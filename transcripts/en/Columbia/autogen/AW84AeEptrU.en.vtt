00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:24.440
interpretation that can occur with
 

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.890
interpretation that can occur with
regard to what is broadcast the images

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:26.900
regard to what is broadcast the images
 

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.020
regard to what is broadcast the images
that we see and so we see two examples

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:29.030
that we see and so we see two examples
 

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.980
that we see and so we see two examples
one in which we indeed indeed respond to

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:32.990
one in which we indeed indeed respond to
 

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.410
one in which we indeed indeed respond to
images of the Asian tsunami and we did

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:35.420
images of the Asian tsunami and we did
 

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.600
images of the Asian tsunami and we did
mobilize resources however there was a

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:37.610
mobilize resources however there was a
 

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.000
mobilize resources however there was a
lot more difficulty doing so when we

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.010
lot more difficulty doing so when we
 

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.700
lot more difficulty doing so when we
have Hurricane Katrina and so part of

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:42.710
have Hurricane Katrina and so part of
 

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.200
have Hurricane Katrina and so part of
what we need to appreciate is that some

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:44.210
what we need to appreciate is that some
 

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.690
what we need to appreciate is that some
of these differences and while the

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:46.700
of these differences and while the
 

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.460
of these differences and while the
extent to which there is a need for a

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:48.470
extent to which there is a need for a
 

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:51.370
extent to which there is a need for a
Global Health Transformation again think

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:51.380
Global Health Transformation again think
 

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.760
Global Health Transformation again think
of those values fair play for example

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:54.770
of those values fair play for example
 

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:57.100
of those values fair play for example
and so we need to value and pursue

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:57.110
and so we need to value and pursue
 

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.400
and so we need to value and pursue
equity in health for all as a global

00:11:59.400 --> 00:11:59.410

again can we act with impartiality can

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:07.820
again can we act with impartiality can
 

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.060
again can we act with impartiality can
we allow a sense of social justice to

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:10.070
we allow a sense of social justice to
 

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:12.670
we allow a sense of social justice to
guide us so what is our work what is our

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:12.680
guide us so what is our work what is our
 

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.820
guide us so what is our work what is our
role what is the role of this conference

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:14.830
role what is the role of this conference
 

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.550
role what is the role of this conference
the idea is that in 2006 if you were

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560
the idea is that in 2006 if you were
 

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.680
the idea is that in 2006 if you were
here you may recall that we declared a

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:20.690
here you may recall that we declared a
 

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.870
here you may recall that we declared a
decade of health disparity reduction and

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880
decade of health disparity reduction and
 

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.480
decade of health disparity reduction and
so we talked about types of evidence how

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:25.490
so we talked about types of evidence how
 

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.180
so we talked about types of evidence how
we need to go beyond the gold standard

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:27.190
we need to go beyond the gold standard
 

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:30.490
we need to go beyond the gold standard
randomized clinical trial and also begin

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:30.500
randomized clinical trial and also begin
 

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.560
randomized clinical trial and also begin
to engage in community collaborations

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:32.570
to engage in community collaborations
 

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.290
to engage in community collaborations
partnerships and of course

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:34.300
partnerships and of course
 

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.540

community-based participatory research

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:36.550
community-based participatory research
 

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:39.580
community-based participatory research
and so today we are going to declare a

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:39.590
and so today we are going to declare a
 

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.680

so what are the forces before I ask you

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:45.950
so what are the forces before I ask you
 

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.100
so what are the forces before I ask you
to join in such a call perhaps you

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:48.110
to join in such a call perhaps you
 

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.320
to join in such a call perhaps you
deserve a rationale and so this is where

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:50.330
deserve a rationale and so this is where
 

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.620
deserve a rationale and so this is where
we can seek yet other evidence and focus

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:53.630
we can seek yet other evidence and focus
 

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.020
we can seek yet other evidence and focus
on the 13 forces that are driving this

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:56.030
on the 13 forces that are driving this
 

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.850
on the 13 forces that are driving this
and we're also going to talk for a

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:57.860
and we're also going to talk for a
 

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.650
and we're also going to talk for a
moment about the mechanism for

moment about the mechanism for
 

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.840
moment about the mechanism for
sustaining this movement and promoting a

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:01.850
sustaining this movement and promoting a
 

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.030
sustaining this movement and promoting a
new field of equity in health and so we

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.040
new field of equity in health and so we
 

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.800

to opportunity and so let's review each

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:24.870
to opportunity and so let's review each
 

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.350
to opportunity and so let's review each
of these spending a little bit more or

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360
of these spending a little bit more or
 

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.900
of these spending a little bit more or
less time on each one but since I'm

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:29.910
less time on each one but since I'm
 

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.670
less time on each one but since I'm
obsessed with the first one it'll have a

major paradigm shift and so you also see

00:14:36.049 --> 00:14:36.059
major paradigm shift and so you also see
 

00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:37.610
major paradigm shift and so you also see
the a over B that is a part of the

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.620
the a over B that is a part of the
 

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.259
the a over B that is a part of the
research group symbol that's on your

research group symbol that's on your
 

00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:41.240
research group symbol that's on your
conference program and so what does that

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:41.250
conference program and so what does that
 

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.879
conference program and so what does that
symbolize it symbolizes the extent to

00:14:43.879 --> 00:14:43.889
symbolize it symbolizes the extent to
 

00:14:43.889 --> 00:14:46.519
symbolize it symbolizes the extent to

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:46.529
which we need to stop that which does

behavior in ways of being associated
 

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:54.350
behavior in ways of being associated
with hierarchical domination and so a

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360

put in the position below and so that is

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:00.420
put in the position below and so that is
 

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.439
put in the position below and so that is
a symbol of many relationships of

a symbol of many relationships of

00:15:13.549 --> 00:15:13.559
the whole dynamic of hierarchical
 

00:15:13.559 --> 00:15:15.619
the whole dynamic of hierarchical
authority and the way in which you can

00:15:15.619 --> 00:15:15.629
authority and the way in which you can
 

00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:17.960
authority and the way in which you can
foster oppression so you know some

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:17.970
foster oppression so you know some
 

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:18.860
foster oppression so you know some

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:23.590
examples

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600
a master be slave a heterosexual be
 

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.630
a master be slave a heterosexual be
sexual diversity and of course the way

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:26.640
sexual diversity and of course the way
 

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.010
sexual diversity and of course the way
of teaching that we're trying to move

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:28.020
of teaching that we're trying to move
 

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.500
of teaching that we're trying to move
away from a teacher lecturing all the

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:30.510
away from a teacher lecturing all the
 

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.200
away from a teacher lecturing all the

recipient of knowledge and so what do we

00:15:35.329 --> 00:15:35.339
recipient of knowledge and so what do we
 

00:15:35.339 --> 00:15:39.170
recipient of knowledge and so what do we
want we want to move to a equals B and

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:39.180
want we want to move to a equals B and
 

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.140
want we want to move to a equals B and
so we need to realize if that is really

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:42.150
so we need to realize if that is really
 

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.820
so we need to realize if that is really
a symbol of higher Matt hierarchical

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:45.830
a symbol of higher Matt hierarchical
 

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.840
a symbol of higher Matt hierarchical
equality that's what we're talking about

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:47.850
equality that's what we're talking about
 

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.150
equality that's what we're talking about
and we get to a equals B so we're trying

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160
and we get to a equals B so we're trying
 

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.519
and we get to a equals B so we're trying
to stop a over B and move to the new

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:52.529
to stop a over B and move to the new
 

00:15:52.529 --> 00:15:55.570
to stop a over B and move to the new
paradigm and so what do we need to do

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:55.580
paradigm and so what do we need to do
 

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.100
paradigm and so what do we need to do
individually we all need a heightened

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:58.110
individually we all need a heightened
 

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:01.400
individually we all need a heightened
state of awareness in other words can we

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:01.410
state of awareness in other words can we
 

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.680

catch ourselves in the act so to speak

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:03.690
catch ourselves in the act so to speak
 

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:06.130
catch ourselves in the act so to speak
to what extent can we engage in cell

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:06.140
to what extent can we engage in cell
 

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.570
to what extent can we engage in cell
observation or is the behaviors would

say self-monitoring can we stop any

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:11.670
say self-monitoring can we stop any
 

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:15.560

behavior and so in this case it would be

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:15.570
behavior and so in this case it would be
 

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:17.510
behavior and so in this case it would be

those ways of thinking behaving being
 

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.570
those ways of thinking behaving being
the road associated with a over B can we

then go on to observe even ourselves or

after we stop can we actually create a

vulnerable population groups and so

00:19:24.419 --> 00:19:24.429
vulnerable population groups and so
 

00:19:24.429 --> 00:19:26.460
vulnerable population groups and so
could we avoid locating such key

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:26.470
could we avoid locating such key
 

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.100
could we avoid locating such key
variables within the individual and so

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:29.110
variables within the individual and so
 

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.169
variables within the individual and so
it's really important that we begin to

00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:31.179
it's really important that we begin to
 

00:19:31.179 --> 00:19:33.600
it's really important that we begin to
focus on the role of the social context

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:33.610
focus on the role of the social context
 

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.120
focus on the role of the social context
so what are those social context factors

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.130
so what are those social context factors
 

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.330
so what are those social context factors
that go along with a over B such as the

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:39.340
that go along with a over B such as the
 

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.310
that go along with a over B such as the

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.760
hierarchical domination the forces of
oppression and of course the goal

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:43.770
oppression and of course the goal
 

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.070

socioeconomic status differences that
 

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.790
socioeconomic status differences that
result and so how can we begin to really

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:49.800
result and so how can we begin to really
 

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.210
result and so how can we begin to really

attempts to coat and adapt in a
stressful social context and then we can

stressful social context and then we can
 

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.580

begin to talk about adaptive versus

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:01.590
begin to talk about adaptive versus
 

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.670
begin to talk about adaptive versus
maladaptive coping we can identify

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:03.680
maladaptive coping we can identify
 

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.350
maladaptive coping we can identify
adaptive ways of coping effectively

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360
adaptive ways of coping effectively
 

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.780
adaptive ways of coping effectively
behaviorally and cognitively and create

interventions and disseminate those kind
of interventions so that others might

of interventions so that others might

of interventions so that others might
replace maladaptive coping with adaptive

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320
replace maladaptive coping with adaptive
 

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.580
replace maladaptive coping with adaptive

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.230
determine their own health their own
health outcomes and ideally are

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240
health outcomes and ideally are
 

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.320
health outcomes and ideally are
empowered so that they can sustain that

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:45.330
empowered so that they can sustain that
 

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.570
empowered so that they can sustain that
which will help them to self-determine

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:47.580
which will help them to self-determine
 

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.730
which will help them to self-determine
their health and so it's evidence of

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:49.740
their health and so it's evidence of
 

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.230
their health and so it's evidence of
this drive we can turn to the work of

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240
this drive we can turn to the work of
 

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.320
this drive we can turn to the work of
brave man again who talks about how the

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:54.330
brave man again who talks about how the
 

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.030
brave man again who talks about how the
foundations for addressing health

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:56.040
foundations for addressing health
 

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.640
foundations for addressing health
disparities and pursuing health equity

00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:58.650
disparities and pursuing health equity
 

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:02.419
disparities and pursuing health equity
come not only from an ethics but also

00:31:02.419 --> 00:31:02.429
come not only from an ethics but also
 

00:31:02.429 --> 00:31:04.130
come not only from an ethics but also
from the field of international human

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:04.140
from the field of international human
 

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.590
from the field of international human
rights and so we're talking about those

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600
rights and so we're talking about those
 

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.080
rights and so we're talking about those
rights are in Taliban's entitlements

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:09.090
rights are in Taliban's entitlements
 

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:10.700
rights are in Taliban's entitlements
that all people in the world have

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:10.710
that all people in the world have
 

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.160
that all people in the world have
regardless of who they are or where they

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:13.170
regardless of who they are or where they
 

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.230
regardless of who they are or where they
live so the right to health is becoming

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240
live so the right to health is becoming
 

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.560
live so the right to health is becoming
a global fundamental concept the dry for

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:18.570
a global fundamental concept the dry for
 

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:20.330
a global fundamental concept the dry for
social justice and acknowledgement of

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:20.340
social justice and acknowledgement of
 

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.240
social justice and acknowledgement of
forces in the social context and so here

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:23.250
forces in the social context and so here
 

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:26.570
forces in the social context and so here
again we see talked about the right to

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.580
again we see talked about the right to
 

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.210
again we see talked about the right to
health and also social justice that

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.220
health and also social justice that
 

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.620
health and also social justice that
these are going to go hand in hand

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:30.630
these are going to go hand in hand
 

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.950
these are going to go hand in hand
whenever we talk about equity and that

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960
whenever we talk about equity and that
 

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.930
whenever we talk about equity and that
is crucial to pay attention to the

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:35.940
is crucial to pay attention to the
 

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.930
is crucial to pay attention to the
social context the social justice piece

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:38.940
social context the social justice piece
 

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.690
social context the social justice piece
goes hand-in-hand with training because

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:41.700
goes hand-in-hand with training because
 

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.480
goes hand-in-hand with training because
we need to inculcate in professional and

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:44.490
we need to inculcate in professional and
 

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.150
we need to inculcate in professional and
personal identities assess that one is

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:47.160
personal identities assess that one is
 

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.669
personal identities assess that one is
not only a health educator what is not

00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679
not only a health educator what is not
 

00:31:49.679 --> 00:31:51.980
not only a health educator what is not
only a psychologist or a nurse or a

only a psychologist or a nurse or a
 

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.980
only a psychologist or a nurse or a

teacher but that an additional dimension
 

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:57.260
teacher but that an additional dimension
of your identity as a professional and

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:57.270
of your identity as a professional and
 

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:59.450
of your identity as a professional and
as a community members should be a

as a community members should be a
willingness to take social action for

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:02.550
willingness to take social action for
 

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:04.970
willingness to take social action for
social justice and then we also have the

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:04.980
social justice and then we also have the
 

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:07.160
social justice and then we also have the
work of others dietrichson it out the

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:07.170
work of others dietrichson it out the
 

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:08.990
work of others dietrichson it out the
ideas that we now talk about the social

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000
ideas that we now talk about the social
 

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.090
ideas that we now talk about the social
context there are certain kinds of

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.100
context there are certain kinds of
 

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.360
context there are certain kinds of
social context factors those involving

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:14.370
social context factors those involving
 

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.060
social context factors those involving
social stratification those that involve

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:17.070
social stratification those that involve
 

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:19.040
social stratification those that involve
differential exposure to help damaging

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:19.050
differential exposure to help damaging
 

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:22.270
differential exposure to help damaging
factories where do we put our

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:22.280
factories where do we put our
 

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.440
factories where do we put our
incinerators for example in what kind of

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:24.450
incinerators for example in what kind of
 

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:27.320
incinerators for example in what kind of
communities what about differential

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:27.330
communities what about differential
 

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:30.169
communities what about differential
exposure where do the diesel trucks go

00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:30.179
exposure where do the diesel trucks go
 

00:32:30.179 --> 00:32:30.950
exposure where do the diesel trucks go
how is it

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960
how is it
 

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.870
how is it
we have such high rates of asthma what

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880
we have such high rates of asthma what
 

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.909
we have such high rates of asthma what
environmental factors might be involved

00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919
environmental factors might be involved
 

00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:37.299
environmental factors might be involved
so there can be differential

00:32:37.299 --> 00:32:37.309
so there can be differential
 

00:32:37.309 --> 00:32:39.769
so there can be differential
vulnerabilities this acceptability that

00:32:39.769 --> 00:32:39.779
vulnerabilities this acceptability that
 

00:32:39.779 --> 00:32:41.149
vulnerabilities this acceptability that
can also follow from differential

00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159
can also follow from differential
 

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:43.639
can also follow from differential
exposure and again the result could be

00:32:43.639 --> 00:32:43.649
exposure and again the result could be
 

00:32:43.649 --> 00:32:46.669
exposure and again the result could be
unequal health outcomes and differential

00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679
unequal health outcomes and differential
 

00:32:46.679 --> 00:32:50.720
unequal health outcomes and differential
consequences of illness the drive to

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:50.730
consequences of illness the drive to
 

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:52.269
consequences of illness the drive to
protect and support the most vulnerable

00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279
protect and support the most vulnerable
 

00:32:52.279 --> 00:32:54.860
protect and support the most vulnerable
again we would have to have that

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:54.870
again we would have to have that
 

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.659
again we would have to have that
consciousness that what affects one

00:32:56.659 --> 00:32:56.669
consciousness that what affects one
 

00:32:56.669 --> 00:32:58.850
consciousness that what affects one
affects all it would have to have that

00:32:58.850 --> 00:32:58.860
affects all it would have to have that
 

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.330
affects all it would have to have that
consciousness about our fundamental

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:01.340
consciousness about our fundamental
 

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.990
consciousness about our fundamental
interdependence we would have to

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000
interdependence we would have to
 

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.330
interdependence we would have to
therefore with such a consciousness

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:08.340
therefore with such a consciousness
 

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.490
therefore with such a consciousness
focus on those who are the most

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500
focus on those who are the most
 

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:11.870
focus on those who are the most
vulnerable and they tended me

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880
vulnerable and they tended me
 

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.810
vulnerable and they tended me
populations or groups defined by racial

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:14.820
populations or groups defined by racial
 

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.269
populations or groups defined by racial
or ethnic status or socio-economic

00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:23.520
orientation or other perceive population
 

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.730
orientation or other perceive population
of group characteristics and we're also

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:25.740
of group characteristics and we're also
 

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.590
of group characteristics and we're also
talking about all of those groups that

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600
talking about all of those groups that
 

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.769
talking about all of those groups that
tend to be negatively stereotyped and

00:33:29.769 --> 00:33:29.779
tend to be negatively stereotyped and
 

00:33:29.779 --> 00:33:32.149
tend to be negatively stereotyped and
stigmatized as what was targets of hate

00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159
stigmatized as what was targets of hate
 

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:34.580
stigmatized as what was targets of hate
and violence so there is diversity and

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:34.590
and violence so there is diversity and
 

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:36.919
and violence so there is diversity and
the kind of projects that for example

00:33:36.919 --> 00:33:36.929
the kind of projects that for example
 

00:33:36.929 --> 00:33:39.200
the kind of projects that for example
the students in the department of health

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:39.210
the students in the department of health
 

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:41.210
the students in the department of health
behavior studies are those associated

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:41.220
behavior studies are those associated
 

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:43.159
behavior studies are those associated
with the research group on disparities

00:33:43.159 --> 00:33:43.169
with the research group on disparities
 

00:33:43.169 --> 00:33:46.610
with the research group on disparities
in health can focus on okay in other

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:46.620
in health can focus on okay in other
 

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.860
in health can focus on okay in other
words there can be virtually any group

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:48.870
words there can be virtually any group
 

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:53.120
words there can be virtually any group
of justifiably serving as a focus given

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:53.130
of justifiably serving as a focus given
 

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:54.799
of justifiably serving as a focus given
how they may be targets of hate and

00:33:54.799 --> 00:33:54.809
how they may be targets of hate and
 

00:33:54.809 --> 00:33:57.200
how they may be targets of hate and
violence and so here the United States

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:57.210
violence and so here the United States
 

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:58.820
violence and so here the United States
we would say that among our most

00:33:58.820 --> 00:33:58.830
we would say that among our most
 

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:00.320
we would say that among our most
vulnerable particularly in recent

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:00.330
vulnerable particularly in recent
 

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.480
vulnerable particularly in recent
decades would be the incarcerated black

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:02.490
decades would be the incarcerated black
 

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:04.639
decades would be the incarcerated black
males in particular but we also have

00:34:04.639 --> 00:34:04.649
males in particular but we also have
 

00:34:04.649 --> 00:34:06.889
males in particular but we also have
global policies that create new

00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:06.899
global policies that create new
 

00:34:06.899 --> 00:34:09.800
global policies that create new
vulnerable groups and so these policies

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:09.810
vulnerable groups and so these policies
 

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.560
vulnerable groups and so these policies
involve more violence global warming

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:12.570
involve more violence global warming
 

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:14.750
involve more violence global warming
government corruption lack of access to

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760
government corruption lack of access to
 

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.250
government corruption lack of access to
essential public health or medical

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:16.260
essential public health or medical
 

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.010
essential public health or medical
services and of course the emotion of

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.020
services and of course the emotion of
 

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.070

civil liberties and freedoms that occurs

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:21.080
civil liberties and freedoms that occurs
 

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.659
civil liberties and freedoms that occurs
and so there are many kinds of social

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:23.669
and so there are many kinds of social
 

00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:27.790
and so there are many kinds of social
conditions that can end up creating new

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800
conditions that can end up creating new
 

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.159
conditions that can end up creating new
vulnerable a shin so under principle 11

vulnerable a shin so under principle 11
 

00:34:31.169 --> 00:34:33.079
vulnerable a shin so under principle 11

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.190
put out the call that we did for a
decade of evidence-based research to

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:26.200
decade of evidence-based research to
 

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.830

the idea that um those who have less

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:50.020
the idea that um those who have less
 

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.800
the idea that um those who have less
income certainly tend to be more

cahuachi it out talk about is how race

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:01.120
cahuachi it out talk about is how race
 

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:01.710
cahuachi it out talk about is how race
has been

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:01.720

use to really divide us and that what's

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:04.330
use to really divide us and that what's
 

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:08.310
use to really divide us and that what's
really needed is a class consciousness

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320
really needed is a class consciousness
 

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.530
really needed is a class consciousness
and if we have this kind of class

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:10.540
and if we have this kind of class
 

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.050
and if we have this kind of class
consciousness the idea is that we might

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:13.060
consciousness the idea is that we might
 

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.390
consciousness the idea is that we might
have social solidarity if you see in

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400
have social solidarity if you see in
 

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.210
have social solidarity if you see in
that third bullet there and the bottom

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:18.220
that third bullet there and the bottom
 

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:21.359
that third bullet there and the bottom
line is that if we can achieve that

00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:21.369
line is that if we can achieve that
 

00:39:21.369 --> 00:39:24.320
line is that if we can achieve that
social solidarity then we might

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:24.330
social solidarity then we might
 

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:27.690
social solidarity then we might
understand why so much research that

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:27.700
understand why so much research that
 

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.609
understand why so much research that
concludes that we needed redistribute

00:39:29.609 --> 00:39:29.619
concludes that we needed redistribute
 

00:39:29.619 --> 00:39:33.060
concludes that we needed redistribute
income and also ensure equal access to

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:33.070
income and also ensure equal access to
 

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:35.250
income and also ensure equal access to
educational and employment opportunity

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:35.260
educational and employment opportunity
 

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.589
educational and employment opportunity
that it needs to come about through

00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599
that it needs to come about through
 

00:39:37.599 --> 00:39:39.960
that it needs to come about through
something such as a movement that cuts

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:39.970
something such as a movement that cuts
 

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:43.800
something such as a movement that cuts
across race lines and that allows us to

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:43.810
across race lines and that allows us to
 

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:46.230
across race lines and that allows us to
experience a very broad type of

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240
experience a very broad type of
 

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.589
experience a very broad type of
solidarity across all lines and so the

00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599
solidarity across all lines and so the
 

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:52.830
solidarity across all lines and so the
idea is that if we r divided we can fail

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:52.840
idea is that if we r divided we can fail
 

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.230
idea is that if we r divided we can fail
to see our common interests instead

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.240

to see our common interests instead
there are values then brave and identify

such as distributive justice

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480
such as distributive justice
 

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.910

distributive justice as the equitable
 

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.089
distributive justice as the equitable
allocation of resources in a society and

allocation of resources in a society and
 

00:40:06.099 --> 00:40:08.310
allocation of resources in a society and
so there is a drive to redistribute

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:08.320
so there is a drive to redistribute
 

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.490
so there is a drive to redistribute
wealth and access to opportunity so as

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:11.500
wealth and access to opportunity so as
 

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.800
