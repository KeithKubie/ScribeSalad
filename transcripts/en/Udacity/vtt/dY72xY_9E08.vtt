00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.660
So the answer is the third one, because the third one shows

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.660
a phenotype where the bone growth is shortened or truncated compared to the

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.900
other three. So although there are

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.200
multiple sequence variations at this given position,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.780
only one of them is an allele that results in shortened bone growth.
