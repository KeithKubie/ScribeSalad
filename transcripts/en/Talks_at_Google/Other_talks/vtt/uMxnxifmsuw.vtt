00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.040
&gt;&gt;COMMENTATOR: Well, good afternoon, everyone.
Welcome to another outstanding Authors@Google

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.040
talk.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.200
And today we are thrilled to host Jeff Ma.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.090
And Jeff is one of the legendary members of
the MIT Blackjack Team, which is a group of

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.789
students and affiliates whose study of statistics
became legend. And is the subject of movies

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.800
such as "21" and the book "Bringing Down the
House".

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.830
Success in gambling is very similar to success
in life and in business. It's all about making

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.970
the right decisions with the right amount
of luck.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.750
And so, it's no question that the-that the
years that Jeff spent honing his blackjack

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.591
skills at MIT have given him a basic strategy
for success in the-the VC world here in the

00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:45.591
Silicon Valley.

00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:49.980
So he'll be talking to us today about his
most recent book which is entitled "The House

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.870
Advantage: Playing the Odds to Win Big in
Business".

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.940
We'll have some mikes at the end for questions
and answers.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.760
And without further ado, please join me in
welcoming Jeff to Google.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.760
Thank you.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.799
&gt;&gt;JEFF: So thanks for having me, guys. How
many of you guys have seen 21?

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.710
Pretty good amount of people. So you know
that the greatest bit of Hollywood magic is

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.159
how they turn an average looking Asian-American
male into a dashing, British white guy.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.159
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.159
Which is what they did.

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.170
So I was the main-the inspiration for the
real-life character that Jim Sturgis played

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.929
in the movie "21" and the character, Kevin
Lewis, in the book, "Bringing Down the House".

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:36.139
And, I always like to tell a couple of stories
when I get started about my days card counting

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:38.619
that weren't in the book and aren't in either
of my books.

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.710
So, "Bringing Down the House" was the first
book, and "The House Advantage" which is over

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.630
there is my new book.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.460
But I like to tell these stories about playing
blackjack with celebrities, which was a lot

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.590
of fun. I have some good stories with all
these guys.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.880
And my first story actually comes from the
opening night of the Bellagio. I had the pleasure

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.180
of playing blackjack with Kevin Costner. And
Kevin was there with his group of friends.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.820
Now what's kind of interesting about the opening
of any casino- there's always three types

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.820
of people there.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.700
There's card counters like myself; ‘cause
for us that was like our emerging markets.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.599
You know like this is like this new casino
opening up. They're much more worried about

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.040
paying people correctly than they are about
catching card counters.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.819
And the second type of people are celebrities.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.541
And anyone guess the third type of person?
Card Counters, Celebrities are at a casino...

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:29.270
What's that? Just yell it out loud.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.811
&gt;&gt;VOICE: Gold diggers

00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:32.140
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Gold diggers. Cougars. Close!

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.140
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.550
You can tell a lot about an audience by how
quickly they get this. I was in a real estate

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.720
conference in, in Orange County. And I asked
this question. And not sooner were the words

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.319
out of my mouth than a woman from the back
row screams, "HOOKERS!"

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.319
So it's card counters, celebrities, and prostitutes.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.620
And what's funny is when you do this corporate
event type stuff, whenever, the person who

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.189
gets it yells it out, I always make them stand
up and then that's what's called, "a career-limiting

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:57.189
maneuver."

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.189
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.140
So, but, anyway, so I'm at the Bellagio opening
night and have the pleasure of playing blackjack

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.500
with Kevin Costner. And he has his group of
friends with him. And it's Kevin Costner,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.841
so, if it were a rapper it would've been like
his posse; but, since it's Kevin, it's just

00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:12.750
his group of goofy friends.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.090
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.019
And...every hand, he was a good player, meaning
he did the right thing most of the time. And

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.610
then he started to lose, and every hand he
lost his friends would look at me and say,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.870
"God, this is like "Water World" all over
again.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.610
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.980
Sooo.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.360
[pause]

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.099
Actually, I'll tell one other story just be-just
because it's a good story and because you

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.599
guys are here for entertainment. And if you
want the real, hard-business takeaway, you

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.150
can get the book but it’s not really, it's
very enter-it's a very entertaining book,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.469
I think too.

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:47.200
One of the funnier stories also has to come-comes
from the NBA lockout. So we may be headed

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.299
for another NBA lockout in a couple years
but the last NBA lockout was about ten years

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.800
ago. And where do you think NBA players went
when they couldn't- they went to casinos.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.111
And so I had the pleasure of playing blackjack
with a bunch of the Ni-the Knicks, John Starks,

00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:07.379
Patrick Ewing. So I sit down at a table with
John Starks and John is-goes nice guy drinking

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.180
Merlot. Which I thought was really weird for,
we're, we're all from the Bay Area so we drink

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.060
wine, we love wine. But for a NBA, big, burly
NBA player at the casino drinking wine, it

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.680
just seemed like a little weird to me.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.520
Actually, it's not that weird 'cause now I
kinda have this whole new impression of what

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.560
NBA players drink.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.020
I was in Vegas about two years ago playing
blackja-playing craps,'cause I'm not allowed

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.560
to play blackjack anymore. And Jalen Rose,
who played in the NBA for about 56 different

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.550
teams, comes up to me and we start talking.
And it turns out the two of us had a lot of

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.090
common friends 'cause he was trying to get
into sports media and I was in sports media

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.199
at the time.

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.919
And he finally says to me, "Jeff, let's grab
a drink together."

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.430
And I said, "Ok, Jalen, what do you want to
drink?"

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.610
And he says, "Whatever you want to drink."

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.650
And so I have one, being a data driven guy,
I have one data point. And that is that John

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.460
Starks drinks Merlot. So I'm like I wonder
what NBA players drink.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.520
He goes, "Like whatever you want to drink
just order it."

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.500
So now I have rap videos, visions of rap videos
going through my head and I turn to the waitress

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.810
and I say, "Give us two glasses of Courvoisier."
I didn't even know what Courvoisier is.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.410
So the waitress starts to walk away and Jalen
Rose, who has like nine-foot long arms grabs

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.020
her and goes, "[WHISPERING VOICE] Excuse me
ma’am. Could you make mine an apple martini?"

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.020
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.030
So, he's like 6'9" ordering an apple martini.
So now I think any of you guys that are like

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.050
closet apple martini fans you can actually
drink apple martini and be ok with it now;

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.160
you can say, "Jalen Rose does it. So it's
cool."

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.410
So anyway, so back to John Starks. John Starks
is-goes through this kind of transformation

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.500
that I'm sure many of you guys have seen your
friends go through at a casino. Where they

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.782
start as this normal, intelligent human being
and then all of a sudden after five or six

00:05:41.782 --> 00:05:45.979
hours become this drunk, degenerate gambler.
And that’s what happened to poor John.

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.620
So John takes his last $500 chip out, puts
it down on the betting circle and the dealer

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.460
deals him an eleven. And the dealer has a
six up. So all you guys that play blackjack,

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.460
what do you do there?

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.801
&gt;&gt;MALE VOICE: You double down.

00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:01.569
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Double down, right! Which means he
needs to put another $500 chip down but, unfortunately,

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:06.479
poor John doesn't have one. So I flip him
a $500 chip from my stack and I say, "Pay

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.039
me back when you win."

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:11.330
The dealer gives him a five to make 16 and
John looks at me and he goes, "Man, you just

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.330
jinxed me!"

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.740
I said, "It's ok, John, ‘cause I'm counting
cards so I know that there's still a pretty

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.949
good chance that the dealer's gonna bust.
I think you'll still win."

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:25.100
The dealer gives him-the dealer flips a 10
to make 16 and then gets another 10 to make

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.970
26. Bust. There's much rejoicing.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.770
John pushes me back my $500 chip. Not a word
of thank you. And at that moment, I decided

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.129
that I would never have John Starks on my
fantasy basketball team.

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:36.200
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.319
I really showed him.

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:43.069
So, I'd like to talk about and this is from
the first chapter of my-of my new book.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:47.780
The most important lesson I ever have learned
at the blackjack table. And it comes from

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.120
Caesars Palace. I was 22 years old.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.220
I walk up to the table and I'm using math.
Again, to basically-I'll explain this all

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.550
later and and most of you guys probably understand
the concept. But I'm using math to beat the

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:03.060
casino, so every decision I make is governed
by math. It's completely 100% objective.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.870
So I walk up and I bet two hands of $10,000
and the first hand I get an 11. On the second

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:14.250
hand, I get a pair of nines. And the dealer
has a six up. So what do we do when an 11

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:15.250
gets a six? We...

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.711
&gt;&gt;VOICES FROM AUDIENCE: Double down.

00:07:16.711 --> 00:07:17.711
&gt;&gt;JEFF: ...We double down, again.

00:07:17.711 --> 00:07:22.289
So I put another $10,000 down and I get a
seven on that to make eighteen.

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:27.371
Then I split the nines, ok, and I lay two
on the first one.

00:07:27.371 --> 00:07:28.810
&gt;&gt;VOICES FROM AUDIENCE: Double down.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:37.389
&gt;&gt;JEFF: So I've got to double again. Put another
$10,000 down, and I do. And then, on the last

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:41.979
nine, and I get, I think, a eight on that
to make 19 and on the last nine I get a ten

00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:43.409
to make 19.

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:44.600
So how much money do I have on the table?

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.080
&gt;&gt;VOICE: 50

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.800
&gt;&gt;JEFF: $50,000. The dealer flips a-has a
six, flips a five to make eleven. And then

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.111
gets a-a-a-a-a ten to make 21.

00:07:55.111 --> 00:07:56.419
[AUDIENCE MOANS]

00:07:56.419 --> 00:08:01.300
And I lose $50,000. And this woman behind
me shrieks, "Oh, my God! That's my entire

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.614
mortgage!" And I want to turn around and go.
"Where the hell do you live?"

00:08:04.614 --> 00:08:05.614
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:08:05.614 --> 00:08:11.680
'Cause we don't live in a place where there’s
$50,000 mortgages, unless you're in a cardboard

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.849
box in the Tenderloin.

00:08:12.849 --> 00:08:13.849
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:20.620
But again, very focused on the math, very
focused on objective data to make decisions,

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:26.300
so now the objective data tells me to bet
three hands of $10,000. So I do.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.530
And I get a nine on the first hand, a 19 on
the second and an ace four on the third hand.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:31.530
And the dealer has a five up.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:42.579
Ok, now, again, basic strategy. As Cliff mentioned
is this role well played out, well simulated

00:08:42.579 --> 00:08:47.210
matrix of decisions that tells you what to
do in every situation. And there's no-there's

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.769
no obje-there’s no subjectivity in playing
blackjack.

00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:53.060
It's really funny because I'll stand behind
my friends now, 'cause I'm not allowed to

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.210
play blackjack. And they're all pretty smart
friends and we'll be sitting there havin'

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.400
a beer and I'll be like the old guys from
the Muppets just making fun of ‘em when

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.400
they play blackjack.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.860
But they'll turn around and they'll ask me.
They'll be like, “Hey, I've got this hand-I've

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.089
got this against this, and the dealer has
that-What should I do?”

00:09:06.089 --> 00:09:07.089
And I'll tell them.

00:09:07.089 --> 00:09:10.579
And they'll go, “Eh, well." And they'll
go and do their own thing. And they'll lose.

00:09:10.579 --> 00:09:13.610
Right and then I'll look at them and go, "Why
do you bother asking me for advice if you’re

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:14.610
not gonna listen?"

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:20.020
So nine against a five, right, you double.
All right. So I put another $10,000 down.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.839
An ace four against a five is another doubling
hand so I have to put another $10,000 down.

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:24.839
I do.

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:30.310
I get a four on that to make 19 and the dealer
has a five up. So here I am with my chance

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:39.240
to win back that $50,000 or to lose two of
the woman behind me houses. So again, one

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:44.810
of those moments where you kind of say, “How
in the world did I get here?" Well, I was.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.180
If this advances, I can tell you what I was.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:53.810
I was - graduated from MIT in 1994 with a
Mechanical Engineering major, which I've used

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.880
nothing of in my life.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.720
And then did this like incredible rebellion
against the world of engineering. And instead

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.920
of going to medical school, went into the
world of finance.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.240
In the interim, this whole internet thing
started. And these days people don't depict

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.460
the internet this way, but it used to be depicted
always as this big cloud, and that's what

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.019
the internet looks like in case you're wondering.

00:10:14.019 --> 00:10:19.120
And then I went on to start three companies
the last of which was called Citizen Sports.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.700
And just sold that to Yahoo actually three-three
months ago.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:27.600
And decided I didn't want to work there as
part of the deal so I am now just out promoting

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.600
my book.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:34.810
But during that whole time, I was a professional
card counter and I played blackjack for a

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:35.810
living.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.410
And I like to actually make this reference
to the guy who invented the internet which

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.450
is important that we all refer to him; 'cause
now we can say that Al Gore has invented two

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.420
things-one good, one bad. He invented the
internet which is good-none of us would have

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.520
jobs if he hadn't done that. And then he invented
global warming-which has been bad for us.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.970
So-[Pause] [MUMBLING in AUDIENCE]

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.870
Come on that's funny. No one ever laughs at
that joke anymore. Maybe that joke is too

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.930
far for people now. They don't remember that-anyways.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:04.340
So what is a professional blackjack player?

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.370
This first thing that people say is, "Isn't
that illegal?"

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.550
And it's actually been tried and I have a
whole passage in the book.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:14.050
'Cause people always wonder why it isn't illegal
or why- It’s just using your brain to beat

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:15.050
a game.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.050
It's like- What´s your name?

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.050
&gt;&gt;MALE VOICE: Mike.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:21.700
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Mike. Say Mike and I are playing Monopoly
together all the time. And I always buy Boardwalk

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:26.100
and Park Place. And he buys the crappy utilities.
And one day he just throws the board up in

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.850
the air and says, "This should be illegal!"

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:31.000
It's just using your brain to beat a game
to be better than someone at a game.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.180
So Mike, just get better at Monopoly and stop
complaining.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:40.709
So the second thing that people always say
is, "Are you banned from Vegas?"

00:11:40.709 --> 00:11:43.550
And believe it or not there is not someone
who waits for me at the jet way of McCarran

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:47.320
Airport when I get off and says, “Excuse
me, Mr. Ma, you have to turn around and go

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.320
home.”

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.320
I'm just not allowed to play blackjack.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:54.000
Actually, a pretty funny story from the filming
of the movie. Now, you guys that have seen

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.820
the movie know I'm in the movie, right. Nod.
Pretend you remember. Otherwise it's really

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.970
sad for me. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] Yes.

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:08.130
Ok, so this is always very sad for me. Because
people never remember. I am a dealer in the

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:12.600
movie, named Jeffery. The person who plays
me walks up to me and says Jeffery my brother

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:18.850
from another- I have a couple of witty lines
a sad card, nominated for a new academy award.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.829
Best actor in a movie that's about themselves,
that's in the movie for less than five minutes.

00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:23.829
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:28.190
But that scene which is literally about five
minutes long, I-I was out there filming for

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.170
three days. And it's not ‘cause I was messing
up my lines. It's because you talk about an

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.120
inefficient industry-movie making is completely
inefficient.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:40.510
So I'm out there filming my scene and one
day the cast turns to me and they go, "Hey,

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:45.070
Jeff, I think it'd be really fun if we all
go to dinner tonight."

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:49.550
So we go and we head to dinner. On the way
over to dinner, Kate Bosworth pulls me aside.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:53.620
And if any of you guys know what Kate Bosworth
looks like, when she pulls you aside, you’re

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.510
like, “Kate, yes, what would you want? What
can I do for you?"

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.881
So Kate says to me, she says, "You know what
I think would be really fun?"

00:12:58.881 --> 00:13:00.029
And I said, "What?"

00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:04.180
And she said, "After dinner let's all go play
blackjack."

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:09.820
And I said, "Kate, I don't think this is gonna
happen. They know who I am. They're not gonna

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.820
let me play blackjack.”

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.940
She said, "It's ok. You'll be with me. I'm
a big star. They won't bother you."

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.600
And I'm like, "Kate, it's been a long time
since "Blue Crush". I don't know what a big

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.600
star you are anymore."

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.600
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS AND GROANS]

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.290
But what seemed like this horrible idea, after
about four or five bottles of wine later,

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:29.480
seemed like this great idea. And after dinner,
we're rolling up stairs to the casino at the

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.630
top of the Palms, the Playboy Casino.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.500
And I set down at the table and the floor
person looks at me, he goes, "Jeff, what are

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.500
you doing?"

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.660
I said, "I'm here. I'm playing blackjack with
Kate Bosworth of "Blue Crush". Big star, no

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:39.940
big deal, right."

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.470
And he said, "Let me check."

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.820
And he calls upstairs, and comes back to the
table and he goes, "Not only are you not allowed

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.240
to play, but if your little friend, Kate's,
at the table you're not allowed to be within

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.389
20 feet of the table."

00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:55.829
And so this was cool because it made Kate
think I was like this-you know- she thought

00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:59.720
I was so cool after that. And so she went
and told everyone on set the next day how

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:05.160
cool I was. And if any of you guys watch "Seinfeld",
it's like when George tries to be a bootlegger

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.820
and like he's this really bad dude.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.000
Anyways, sorry, sorry for the non sequitur,
but the whole point is I'm not banned from

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.449
Vegas; they just don't let me play blackjack.

00:14:12.449 --> 00:14:16.199
And then the final thing is they say, "Remind
me never to play poker with you."

00:14:16.199 --> 00:14:21.199
And this is interesting because it actually
is a real-it really kind of is a lead in to

00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:24.810
why I wrote "The House Advantage", my new
book.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:33.079
Because blackjack is this perfect petri dish
for using analytics. Imagine that you could

00:14:33.079 --> 00:14:37.290
model situations and always know how the person
you were modeling or playing against was gonna

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:38.980
act. You always knew perfectly.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.990
In poker, you don't, right. In poker, you
can make absolutely the right call all the

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:50.280
time and then some idiot decides to go all
in on a pair of twos. And you just -- a two

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.509
pops up and they get lucky and you lose.

00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:57.370
And the same thing's true of the market, right.
You know people think that it's smart to keep

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:03.230
lending a million dollar mortgage to farm
workers who make $12,000 a year and think

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.690
that's a good investment decision from a mortgage
standpoint.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:11.290
I mean people act irrational, and blackjack
is not that way, because you only play against

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.910
the dealer and you know at all times how the
dealer's going to act so you can model the

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.310
situan per-situation perfectly.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:21.100
So what makes blackjack beatable? Well, blackjack
is the only game in the casino that's subject

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.009
to something called "conditional probability."

00:15:23.009 --> 00:15:25.440
If you contrast blackjack to roulette-

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.980
And one of my favorite stories from roulette
and it's in "The House Advantage".

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:34.420
Is this time that I went to Vegas with my
friend, Brian, and this is after the whole

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:41.130
blackjack thing was done for me. And I walked
up to the blackjack table and Brian actually

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:45.209
asked me to sorta coach him to play blackjack.
So I was kinda sitting next to him, just tellin'

00:15:45.209 --> 00:15:48.529
him what to do. And over about two hours we
won a couple thousand dollars.

00:15:48.529 --> 00:15:52.819
So it's Friday night in Vegas, and I'm like,
“Let's go spend the money somewhere.”

00:15:52.819 --> 00:15:57.710
So we get up and we start walking over to
go cash out the chips and all of a sudden

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.230
Brian disappears. And I'm like, “Where did
Brian go?"

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.209
And all of a sudden I hear, "$1000 on black."

00:16:02.209 --> 00:16:08.430
I look up. There's Brian. I walk over to the
roulette table and Brian's setting there and

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:12.800
before I can say anything the roulette wheel
spends and it's, "14 red."

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.940
Brian loses $1000.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:20.610
I go to grab Brian and I'm pretty happy that
he's only lost a $1000 and he's still up a

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:25.630
$1000. And I can explain to him that roulette
is the most horrible game you can play in

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.519
the casino.

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:32.800
And he looks at me and before I can grab him,
I hear him say, "$1000 on black."

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.750
And I say, "Brian, what are you doing?"

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.930
He says, "Don't you see what is happening
here?"

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:38.930
And I said, "No."

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:43.550
And he points up to this magical sign above
the roulette wheel. And this magical sign

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:49.709
has the result of the last 20 spins. And the
last seven now have been red. So in Brian’s

00:16:49.709 --> 00:16:52.639
mind, black is a sure thing.

00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:54.130
And I say, "Brian, that's not true."

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:58.310
And he goes, "Listen. I know you know blackjack
and statistics. But this is roulette. And

00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:59.769
this is gambling, and I know gambling."

00:16:59.769 --> 00:17:00.930
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:06.140
Well, we all know that-the flaw in his logic,
right. Every spin of that roulette wheel is

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:10.150
independent. And I walked away. And the whole
"fool and his money are soon parted." Well,

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:17.390
he was the fool and his money parted. And
an improbable three more reds in a row, Brian

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:22.720
was out $4000 now and down $2000 for the night
and we no longer had any money to spend at

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.580
the club. But no worries. Anyways.

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:28.890
So the point is that roulette every spin is
independent and the same thing is true of

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.230
craps. Right, every roll of the dice is independent.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:36.190
But, in blackjack, if I take all four aces
out of a deck of cards, hand you that deck

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.940
of cards, what do you think the chances of
you dealing yourself blackjack are?

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:39.940
Mike, what do you think the chances are?

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.180
&gt;&gt;Mike: Don't know.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.480
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Zero, Right. There's no more aces
left. Good luck dealing yourself blackjack

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:50.340
with no aces in the deck, right. So blackjack
is the only game where what you see impacts

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.340
what you're going to see.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:57.810
There is a professor, by the name of Ed Thorpe,
and he wrote a book called, Beat the Dealer.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:05.130
But, in the-in the early days, ok, and this
is in the 1960's, Ed Thorp was a grad student

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:13.550
at UCLA. And he, -- his wife wanted to go
on a vacation. So he had this idea of going

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:19.320
on a vacation with his wife to Vegas. And
the thing with really smart odds people is

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.060
they don't want to gamble because they know
the odds are always against them.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.730
So Ed Thorpe did not want to gamble in Vegas.
He just wanted to take advantage of the buffets

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:33.620
and the pool and the shows. And so he's like
thinking about heading to Vegas and not gambling.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:38.060
And then all of a sudden, before he goes,
this guy hands him a research paper that had

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:42.080
just been done by these army technicians where
they used hand-held calculators. 'Cause remember

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:46.370
this is in the 1960's. It's not like people
are floating around with laptops back then.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:51.160
And this-this-this-this thing basically told
him -- this paper told him that there was

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.450
an optimal strategy for blackjack, which is
this basic strategy thing that I've already

00:18:54.450 --> 00:19:00.250
alluded to. And what it said was that if you
did this correctly, your odds against the

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:01.250
casino were about even.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.780
So he took this little piece of paper and
he walked into the casino and he sat down

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:05.780
at the table.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.720
And this is a guy, Ed Thorp, that wrote "Beat
the Dealer". He then wrote a book called "Beat

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.460
the Market". He started the first quantitative
hedge fund. Has made hundreds of millions

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:15.840
of dollars but he tells this story to me like
it's his proudest moment.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.351
He goes, "Jeff, I started with $10 at that
table and you know how much I walked away

00:19:20.351 --> 00:19:21.351
with?"

00:19:21.351 --> 00:19:23.670
And I'm like, "I don't know. Like 100,000;
10,000?"

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:25.070
And he's like, "$1.50."

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.620
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.300
And I'm like, "Really."

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:32.570
But he's like, "But I outlasted everyone at
that table and they all thought I was crazy."

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:36.800
So, this was the moment that he realized that
blackjack might indeed be beatable.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:41.280
And so what he did is he took this knowledge
with him to MIT and he applied it. And he

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.550
had one of the first computers ever, an IBM
704 computer, and actually did simulations

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:50.410
on blackjack where he simulated a deck of
cards with no twos in it, with no threes,

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:51.410
with no fours.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:57.030
And what he found is that the high cards-
10's, face cards and aces- are valuable for

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:00.260
the player. Meaning, when there's a lot of
those left, it's good for the player.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:05.590
The low cards- two, three, four, fives, and
six-are bad for the player. So when those

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:11.000
are gone, that's good for the player. Ok,
and then we just created- and he created this

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.860
really simple way of tracking the cards by
lumping them into these buckets.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:20.680
And so what this does is this tells you what
your odds of winning are. You know when there's

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.600
a lot of tens left, your odds of winning go
up. And that means you bet more. When your

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.080
odds of winning go down, you bet less or you
don't play at all. And this is really this

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.690
sort of fundamental lesson of blackjack.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:34.341
And this is why-why I say, "How is Google
like card counting?"

00:20:34.341 --> 00:20:39.560
Right, and the reason is, is that Google in
a lot of ways is all about data.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.560
And it's all, I don't have to tell you -- I
mean you guys tell me what Google’s really

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.180
about, but when I look at Google from the
outside, I think that a lot of it's about

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.390
data and it's a lot about using the past to
predict the future, right -- the better algorithms

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.200
and what not-and that's really what card counting
was.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:56.710
This quote from this French philosopher, sort
of in poet, "History teaches everything, including

00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:00.730
the future." Is the key to card counting.
It's using data from the past to predict the

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:01.730
future.

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:07.400
And so many industries would be well served
to think about business that way right now

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:12.920
and that's at the core of sort of why-why
I wanted to write the book.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:18.800
So when you, when you have at the core this
sort of idea of using data and analytics behind

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.880
you, it helps you make difficult decisions.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:29.080
So, proof to you guys that I was actually
in the movie. That's me Jeffery, the dealer.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.900
What's sad about this is I had a name tag
as a prop and they actually spelled my name

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:39.880
wrong. So I'm not Jeffrey, J-e-f-f-r-e-y,
the dealer; I’m Jeffery, J-e-f-f-e-r-y.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:46.842
But anyway so. Why I have this up here is
to remind myself and you guys of one of the

00:21:46.842 --> 00:21:48.460
most difficult decisions I've ever made.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:54.190
Okay. And how many of you guys play blackjack?

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:55.201
So only about half of you guys.

00:21:55.201 --> 00:21:59.640
So you're not-this'll be-this’ll be a little
bit difficult for you guys to understand but

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:04.730
I walk up to a table and this a-a probably
about a year and a half into my playing and

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:08.410
I had just learned something called numbers
plays which is an advanced way. It's almost

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.980
like an advanced strategy.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:15.120
It's a way of actually varying what you do
at the table based on knowledge of how many

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:21.060
tens and low cards are left. So I walked up
to the table and the count. My team mates-basically,

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.770
the whole idea of the cloak and dagger thing
where Kate Bosworth folds her arms and-.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:31.810
Well, I walk up to the table and the math
tells me to bet two hands of $8000. So I do.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.460
I bet two hands of $8,000.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.710
The first one I get blackjack and on the second
one I get a pair of tens and the dealer has

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:42.530
a six up. So the blackjack I get paid $12,000.
OK, Great. All rejoicing.

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:48.680
The pair of tens, I actually have the opportunity
to split but no one in their right mind splits

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:56.600
tens with $50 on the table let alone $8,000.
But, actually, the math called for me to split

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.600
these.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.730
And let me explain to you the math behind
it. Imagine you're tracking tens and low cards.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:05.830
And imagine that you know that pretty much
every card that you're not seeing is a ten.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:09.100
And if you have a pair of tens against a six
wouldn't you want to split those. Wouldn't

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.870
that give you a higher expected value? So
that’s what I did.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:15.640
So I turn to the floor-the woman and she's
like looking at me like I'm crazy. And I said,

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.671
"I think I want to split those."

00:23:16.671 --> 00:23:17.840
And she says, "Excuse me, you want to what?"

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.100
I said, "I think I want to split those."

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.920
And, literally, there’s four people at the
table, all stare up at me and if they were

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.080
packing heat, I would have been dead right
then.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:32.670
But the dealer gives me a nine to make 19
and then gets an ace and then gives me an

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.520
ace on the second one to give me 21.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.450
So, I'm feeling pretty good about myself but
I still needed the dealer to bust, otherwise,

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:43.270
probably won't walk away from the table alive.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:49.361
The dealer flips a ten to make 16 and gets
a ten to make 26. I win. I grab my chips and

00:23:49.361 --> 00:23:53.080
I run away from the table basically, 'cause
I knew that they were going to be pissed off

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.080
at me.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.660
But as I walked away from the table I thought
a lot about why that was such a hard decision

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:01.130
for me. And there's a lot of reasons why that
was hard for me.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:04.520
And if you think about them in terms of business
stance, it’s one of the reasons why it's

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.400
so hard to make difficult decisions in general.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:11.380
One was something called group think. OK.
So many of the decisions that you make in

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.800
life are influenced by people around you and
they don't need to be.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:19.150
Everyone at that table thought I was an idiot
for splitting those tens. Right, there's,

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:23.480
to a man they thought I was idiots. And this
was a $500 table. So they all had real money

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.720
out there. And all probably thought they knew
a lot about blackjack.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:33.660
But I had to like divorce myself from the-from
the feelings of wanting to just assuage them,

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.990
you know. And just go with it and split them.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:41.540
The second thing is actually a-a cognitive
bias. Are you guys familiar with the any sort

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.760
of behavioral economics or behavioral finance
stuff that's done?

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.880
Any of you guys read Dan Ariely's work and
"Predictably Irrational"?

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:53.980
The classic way of looking at economics is
that people are rational. People always make

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.790
the right decision. But the reality is, people
aren't.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:01.120
And, in fact, there is something called, "Loss
Aversion", where we're more impacted by a

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.590
loss than we are by a gain of equal amounts.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:08.870
It's the reason why when Google's stock was
shooting up. You know, back in the day, that

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:12.850
people kept, every time you guys kept kicking
butt, they still sell because they were afraid

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:17.280
of losing the money that they had gained already.
It would go up more and they'd be really pissed

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.600
off that they sold.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:23.250
In general, it's the reason that people are
risk adverse. It's something called, "Loss

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:24.250
Aversion."

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:27.920
And for me having that 20, and when people
have 20, they already bank that as a win.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.540
And they don't want to give up the opportunity
to make more money.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:35.400
But if you think about the way that-and not-not
to talk about-I don't know do you guys consider-

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:39.030
I guess you consider Facebook a competitor
for sure, no, maybe, I don't know.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:43.080
Anyways, I was speaking at Facebook and I-I
mentioned this story and I said, "You guys,

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:48.740
are you gonna take the exact same risks now?"-
And I spoke at that day, the day had 500 million-they

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.660
got 500 million users. "Are you going to take
the same risks today?"

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.931
And someone from the executive team was standing
in the back and he said, "Absolutely, we're

00:25:54.931 --> 00:25:57.351
gonna take the same risks"; because they're
not loss averse.

00:25:57.351 --> 00:26:00.340
And I'm sure you guys are not loss averse
as a company. You're thinking about how do

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:05.240
we continue to grow the business, not how
do we try to protect and defend.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:09.140
The other kind of bias that actually comes
into play is something called "omission bias"

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:15.040
or "inactivity bias". And so in blackjack,
what's interesting is-is people make mistake-so

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.790
many mistakes when they play blackjack. And
they make a lot of mistakes based on inactivity

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:21.090
versus activity.

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:27.220
So think about it. You have 15 and the dealer
has a 10 up. What do you guys do in that situation?

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.030
[PAUSE]

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.120
You hit, right.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.540
'Cause there's a good chance they got 20,
but a lot of people will stand on that. 'Cause

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:39.730
15 they're worried that they're going to get
a 7, an 8, a 9, a 10 and bust, right.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.070
And that's something called, "Omission Bias."

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:45.250
People favor maintaining status quo versus
making an active decision.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:49.541
I always kinda allude this to-like to take
it totally out of the realm of business and

00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:54.910
out of sports or out of gambling-to that friend
of yours that you know is in this horrible

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:56.270
relationship.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:59.750
And e-and then they-they everyday they don't-they
stay in that relationship, right, because

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:04.010
they just don't want to make the active decision
of breaking up with them. Because the idea

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:08.660
of staying in this relationship is easier,
right. Maintaining status quo is easier.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.070
So when you think about making decisions as
we did in blackjack, you have to think about

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:15.620
inactivity and activity equally.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.010
So as I thought about this whole thing I was
reminded- How many of you guys are sports

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:22.570
fans. All right, so a handful of you, again.

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:26.350
There's a guy by the name of Bill Belichick,
who made this really difficult decision with

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:30.340
the New England Patriots. He got a sort of
killed about it. Anyways at the end of the

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:34.380
day, it was an okay decision but it didn't
work.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.690
And I was talking to a very famous sports
writer by the name of Bill Simmons about it.

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:41.510
And Bill and I were talking about the decision.
And he was getting frustrated with me because

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:44.760
I thought I was right and he thought he was
right. In the end, he looks at me and he goes,

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:48.030
"Well, Jeff, you know what. It was the wrong
decision. We know that."

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.110
And I said, "How do we know that, Bill?"

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.100
And he said, "'Cause it didn't work."

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.160
[FEW CHUCKLES]

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.660
But you guys laugh. But, I mean, in his mind,
bad outcome meant bad decision.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:03.480
And that's not true, right. A bad decision
doesn't always necessarily mean a bad outcome.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.900
And separating the outcome from the decision
was an important thing that we learned in

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:07.900
blackjack.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.640
You can make the right decision all the time,
but still lose if you just happen to get unlucky

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.100
and the dealer got a five to make 21.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.170
So why make difficult decisions?

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:21.350
Don't end up like this guy. You wanna end
up like this guy instead.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:25.710
Okay, and Sean Payton-What's interesting about
Sean Payton-Now, how many of you guys watched

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:26.760
the Super Bowl? [PAUSE]

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.760
Okay.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:33.530
So you guys all know the really, really crazy
thing Sean Payton did, right? He decided to

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.610
go for an onside kick at the beginning of
the second half.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:39.480
Ok and for those of you guys that don't follow
football, onside kick is this really risky

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.380
thing. You basically kick the ball short and,
if your team's able to recover it, you get

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:47.930
the ball. But, if not, the other team gets
the ball in much better field position.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:53.220
And this is a really risky thing 'cause, over
the course of history of football, only 25%

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.500
of onside kicks are recovered by the home
t-by the team kicking it.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:01.550
But what no one in mainstream media-no one
talked about, was that a surprise onside kick,

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:05.830
which this was, is recovered 60% of the time
by the kicking team.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:11.210
So that even though, this was like a big risk
by Sean Payton. If he had done this 1,000

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.940
times his team would have gotten the ball
600.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.740
So how risky was it really?

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.920
[PAUSE]

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:24.640
So-o-o-o, what's kinda interesting about this
whole Sean Payton and Bill Belichick thing,

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:30.141
just to get out of sports now, is it actually
highlights sort of this thing -- the reason

00:29:30.141 --> 00:29:34.070
that we use analytics and the reason that
I've used analytics is that I believe it helps

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:38.510
you win more often and teams help-it helps,
it just makes your company win, makes your

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:39.960
team win.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.680
But wha-what's interesting about coaches and
professional teams-and I was talking to Daryl

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.910
Morey, who's the General Manager for the Houston
Rockets, about this. And I was kinda like

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:52.171
bitchin’ to him about how "coaches make
all these bad decisions". Why do they do this?

00:29:52.171 --> 00:29:54.350
They make decisions that don't help them ultimately
win.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:58.860
And he said, "You know what, 'cause their
ultimate goal is not necessarily to win."

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.690
And I said, "Really! How's that possible?"

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:05.770
And he said, "Actually their first goal is
self-preservation. They wanna keep their job."

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:10.510
And if they do something that is so- there's
a-there's a philosopher, or sorry, economist

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:15.090
named John Maynard Keynes. And he has this
great quote that says, "History would teach

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:21.080
us that it's better to fail unconv-fail conventionally
than it is to succeed unconventionally."

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:26.380
And just this idea that you need to sorta
go with the flow, and that's what these coaches

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:31.520
were doing. So it's, what I think and there's
actually a chapter in the book. How many-has

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.390
anyone read "The House Advantage" yet?

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:34.390
[PAUSE]

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:37.370
So, there's-there's a chapter in there that
actually talks a little bit about Google.

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:42.400
And it talks about Tom Wu, who anyone of you
gu-guys know Tom Wu, he's in your sort of

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.960
HR Compensation Plan Department.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.620
And he talked all about the way you guys work
hard to try to create aligned incentives within

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:51.910
your compensation programs.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:57.060
And that's like what people need to do, because
in blackjack we had a really, really great

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.880
si-set of aligned incentives.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:03.270
We had this pile of cash and chips that we
tried to grow into a bigger pile of cash and

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:05.820
chips. OK, and that's how simple it was.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:09.690
Actually, people always ask me, "What was
the most money you ever made in a weekend?"

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:15.130
And the most money we ever made in a weekend
was $450,000. And at the end of the weekend,

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:20.660
myself and a coup-one of my other buddies,
Wes, were sitting at the Mirage pool with

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:25.780
all of the money that we had in a duffel bag.
And the reason we do that is that we didn't

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:30.530
want to leave the bag up in our room, and
it was too big to put in the safe, so we have

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:33.270
it down at the pool under a lawn chair in
this ratty duffel bag. No one knows what's

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:37.280
in it. So I turn to Wes and I say, "Wes, do
you think we can just leave this bag here

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.280
and maybe go for a swim?"

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.760
And he looks at me and he goes, "Uh-h-h, well,
how much is in there?"

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:49.740
And I said, "Well it's the money we won-$450,000,
and the money we brought out here- $540,000.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.400
So it's about $990,000."

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.530
And he says, "I don't see why we can't leave
it. It's not like it's a million dollars."

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.410
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:02.870
So, we have this sort of real common set of
incentives and I think that in business that's

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:06.860
so important. And if you read Michael Lewis'
new book "The Big Short" what he talks all

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:10.730
about is how the mortgage crisis so much of
it was caused by people having misaligned

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:15.370
incentives. And I applaud the work that you
guys do on your compensation plans for trying

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.340
to strive so much for aligned incentive.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.600
Soooo. [PAUSE]

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:25.350
OK, My four keys to making better decisions;
and this is sort of a recap of what we just

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:26.350
talked about.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:31.630
One, that realize that decisions are everywhere.
This idea of omission by us, or not wanting

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:35.720
to make a decision that should be the same
weight as actually making the decision.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.500
Evaluate decisions from a true zero frame
of reference.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.940
So this’ll help you avoid that idea of loss
aversion, right. Instead of thinking about

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:50.230
like, ok, I’d already won $5,000 maybe I’ll
just kind of quit right now. Well, no, your

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:51.900
company will never get bigger if you think
that way.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:55.360
Oops. [PAUSE]

00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:04.240
Imagine you’re to make a decision millions
of times. So in the Sean Payton example that

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.750
we talked about, instead of him thinking about
that one play, think about, "Well if I did

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:10.420
this a thousand times, how many times will
it work?"

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:14.400
You need to, like let’s say that Mike, I
know you're sitting in the front row, just

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.150
shouldn’t have done it, so; let’s say
that we’re gonna play a game you and I,

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:19.150
right.

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:25.200
We flip a coin. If it’s heads, I’m gonna
give you a million dollars. If it’s tails

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.961
you give me a $100,000. Ok, right.

00:33:27.961 --> 00:33:34.420
You’re psyched on that, but let me pre-empt-le-I’ve
got five goons behind me. And if you lose,

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.230
you gotta pay me right now. They’re going
to go with you to whatever bank you’re at,

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:41.450
whatever place you’re at and you gotta pull
that $100,000 out and hand it to me today;

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:45.400
otherwise, they’re going to rough you up.
But you only get to play once. Do you want

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.400
to play that game still?

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:53.070
Ok, now let me say that you have a line of
credit with me. And you can play that game

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:56.470
as many times as you want and you can settle
whenever you want. Now do you want to play

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.340
that game? Absolutely, right?

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:03.120
And so the decision is much easier when you
get to make it millions of times than it is

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.120
to do it just once.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.920
So try to think about decisions and try to
put yourself into positions where you get

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:10.030
to make good decisions millions of times.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:15.240
And the final thing is this idea, this Bill
Simmons story, right. Don’t confuse the

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.320
outcome with the decision.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:21.909
A bad outcome doesn’t necessarily mean a
bad decision. And that's the best way to think

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:24.830
about it as you evaluate decisions you make
in your life or in your business whether they're

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.389
good or not, right. Don’t think about, ok,
it’s just worked.

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:30.760
This guy was telling me he works for a hedge
fund, right. And he says his hedge fund manager,

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:34.710
the guy that he works for does not believe
in this, right. He believes that good decision-good

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:35.940
outcome always means good decision.

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:39.919
He was telling this story, actually, what’s
funny, where he was trying to buy Google,

00:34:39.919 --> 00:34:43.760
I think. And he mistyped the ticker symbol
and didn’t notice and bought some other

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:49.770
stock that went up 60% in like two days. And
claimed that that was a good decision, ‘cause

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:53.919
it was a good outcome, as crazy as that sounds.

00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:58.190
So let’s go back to my defining moment-my
big lesson.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:02.161
Oh, this slide just gets all screwed up now.
I’ve gotta fix it. Anyways, this kind of

00:35:02.161 --> 00:35:03.161
gave it away.

00:35:03.161 --> 00:35:09.930
But, basically, I had, recap, I had $50,000
on the table, the dealer had a 5 up. I’m

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:15.520
about to win back this money, this woman’s
house, that she had lost-“oh, my mortgage.”

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:21.110
The dealer flips a 10 to make a 15 and then
gets a 6 to make 21. And I remember thinking

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:26.410
to myself- well, first of all I was 22 years
old. Just lost $100,000. Sick to my stomach.

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:32.520
I walk upstairs to my room at Caesars Palace.
Collapse on the floor, stare up at the ceiling,

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.361
wondering to myself, "Why is there a mirror
up there?" And then once I got over that.

00:35:36.361 --> 00:35:37.361
[Audience Chuckles]

00:35:37.361 --> 00:35:40.560
Well, I was 22 no idea why there’s a mirror
there. And so once I got over that, I’m

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.770
like "Do people get ready like this? How do
they do this?"

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:43.770
[Laugh from Audience]

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:47.760
So once I got over that, I-I started thinking
about all those lessons that I had just talked

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.760
about, right.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.760
I thought about loss aversion.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.310
I thought about the idea of making a decision
million of times.

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:56.420
I thought about had I made the right decision
and just suffered a bad outcome.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.620
And I realized that that-that was true.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:03.550
And I thought about all this that I believed
in, in terms of numbers and analytics and

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:04.550
math.

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:07.940
And I really believed that I had made the
right decision. So I went back down and I

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:08.940
kept playing.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:13.790
And for the weekend, I won back that $100,000
I’d lost and I won an additional $70,000.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:18.830
So I ended up plus $70,000 for the weekend.

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:21.970
And, if I had quit, a lot of this would never
have happened to me.

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:24.980
I mean, I certainly wouldn’t be considered
this data expert.

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.450
And I wouldn’t be talking to you right now.

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:28.270
And never would have had a movie or a book
written about me.

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:32.070
And I wouldn’t have been able to write my
new book, "The House Advantage".

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.541
So thanks for the time.

00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:36.650
Do we have questions? I’m gonna put my mike
up here now so that people can get the mike

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:37.850
and then I’m gonna just stand by the podium.

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:39.670
[PAUSE]

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:49.830
&gt;&gt;YOUNG MAN: Ah, So when you talk about decision
making in blackjack, from an objective point

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:52.930
of view, you have the numbers, and there’s
always a right decision, right.

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:53.930
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Uh huh.

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:59.650
&gt;&gt;YOUNG MAN: But in business and, um, and
in poker for example, you have the incomplete

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:01.470
set of information, right.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:06.840
And a lot of times like- like you said you
lose your $100,000 here but to you, you can

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.080
rationalize it to yourself that, oh, you made
the right decision mathematically.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:13.781
But in business and in poker a lot of times
you think you made the right decision.

00:37:13.781 --> 00:37:14.781
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Right.

00:37:14.781 --> 00:37:15.781
&gt;&gt;YOUNG MAN: But you don’t actually know.

00:37:15.781 --> 00:37:16.781
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Right

00:37:16.781 --> 00:37:17.850
&gt;&gt;Young Man: So how do you deal with that
kind of uncertainty?

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:22.380
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Well man, I think you need to-need
to be able to do things enough times that

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.520
you can decide whether it was the right decision
or not.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.620
So, I think that'sa really good point. Which
is ultimately-how do you avoid having like

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:32.700
confirmation bias where you look back on something
and you go, “God, I think that was the right

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:33.700
decision.”

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.150
So in blackjack, if you think about it, we
have this played out and simulated so many

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:38.880
time that we knew it was the right decision.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.510
So you have to create a framework that you’re
certain that your decisions are correct, and

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:45.810
not just rely on outcomes. Does that make
sense?

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:47.270
&gt;&gt;YOUNG MAN: Yeah.

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:50.560
&gt;JEFF: And the thing with poker and the market
and everything is that you’re never gonna

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.511
be able to reach the certainty that we did
in blackjack.

00:37:53.511 --> 00:37:58.280
You’re gonna just to try to improve. So
all you wanna do is make sure that whatever

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:03.410
analytics or whatever framework you’re using
improves your ability to make decisions. So

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:05.140
now that’s the only level that you need
to feel competent.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:08.430
And honestly, if you do something a million
times-if you do something a hundred times

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:11.080
and it keeps not working or a thousand times
and it keeps not working, it probably wasn’t

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.270
a good decision in the first place.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:13.720
&gt;&gt;YOUNG MAN: That’s so.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:17.450
&gt;&gt;JEFF: You have to be pretty objective with
yourself though. Yeah.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:21.020
&gt;&gt;MAN: Yeah, Hi. Thanks, thanks again for
coming out here…

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:22.020
&gt;&gt;JEFF: No problem.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.020
&gt;&gt;MAN: and speaking to us. I just wanted to
ask you- now that the houses at a lot of these

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:31.210
casinos have gotten a lot smarter and started
to add more decks to the shoes, do you think

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:33.210
it’s still possible to beat the house or…?

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:38.060
&gt;&gt;JEFF: You know it’s a lot harder in blackjack,
and certainly like our movie, our book and

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:47.650
this book don’t really help. But, it’s
 -- the thing about the casinos is that the

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:52.910
reason that blackjack is beatable and the
reason that blackjack became popular was because

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:55.770
it was a game that could be beaten.

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:58.790
So it’s always gonna be beatable because
that’s what makes it popular and they’re

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:01.980
always gonna offer a version of it that’s
gonna be beatable. It’s just harder to beat

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.980
than it used to be.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:07.160
You just have to find your niche. What you
can’t do like a big team anymore with hundreds

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:11.280
of thousands of dollars. You could probably
go in as an individual betting thousands of

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:14.610
dollars and be ok.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:15.610
Other questions? [PAUSE]

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:19.260
Anyone? Come on you guys must have some questions?

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:23.010
Don’t you wanna know if I ever really got
beat up?

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:27.220
Don’t you know how it was like having a
white guy playing me? I mean these are all

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:31.080
the standard questions. Like I can start asking
them myself.

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.080
Yeah, go ahead.

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:38.000
MAN: So you talked a little bit about having
an argument with Bill Simmons about a football

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
decision.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Uh huh

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.700
&gt;&gt;MAN: What exactly was the decision and what
were the-what was the frame of reference…

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.700
&gt;&gt;JEFF: …Oh, well…

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:44.700
&gt;&gt;MAN: …you…

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:45.700
&gt;&gt;JEFF: …was so…

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.700
&gt;&gt;MAN: …were using.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.280
&gt;&gt;JEFF: …in that was, It was the-when the
Patriots went for a fourth and two against

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:53.400
the Colts and they were at their own 29 yard
line. They were up by six points and they

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.330
didn’t get it and then the Colts came down
and scored and won the game.

00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:01.110
And he got killed, Bill Belichick got killed
by the mainstream media because they thought

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:04.590
it was absolutely the wrong decision. Now
there is a lotta math and numbers that said

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:07.280
that it was the right decision.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:09.870
And I’m not here to tell you guys that it
was the right decision or the wrong decision.

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:14.930
What I’m saying is that it was a, probably,
a difficult decision that he probably could

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:19.360
have been right. What I’m here to say is
that it didn’t make it a bad decision because

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.870
it didn’t work, right. That’s my main
point.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:26.100
&gt;&gt;MAN: OK, thanks.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.170
[PAUSE]

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:36.220
&gt;&gt;MAN: So you mentioned that people get mad
at the blackjack table when you pull cards

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.220
when you’re not supposed to.

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.220
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Yeah.

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.620
&gt;&gt;MAN: Is there anything beyond superstitious
to them?

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:40.620
&gt;&gt;JEFF: No

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.350
&gt;&gt;MAN: It’s like how do you explain to people
that it really…

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:43.350
&gt;&gt;JEFF: There’s…

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:44.350
&gt;&gt;MAN: …doesn’t matter.

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:46.950
&gt;&gt;JEFF: There’s like this wonderful chapter
in this new book called "The House Advantage"

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:47.950
about it.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:48.950
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:54.080
No, I do talk about that and that’s, so
what he’s referencing is that in blackjack

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.661
you only play against the dealer.

00:40:55.661 --> 00:40:58.730
Ok, you don’t play against the other players.

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:04.220
Yet when you do something that people perceive
to be wrong and it causes- Let’s say that

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:10.470
you have a 12 and the dealer has a six up
and you decide to hit your hand and you get

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:17.610
a ten, right, and you bust. And the dealer
flips his card, has 16 and gets a 5 and makes

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:19.970
21 and everyone loses, right.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:24.180
The thought process is that you took the ten
that was gonna keep the dealer from busting

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.470
so you cost the entire table.

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:30.520
But the problem with that is that the cards
are in there are 100% completely randomly.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.780
And you very well could have taken the six
that the dealer needed to-or the five that

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:38.480
the dealer needed to make 21 and then ended
up giving the dealer 10.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.950
Now nobody ever remembers the times that people
did things and it hurt them -- and it helped

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:49.870
them, right. People only remember the things-the
times that people did things and it hurt them.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:54.640
And that’s something called confirmation
bias, Right. We’re all inclined to believe

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.640
things that support our hypothesis. It’s
just easier.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.940
It’s like the reason that there’s conspiracy
theories. There’s this whole, there’s

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.610
going to be this whole section of my book
where I made fun of Charlie Sheen, ‘cause

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:05.561
Charlie Sheen actually still believes.

00:42:05.561 --> 00:42:10.420
Or-n-you can just go and it’s cool to say
at Google. Just go home and Google this. I

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:13.440
have to say that’s cool. Sorry, that was
just nerdy.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.780
But go back and Google this which is to say
that “Charlie Sheen Conspiracy Theory”

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:21.440
and you’ll see quotes from him where he
says. "It looked too planned the way that

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.200
second tower went down almost it was like
an internal demolition."

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:30.430
Or, he says things like, “They never found
any plane parts at the Pentagon", even though

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:36.331
they did find plane parts at the Pentagon.
So the concept is that he has this conspiracy

00:42:36.331 --> 00:42:40.390
theory and he only wants to remember details
that support his conspiracy theory.

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:43.380
And that’s true of people that believe that,
right.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:46.310
And what I would say to them is, “Listen.
What I want you to do for the next year that

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:50.080
you’re playing blackjack I want you to take
on your IPhone or whatever I want you to keep

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:54.160
running track of every time someone does something
stupid and it hurts you and every time someone

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.730
does something stupid and helps you. And I
bet after that year you’re gonna come back

00:42:57.730 --> 00:42:58.920
and it’s gonna be 50-50.” So that’s
what I would tell them.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:42:59.920
&gt;&gt;MAN: How often will they do that?

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.350
&gt;&gt;JEFF: No one will do that.

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:03.350
[CHUCKLES]

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:06.881
But confirmation bias is fascinating because
it-it-it’s not just the blackjack table.

00:43:06.881 --> 00:43:08.770
It affects us all over the world, right.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:12.600
It’s the reason why like, you know, there’s
this guy -- I mentioned him earlier, Daryl

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:17.890
Morey, he’s the General Manager of the Houston
Rockets, and he’s like telling me about

00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:22.070
how important it is that he will only have
people that work for him that are willing

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:25.980
to argue with him. ‘Because he doesn’t
wanta be-have people that are there just confirming

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.280
whatever biases he has. It’s important.

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.280
Yeah.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:35.020
&gt;&gt;MAN: Um, also, FYI I think actually Bill
Simmons, I don’t know if you read the article

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:39.770
about that Bill Belichick incident afterwards
but I think that he ended up agreeing with

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:40.770
you afterwards, so-

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:43.900
&gt;&gt;JEFF: He’s-he’s, yeah, I don’t wanta
talk about Bill Simmons any more.

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:44.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.260
He's already gotten enough play on this.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:51.720
&gt;&gt;MAN: Anyways yeah. So, there’s this thing
that I guess in poker we call it emotional

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.510
tilt, right. It’s this situation where you
understand…

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:55.910
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Right…, right…, right…

00:43:55.910 --> 00:44:00.490
&gt;&gt;MAN: …you like make a right decision but
you get the wrong result and you get this

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:05.840
kind a like huge like blow to your head where
it’s like, God, like what the hell is that…

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.000
&gt;&gt;JEFF: It like emotional tilts in business…

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000
&gt;&gt;MAN: …Right…

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000
&gt;&gt;JEFF: …it’s in everything, right…

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
&gt;&gt;MAN: So…

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Sorry go ahead.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.230
&gt;&gt;MAN: So like beyond kind of trying to stay
objective, beyond looking at the numbers beyond

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:17.521
that, what do you think is like a real like
tangible way you can deal with that?

00:44:17.521 --> 00:44:21.730
&gt;&gt;JEFF: You can’t make emotional decisions
if you really want to be successful. I mean,

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:25.210
there’s not a lot of people that make emotional
decisions that are successful.

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:31.370
And the avoiding emotional tilt in life and
in business and in blackjack or poker is really

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:35.000
important and that’s one of the things that
using data and analytics to make decisions

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.870
it makes it easier for you to make unemotional
decisions, because you’re not impacted by

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:42.700
what recently happened, because you’re not
following a subjective framework. You’re

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:46.991
following an objective framework. And I-I-I
think that’s-I think that’s really important.

00:44:46.991 --> 00:44:51.950
Because there’s a scene in the movie "21"
where the guy that plays me basically goes

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:54.630
on an emotional tilt and he loses hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

00:44:54.630 --> 00:45:00.410
And that scene is based on the story that
I told you guys where I lost $100,000 in two

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:04.850
hands of blackjack. And when I read that script
the first time I went to the screen writer

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:08.420
and I said. "You gotta take this out, ‘cause
we never would have done this."

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:12.990
If someone went on an emotional tilt they
were fired they were off our team. So, of

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:16.050
course, they don’t listen to me ‘cause
they’re making a Hollywood movie but the

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:20.640
point is that that's just unacceptable. You
can’t allow that to happen.

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.970
You had someone behind you.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:31.250
&gt;&gt;Man: To sort of follow up on that question,
what are the-what are the elements that cause

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:32.250
people to go into that emotional tilt, like
on a casino floor or in a trading room…

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:33.250
&gt;&gt;JEFF: That’s a fascinating…

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:34.250
&gt;&gt;MAN: …in a…?

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:35.250
&gt;&gt;JEFF: That’s fascinating and honestly
that’s something that I’ve been sorta

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:38.230
playing around with for my next book, if I
do a next book -- which is just this idea

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:43.340
of the emotions that go behind us that make
us make really bad decisions.

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:49.010
So like, there are a lot of really, really
successful people in business that go to Vegas

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:53.120
and play games that they know they’re gonna
lose, but they still do it. And I don’t

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.751
know why they do it. I don’t know, I mean,
I honestly don’t know.

00:45:55.751 --> 00:45:59.680
I would love-it’s a fascinating thing to
think about, because if you could understand

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.230
that, you could: 1) help people make better
decisions and 2) you could prey on that for

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:06.790
your own business [AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]to help
them make bad decisions. So, it’s cool.

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:07.790
Okay.

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:12.550
Did you have something in the back, the red
shirt or?

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:13.870
[PAUSE]

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:21.320
&gt;&gt;MAN: And so a question that I think someone
asked earlier about when you have incomplete

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.940
information. And you know that you don’t
have enough information…

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:24.940
&gt;&gt;JEF: Right

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:25.940
&gt;&gt;MAN: …or all the information…

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:26.940
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Right

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:30.750
&gt;&gt;MAN: …And I guess recently there-there’s
been some books or articles about like your

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:31.750
gut instinct…

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:32.750
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Right

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:34.910
&gt;&gt;MAN: and how that could be right because
you’re assimilating information that you

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:36.790
don’t logically have, but you have…

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:37.790
&gt;&gt;JEFF: right

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:39.640
&gt;&gt;MAN: What are your thoughts on that?

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:43.550
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Yeah. I mean there’s a chapter in
my book that’s entitled “The Brain Cells

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:48.391
in your Stomach” and it’s-it’s-it’s
supposed to be talking about gut or intuition

00:46:48.391 --> 00:46:52.840
or it’s supposed to kinda describe this
new form of intuition, which is kinda like

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:58.500
what you’re saying, this idea that-that
maybe your intuition is incorporating data

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:00.550
that you’re not conscious of.

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:03.910
Which is fine which is like a great way of
thinking about things. But, I think the key

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:07.880
is that you understand that every successful
decision that’s made has some form of data

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:11.450
behind it. It might not be data sitting in
a spreadsheet, it might be in your brain and

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:16.660
it be-not even be totally data that you remember
or understand, but it’s data nonetheless.

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:20.140
Because like the point of that chapter that
I have is this-the last time I checked there’s

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:24.970
no brain cells in your stomach, right. And
you can’t use your gut to actually make

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:26.670
a decision.

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:31.890
And I’m actually, like literally have in
my bag a cop-a copy of "Blink", Malcolm Gladwell’s

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:36.130
book ‘cause I wanta reread it because when
I remember reading it, it kinda drives me

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:40.110
crazy, right. This idea that people blink
and they make these great decisions.

00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:43.520
Well, that’s well and good but how in the
world are we able to harness that or use that

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:49.150
in our lives? And I’d love to take him to
task on that and try to get him to help me

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:52.751
to understand how that’s useful to me. So.

00:47:52.751 --> 00:47:59.760
&gt;&gt;WOMAN: Ok, so did you really get beaten
up and how bad did it get? And, also, did

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.840
you start the club at MIT or was it already
there?

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.710
&gt;&gt;JEFF: No, it’s been around for a long
time. You know, it’s one of those things

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:11.250
that the reason that I got well known is because
I approached Ben Mezrich, who wrote "Bringing

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:15.170
Down the House", the original book and I told
him I had this great story for him.

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:20.760
He was-had written only fictional books before
and some would say he’s only written fictional

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:21.760
books since.

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:22.760
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:26.630
That’s a little inside joke about Ben and
the flak he’s getting on his Facebook book.

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:32.290
But he had written six books before and they’re
all fictional and I had this great story about

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:33.300
what we did playing blackjack.

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:37.100
Now none of us-neither of us thought the book
was going to be big at all. And what’s actually

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:44.850
interesting is that in terms of the life is
about preparation and luck and hopefully successes

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:46.850
comes from those two things. Well, this was
a lot of luck.

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:52.789
It turned out that Kevin Spacey's right hand
man read a wired out adaptation version of

00:48:52.789 --> 00:48:57.340
the book before it even came out and called
Ben and told him, "I really think that we-that

00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:01.020
Kevin and I want to make this into a movie."
So before the book even came out, it was going

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:03.210
to be made into a movie by Kevin Spacey.

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:06.860
And Ben was on the Today Show the first day
the book came out. It went through the roof

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:10.740
on Amazon. All this kinda stuff. Anyways,
so that’s how I ended up getting well known

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:12.900
in that equation. It wasn’t because I started
the team.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:18.300
I never really got beat up. There’s this-there’s
this scene I describe in the new book about

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:22.369
getting chased off a riverboat in Shreveport,
Louisiana, at gunpoint wondering to myself

00:49:22.369 --> 00:49:26.790
if anyone's going to notice if an Asian dude
disappears in Shreveport, Louisiana.

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:33.160
And it was a-it was-it was sorta fascinating
time. The scariest thing probably that ever

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:37.010
happened to me was when I was screening the
movie for the first time, Laurence Fishburne

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:40.380
was sitting right next to me in this like
tiny little screening room and every time

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.090
his character hit my character he would stand
up and cackle over me.

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:44.090
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:46.600
And I was just like, "Leave me alone, Morpheus.
Go back to the-go back to the Matrix."

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.700
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:48.700
Yeah.

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:55.890
&gt;&gt;WOMAN: So did it in fact upset you to be
portrayed as a white guy?

00:49:55.890 --> 00:50:02.400
&gt;&gt;JEFF: You know what? It didn’t- it did
and it didn’t. Now if any of you guys actually

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:08.650
think that I had any say in who cast me, you’re
crazy. Because it’s not like I’m Lance

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:13.520
Armstrong, where people are gonna to go, “Ok,
I know Lance Armstrong is not black.”

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:18.920
They’re not going to know that so I didn’t
have a lot of say. And at the end of the day,

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:23.100
what I tried to do was be as complicit with
the casino, with the, sorry, the studio as

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:27.530
possible so that they would make me part of
their promotion. And they did.

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:31.990
They made me front and center for their promotion.
I was on the second front page of USA Today;

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:36.410
I was on the Early Show on CBS. And that was
my way of sort of representing to everyone

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:40.100
that the guy from "Bringing Down the House"
was Asian-American.

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:44.210
If I had gone against them, they would have
pushed me totally out and nobody would have

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:47.350
ever known. They probably would have taken
Ben Mezrich out with them on their PR Tour.

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:53.170
So I’m pretty, pretty strong in my-in my
roots and it’s not like I wanted to ever,

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:56.170
 -- and the reason that I’m talking about
this so much is because I did get a lot of

00:50:56.170 --> 00:51:01.660
flak about it publically. It’s not like
I had that much say and in the end I try to

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:06.640
do the best thing for myself and the movie
and just my culture in general, I guess.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:10.600
Alright, we’ll probably take one more if
anyone has one more.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.600
[PAUSE]

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.610
OK, if not, I’ll…

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:16.780
OK, sorry, go ahead.

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:17.780
[PAUSE]

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.150
&gt;&gt;MAN: Mike

00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:21.530
&gt;&gt;JEFF: No problem.

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:26.640
&gt;&gt;MAN: So I know a lot of people have very,
very strong opinions about LeBron James’

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.640
decision to join with you…

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:28.640
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Yeah!

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.250
&gt;&gt;MAN: …I just wanted to know, based on
your thoughts on…

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:31.250
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Yeah.

00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:34.560
&gt;&gt;MAN: …decision making. What do you think
on his decision? And part two- Have you ever

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:35.920
talked to Bill Simmons about that?

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:36.920
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:40.660
&gt;&gt;JEFF: I have not talked to Simmons about
it. Simmons like - the reason I’m mad at

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:46.210
Simmons is ‘cause I’m trying, I talked
to him about my book back in February. He

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:48.810
thought it was like a great idea and he said,
“Oh, I’d like really be interested in

00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:51.550
reading that." And I’ve been trying to get
him to read it and I haven’t been able to

00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:52.550
get him to read it yet.

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:53.550
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:54.660
So that’s why I’m annoyed in full disclosure.

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:56.911
The second thing is that LeBron James --

00:51:56.911 --> 00:52:02.960
It was a fascinating-it was a fascinating
time. For two weeks, it was consuming so many

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:10.460
people and every-I was doing an interview
with a- and not to like stereo type or profile

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:18.110
or anything- but with like a 65 year old woman
on NPR in Boston and we started talking about

00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:21.530
the book and then we mentioned sports. And
she was like, “What do you think of LeBron

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:23.531
James?” And so all of a sudden we got on
to LeBron James.

00:52:23.531 --> 00:52:29.280
I think it was kind of a cowardly decision.
I mean, I think that I kinda agree with Michael

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:32.760
Jordan’s words when he says like, “You're
LeBron James and these people come to you.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:33.760
You don’t come to them.”

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:37.080
But at the end of the day, there’s a lot
of ways you can paint it.

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:41.290
I mean he wanted to go to play basketball
with two of his friends who are really good,

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:42.440
and who can fault him for that?

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:46.290
In Miami versus Cleveland. Who can fault him
for that? So, you know.

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:47.290
Ok, Sorry.

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:48.420
&gt;&gt;MAN: Do you think it was a good business
decision?

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:51.570
&gt;&gt;JEFF: For him? I just don’t think that
it matters, right.

00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:55.540
He has so much money, like what’s the difference?
I mean, you can play that out -- like there’s

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:59.920
all those ideas and I-I-I did about two different
or three different interviews for different

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:01.420
ESPN and Sports outlets.

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:06.430
You know there’s no income tax, State income
tax in Miami, there’s no-there’s all these

00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:09.660
things, right. He’s probably spent so much
money in bottle services in the clubs that

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:12.600
it probably was a bad financial decision,
in South Beach, but. No, I mean, I don’t

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.610
know, I have no idea on that. So…

00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:15.610
&gt;&gt;MAN: Cool.

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:16.610
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Thanks.

00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:18.950
&gt;&gt;MAN: I just think when you were talking
about the bias and how a lot of people say

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:21.740
that if he doesn’t win a ring then it was
a bad decision, but…

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:22.740
Not necessarily.

00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:23.791
&gt;&gt;JEFF: I don’t think he can say that.

00:53:23.791 --> 00:53:24.791
[Chuckle from Audience] So…

00:53:24.791 --> 00:53:25.791
&gt;&gt;Man: Alright. Thank you.

00:53:25.791 --> 00:53:29.290
&gt;&gt;COMMENTATOR: Well, that was an outstanding
talk and thank you very much for speaking

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:30.290
with us.

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:31.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:34.050
&gt;&gt;JEFF: Thanks guys.
