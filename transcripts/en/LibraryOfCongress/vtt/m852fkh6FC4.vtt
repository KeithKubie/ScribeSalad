00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.510
Please join me in welcoming
our guest, Howard J. Ross.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.190
[ Applause ]

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.490
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: Hi, everybody.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.790
Good afternoon.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.540
I'm going to actually start
with a little video clip.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; [Background Music] He's the boss.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.560
She's bossy -- the negative way.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.270
Women are perceived at
the office in a new ad

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.310
for Pantene that's gone viral.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.430
It's hit a nerve so we
set out to find the truth.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.380
Are women who act exactly the
same as men seen differently?

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.960
Listen to this woman.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.710
How do you feel about
her as a job candidate?

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.550
&gt;&gt; I know the Windows operating
systems like the back of my hand.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.850
No problem.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.150
&gt;&gt; Now, listen to him.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.370
&gt;&gt; I know the Windows operating
systems like the back of my hand.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.670
No problem.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.380
&gt;&gt; The candidates in
these videos are actors

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.130
in a Yale University
hiring experiment.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.980
The resumes identical,
the interviews identical.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.740
&gt;&gt; I'm extremely good at
sizing up people quickly

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.780
and delegating responsibility
accordingly.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; The only difference is gender but
when it comes to who got the job?

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.360
&gt;&gt; I thought the male applicant
had better soft skills.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.910
I'd say the woman was
arrogant and over-selling.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.740
&gt;&gt; In hundreds of evaluations,
the female job seekers come off

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.730
as more aggressive,
are rated less likeable

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.650 position:56%
and they're less likely to be hired.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.060
&gt;&gt; Isn't it a Catch 22?

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.930
You're supposed to be
strong to get that job.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.150
And you're saying if you're
too strong, you won't get it.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.170
&gt;&gt; You need to behave in
this dominant way to advance

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.690
as a woman in the workplace.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.990
But you're seen negatively

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.160
because that's not how we
expect women to behave.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.380
&gt;&gt; And if you think this is
just male bias, it's not.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.200
Both men and women doing the
hiring made the same call.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.660
&gt;&gt; I think there's a level
of arrogance that becomes --

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.380
that might be okay to be a manager
but then there's a step above

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.830
and I thought she was
slightly above that.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.080
&gt;&gt; So let's talk and when we
revealed our study results --

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.600
&gt;&gt; I was surprised by my reaction.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.560
&gt;&gt; What does that say about us?

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.970
&gt;&gt; We've a long way to go.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.480
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: Yeah, we do
have a long way to go, don't we?

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.460
We don't have to go far from the
morning's news each day to see

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.100 position:56%
that we still have a long way to go.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.220
And you know, we look at
circumstances like this

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.810
and of course, the first
question that comes

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.630
to mind is a question
of equity and justice.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.290
You know, how can people
be successful

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.900
if they're not treated fairly
simply because of gender or race

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.630
or any other distinction?

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.170
And there's another -- excuse me --

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.010
another important question
too which is how are we going

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.960
to possibly make decent
talent management choices

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.900 position:56%
if we're making them based on things
we don't even know are manipulating

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.250
our minds?

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.880
And so I want to start this
afternoon by saying, you know,

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.590
"I don't care what
your politics are."

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.650
You know, I don't care whether
you're a Democrat or a Republican.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.100
I don't care whether
you see yourselves

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.770
as liberal or conservative.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.630
And that's something
we might talk over --

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.530 position:56%
talk about over lunch although these
days, people are afraid to talk

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.350
about those things over lunch.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.700
What I want to talk about
is how does this dynamic,

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.460
this unconscious way
we make decisions

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.110
about people impact the essence
of who we are as human beings,

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.090
at our jobs, at work,
on the streets?

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.130
How does it impact people's
lives, their livelihoods?

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.430
And it's not, we know because
most people wake up in the morning

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.560
and say, "Hmm, how can I
suppress the people of color

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.430
in my organization today?"

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.130
How can I hold down
the women, you know?

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.710
I'm not saying there aren't
some people like that.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.320
Of course, we know there's some
but overwhelmingly the issue

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.770
that we deal with especially
in organizations like yours,

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.320 position:56%
especially in organizations where
we have a relatively highly educated

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.940
workforce and, you know, people
who are committed to be a part

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.460
of a larger organization --
it rarely shows up that way.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.490 position:56%
Something else is going on and it's
something that if we tell the truth,

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.530
each of us has experienced.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.930
I remember I was down
-- two years ago,

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.730
I was down at the Jackson
State University in Jackson,

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.180
Mississippi doing some work for
a couple of days with the deans

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.950
and the faculty members down there.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.590
And I had to fly from there to
New York City for another client

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.050
so I had to go through
Memphis, Tennessee.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.230
And I got to Memphis in
time for my last flight out.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.830
And as soon as I get through the
gate, the gate attendant comes on

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.890
and says, "Ladies and gentlemen,
there'll be a 45-minute delay."

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.890
And the words were barely out of
her mouth when this voice boos

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.470
out from behind, "You
talking to us, lady?"

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.330
And I turned around and
there's a guy sitting behind me

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.460
who I would best describe as
Santa Claus with an attitude.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.670
Older white guy, big white beard,
white hair, wearing overalls

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.660
and a flannel shirt with a
car magazine in his hand.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.540
Yeah, you're chuckling
like I did, you know.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.190
I kind of got him pegged, right?

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.020
So I went about my
business on my computer

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.480
until it was time to
get on the plane.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.780
It comes time to get on the plane.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.710
I get down to my seat and lo and
behold, who's sitting next to me

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.010
but angry Santa Claus [laughter].

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.310
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.690
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: So we did the nod.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.990
Travelers know what I mean.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.920
You know and you kind of sit down.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.850
We take off, go into
parallel plane mode.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.150
I'm working on my computer.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.280
He's reading his magazine.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.200
We fly for a couple of hours until
it's time to do the initial descent

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.460
to New York City so
I closed my computer.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.630
And travelers know this is
when airplane chat starts

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.710
because it's now safe to talk
to the person next to you.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.670
You're not going to get stuck
in a two-hour conversation

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.190 position:56%
with a lunatic, you know [laughter].

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.900
And so I turned to him and I say,
"So what takes you to New York?"

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.270
And he says, "I've got
a business meeting."

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.570
I said, "Really, what
are you doing?"

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.700
And he says, "I'm a radiologist."

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.350
So boom! There goes
that picture, you know.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.840
So now, I was sort of nonplussed
and a little embarrassed.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.620
And I said, "So what
kind of radiology?"

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.040
And he says, "Well, you
might be interested in this,"

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.020
because I was working on a deck
that I was going to be using

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.680
and he had clearly been, you
know, kind of catching glimpses.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.980
He said, "We're studying the brain.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.950
We're watching it on a functional
magnetic resonating image array

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.290
and we can actually determine
which parts of the brain responds

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.680
when people interact with
different kinds of people.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.150
Yeah, exactly so he's studying the
very thing I'm the most interested

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.450
in [laughter].

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.370
And had I not pegged him as angry
Santa the car mechanic and talked

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.670
to him a little bit earlier,

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.120
I probably would have saved
myself months of research

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.780
on my book, so [laughter].

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.070
So I say that because I'm
not here to talk about you.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.390
This is who we are as human
beings, every single one of us.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.030
Now we each have different
aspects that we respond to,

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:47.430
different kinds of
people we respond to.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.190
But this is fundamental to
who we are as human beings.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.730
And it's important for us to
recognize that because if we look

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.080
at the background through
which we've seen diversity

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.060
and inclusion work over a
period of time, it really comes

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.360
from a very different angle.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.680
I've been paid for doing this
work now for over 30 years.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.100
I go back to the times some
of you remember when the kind

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.390
of diversity workshops we did
were with the two-by-four.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.140
You know, you kind of beat
people over the head especially

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.660
if they look like this until at
some point they saw the error

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.960
of their ways.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.650
It was always very cathartic
if they cried [laughter].

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:18.010
And then -- and then -- and then
people would sort of you know,

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.340 position:56%
see the light and you would believe.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.990
But what I began to
notice was when we talked

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.970 position:56%
to those people a month later or two
months later, more times than not,

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.270
they would say, "Well,
that was fine.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.570
Just don't make me
ever do it again."

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:31.280
It was a recipe for getting people
to watch out what not to do,

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.070
to be careful what not to say but
it wasn't a recipe for inclusion.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.230
It wasn't a recipe
for truly engaging,

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.530
getting people to truly engage.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:40.730
In fact, sometimes, it
had the opposite effect.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.970
They had people be
even more tentative.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.270
You talk about race.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.570
I'm heading out of here because I
don't want to say the wrong thing

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.980
and get in trouble again.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.360
So if we look at that, we can kind
of see that there is a paradigm

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.110 position:56%
that we dealt with these issues of
diversity with for a long, long time

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.510
and it's this one -- this sort
of us versus them paradigm.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.330
And as soon as an issue comes
up, we immediately put ourselves

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.010
into a particular position
that we've already established.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.350
So if you think about something
like I know many people --

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.670
how many people remember
the incident that happened

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.240
with Skip Gates -- with the
Harvard history professor?

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.540
You remember the Beer Summit?

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.150
Right, so Professor Gates,

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.370 position:56%
one of America's most notable
historians -- he's African-American.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.200
He comes home from a trip to Asia.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.960
He comes to his front door
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.000
He's locked out so he breaks
a window so he can get in.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.300
Police officers show up.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.120 position:56%
Something happens and he's arrested.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.630
It becomes big -- you
know, big news.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.300
The next morning, there's
his picture

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.310 position:56%
of his mug shot on the morning news.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:39.000
How many of us when we heard that
story already knew what happened?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.300
You see what I mean?

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.660
Either we knew that
it was one more time

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.430
when it was a white police officer
treating an African-American

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.410
in a particular way or we knew,
if we were on the other side

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.010
of equation, one more time

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.810
when a public servant just
doing his job is called a racist

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.110
for no reason.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.950
Whatever it is, we choose
sides and this is the nature

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:56.620
of this us-versus-them dynamic.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.920
If you have any question
about this, by the way,

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.160
read the news this morning about
the president's speech last night.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.470
Or better yet, watch MSNBC and
Fox News and you will wonder

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.580
if you were watching the
same speech [laughter].

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.770 position:56%
Because most of the responses -- and
we have to acknowledge on all sides,

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.540
most of the responses we
were already ready for.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.390 position:56%
Those of us who, like the president,

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:19.940
were ready to agree
with what he said.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.780
Those of us who don't like
the president were ready

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.590
to have all the excuses because we
no longer look at issues and think

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.690
about the issues that
come to determinations.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.450
We come from our ideology
to those issues looking

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.300
for how we can be right.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.450
And if we're going to move forward
with this issue, we need to be able

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.290
to look at the whole
dynamic that's here --

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:41.140
because what gets produced is what
I call a conversational network

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.440
of contention.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.960
So this tension that we have
around talking about these issues

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.720
that makes it so painful and
frankly, for a lot of people,

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.950
so frightening to talk
about the issues.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.480
And that's the background to which
we've historically done diversity

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.160
and inclusion work.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.280
So when we look at it over a period
of time, we go back 30 to 40 years

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.670
when we -- when this movement
really took on in organizations --

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:07.500
mostly we were looking at coming
from a place of ignorance.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.600
You know, at the start, people
didn't know there were issues.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.230 position:56%
So we had [inaudible] from that into
compliance and affirmative action.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.570
So we have to stop things
that are happening badly.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.280 position:56%
Fix some things that happened badly.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.860
Get more people engaged
who have been left

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.570
out so hire representation.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.680
Make sure people don't discriminate
so we have laws to protect people

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.480
so that they're not
discriminated against.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.940 position:56%
And ultimately then get to this
place of what people call tolerance.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.300
Now I don't know about you but I've
never aspired just to be tolerated.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.370
So I've never particularly
liked that word.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.270
But the metaphor I use for
it is it's sort of like

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.010
in the old days before the wellness
movement hit back in the 1980s.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:46.890 position:56%
You would go to a doctor and the job
of the doctor was to get you unsick.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.510
And I mean very rarely in
the 1960s and the 1970s,

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.810
if you went to a doctor,
did they say,

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.110
"Tell me about your
exercise program.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.410
Tell me about what you're eating."

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.170
You know, they just didn't do that.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.470
That wasn't their job.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:58.770
You came in with an illness.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.070
They made you unsick.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.650
Then at some point, we realized
there's a whole another side

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.010
to the whole wellness continuum.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.640
And that is how can you actually
live a life that has you be well

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.220
like to exercise and to eat
well and to manage your stress

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.290
and all the things that we now
know are so important to us

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.090
and doctors now talk to us about?

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:17.430
Well, similarly, we found
out that this is only --

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.720
this part of the equation
only gets us representation.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.250
But what it doesn't do is help
us really engage with each other.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.130
How do we manage that diversity
so we know how it's affecting us?

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.220
And ultimately, how do we have full
inclusion and cultural competency?

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.550
And as a result of that, we can see
that despite all of our efforts,

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.800 position:56%
despite the millions of dollars that
have been spent and the, you know,

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.960
hundreds of thousands or
millions of people who have gone

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.660
through training programs or
the laws that have been passed.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:46.410 position:56%
We still have any number of examples
that we see on a daily basis

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.650
where people are treated
differentially based on race,

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.630
based on sexual orientation,
based on gender,

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.830
based on any number
of different things.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.550
Now we know, this has been a
subject of enormous research.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.850
How it is that the mind does this?

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.900
I want to share just a handful
of the literally 1200 studies

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.130
that have been done in the last 10
years alone on unconscious bias.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:08.330
So this one is a pretty
interesting one.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.110
Arin Reeves is a researcher
in Chicago.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:13.320
She went to groups of law firms
and she gave partners a memo

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.400
that was written by a man named
Thomas Meyer, they were told.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.590
It had 22 intentional errors
that were written into the memo.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.450
Half of the lawyers were told that
Thomas Meyer was white and half

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.120 position:56%
of them were told that he was black.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.520
When they were told that he was
white, they found on average --

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.140
or they rated it on
average 4.1 out of 5.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.640
They found on average
10.2 of the errors

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.070
and you can see some of
the things they said.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:36.370
He has potential.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.370
He has good analytical
skills, generally a good writer

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.280
but needs to work on some things.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.460
When they were told that
Thomas Meyer was black,

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:47.550
they found 40% more errors,
rated him a 3.2 instead of a 4.1

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:50.730
and this Thomas Meyer needs a
lot of work, average at best

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.800
and I can't believe he went to NYU.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.410
Nothing different about the resumes
except the race that they were told

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.290
of the name of the
person who wrote them.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:05.760
And this one at Columbia
University and NYU and Wharton,

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.850
they tracked emails and found that
women have 35% more emails ignored

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.710
and almost 60% more
meetings declined.

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.590
Now this one for me is
particularly interesting

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.480
because when we send
emails out into the world

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.830
and they don't get responded to,
none of know whether, you know,

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.600
it's because a person is
a terrible communicator

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.340
or whether they're just
not listening to us.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.600
We all know privately we
have a little pecking order

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.180
of emails, don't we?

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.480
You know, we have the emails.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.780
We'll get to them.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.080 position:56%
When we get to them and then we have
emails so we got to take a break

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.380
to see what's somebody's
sending us [laughter].

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.930
You know, the people
who are important to us?

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.610 position:56%
So when you look at these, these are
things that we would never know and

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.690
yet obviously has a huge impact
on people staying in the loop,

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.660
people getting engaged with
things, people being able

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.790
to have their work valued and
input, all these kinds of things.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.090
Accent is another one.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.620
Researchers at the
University of Chicago

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.210
and Tel-Aviv University found
that we believe people more

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.550
when they have accents
similar to ours and less

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.530
when they have accents
different than ours,

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.600
with one exception --
anybody want to guess?

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.900
&gt;&gt; British.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.200
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: That's
right, the British.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.500
That's right.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.800 position:56%
We think people with British accents
not only make better movie villains

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.100 position:56%
but they're also smarter [laughter].

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.730
One of our clients in
New York City has that.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.330
There's a guy who works
there from Liverpool

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.630
where the Beatles come from.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:16.370
And Liverpool is a very blue-collar
town so they speak a form

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.330
of Cockney there that is
called Scouse, I think.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:19.840
And I think that's the
way it's pronounced.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.250
And it's sort of a -- what he said,

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.450
he was told growing up,
it was gutter English.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:27.030
So he says, "Whenever I fly back
to visit my family in Liverpool

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.330
and then come back to the States,

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:32.890
I feel myself getting
smarter every mile I fly."

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.350
[Laughter] Weight is another one.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:37.110
Researchers of at least four
different universities have found

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.280
that doctors discriminated against
patients who were overweight.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.130
Spent less time with them,
less follow up on protocols,

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:48.030
in every way less patient service.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.750 position:56%
They also found -- other researchers
found at Johns Hopkins University,

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.460
the patients do the
same thing with doctors.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:55.370
That if a doctor is
overweight, they tend to listen

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:58.720
to the doctors' instructions less
and evaluate their treatment less.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.600
And then this is one I did.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.020
I have an artificial knee and so
every time I go through scanning

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:09.840 position:56%
like downstairs, you know, I have to
get -- you know, do the wand thing.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.500 position:56%
So right, what I began to notice
was I was in airports that it seemed

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.610
like I was going through slower
when I was in casual clothing

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.160
than when I was dressed
in a business suit.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.930
So it turns out, I did my own
study over a period of a year.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.500
And it turns out about 47% faster
when I'm different clothing.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.920
And most of us know
that this is true,

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.800
that appearance changes
the way we relate --

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.460
that we're related to whether it's
because of clothing or piercings

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.860
or tattoos or hairstyles or
age, any number of things.

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.220
And this is my new favorite.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:41.120
When this came out of the National
Academy of Sciences just last year,

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.280
they studied the 47 most damaging
hurricanes over the last 60 years

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.850
and they found -- to see
if there was any pattern

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:51.070
in the fatalities associated
with gender name of hurricanes.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.790
And they found that it turns
out that hurricanes named

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.900
after women kill roughly
twice as many people

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.810
as hurricanes named
after men [laughter].

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.920
Now lest you think this
has something to do

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.300
with hell hath no fury like
a woman scorned [laughter],

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.070
it's got nothing to do with that.

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:06.380
&gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not sure.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.780
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: What the
research [laughter] --

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.530
what the researchers found at the
National Academy of Sciences --

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.060
this is not some touchy-feely
organization --

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.170 position:56%
the reason is, believe it or not, is
because people take hurricanes named

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.890
after men more seriously and
therefore prepare for them more.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.480
Now how insane is that?

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.010 position:56%
Can you -- that's right, absolutely.

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.170
Can you imagine the conversation?

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.720
So Leslie comes up
to me and she says --

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.780
I just choose Leslie because
we're old friends and I said --

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.620
so she comes up to me and
she says, "Hey, Howard.

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.920
There's a hurricane coming!"

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.220
I said, "Really?

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.520
What its name?"

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.820
She says, "Hurricane Mary."

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.120
I say, "Oh, don't worry.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.420
It's a girl."

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.720 position:56%
[Laughter] This is how crazy we are.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.020
And I could go and I could
give you a list of studies

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.440
about virtually every
aspect of human identity.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.870
And we have a study that shows that
people are biased based on that.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.140
Now, you know, we're
laughing at this one

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.050
but obviously the same dynamic
occurs when a police officer walks

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.550
up to a young man in the
street and has a reaction

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:03.060
that this young man is more
dangerous than another young man.

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.580
I better pull my gun
out for this young man.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.510
I better be on high
alert for this young man.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.710
And this young man
ends up shot or dead.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:16.650
It shows up seriously when
somebody comes in for an interview

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.740
and I listen to them
just differently

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.040
than somebody else as
we saw in that video.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.340
They say the same things.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.640
They have the same kind of resume.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.260
They appear all the same
and yet for some reason,

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:30.240
this person resonates with me more.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.380
I feel more comfortable with them.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.680
I choose them.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.070
So all of this is happening
all the time around us.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.280
And, you know, what our
studies show is that very little

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.560
of it happens out of intention.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.730
I mean, there are people out
there who are hateful and hurtful.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.030
There's no question about it.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:49.110
But as my good friend Brett
Pelham who's a researcher

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.950
at the National Science
Foundation said, "At some --

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.310
at some level, all bias
is unconscious bias."

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.890 position:56%
Even the biases that we consciously
have now have been unconsciously fed

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.910
by the various things that we've
learned throughout our lives.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.610
We weren't conscious about it
when we were three years old

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.920
and that being a boy, if I
picked up my sister's doll

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.460
and my mom slapped me
on the hand and said,

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.020
"Only sissies play with dolls."

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.610
And all of a sudden,
that choice shows

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:19.280
up as homophobia 15 years later.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.580
So we want to look at this.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.900
And what I want to do is
look at with you a little bit

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.080
that behind a curtain, it
is why does this happen?

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.380
How does it happen?

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.660
And then ultimately I want to
leave you with some thoughts

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.930
about the things that we're
discovering we can do about this

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.490
because we do have something
to say about our biases.

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:38.930
We can't eliminate bias but we
can learn to navigate them better.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:41.020
We can learn to mitigate
the impact on our lives.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.570
And then I will save some time, by
the way, at the end for questions.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.000
So if you have questions, you want
to, you know, kind of make a note

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.300
of them or jot them down.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.600
I will save about 15
minutes hopefully

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.620
at the end so we can engage in it.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.330
But I'm actually willing
for any of you who would

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.690
like to stay along a little bit
later than one o'clock to try

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.760
to stick around for
a little bit longer.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.060
So let's start with this question.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.860
How much do we really know?

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:05.260
[ Music ]

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.570
&gt;&gt; Clearly, somebody in this
room murdered Lord Smythe

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:14.010
who at precisely 3:34 this
afternoon was brutally bludgeoned

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.020
to death with a blunt instrument.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:20.840
I want each of you to tell me your
whereabouts at precisely the time

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.000 position:56%
that this dastardly deed took place.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.250
&gt;&gt; I was polishing the
brass in the master bedroom.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:32.650
&gt;&gt; I was buttering his lordship's
scones below stairs, sir.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:36.110
&gt;&gt; I was planting my
petunias in the potting shed.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.750
&gt;&gt; Constable, arrest Lady Smythe!

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.510
&gt;&gt; But, but how did you know?

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.490
&gt;&gt; Madam, as any horticulturist
will tell you,

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.430
one does not plant
petunias until May is out.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:47.730
Take her away.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.030
&gt;&gt; Come on.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.720
&gt;&gt; It's just a matter
of observation.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.890
The real question is
how observant were you?

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.750
&gt;&gt; And action.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.950
&gt;&gt; Clearly, somebody in this
room murdered Lord Smythe,

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:11.540
who at precisely 3:34 this
afternoon was brutally bludgeoned

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.560
to death with a blunt instrument.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:18.360
I want each of you to tell me your
whereabouts at precisely the time

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.710 position:56%
that this dastardly deed took place.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:24.290
&gt;&gt; I was polishing the
brass in the master bedroom.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:30.180
&gt;&gt; I was buttering his lordship's
scones below stairs, sir.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.640
&gt;&gt; I was planting my
petunias in the potting shed.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.970
&gt;&gt; Constable, arrest Lady Smythe!

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.500
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: Now how many
of us have seen this happen?

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:02.330
This, by the way -- one of a series
of videos that they did in London

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.250
to make people more aware
of bicycle riders --

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.360
like the drivers to make
more bicycle riders.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.370
How many of you have been in
a meeting, something happens.

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.680
Some interaction between people
and you walk out and you're saying

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.200 position:56%
to yourself, "I can't believe that."

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.260
And somebody else says,
"What are you talking about?"

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.900
And has that -- had
that ever happened?

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.310
No. Well, it particularly
happens to, you know,

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.930
a particular group of people.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.230
We notice that people are listened

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:25.880
to differently depending
upon the group their in.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.710
Sometimes that's by status,
organizational status.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.690
We listen to management maybe
more than non-management.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.900
We listen to people from
our department differently

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.920
than we listen to people
from other departments.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.780
Sometimes, it's because
of an identity factor --

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:38.710
race, gender, something like that.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.950
We tend to value people more
without realizing it very much

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.250
like [inaudible] in that video.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.040
And yet when we look at these
pictures, we can see all

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:50.300
of these things are happening.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:55.060
All of these changes right in
front of our eyes and you knew

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.040
to be looking for something.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.950
It wasn't like something
just popped upon the screen.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.250
You know what we're
here to talk about.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:04.020
And you know I said, "Do we really
see the world like we think we do

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.360
and yet still we don't see it?"

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.660
This is occurring all the time.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.960
This is a phenomenon

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.420
that psychologists call
selective attention.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.160
And there's been a tremendous
amount of research around this.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.950
For example, there's a
researcher named Trafton Drew

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:20.280
at Harvard Medical School who sent
out a picture of a lung scanner.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.720
It was actually a lung scan that
he sent out to radiologists.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.890
He asked the radiologists
to look for cancer nodes

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.210 position:56%
which are very, very tiny obviously.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:30.750
Embedded in the lung
scan is a picture

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:35.180
of a gorilla 50 times the
size of a cancer node.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:39.340
Fifty times the size -- 83% of
the radiologists didn't see it.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.230
They were looking so
carefully for this

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.660
that they couldn't
see this [laughter].

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.520
Any of you have children
and asked them to go

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.160 position:56%
to the closet to look for something?

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.680
You know what I'm talking
about [laughter], right?

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.010
That's selective attention
at its best [laughter].

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.380
Now this doesn't only
impact how we see.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.700
It also impacts how we hear.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.730
So I'm going to do
another little experiment.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.030
Folks on this side of the room,

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:01.330
in just a moment I want
you to close your eyes.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.370
I'm not going to let them
take your stuff, don't worry.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.360
And folks over here, I want
you to watch the screen.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.450
I'm going to show you all a
five-second video and I'm going

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:09.120
to ask you what you hear, okay?

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.550
So close your eyes over here.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.580
Here we go.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.360
&gt;&gt; Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.000
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: Good,
open your eyes.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.060
So if you heard ba-ba,
please raise your hands.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.510
If you heard something like
da-da or ga-ga, raise your hands.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:29.870
Or a vowel sound, anything other
than ba-ba, raise your hands.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.100
Now how does that happen?

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.400
Very odd, right.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.700
I'm going to play it again.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.000
This time, you could open and
close your eyes at intervals.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.770
You'll actually hear it
change right before your eyes.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.070
&gt;&gt; Ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba.

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:43.370
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:46.530
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: Now aside
from being way cool,

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:48.540
what does this teach us [laughter]?

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.750
We actually hear with our
eyes more than we realize.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:54.320
In this case, it happens because
the video is of him saying ga-ga

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.810
but the voiceover is
of him saying ba-ba.

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.120
You actually hear what he
said with your eyes closed.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.490
Over here, the brain plays
a little trick on us.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.140
It has to deal with the dissonance
between what we're seeing

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.640
and what we're hearing so it
usually morphs into a D sound.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.220
For some people, a little bit
of an L or a little bit of a G.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.060
But the point is, it's a different
sound even though the sound that's

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.720
playing is the same.

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.470
Now this can happen in
lots of different ways.

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.930
For example, in many of us,
you've seen it happen this way.

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.190
Sorry, this is [inaudible].

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:27.050
&gt;&gt; We have got to cut
costs, people, ideas.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.830
&gt;&gt; Well, we could open
an account on fedex.com.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.110
&gt;&gt; We have got to cut
costs, people, ideas.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:36.550
&gt;&gt; Well, we could open an
account on fedex.com to save 10%

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:38.880
on online express shipping.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.410
&gt;&gt; Okay, how about this?

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.120
We open an account of fedex.com.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.830
We save 10% on online
express shipping.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.390
&gt;&gt; But you just said
the same thing I said.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.410
Only you did this.

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:54.710
&gt;&gt; No, I did this.

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:56.010
It makes all the difference.

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.310
&gt;&gt; Bingo!

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.610
&gt;&gt; That's good.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:59.910
&gt;&gt; That's right on the nose.

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:01.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:02.510
&gt;&gt; Really expressive ideas.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.810
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: There's something
nobody notices at 10 minutes later.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:05.110
It's a eureka moment when
the man does it, you know.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.680 position:56%
As my friend, Sukhvinder Singh Obhi,
a brain scientist at Canada says,

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.400
"Our brains seem to have evolved to
be good enough most of the time."

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.640
So we want to look at this a
little bit because this is really

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.790
at the core of what bias is.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:18.160
You know, how many of you when
you hear the word bias tend

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.400
to think of it in negative terms?

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.700
Can you hear it?

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.330
Yeah. In fact, bias is neither
inherently positive or negative.

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:29.000
It is simply a function of
the mind that's designed

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.440
to help us quickly chart how
to deal with a circumstance.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.950
And why would we have that
function, do you think?

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:39.470
&gt;&gt; Survival?

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:40.770
&gt;&gt; It's evolutionary.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:42.070
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: Yeah, for
survival, exactly right.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:44.820
Twenty thousand years ago, we see a
group of people by the waterhole --

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.350
we had to determine instantly
whether it was them or us.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.020
If we made the wrong
decision, we got killed.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.150
So as a result of that,
we have a tendency

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:52.540
to spot these things very quickly.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:56.290
Now we know from research
that we first spot race

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:58.460
because it's the most
visible identifier.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.350
Things like gender, we may be
more hard wired to see gender

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.440
because of course, times you
know, thousands of years ago,

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.450
we lived mostly with people
who are of the same race.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.910
Very rarely encountered
people of opposite races.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.410 position:56%
But nonetheless, we spot race first.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:14.490
And sometimes, this could
be very helpful to us

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:15.980
to spot a bias and
sometimes you can't.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.340
If I walk up to one of you with
a knife in my hand like this,

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.900
you don't look up and
say, "I wonder what it is

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.730
and it's going to do with it?"

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:23.030 position:56%
[Laughter] You know, you quickly get

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:24.400
into defensive mode
and it saves your life.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.450
We have a bias against that.

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:30.880
But obviously, when it involves
somebody on the street and a gun,

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.380
it can have horrible consequences.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.490
When it involves somebody
in a job interview,

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.060
it can have terrible
professional consequences.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.770
So the phenomenon could be
either positive or negative.

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:41.560
It can help or hurt us.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.890
But when we're not aware of it,
it has dangerous consequences.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:47.070
And by the way, what do you call
biases when you agree to them

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.370
and even write them all down?

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.880
That's all qualifications are.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.810
Now I'm not saying
qualifications are a bad thing.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:57.110
They're valuable.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.070
It makes it easier than having
to interview all of the tens

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:02.830
of thousands of people who probably
apply for jobs here, for example.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:04.840
You couldn't possibly
interview all of them.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.140
So we create qualifications.

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:08.180
So we say, for example,
college degree.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.520
So toss out Steve Jobs.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.820
Toss out Bill Gates.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.620
Toss out Mark Zuckerberg, you know.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.300
We have to be careful because when
we create these qualifications

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.720 position:56%
without realizing, we're also
limiting ourselves to see the people

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.020
who follow the most
traditional path.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.690
And there are lots of different
examples of how that shows up.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:25.960
But I want to talk for just a
moment about what we're discovering

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.930
about why the brain
functions in this way.

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.670
So if you imagine, we see something
in front of us, some person

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:36.390 position:56%
or circumstance and immediately,
what happens is and we know this now

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:37.690
because we can wire the brain

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:39.900
on functional magnetic
resonating imagery and we can see

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.560
which parts of the brain function.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.570
Now we needed to go to what Daniel
Kahneman, great psychologist,

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:46.820
Nobel Prize winner,
calls our fast brain.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.120
This is the limbic system.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.480
If I use my hand as a brain model,
imagine this is the profile.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.020
The limbic system is
in where my thumb --

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.740
actually, it would be
better if I had two thumbs

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.900
but that would be a
little weird [laughter].

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.370
That if I had -- that's
where the limbic system is.

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:02.220
The amygdala, the hippocampus,
the hypothalamus --

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:05.070
these are the parts of the brain
that quickly spot what's going on,

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.710
try to figure out very
quickly what it is.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:10.020
It's like going to a file cabinet
and decide what's the action to it.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.350
And so if I take this and
so -- is Bob, is that it?

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.810
Yeah, if I throw this at Bob,
he's not going to say, "Oh,

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:17.110
what happens when it gets here?"

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.760
You know, his hand will
shoot up instinctively.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.220
It's a protection mechanism.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.520
And it can save our lives.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.950 position:56%
You're driving in the morning and
the car stops short in front of you.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:26.340
You see those taillights going.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.430
You don't say to yourself,
"What's the best thing to do now?"

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:29.810
Or you'd be in their back seat.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.550
Your foot hits the brake before
you get a chance to think about it.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:36.240
This is where the heart of a lot
of our core stereotypes come from.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.680
Quick assessment to that person.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:42.240
Quick association -- put
myself into friend or foe mode.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.910
And we're particularly
sensitive to foe.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:46.810
We look first to eliminate
foe before we see friend.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:48.400
So we can see this
again in the brain.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.470
It takes about 20% more
brain energy, fluid,

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:53.900
et cetera to see something
friendly than it has

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.220
to see something negative
because the brain wants

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.230
to make sure it's safe before
it will allow things in.

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:02.470
And this is why, of course, the
instinctive reactions that happen

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.880
with people in tense
situations are really challenging

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.980
because what happens is the
amygdala, the basic fear center

00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.430
of the brain gets charged and
you have an amygdala hijacking.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:12.940
It takes over.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.700
Right now, we have a collective
amygdala hijacking happening

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.410
in our culture around Islamophobia.

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:23.710
People are reacting in ways that
are completely contrary to anything

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:27.090
that they would have
rationally thought or believed --

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:29.250
doing things that completely
inappropriate.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:33.620
I'm not talking now about political
ideologies and thoughtful processes

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.920
about what's the best
to handle this.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.310
I'm talking about that
fear reaction.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:41.840
When somebody comes into an
airport, gets on an airplane

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.900
and a woman with a hijab walks in.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.500
And somebody's looking
where she sits.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.800
That's the fear reaction.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.590
Most of us have felt those
at times and we're all --

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:51.890
we're even embarrassed by them.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:53.320
When we see it, we feel them
but we can't help it just

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.920
like I was embarrassed by my
reaction to angry Santa Claus.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.590
It wasn't like a reaction I chose.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.890
I was in -- my actions
had [inaudible].

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.820 position:56%
I said to myself afterwards, "You've
been doing this work for 30 years?"

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:07.090
I actually went to my first Civil
Rights meeting 50 years ago.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:09.050
How long do you take before
you get it out of your system?

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:11.280
But the truth is we don't
get it out of our system?

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.530
We do, however, have the capacity
for more thoughtful thinking,

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:15.830
at least in our slow brain,

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:18.640
in the prefrontal cortex,
this part of the brain.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.740
The red part in this
picture you see --

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.380
the most remarkable
part of the human brain,

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.550
four to five times larger than
any other animal per body size,

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:26.850
two to three times more active.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:30.090
It gives us the capability of
what we call metacognition,

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:32.330
the ability to watch
ourselves think.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:35.280 position:56%
This is where we have thoughts like,
"What made me think about that?"

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.670
Any of you who have done any kind
of personal development work,

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:40.260 position:56%
any kind of therapy work -- it's all

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:43.800
about developing the prefrontal
ability to watch ourselves.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.910
This is where we see, "Oh yeah,
I know my mother triggers me.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.220
Let me go take a breath
so that I don't react."

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.940
I know I'm about to wring my
kid's neck because once again,

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.380
their homework is a mess.

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.150
I take a breath and
I settle myself down.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:59.510
This is the part of the brain that
allows us to socialize ourselves

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:01.340
so that we're not just
reaction machines,

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.520
robots dealing with each other.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.750
And it's going on all the time.

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:07.490
All the time.

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:11.210
Now, how that shows up is
over the course of our lives,

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:13.430
we developed sort of an
internal book of rules.

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:16.000
So let's step back from
behind for just a minute.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.300
So if I walk up to [inaudible].

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.930
Now how did you learn to do that?

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:21.750
&gt;&gt; By socializing.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:23.050
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: Exactly.

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:24.350
This is the social cue
we had so [inaudible]?

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.650
&gt;&gt; Travis.

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:26.950
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: Travis.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:28.250
So how did the handshake
feel, Travis?

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:29.550
&gt;&gt; Yours?

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:30.850
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: Yeah.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.150
&gt;&gt; Light.

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:33.450
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: Yeah, light.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:34.750
So I shook Travis' hand much
softer than we normally do

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.050
in American business
environment which is more

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:38.630
like a wrestling match,
you know [laughter].

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:40.200
Your description was
actually pretty tame.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.050
Most people would say weak, fishy,
you know, all these comments.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:47.300 position:56%
But how many of us -- how many of us
have heard somebody say at one point

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.460
or another, "If somebody shakes
my hand like that at the beginning

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.760
of an interview, forget it.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.060
The interview's over."

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.990
Now think about how insane that is.

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:55.290
In about a third of the world,

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:56.910
that's the normal way
to shake hands.

00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:58.210
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:32:59.730
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: I could
have a disability.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:02.710
I could be recovering from
an injury or have an injury.

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:04.010
And yet, what are we looking for?

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:05.520
We're looking for the shortcuts.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.690
And so we learn this book of
rules throughout our lives.

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:10.140
You learn certain ways that
we're supposed to be and we --

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.440
and this creates a schema.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.310
It creates a frame of -- a brain
frames what we see and draws

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:20.530 position:56%
out that which we are interested in.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.800
So watch a shoe shine person in
the airport the next time you're

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.180 position:56%
in the airport or the train station.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.260
And as they're walking -- as
you're watching people walk

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.030
down the hallway, watch
what they're looking at.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:31.130
What do you think they're
looking at?

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:32.430
Shoes, exactly.

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:34.010
They're looking for the
person with dirty shoes

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.130
so they can say, "Do
you need a shine?"

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.460
If you ask them what they see,

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:40.410
you see three men, two
women and the child.

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:42.990
They see three loafers, two
Florsheims and a pair of sneakers.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.470
And they often wouldn't even
be able to tell you anything

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:47.820
about the person because they've
never looked above the knee.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.120
This is the way a schema works.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.420
Let me show you.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:51.720
Take a look at this picture and see

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.330
if you can identify anything
recognizable in this picture.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.970
Anybody see anything?

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.140
Yeah, what do you see?

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.440
&gt;&gt; I see a dog.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.740
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: A dog.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.040
Okay, anybody else?

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.340
&gt;&gt; A cow.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.640
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: A cow, okay.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.940
Somebody saw the cow.

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:10.240
Well, let me make it -- there
is a cow in the picture.

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.540
I'll make it easier for you.

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.840
I'll superimpose it.

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.140
Okay, so can everybody see
the cow now [laughter]?

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:15.440
Yeah, yeah.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:20.010
Okay, so every -- so everybody --
anybody who doesn't see the cow?

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:21.320
Okay, let me quickly
point it out here.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.420
In here's -- okay, right.

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.720
Excuse me.

00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:27.020
Now I'm going to remove these
-- oh, the superimposed picture.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.610
Go back to the original
and tell me now

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:31.100
if you could avoid seeing the cow.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.680
Right? The thing that was
invisible just a moment ago --

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.470
now, you can't not see.

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:37.900
If I came in next week,
immediately you would see the cow

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.810
because your schema has changed.

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:42.610
Now, if schema can be impacted
by something like shiny shoes

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:46.240
or a silly game like this, how can
it not be impacted by these bodies,

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:48.730
these identities we
have our lives in?

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:52.990 position:56%
Now as men, we see a different world
than women -- as people of color,

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:55.470 position:56%
a different world than white people.

00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:57.910
Because our schema impacts

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:59.410
that which we see and
that which we don't.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:01.520
And so we're sensitive
to certain things.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.190
We're alert about certain things.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:05.880
We're looking for certain
things or completely oblivious

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.980
to certain things which is why
it's so frustrating sometimes

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.280
to have these conversations.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.920
"Why are you making such
a big deal out of that?"

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.220
somebody will say.

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:14.770
Because it happens to me every day.

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:18.920
You're just not seeing it --
particularly the micro behaviors.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:22.370
Now we sometimes call them micro
inequities, micro advantages.

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:24.620
Some people are using the term
micro aggressions these days.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.270
The little things that
have an impact

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:29.020
but don't seem very big
in and of themselves.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.520
You know, if somebody
walks up to you

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.270
and you give them your full
attention versus another person

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:34.570
who walks up to you
and you tell them

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:37.430
to go ahead while you're
multitasking on your phone.

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:38.870
By the way, how many
people here pride yourselves

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:40.270
at being multitaskers?

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:41.920
Anybody else besides me?

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:43.450
You know there's bad news, right?

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:44.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah [laughter].

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.050
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: We can't.

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:47.350
The brain doesn't multitask.

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:48.650
I mean, it can if you're
doing some kind

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.410
of a mindless activity
like a repetitive task.

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:52.810
Like if you're -- if you knit and
you've been knitting for years,

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:55.290
your hands knit by themselves
or something like that.

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:57.820
But mostly, what we call
multitasking is serial tasking.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.120
We're looking at this, this, this.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.800 position:56%
We're kind of going like this which
is why when we're in those meetings,

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.890
they say, for everybody sitting
at the meeting like this looking

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:05.840
at their phones as if nobody knows
what they're doing [laughter]?

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.510
And then you walk out of the room.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:08.860
What's the first thing
they usually say?

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:10.990
What did they say about
that [laughter]?

00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:13.910
Because we only see about 70%.

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:15.840
So schema gives us a
particular background

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:21.420
and the background frames what we
see and becomes self-fulfilling.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.840
We gather information to support
our already point of view.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.250
This is what we were
seeing this morning

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.340
with the pundits looking
at the speech.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:30.170
I already believe that
the president is good.

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:31.880
I already believe the
president is bad.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.320
Therefore, I'll cherry pick the
speech and take out the points

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.450
that prove my point and ignore
the things that maybe iffy.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:41.550
And I'll make that case or even
sometimes take the same piece

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:44.060
of data and use it for two
completely different purposes.

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.550
And we do this with
people, of course.

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.970
Yeah, somebody who you
like who works with you

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:50.040
and they screw some
things up and you know,

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.010
their excuses make a lot of sense.

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:53.310
Somebody you don't like so much,

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:56.020
it's just one more
excuse [laughter].

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.380 position:56%
And this is effective and I say
that definitively because as I said,

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.540
we have over a thousand
studies in 10 years alone.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.670 position:56%
It is affected by people's identity.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:10.260
It's affected by who that person
is and what that person is.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.350
Now, so that background
becomes self-reinforcing.

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:14.720
Now just to give you a
sense of the comparison,

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:18.000
if the slow brain capacity
is roughly the size

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.200
of a gallon milk jug, the fast
brain is like the Milky Way.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.240
Literally hundreds of thousands
of times more fast brain reactions

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.360
than slow brain reactions.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.250
We are robots basically
walking around pretending

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:30.800
like we're sentient beings.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:35.460
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: Now ironically,
it's only when we accept

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:36.760
that about ourselves

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.930
that we actually have the
opportunity for consciousness.

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:43.120
When we realize how automatic
we are and we begin watching it,

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.130
then we have an opportunity
to disengage it at times.

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:48.540
Otherwise, we go around
making stuff up about people.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.630
So I want you to imagine
for a minute.

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:52.300
You've got a son or a daughter.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.220
You've got a son or a
daughter and they call you

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.970
and they say, "Mom,
Dad, I'm in love.

00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:58.810
I found the guy of my dreams.

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:02.220
He's the one and I can't wait to
bring him home at Thanksgiving

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.770
and introduce him to you."

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:05.440 position:56%
Well, you're kind of anxious, right?

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:06.740
You want to see this guy.

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.100
So you go on their Facebook page

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.790
or whatever social media
you tend to prefer.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:14.550
And you see pictures of them with
two men -- this one or this one.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:16.350
Who are you hoping for?

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:19.130
[ Laughter ]

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.870
Right? Well, as it turns out,
this guy is John Fetterman.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.480 position:56%
He's the mayor of Braddock,
Pennsylvania, a candidate for Senate

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.080
in the State of Pennsylvania
right now.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.420
A master's degree in
public policy from Harvard.

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.470
Served in AmeriCorps and got
international media attention

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:36.100
for the amazing way he transformed
the old steel town that Braddock is

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.120
and he turned it into
a thriving community.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.970
He actually works with
other communities

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:41.270
to help them do the same thing.

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:42.580
Amazing guy if it's [inaudible].

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.510
This is Ted Bundy,
the serial killer.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:49.160
[ Laughter ]

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.950
And yet, we do this with
people all the time.

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:52.250
We spot people all the time.

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:54.180
We make stuff up about them.

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.270
You know, if you look around
the room for a minute.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:58.440
Just let your eyes, don't let
it settle on any but just look

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.740
around the room for
a second [laughter].

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:01.580
And see what you make up
about who's the smart one,

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.260
who's the one that's
not so smart, you know.

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:05.820
Who's the one who's in the
leadership position or not?

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.650
Who's the one who looks
friendly or not so friendly?

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:11.560
Who's the one who looks
scared or not so scared?

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:12.860
This is what we do with people.

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:14.720
We make these assessments
and then we act

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.220
in accordance with
those assessments.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.210
And it's not only individual,
by the way.

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:22.230
It shows up in social groups too.

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:23.820 position:56%
In fact, we're much more influenced.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.110
What we're learning is we're much
more influenced by the groups

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:29.350
that we belong to than we
ever even thought possible.

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:31.290
Now most of us have heard
of Maslow's hierarchy.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:35.100
Abraham Maslow created
this model in 1943,

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.130
core foundation model
of modern psychology.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.870
Maslow said that there are
certain things that needs

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:42.170
that are more important
than other needs.

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:44.350
And you got to get your
physiological needs met then safety

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:46.970
and then we worry about
belongingness on up the chain.

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:49.250
It turns out that we're
discovering Maslow was wrong.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:52.420
That belongingness is
actually the key human need.

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.230
And it makes sense
if we think about it

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:59.100
because what's the most vulnerable
time of a human being's existence?

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.400
Infancy, right?

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.570
The first two years of our lives,
we can't exist unless somebody --

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:05.940
unless we belong to somebody.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.240
We literally will die.

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:10.810
Our first imprint is I exist
because he or she exists,

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.960
whoever our primary caretaker is.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.590
And in fact, we know
that being excluded

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:17.550
from a group triggers
activity in the same regions

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:19.270
of the brain associated
with physical pain

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:23.790
which is why every time one of
these terrible incidents happen,

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:27.530
Sandy Hook, Columbine, Charleston,

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:30.000
what's the first word you
almost always hear used

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.630
to describe the individual?

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:32.930
&gt;&gt; Loner.

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:34.230
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: Loner,
almost every time, right?

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:35.530
And it also contributes to
the fact that four times

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:38.170
as many gay teenagers commit
suicide because that same sense

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:42.470
of loneliness gets internalized,
even sometimes separating them

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:46.010
from their own -- separating
somebody from their own family.

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:49.070
But the behavior also leads -- this
phenomenon also leads to behavior

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:51.370
that sometimes it's
just downright funny.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:59.010
&gt;&gt; The gentleman in the
elevator now is a candid star.

00:40:59.010 --> 00:41:01.530
These folks who are entering --
the man with the white shirt,

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:05.040
the lady with the trench coat
and subsequently one other member

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:12.640
of my staff will face the rear
and you'll see how this man

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.510
and the trench coat woman --

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:20.710
[ Laughter ]

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:24.230
-- tried to maintain his
individuality [laughter].

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:26.510
And little by little --

00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:32.160
[ Laughter ]

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.540
-- he looks at his watch but
he's really making an excuse

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:41.020
for turning just a little bit
more [laughter] to the wall.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.810
Now we try it once again.

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:45.470
Here's the candid subject.

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:47.740
Here comes the Candid Camera staff.

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:50.630
Three of them at least [laughter].

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:55.510
And this man hasn't apparently
been in groups before.

00:41:55.510 --> 00:42:07.200
[ Laughter ]

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.750
&gt;&gt; Howard Ross: We don't
do the same thing, right.

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:11.120
I mean, how many times have
you gone out in the evening?

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.420
[Inaudible] anything
to drink tonight

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:13.780
so everybody else orders
a glass of wine.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:15.920
And now, what the heck,
I'll have it, you know.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.250
Or more importantly, you come
into a calibration meeting.

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:19.550
You're evaluating an employee

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:22.270
and there are five of
you in the meeting.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:24.490
And you come in really
high on the employee.

00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:25.880
You're very positive about them.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.490
But before you get to weigh in,
the other four people trash him

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:31.840
to all the terrible things about
this employee, why they're no good.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.180
Then they say, "What do you think?"

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.060
And all of a sudden, you notice
you're a little bit more hesitant

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.840
with your praise, a little bit more
muted, if you even give it at all.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.710 position:56%
There's part of us that wants to go
along with the crowd and this is one

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:43.890
of the reasons why
workplace environments --

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:45.880
doing this work in
workplace environments can be

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.220
so valuable when it's done well.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.520
Because you begin to
create a culture

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.770
in which people are supported
in making more conscious choice

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.280
and in thinking more carefully

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:56.490
about the decisions
they make around people.

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:57.790
But there is good news.

00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:00.450
I promised you I will leave you
with some of the things we can do

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:03.030
about this because you
know, at this point,

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:04.920
a lot of times people are saying,
"Great, now you convinced me

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:09.810
that I can't believe anything I
think and I got biases about people

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:11.110
that I'm not even aware of.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:12.600
Thank you very much
for that, right."

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.240
But there is good news and that is
that in fact, that there are ways

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:20.050
that we can consciously develop
the ability to be more mindful

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:22.110
of our decision-making,
be more thoughtful

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:23.810
about the things that influence us.

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:26.100
We've identified six
things in particular

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.610
because the unconscious
mind is quite malleable.

00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:30.040
We've got a remarkable capacity

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.160
for what we call neuroplasticity
to rewire our brains.

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:35.420
The notion is that you can't teach
an old dog new tricks isn't even

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:36.720
true for dogs.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.160
We're always learning new things.

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.560
I remember when my
stepfather who passed away

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.260
about a year-and-a-half ago now.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:47.560
He was 83 when he learned
to use the internet.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.600
And it was life altering for
him because now he could shop

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.090
for himself even though, you know,
he couldn't drive himself anymore.

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:57.400
He could send notes to
people and receive them.

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:00.900
I even taught him to Skype
so that he could, you know,

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.290
we could talk to him face-to-face.

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:05.270
It was life altering and at 83
years old, he learned to do it.

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:07.420
But he wasn't a techno
-- a technical guy.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.790
It's just that you know, we
learn new things all the time.

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:14.130
So six ways -- the first is
by far, the most important.

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:16.440
And that is to recognize and
accept that we have bias.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.420
That it's foundational to
have it as we see the world.

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.920 position:56%
The question is not do we have bias?

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.630
The question is which are ours?

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:23.290
And every single person
in this room,

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:25.110
if you tell the truth, knows this.

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:26.930
We know that there are
certain people who are inclined

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:28.230
to like more than others.

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:30.450
We know that we go into that
party where there's nobody there

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:32.680
who we know and we make
a quick mental decision

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.480
as to who's the person we're
going to go up to talk to --

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:37.010
based on who looks
safer or more welcoming.

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:38.310
Based on what?

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:41.150
Who has looked safer, more
welcoming like that before?

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:43.260
We project onto that
circumstance what we've learned

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:45.410
in the past from our book of rules.

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:48.490 position:56%
And the metaphor I like to use for
this is it's kind of like the clutch

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:51.370
in a standard transmission
automobile for those of you

00:44:51.370 --> 00:44:53.850
who even remember standard
transmission automobiles.

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:56.760
When you step on the clutch,
the motor doesn't stop running.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.060
The motor is still running.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.430
It just disengaged
from running the car.

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:03.900
Similarly if I say to myself,
"Okay, I have a bias about this.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:06.140
I better be careful about this."

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.340
When I've been talking or
interacting with that person,

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:09.640
I have a chance to separate.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.280
I give an example for myself.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.670
I had a young man come in to
do an interview a few years ago

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:16.260
for an administrative
position at our company.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.750
And I've been a professional
musician for probably 30 years.

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:20.050
I don't do it so much anymore,

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:22.060
but for about 30 years
I played in bands.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.360
And so I looked at his resume

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.730
and it says Berkeley School
of Music for two years.

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:28.350
And immediately my
whole body leaned in.

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:29.650
What do you play?

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:30.950
What kind of music do you play?

00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:33.700
And then, you know, because I
happened to catch it this time.

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.110
Like I said, I missed it
with the guy in the airplane.

00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:37.420
But this time, I happened
to catch it.

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:38.720
I said, "Wait a second.

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.070
You're not interviewing
a bass player.

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:41.670
You're interviewing an
administrative person."

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:43.100
So I actually said to
him, "You know what?

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:44.620
Let's hold off on that
conversation for now.

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.270
Maybe we'll talk about
that after the interview."

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:49.140
Come back to do the interview.

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:50.930
Now I'm not saying it would
have been perfect necessarily.

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:52.320
That it still might
not have influenced me

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.270
but I had a far greater chance than
what would have normally happened

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:57.890
if I was unconscious, which is I
would have spent 45 minutes talking

00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:59.640
with him about music and
then I would have said,

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.130
"Now let me ask you these
questions so that I can hire you."

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:05.790
[Laughter] Because I already
heard his bass playing behind my

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:07.090
guitar [laughter].

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:08.810
The second, in order to do that,

00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:11.000
we have to develop the
capacity to observe ourselves.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.970
The metaphor that I like to use is
to put a flashlight on ourselves.

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:16.470
To watch ourselves in action.

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:18.270
Mostly the way we relate
to the world is we look

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:21.030
at what's going on out there.

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:22.670
And we figure out why we're --

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:24.570
why the thing out there
is causing us trouble.

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:26.100
We have very little
attention on what --

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.150
how are we responding
to what's up there?

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:29.450
What is that triggering in us?

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:31.140
Who is that person reminding us of?

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:33.260
Are there certain circumstances
where we notice

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:36.200
that we get charged
more than others?

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.750
Now that's where we begin to see
ourselves in action and that's

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:42.740
where we begin to shift
ourselves in action.

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.810 position:56%
Now my wife, one morning says to me,

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:47.110
"Would you mind taking
out the trash?"

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:48.420
Now I have no problem
taking out the trash.

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:50.870
I even do it myself
sometimes, you know.

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:53.460
But for some reason,
I just got irritated

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:56.650
and I didn't even know why,
you know, at the moment.

00:46:56.650 --> 00:46:57.950
And then I stopped for a second.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:59.250
I looked and I said,
"Why am I irritated?"

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:00.550
And then I realized.

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:04.970
At that moment I saw -- I was seven
years old and she was my mother.

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:07.780
My mother and I used to have
righteous battles over the trash.

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.640
Some of you remember those
kinds of things or have them

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:10.940
with your own children, right?

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:15.220
And at that moment, something about
the way she said it or something

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:18.030
about that circumstance reminded
me of my mother giving me stuff

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:19.830
about not taking out the trash.

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:21.130
And so I left.

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:22.430
I said, "Sure, Mom.

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:23.730
I'll take it out."

00:47:23.730 --> 00:47:25.030
And given that we -- we
both do this work together.

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:26.710
She knew exactly what I meant and
laughed and that was the end of it.

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:28.670
There's something liberating
about this.

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.790
In order to do this, the
third thing is we have

00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:33.630
to practice what I call
constructive uncertainty.

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:36.970
Turn some of our exclamation
points into question marks.

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:41.920
Is that person really that way or
might I be seeing them that way?

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:45.970
That's a huge distinction.

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:49.760
And one of the ways we do this
is by slowing ourselves down.

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.060
The breath is really valuable.

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:53.020
I've been working with
police officers around this.

00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.080
And one of the things I'm
teaching them is to use the breath

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.120
when they're on to
emergent crime scenes.

00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.360
If you just simply do
some deep breathing,

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.850
it slows down the process
a little bit.

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:05.450
It doesn't put them -- so I'm
not talking about just sitting

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:08.880
in cross positions saying
"Om," or anything like that.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.480
I'm just talking about -- the
reason it happens, by the way,

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.180
there's a physiological
reason for this.

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:16.940
That the part of your brain
that you need to use in order

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:18.870
to consciously slow
down your breathing,

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:21.420 position:56%
to deepen your breathing -- when you
say, "Okay, take a deeper breath,"

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.550
is your prefrontal cortex.

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:26.040
You go out of your limbic
system when you do that

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.190
and your prefrontal area
now is what's in charge.

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:32.260
The prefrontal area is the
slower part of your brain.

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:36.790 position:56%
They may get to the emergent crime
scene and for a split second longer,

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:39.160
wait before they pull that trigger.

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:42.590
For a split second longer,
consider what they're doing.

00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:45.180
Because you know, I have tremendous
-- I want to make it really clear,

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:46.480
I have tremendous compassion

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.020
for what police officers
have to deal with as well.

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.450
You put yourself in the situation
where in moments you have

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:52.940
to make a decision like to
cost somebody else their life.

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:54.980
It could cost you your career.

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.590 position:56%
You could be the next public pariah.

00:48:57.590 --> 00:49:00.270
And yet, if you wait too
long, you could be killed.

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:04.570 position:56%
I mean, I don't know anybody here
but I'm not signing up for that job.

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:08.060
But at the same time, we know the
consequences of it not going well.

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:09.770
So we're trying to
teach people to be able

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:11.070
to be more conscious about that.

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:13.380
Rollo May, a great psychologist
said, "Freedom is the capacity

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:15.980
to pause between stimulus
and response."

00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.750
Another one that we found that
really makes a difference is

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:22.280
to engage with others and expose
yourself to counter stereotypes.

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:24.220
In other words, positive
examples of people

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.530
who normally have negative
stereotypes around.

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.680
So pictures on the
wall make a difference.

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.800
Things like Black History
Month still matter

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:34.760
because they give us
positive stereotypes.

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.140
Now it would be a lot better

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:39.620
if the other 11 months were White
History Month and if we didn't,

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:44.310
you know -- if we didn't
continually reinforce that,

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:45.930
if we really embedded it more.

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:47.980
But nonetheless, these kinds
of things really matter

00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:50.120
because they give us
those counter stereotypes.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.660
Spending time with
people makes a difference.

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:56.290
Meeting people from other cultures,
identities, races, racial groups,

00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:58.040
sexual orientation
makes the difference.

00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.690
You know, in a sad way, you know,

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:02.470
one of the things we're
finding that's in the research

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:05.680
that behind the acceleration
of rights

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:11.540
for LGBT people today
ironically was the AIDS epidemic.

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:13.980
Because what did the
AIDS epidemic do?

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:16.780
It made it obvious that certain
people who people loved too

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.970
in their family, all of a sudden,

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:21.290
their sexual orientation
became more apparent.

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:25.630
We never knew Rock Hudson
was gay until he got AIDS.

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:27.760
That's not to suggest, by the
way, that all people have AIDS.

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.060
We know that they're not.

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:31.500
But the point is in the early
days, that it had that impact.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:34.440
Now, for one thing to not
like those gay people,

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.460
it's another thing entirely
to not like my son Bobby,

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:42.340
or my cousin Johnny, or
my sister-in-law Sally.

00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.190
When it becomes personal,
it's very different.

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:48.280
And then the last one is to
establish ways to get feedback,

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.030
to create relationships so people
can come up to us and say, "Look,

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:52.520
you may not have intended
anything about this

00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.460
but let me tell you how
your behavior affected me."

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.440
Now for those of us who are in
power in leadership positions,

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.520
it's critically important
that we recognize that we have

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.910
to set the tone for that.

00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:03.070
We have to be the ones who put
ourselves out there and be open

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:06.840
to feedback because otherwise
people project all of their --

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.700
you know, authority
figures from their lives.

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.350
If you had a father who didn't
like feedback from you --

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:14.490
or very few fathers do, I
find, you know [laughter].

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:18.060
I'm speaking as somebody with
four children [laughter].

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:20.760
Then you may be hesitant
even if the boss says, "Sure,

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:23.250
tell me what you're thinking,"
because what we tack on to the end

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:26.180
of that sentence is even if it
costs you your job, you know.

00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:28.320
But creating a flow back and forth

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:31.140
where we can give each other
feedback actually creates a way

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:33.420
for us to see ourselves
in other people's eyes.

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:36.340
And it could be incredibly
valuable in this process.

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:39.620
Now I want to spend just the last
minute or two talking about systems

00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:41.760
because you're working in
an organization and we know

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.060
that we can change systems.

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:45.000
In 1970, 5% of the musicians

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.200
in the major orchestras
in the world were women.

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:49.210
In 1980, there was only 12.

00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:51.470
Still only 12% even after 15 years

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:56.020
of modern women's movement
-- the resurgence of it.

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:57.570
The number is now over 40%.

00:51:57.570 --> 00:51:58.870
What happened?

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:02.420
They put in a whole range
of structures and systems

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.540
that changed the way
they did auditions.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:07.800
The first one was they began to
advertise for auditions rather

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.300
than simply to invite
people to them.

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:12.430
It used to be the conductor would
say, "Get the second chair violin

00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:14.750
for Philadelphia to
come and audition."

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:17.550
Now what they do is ask or
advertise them in trade magazines

00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:19.550
so people can show up and audition.

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:20.940
The second thing they
did is they started

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:22.820
to use panels rather
than individuals.

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.140
The conductor used to make
the choice individually.

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:27.490
Now what they do is they
have panels of people

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:29.080
so that you have different
points of view

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.610
and the more diverse
the panel, the better.

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:33.200
So you can get different
points of view, you know,

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.700
what did we think rather
than what did I think?

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:37.380
And the most important
thing they did was

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:40.090
that they changed the fundamental
structure of the audition itself.

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:44.090
They began to have people
audition behind screens and walking

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:47.760
out on rugs so that people could
no longer see the musician.

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:51.270
They could no longer hear
the shoes of the musician.

00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:52.830
All they could hear was the music.

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:54.320
This was, by the way, for
those of you who are fans.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:58.140
This is where <i>The
Voice </i>came from on TV.

00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:00.650
And what they found was it
fundamentally changed the way

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:01.950
to music.

00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:03.250
So when you're changing a system,

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:04.550
it's not enough just
to do individual work.

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:07.320
Yes, we want to look at education
because education is important.

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:08.900
And we're not talking about
a quick talk like this.

00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:11.570
I'm talking about actually spending
some time understanding these

00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:14.170
dynamics and how we
respond to these dynamics.

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:16.820
The second is to create
priming techniques because even

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:18.870
if you have the best
training program in the world,

00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:21.210
if you don't do a performance
review until four months from now,

00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:22.640
how much are you going to remember?

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.110
So you might have a
little tool that you use.

00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:26.870
We call them performance
support tools.

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:29.170
Before I do a performance
review, I take two minutes

00:53:29.170 --> 00:53:31.670
to watch this little video clip
or I read this sheet of paper.

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:35.140 position:56%
I answer these questions so that I'm
reminded to pay attention to some

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.220
of the dynamics that might show
up in the performance review.

00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:40.320
It makes a huge difference.

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:41.620
The third -- whoops.

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:43.810
The third one is to change some
of our systems and structures

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:45.720
like do we interview
people in the same way?

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.020
Maybe we will shift
that a little bit.

00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:51.010
Maybe we have panel interviews
rather than individual interviews.

00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:53.510
Maybe we send the interview
questions out to people a couple

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:56.670
of days early because that balances
out English as a second language

00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:58.990 position:56%
or introversion versus extroversion.

00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:01.090
You know, maybe we'd be sure
that we interview people

00:54:01.090 --> 00:54:02.460
on all the same circumstances

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:04.250
because you interview
one person fresh

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:05.980
when you're nine o'clock
in your office.

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.540
The second person in the cafeteria
at noon and the third person

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:11.350
over Skype -- you're conducting
three different interviews.

00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:13.700
Now so there are things that we
can do structurally to change that.

00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:16.360
Actually for those of you who buy
the book, in the appendix there,

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:19.240
I have 16 pages of ideas
for those kinds of things.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.540
And then finally, we need

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:23.550
to establish a system
of accountability.

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:26.090
We need to keep track of
these things at every stage

00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:28.800
because what we notice is
by the time we usually --

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:32.110
for most people and most
organizations, we have one metric

00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:34.830
for diversity which
is how many are there.

00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:36.220 position:56%
But if we really look at the system,

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:37.670
we see well how many
applied for jobs?

00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:39.270
How many were offered jobs?

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:40.570
How many accepted jobs?

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:42.080
Now how many are successful
after six months?

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:45.350
We could begin to see when the
breakdown in the system happens.

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:47.950
So there are things
we can do about this.

00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:49.250
Yes, it exists.

00:54:49.250 --> 00:54:50.780
It's inevitability for human
beings but there are things

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:52.080
that we could do about it.

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:53.380
And I'd like to end
with this picture.

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:55.180
This is a picture of an
Aspen forest in Colorado,

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:58.190
because at the essence
this is what I'm learning

00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:59.820
about who we are as human beings.

00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.210
You know, we look at these forests.

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:02.850
Some of you, I'm sure, have
seen them if you travel

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:04.150
to that part of the country.

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:05.450
And they're majestic.

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:06.920
Thousands of acres of these
ramrod straight trees.

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.750
They go up 80 to 100
feet tall, incredible.

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:12.170
Do you know the interesting
thing about the Aspen trees?

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:14.070 position:56%
They're not individual trees at all.

00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:18.150
The Aspen forest has the largest
intact organisms in the world.

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:20.700
They're connected by
common root systems.

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:24.210
The way they grow is that one
tree [inaudible] around another

00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:25.780 position:56%
and another and another and another.

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:29.590
The largest one in Northern
Utah has 80,000 trees.

00:55:29.590 --> 00:55:31.480
It's one plant.

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.270
One plant.

00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:36.070
For me, it's a perfect metaphor
for who we are as human beings.

00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:38.310
We act like we're each
different but in reality,

00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:41.060
when we understand
our psychomechanisms,

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:44.190
the way we think -- we're actually
more similar than we think we are.

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:46.110
We check different material,
different life stories

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:50.160
that we process differently
but we actually process --

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:53.250
excuse me, different content to
process but we actually process

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:55.060
that information very
much the same way.

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.360
And if we can really get that,

00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:58.900
then instead of saying,
"Why are you that way?"

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:02.740
We could say, "Why
are you that way?"

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:05.210
So there's a difference
between fear and curiosity.

00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:08.240
And that conversation we
can create environments

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:10.340
in which everybody can thrive.

00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:12.140
Thank you.

00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:15.710
[ Applause ]

00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:19.350

of the Library of Congress.
