00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.669
- Thank you very much, Judy,
for the kind introduction.

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:12.460
I'd of course like to
take this opportunity

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.060
to thank Judy and Liz
and the entire staff

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.000
here at Radcliffe for
this wonderful opportunity

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.240
to be a part of such a
fantastic community of scholars

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.930
and artists and writers
of this-- it's really

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.150
been wonderful for me
and for my project,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.082
I especially appreciate
the congenial tone of all

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:32.790
of our discussions in
this forum and also

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.760
in our private seminars.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.125
Thank you very much for that.

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:44.040
I've had a lot of discussions
with some of the fellows

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.300
here are some of the colleagues
during this initial time here,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.650
and I get the sense a number
of you have been a little bit

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.410
traumatized by Hegel due to
some experience you've had

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.350
as an undergraduate, perhaps.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.550
And I understand
that sense of trauma.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.750
I want to ask you today to bear
with me for just a little bit

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.160
here, and see if I can present
to you a picture of Hegel which

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.670
is perhaps a bit more
intelligible and a bit more

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.430
interesting, perhaps a bit
more compelling than the one

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.630
that you were
presented with before.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.080
So if I enjoin you just
to put aside for a moment

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.400
whatever bad memories
you might have

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.690
or whatever picture
of Hegel you might

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.110
have had in your mind
up until now, let's

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.560
see if we can start over again.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.760
During Hegel's tenure
in Berlin from 1818

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.140
till his death in 1831, he
delivered his lecture course

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.190
on the philosophy of
religion four times,

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.410
in 1821, 1824, 1827, and 1831.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.450
In these lectures,
Hegel's ostensibly

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.130
trying to make a case for the
truth of Christianity, which

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.710
is more or less what we would
expect from somebody who's

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.760
a professor at the
main university

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.340
in Prussia during the 1820s.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.040
It makes perfect sense.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.700
I think we have to recall that
during this time in the kingdom

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.000
of Prussia, there didn't
exist freedom of religion

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.410
as we know it today.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.890
It was straightforwardly
illegal to call into question

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.710
any of the key points
of Christian dogma.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.280
And Hegel had seen some of his
own colleagues unceremoniously

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.770
fired for having appeared to
have done things of that sort.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.990
Everything that Hegel
published during this time,

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.870
he had to submit to the Prussian
censors for their approval

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.400
first.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.220
So sometimes Hegel's
often caricatured

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.170
as a prototypical
Prussian philosopher who's

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.240
writing a defense of
the Prussian state,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.220
but this is a complete
misunderstanding.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.230
This is one of the
many Hegel myths

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.830
that one will find sometimes
in the secondary literature.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.460
Hegel himself was
not a Prussian.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.000
He was born in Stuttgart.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.414
He came from the Duchy of
Wurttemberg which at that time

00:02:58.414 --> 00:03:00.330
was, of course, a
completely different country

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.610
with its own customs
and traditions.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.550
Hegel himself was always
a foreigner in Prussia,

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.690
and his students often noted
his thick Wurttembergian accent.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.120
And his colleagues
sometimes tended to snub him

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.760
or to exclude them from noble
society because of this.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.840
Now while Hegel's stated
goal in these lectures

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.530
is to defend the truth of
Christianity, in my project,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.570
I submit that if we
read between the lines,

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.130
we can see in fact he's engaged
in a project which is much more

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.420
ambitious and in some
ways more interesting.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.800
He notes that human
beings have worshipped

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.870
the divine in virtually
every form imaginable.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.570
So anything at all can be,
and has been, reverenced

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.030
as a god or a divinity.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.570
And this, at first glance,
can appear very confusing.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.150
I know when I teach students
introduction to mythology,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.276
the first time they hear
about the Greek myths,

00:03:53.276 --> 00:03:54.900
they can't make any
sense of it at all.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.150
It strikes them as very strange
when they hear these stories

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.358
about the Greek gods and
goddesses and all the things

00:03:59.358 --> 00:04:00.210
they are doing.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.530
It doesn't seem to make any
sense whatsoever to them.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.390
So Hegel's deeper
project is to try

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.340
to discern some rationality,
some logic, some logos,

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.240
in this apparently chaotic
manifold of myths, beliefs,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.829
and religious practices.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.010
He wants to find some
basic principles that

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.690
can help us to
understand why it is

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.240
that humans conceive of the
gods in the way that they do.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.719
And so when I talk about the
logic of the gods in my title,

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:29.010
this is what I'm talking about.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.510
Hegel wants to
help us understand

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.800
this logos, this rationality.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.450
The first edition
of Hegel's Lectures

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.630
on the Philosophy of Religion
was published in 1832,

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.730
just a few months
after Hegel's death.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.190
It was edited by one of his
students, this guy Philipp

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.306
Marheineke, who
was a theologian.

00:04:47.306 --> 00:04:49.710
And what Marheineke
did is he simply went

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.490
around and combined--
asked his fellow students

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.010
if they had lecture
notes to these lectures

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.140
that Hegel had given
through the years,

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.710
got those together, combined
them, and collated them

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.000
to make a single running text.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.710
And so when we talk
about Hegel's Lectures

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.210
on the Philosophy
of Religion, we're

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.880
not strictly speaking
about, talking about a text

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.620
by Hegel's own hand.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.810
These are student notes
which have been put together

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.060
in different ways, and
the philology of this

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.290
is extremely complex.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.180
I won't go into it,
but take it from me,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.180
this is a complex matter
and different editions

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.520
follow different
principles, a long story.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.110
But it was this initial
edition by Marheineke in 1832

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.930
which played a crucial role
in the history of reception

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.680
since it was really the focal
point for the critical debates

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.980
surrounding Hegel's philosophy.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.740
In many ways, it
was the key text

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.060
that caused the split among
Hegel's followers, that

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.570
created the schools known
to the history of philosophy

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.225
as Right and Left Hegelianism.

00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:51.950
Again, we don't need to get
into the details of that,

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.130
but suffice it to say that
the debates about Hegel's

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.400
philosophy of religion
defined philosophy

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.260
and theology in the
German speaking world

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.200
in the 1830s and 1840s.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.930
And so this was a text that was
read by thinkers such as Ludwig

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.930
Feuerbach, David Friedrich
Strauss, Karl Marx, Bruno

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.270
Bauer, Soren Kierkegaard.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.100
All of the important
figures of that period

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.670
read this text carefully, and
it played an important role

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.180
for them.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.400
Now the basic structure
of these lectures

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.300
follows a threefold scheme.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.490
For Hegel, everything's
about threes, right?

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.770
We start with The Concept of
Religion and then the section

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.862
The Determinant Religion
or sometimes translated

00:06:32.862 --> 00:06:34.320
The Definite
Religion-- this is one

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.600
we will look at in more
detail-- and finally

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.540
what he calls The Absolute
Religion or The Consummate

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.240
Religion in another translation.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.890
The first section
now, The Concept

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.420
of Religion-- here Hegel
explores the nature of God

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.590
in the abstract.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:54.360
So the idea is that
God is a concept

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.020
and each different field
for him corresponds

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.230
to a specific concept.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.080
So God is the concept
that corresponds

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.040
to the field of
religion in the same way

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.070
that, for example, beauty is
a concept that corresponds

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.770
to art or aesthetics
or in the way

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.600
that justice would
be the concept that

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.500
corresponds to law.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.160
And so here Hegel
wants to explore,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.860
what do we mean
intuitively when we use

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.520
this word God or the divine?

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.180
What is that as a concept to us?

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.400
So independent of
any concrete religion

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.450
or any religious tradition,
just what does that term mean?

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.580
So that's what he's occupied
with in that first section.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.410
Then in the second
section, he moves

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.620
from that abstract concept
to the concrete conception.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.010
So he wants to look at all
the different religions

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.850
of the world and
see, concretely,

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.100
how have those different
religions conceived

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.650
of the divine in different ways?

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.390
And so here he goes through.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.030
He gives us a long story about
the development of the world

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.900
religions, and at the
beginning of each chapter,

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.900
he tries to say, what does that
religion understand by God?

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.930
What is the concept of the
divinity in that religion?

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.250
And so here you can
even see that we

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.140
can understand The
Concept of Religion

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.870
as representing the
universal, right?

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.130
What is God as a
general concept?

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.630
And then The
Determinant Religion

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.200
representing the
particular, right,

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.040
so looking at individual
conceptions of God.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.250
And then he thinks that the
third section, The Absolute

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.020
Religion, this is his defense
of Christianity, where he

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.530
thinks these two come together.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.930
And the historical
story he wants to tell,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.240
it's leading up to
Christianity and this

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.859
is the Hegel as
Christian apologist part

00:08:32.859 --> 00:08:36.870
that we will return to.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.490
The middle section, The
Determinant Religion,

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.260
is where it gets a
little more complex.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:47.900
He divides this into two large
sections, the natural religion,

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.780
or religions of nature, and
the religions of spirit.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.760
Each of the world religions
is determined and organized

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.580
for him in accordance with
its specific conception

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.240
of what the divine is.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.140
So the movement that
Hegel wants to trace

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.070
is intended to be
a progressive one,

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.070
starting with the most basic,
moving to the most complex.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.900
To use his language, he has kind
of a funny way of putting this,

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.570
that human beings are
emerging from nature

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.180
as they're slowly
developing different aspects

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.410
of human culture.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.690
And so his question,
you can understand it

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.240
as being how did
human beings get

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.360
from certain early conceptions
of the gods to the conceptions

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.100
that we have today?

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.230
I guess in the same way,
I suppose, anthropologists

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.270
ask how do we get
from stone tools

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.900
to, whatever, rocket
ships or computers?

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.980
So now the first category,
natural religion, the divine

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.610
is conceived of as
an object of nature.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.490
So anything at all, like
the sun, the moon, a river,

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.170
an animal, a plant,
anything of this sort

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.830
would fall for him
under the category

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.830
of the philosophy of nature.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.600
In contrast to that, we have
the religions of spirit,

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.240
and on these accounts,
they're the conception

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.940
of the god as a self-conscious
agent or entity.

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:11.670
It's an anthropomorphic
conception.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.370
These are the
forms of polytheism

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.940
we see, for example, in the
Greek and Roman religion.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.810
In the secondary
literature on this,

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.680
there's quite a number
of books that treat

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.680
Hegel as a Christian apologist.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.350
Many theologians just go
to that final section,

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.790
and they ignore everything else.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.474
But I think this is a
mistake because this section

00:10:32.474 --> 00:10:33.890
on the determinant
religion, which

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:39.770
has really been quite neglected,
is compelling in many ways.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.010
But I think what has
stood in the way of people

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.190
looking at this
more seriously is

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.210
what we call in Hegel studies
Hegel's teleology, that

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:55.060
is this end toward which the
development is progressing,

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.980
or to put a finer point
on it, his Eurocentrism.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.650
We're all leading
up to Christianity,

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.840
and everything looks like
it's subordinated to that.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.530
And so most of these studies on
Hegel's philosophy of religion,

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.410
they want to skip over
that part and just see

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.270
what he says about
Christianity and not

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.880
worry so much about this
uncomfortable question

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.480
of telos.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.369
And of course that's
understandable.

00:11:15.369 --> 00:11:17.410
It's quite unfashionable
to talk like that today.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.476
Nobody wants to say that the
history of or development

00:11:20.476 --> 00:11:21.850
of world religions
leads up to be

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.890
a culminating point
in Christianity which

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:25.060
is the only true religion.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:29.250
I mean, that offends our
modern sensibilities.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.840
And so, yeah,
understandably, people

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.524
have shied a little bit
away from this topic.

00:11:35.524 --> 00:11:36.940
But I think what
I want to suggest

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.023
is that the matter's not
quite so straightforward.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.685
I think when we hear this
claim about the end of religion

00:11:45.685 --> 00:11:47.820
in Hegel, that conjures
up in our minds

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.850
a great number of things about,
OK, what a person who would

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.970
think that must have thought.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.530
And what I want to submit
to your judgment here

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.990
is that in Hegel's case,
this is not the case.

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.150
That our modern
sensibilities simply

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.780
do not square with the
sensibilities at that time.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.680
And let me give you three quick
reasons for why I think that.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:17.200
The first is that Hegel devotes
a great deal of time and effort

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.310
to understanding these
other world religions,

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.580
and it's perfectly
clear that he doesn't

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.076
think that because those are
not the culminating religions,

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:25.950
that they're simply
meaningless or worthless.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.810
On the contrary, he's
extremely engaged in this,

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.690
in exploring those
other religions.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:35.640
And far from dismissing it, at
the beginning of his lectures,

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.450
Hegel actually
warns his auditors

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.120
about prejudice
towards this material.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.220
And this is what he says.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.039
I mean, imagine this,
like the first day

00:12:44.039 --> 00:12:45.830
of the semester at the
University of Berlin

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.288
and all these
excited students come

00:12:47.288 --> 00:12:50.920
in for Hegel's lectures
and Hegel's attentive

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.510
to this issue.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.697
And so he says this
just as a caveat right

00:12:55.697 --> 00:12:57.280
at the very beginning
of the lectures.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:02.020
He says, it's undoubtedly true
that the definite religions

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.660
of the various peoples
often enough exhibit

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.950
the most distorted and confused
ideas of the divine being,

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:11.430
and likewise of duties and
relations expressed in worship.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.870
But-- here's the key
point-- we must not

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.540
treat the matter so
lightly and conceive of it

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.790
in a superficial
manner, as to reject

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.280
these ideas and these rights
as superstition, error,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.360
and deceit.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.720
On the contrary,
something higher

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.750
is necessary,
namely to recognize

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:30.910
the meaning, the truth,
and the connection

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.930
with truth, in short, to get to
know what is rational in them.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:38.230
They are human beings who hit
upon such religions, therefore,

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.150
there must be reason
in them, and amidst

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:44.710
all that is accidental in
them, a higher necessity.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:51.070
Now we can see here that Hegel--
it's very easy to read over

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.620
this kind of a
passage, but I think

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.820
we need to put this in
its historical context.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.481
And when you do, you see this
is actually quite striking.

00:13:58.481 --> 00:13:59.980
Let's remember now,
this is the time

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.620
when Europe was just
beginning for the first time

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.020
to learn at all about these
different non-European

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.110
religions.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.000
And this process,
as we all know,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.144
was accompanied with a
great deal of suspicion,

00:14:10.144 --> 00:14:12.810
a great deal of ignorance, and a
great deal of prejudice, right?

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.410
And so some of which
Hegel presumably

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:15.970
saw in his own
classroom, and so here he

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:17.770
is, right at the
beginning of his lectures,

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.710
admonishing his students to
put aside their prejudice

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.840
and to take a serious
look at this material.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.370
There is an inherent
rationality in religious belief

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.090
and practice,
regardless of how odd

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.550
or how foreign it might
strike us or our intuitions

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.170
at first glance.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.050
Although there is a
teleology in the development

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.760
of that religion,
Hegel's not implying

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.490
here that everything prior to
that is simply meaningless.

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.950
On the contrary, he's making
a plea, which at the time

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.406
was quite progressive,
for a careful study

00:14:44.406 --> 00:14:45.655
of the non-European religions.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.550
A second point that
I think follows along

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:55.510
with this is if you look at
the field of the philosophy

00:14:55.510 --> 00:15:00.630
of religion in his time, it
was, as one would expect,

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.920
extremely Eurocentric.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.900
If you look at the-- well, I've
spent a lot of time on this--

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.260
but just briefly, look at
the philosophy of religion

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.220
of his immediate
predecessors, the philosophers

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.330
Kant and Fichte.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.370
If you look at their
philosophy of religion,

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.700
it's all about the
Judeo-Christian tradition.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.640
They basically never talk
about any other religion.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.010
It's extremely limited.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.510
So for them,
philosophy of religion,

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:26.110
it's about understanding
the Christian tradition, by

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.630
and large, whereas
for Hegel, he's

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.750
really sort of the first one
to have made a conscious effort

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.531
to include these
non-European religions

00:15:34.531 --> 00:15:36.280
and to really take
them seriously and make

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:40.570
that a central part
of the discussion.

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.070
This is particularly
striking when--

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.400
look at even to this very day,
how Eurocentric this field is,

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.000
right?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.110
And so in this
sense as well, Hegel

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:53.930
seems to be on the
progressive side of things

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:56.200
during his own time.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.772
And the third point
I wanted to bring up

00:15:58.772 --> 00:16:00.230
has to do with
Hegel's relationship

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.540
to this guy, Georg
Friedrich Creuzer.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:07.760
Creuzer was important in
the rise of Asian studies

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.710
in the German
states at the time.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:15.670
From 1810 to 1812, he published,
in four volumes, this book,

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.420
Symbolik und Mythologie der
alten Volker, besonders der

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.020
Griechen, Symbolism
and Mythology

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:23.224
of the Ancient Peoples,
Especially the Greeks.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.520
This was an important and
extremely controversial

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.450
book at the time.

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:35.110
Creuzer began his studies in
Jena in the 1790s, and in 1804

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:39.140
was appointed to a professorship
in philology and ancient

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.570
history at the
University of Heidelberg.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:45.140
There, he became known as
one of the leading figures

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.390
of Heidelberg Romanticism.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.270
Through his contact with the
other Romantics in this circle,

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.870
Creuzer, although originally
a classicist by training,

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.810
he became quite interested
in the mythology of India

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:58.460
and other Eastern religions.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.240
And this was the beginning of
the inspiration for his book.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.930
Creuzer's approach to religion
foreshadowed Hegel's in a lot

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:06.890
of important ways.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.599
He saw a general development in
history of the different world

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:15.470
religions, and he saw them
as developing from earlier

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:16.550
stages to later ones.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:19.970
And he saw different
beliefs in cults

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.260
being transferred from
one culture to another

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.569
and then being reshaped
in different ways.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:30.332
And Creuzer's
comparative mythology

00:17:30.332 --> 00:17:31.790
attempted to
demonstrate that there

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:35.270
were important aspects of Greek
mythology which originally

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:39.950
came from eastern sources, such
as Egypt, Persia, and India.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:43.610
And this called into question
the importance and originality

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:45.710
of Greek culture, which
the tradition was,

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.510
of course, had long celebrated.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.080
And this was a highly
controversial claim

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:51.620
at the time.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.550
This was the period of
Neoclassicism of Philhellenism

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.460
in the German states.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.170
And Creuzer's view
seemed to completely

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.780
undermine what was the
assumed superiority

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.110
or primacy of Western culture
and to raise these Eastern

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:10.370
religions to a new
elevated status.

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:14.540
This book set off quite
a testy controversy

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.040
that took place
during the time when

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.970
Hegel was lecturing in Berlin.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.147
And Creuzer's views
were simply rejected

00:18:21.147 --> 00:18:22.730
and there were
attempts to portray him

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:26.440
as kind of a fanatic or
an incompetent scholar.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.870
There was an enormous degree
of resentment built up

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:32.892
among the classicists,
that Creuzer had,

00:18:32.892 --> 00:18:34.850
in a certain sense,
betrayed his own background

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:39.680
as a classical philologist, and
they regarded his enthusiasm

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.810
for ancient India as
like high treason.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.416
They had no patience
for this at all.

00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:47.852
Hegel knew Creuzer personally.

00:18:47.852 --> 00:18:49.310
They were colleagues
when Hegel was

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.440
at Berlin from 1816 to 1818.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.194
That was immediately before
he went to-- I'm sorry.

00:18:56.194 --> 00:18:57.610
They were colleagues
in Heidelberg

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:02.110
immediately before
Hegel went to Berlin.

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:05.270
Hegel's first biographer,
Karl Rosenkranz,

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.670
especially emphasized
Hegel's sympathy for Creuzer

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.250
during this Heidelberg period.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.680
And this relationship
is attested

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.740
to in a number of
different letters

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.539
that Hegel writes to
Creuzer while he's in Berlin

00:19:17.539 --> 00:19:18.830
and while he's giving lectures.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.760
And he tells him quite openly
how inspired he is by his book

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.370
and how he's making use
of them in his lectures.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.040
And Hegel says this also
explicitly in the lectures

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.760
and the manuscripts
that we have,

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.409
and this is also something
we have to fully appreciate

00:19:35.409 --> 00:19:36.950
the force of these
passages, you have

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:38.540
to put it in the
historical context,

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.111
where imagine all of
this controversy going on

00:19:42.111 --> 00:19:42.860
in the background.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.230
Everybody in the classroom
knows who this guy Creuzer is

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.290
and they know he's
under fire because

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:50.962
of all these philologists
who are mad at him, right?

00:19:50.962 --> 00:19:51.920
And then there's Hegel.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.400
He's saying, my friend
Creuzer says this,

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.570
and I think he's
right-- at the time,

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:00.460
enormously contentious
thing to say.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:02.034
So what are these--
these passages,

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:03.950
one could easily read
right over if you're not

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.690
familiar with the
historical background,

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.880
but here, Hegel's
clearly taking a stand

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.370
on Creuzer's side
of the argument.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.480
And Creuzer was a major
influence, I think,

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.110
on Hegel's understanding and
general approach to religion.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.330
In particular, he gave
Hegel a greater appreciation

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.690
for the religions of
the East and this then

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.080
drew Hegel into these
contemporary controversies

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.260
surrounding the value and
the status of this newly

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.360
discovered material.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.680
Hegel's often known to be a
great critic of the Romantics,

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.980
but he was also sympathetic
to their attempt

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.862
to understand the deeper
meaning of the Asian religions.

00:20:43.862 --> 00:20:45.320
Both Hegel and
Creuzer, they wanted

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.360
to trace the links between
the different world religions

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.910
and to establish a
continuous development

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.060
from the religions of the
East through the Greeks

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:54.740
and the Romans.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.460
And on this score, in
contrast to many scholars

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.700
then and for that
matter now, Hegel,

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.700
he doesn't have any
problems with the suggestion

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.200
that key aspects of Greek
culture and religion

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.080
came from Egypt, and key
aspects of Egyptian culture

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.750
and religion came from,
for example, Mesopotamia

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:14.070
or from Ethiopia.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:18.120
And he's quite open to
these sorts of connections.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:25.460
And so all of this is simply to
show that it may be the stated

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.310
goal of Hegel's lectures
is to defend Christianity,

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:32.580
but there's a lot more there
than what we would immediately

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.430
take to be implied
in that simple claim.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.990
He has enormous interest
in this other material

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:44.600
and is also keen to give it
a philosophical analysis.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.078
OK, well what is
the theory here?

00:21:50.949 --> 00:21:52.740
I hope this doesn't
bring back bad memories

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.060
from your undergraduate days.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.730
For Hegel, religion
operates at the level

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.530
of what he calls spirit.

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.550
By this, he simply
means human culture,

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:06.560
anything that is the
product of the human mind.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.380
So the gods are the product
of the collective human mind.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.260
They're not the idiosyncratic
result of specific individuals.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:18.230
And so this means that when
we're talking about religion,

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.120
that the different
religions follow

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.530
different nationalistic lines.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:27.410
So it's groups of people
who have their own gods, who

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:28.360
have specific gods.

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.940
So specific peoples or nations
each have their own set

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.149
of gods or deities.

00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:34.940
So the Greeks have
specifically Greek gods,

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:39.520
the Egyptians have
specifically Egyptian gods.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.980
And so Hegel's account
here of religion,

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:45.140
it follows a pattern which
is quite similar or parallel

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.451
to the account he wants to give
of the development of world

00:22:48.451 --> 00:22:48.950
history.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.410
The notion of the divine
that a people develops,

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.580
according to Hegel,
is naturally going

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.630
to be a reflection of its
own values, its own culture,

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.990
and its own self-conception.

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.500
So you can think of this as
whatever a given people can

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.610
think of as being of the
highest or the grandest,

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.850
the most sublime at that
given point in history.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.030
Well that's represented
in their religion.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.680
That's their conception
of the divine.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.980
But this means that those
conceptions, of course,

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.313
are going to be culturally
and historically conditioned.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.356
One silly example
I use sometimes

00:23:27.356 --> 00:23:28.730
to illustrate this
to my students

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:32.850
is think of an older
science fiction film

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:34.790
that you've seen,
perhaps, and think

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:38.630
of how the writers at
that time tried to imagine

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.370
how the future would look.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:42.980
What would it be like if we
had this fantastic technology?

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.870
We could do anything
at all, right?

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.660
And then compare that
with what we have today.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.060
Very often, we sort of laugh
at those old films, right?

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.797
Remember like Captain Kirk
with the communicator, right?

00:23:53.797 --> 00:23:55.880
I mean at the time when
that was written, probably

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.530
like in the '50s or '60s,
whenever that show was on,

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.370
that was just a grand
idea of what technology

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:02.150
could do one day.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.350
Talk to the Starship
on the communicator

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:05.730
from the planet, right?

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:09.110
Whereas today, I
think the crudest form

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:11.210
of cell phone you
can buy for $10 far

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:13.610
surpasses the
communicator, right?

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:15.770
It's this choice of something
about the contingency

00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:17.300
of the human imagination.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:22.310
It's fixed in the certain
time and place, historically.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.170
And so from this, it
follows, according to Hegel,

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:29.270
that the conception
of the divine,

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.100
which indeed constitutes
a part of culture,

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.890
is going to be in
a certain sense

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.080
a reflection of
that given people.

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.850
And so through their
different cultural artifacts,

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:42.920
the way he puts it,
the people given people

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.350
objectifies itself to itself.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:48.260
So you're producing some
external thing and viewing it,

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.200
and that is a reflection of
what you are as a culture.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:56.780
And the conception of the
gods is one such artifact.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.590
So from this analysis,
I think it's clear

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.440
why Hegel thinks that
a historical study

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.900
of the concrete religions
is quite important.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.830
And he explains that
the goal is then

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.130
to study religions
in history to see

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.830
how these different historical
peoples characterize

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:13.580
the divinities and to understand
that as a function of how they

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.180
conceived of themselves,
that is, what they thought

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:19.280
it amount to to be human.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:23.000
Now given this, that the
conception of the divine

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.730
reflects and corresponds to a
people's conception of itself,

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.519
it seems clear that this
self-conception is historically

00:25:29.519 --> 00:25:31.310
mutable and needs to
be traced through time

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.660
and then this is something
that gives his analysis

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:35.975
this historical dimension.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.680
You know there's, of course,
another set of lectures,

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.740
his lectures on the philosophy
of history-- similar story,

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.230
student notes which were
collected and published

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.540
posthumously.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.800
In these lectures, Hegel traces
the story of human history

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.140
in terms of one people
and after another.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:00.110
I'm sure some of you
have read some of this.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:02.840
The key thesis
there that he tries

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.690
to defend that everybody
recites to themselves

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.060
is, OK, the development
of human history

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.750
is the realization
of human freedom.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.490
So through the course
of time, humanity

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:16.130
is becoming more and more free.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.432
OK, I mean, any undergraduate
can recite that for you,

00:26:18.432 --> 00:26:19.640
but what does it mean, right?

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.040
This is, of course,
the big question.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.950
Lots that have been
written about this.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.770
My short version is
something like this.

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:29.571
Forget for a moment
the idea of freedom.

00:26:29.571 --> 00:26:31.070
That can mean many
different things,

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:34.230
as every good politician knows.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:40.490
Think of concepts such as
individuality or subjectivity.

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:42.910
That's the kind of thing
he's talking about.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:48.440
What he's trying to trace
there is a historical movement

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.250
which begins with a
time where individuals

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:56.750
were subordinated to
custom, to tradition,

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.480
standard ways of doing
things, and that there

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:05.620
was no recognition of the
value of the individual.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.280
And so it's only through
the course of history,

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.640
Hegel wants to say that this
conception of individuality

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.600
starts to be recognized
and starts to gain ground.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.364
And so I think that's
the kind of thing

00:27:18.364 --> 00:27:20.780
that you can talk-- there's
an element of freedom involved

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.820
in that, of course, to
what it is to be free.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:24.470
We think today that
it has something

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.560
to do with what we are as
individuals, of course,

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:31.540
but I think it's a clearer
way to think about it.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.360
And so the idea is
that in the past,

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.340
these traditional
customs were oppressive.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:40.640
People were simply obliged
to go along with things

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.830
because, well, that
was what the family,

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:47.510
the tribe, the state,
whoever simply dictated.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.037
It didn't matter what
the individual thought.

00:27:50.037 --> 00:27:52.370
If they were inclined to do
it or not, it didn't matter.

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:53.732
Your opinion does not ask.

00:27:53.732 --> 00:27:54.440
You simply do it.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.450
This is your role.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.570
This is the realm of what
Hegel calls zeitlichkeit,

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.340
and this is a German
word that just

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:05.150
means, for Hegel, the
larger sphere of customs

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:10.510
and traditions that he thinks
people were subordinate to.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:15.080
And Hegel's own term
is subjective freedom,

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.080
this development
of the individual

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.630
that I think is
more intuitive to us

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:26.500
today, where gradually
through the course of history,

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.970
it's realized that each
and every human being

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.610
is valuable and
important on their own,

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:33.110
that there's
something irreducible

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.990
about the individual.

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:37.715
And this realm of
subjectivity, individuality,

00:28:37.715 --> 00:28:40.090
is something that only
comes to be recognized

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.060
in the course of history.

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:45.290
Here, it's helpful
to think of things

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:48.434
like the idea of human rights.

00:28:48.434 --> 00:28:49.850
Human rights is
not something that

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:51.780
was there at the beginning
of history, right,

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.050
and so this is an idea.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.400
It's a concept that
developed, took a long time

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.320
to develop and to refine.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.840
Think of things
like the Declaration

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.690
of the Rights of Man and Citizen
or the United Nations charters.

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:06.350
These are documents which
reflect a certain conception

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.950
of what it is to
be a human being

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:13.550
and that celebrate a certain
form of irreducibility of what

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:15.980
it is to be an individual.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.680
In earlier times, of course,
that conception was not

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.090
present, I mean not in
that articulated way.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:24.710
This is the kind of
thing Hegel has in mind.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.690
If you want to turn
the point around, look

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.890
at it on the negative
side, Hegel's

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.535
quite critical of a number
of different institutions

00:29:33.535 --> 00:29:34.910
historically which
he thinks have

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.730
stood in the way of the
development of human freedom

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:38.990
or individuality.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.320
So he's quite critical of,
for example, the Indian caste

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:42.980
system.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:45.770
He's critical of
the slave trade.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:47.870
He's critical of the
anti-Semitic laws

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.240
in the Prussia of his own
day, which exclude Jews

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.070
from certain legal rights.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:54.230
So all of these things
are, to his mind,

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:58.310
in complete contradiction to the
principle of subjective freedom

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:01.040
because they undermine the
dignity and absolute value

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.400
of the individual.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.580
So the long story Hegel
wants to tell them

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.567
about the development
of subjective freedom

00:30:08.567 --> 00:30:10.400
in his lectures on the
philosophy of history

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.682
is then, you can see, intimately
connected with the story

00:30:13.682 --> 00:30:15.640
he wants to tell about
the development of world

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.710
religions in his lectures on
the philosophy of religion.

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:22.190
So the culture and the
self-conception of a people,

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:27.220
it's going to be limited by
its degree of, in his words,

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.290
freedom or individuality,
subjectivity

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.880
that it's achieved,
its awareness of that.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.780
Since the culture or
self-conception is constituent

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:38.050
of a conception of the
divine in any given people,

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:40.725
it therefore follows that
the notion of freedom,

00:30:40.725 --> 00:30:42.100
individuality,
subjectivity, it's

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.840
also bound up with the way in
which the gods are conceived.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.930
Well that's the theory.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.740
Let's go and look
at some examples

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:55.580
and hopefully this will
become a bit more intuitive.

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.780
We saw that that Hegel begins
in his categorization with what

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.651
he's calling the
religions of nature.

00:31:01.651 --> 00:31:05.275
One of the religions
of nature is Hinduism.

00:31:05.275 --> 00:31:06.400
What do we see in Hinduism?

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.100
The conception of
the god, Brahma,

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.730
who's the creative power of
nature, and anything in nature

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.760
can be perceived of
as having this power.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.620
And so for this
reason, the Hindus

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:21.500
worship all sorts of natural
objects, like the river Ganges.

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.900
They worship different plants.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.850
They worship
animals, all of which

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.730
are thought to have this
divine element in them

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:30.470
because they have the force
of nature within them.

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:32.050
There's seemingly
infinite number

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:36.430
of avatars or manifestations
of the abstract divine.

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:40.810
Here, we have the sacred cow
or Hanuman, the monkey god, one

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.020
of the heroes of the Ramayana.

00:31:45.414 --> 00:31:47.080
Another of the other
religions of nature

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:51.410
is Zoroastrianism, the religion
of the ancient Persians.

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:58.810
The Zoroastrians worshipped
as a divinity light or fire,

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:04.420
and so they had fire
altars that were

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:08.090
central to their
religious ceremonies.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:10.412
And again, very straightforward
why Hegel thinks this

00:32:10.412 --> 00:32:11.620
is a natural religion, right?

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.220
Light and fire, these
are products of nature.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:15.100
They're not the product
of the human mind.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:15.850
They're out there.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:19.540
We can find them in nature.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.780
So we have two examples of
what he talks about in terms

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.570
of natural religion,
then we move

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:28.570
to his conception of the
Egyptian religion, which

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:31.240
he thinks is a
transitory religion.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.795
It moves us away from
the natural religion

00:32:34.795 --> 00:32:38.500
and into the
religions of spirit.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.590
And he thinks-- he gives
us lots of examples of why

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:42.940
he thinks this is transitory.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.790
One of these has to do with
the Egyptian conception

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:49.000
of the immortality of the soul,
which he thinks is absolutely

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.130
a key moment in the development
of a religious thought.

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:56.655
And he illustrates that
with images like this.

00:32:56.655 --> 00:33:01.160
This is the Papyrus known as
the Book of the Dead by Hunefer.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.610
And what's going on here?

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:09.130
We have the Osiris, the god
of the dead who is sitting

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:11.190
on the right on the throne.

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:13.512
Here on the left,
we have-- I guess

00:33:13.512 --> 00:33:15.470
this is supposed to be
read from left to right.

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:19.120
We have the god of the
underworld, Anubis,

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:23.410
with the head of a dog who's
leading in the dead guy.

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:25.430
And then in the
next scene, we see

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:29.380
Anubis is weighing on the
scales the heart of the dead guy

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.780
against a feather.

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.220
And so the idea is that if
you have a very heavy heart,

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.545
then you were a morally
wretched person, and you lose.

00:33:38.545 --> 00:33:40.420
You don't get to enter
the realm of the dead.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.030
If that's the case, then
this other god here,

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:45.250
who has the head
of like a crocodile

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:49.600
and the body of partly of
a hippopotamus, Ammitt,

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:53.040
he will eat the heart
and that person,

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.270
his soul dies, as
the heart is thought

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:58.280
to be the locus of the soul.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.230
Then we have the god
Thoth, with the head

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.520
of an ibis, who's writing
down what's happening,

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.110
recording the guy's name and
whatever, social security

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:11.359
number, making sure that we
have the right person here.

00:34:11.359 --> 00:34:13.900
And it looks like he passes the
test because you can see him.

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:15.580
Then he's being led
by the god Horus

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.900
into the realm of the dead here.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:23.852
And now what's Hegel's point
with this kind of a story?

00:34:23.852 --> 00:34:27.310
He's saying that the
idea of judging people

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:29.464
for their moral
worth and holding

00:34:29.464 --> 00:34:30.880
them responsible
for their actions

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:35.320
implies a developed
conception of individuality.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.179
Individuals and
their moral decisions

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:39.400
are now thought to have
an importance in value

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.219
that he thinks was not
formally recognized.

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:45.580
So the moral life of
each individual person

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.830
is important enough
in this sense

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:49.760
to warrant its own
legal proceedings.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:54.170
It's important enough that
it even interests the gods.

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:57.560
Now suddenly the moral
life of individuals

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:03.470
is an enormous importance
which accrues to this.

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.010
And Hegel thinks that
the intuitive ideas

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:09.092
that we have today about
justice, about morality,

00:35:09.092 --> 00:35:11.050
about individual freedom,
he thinks all of this

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:14.980
can be traced back in part
to this original Egyptian

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.330
conception of immortality.

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:20.910
He thinks all that arises
here for the first time.

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:23.460
Another important characteristic
of the Egyptian gods

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.580
is that they're mixed entities.

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:31.710
They contain a human element
and an animal element.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:34.390
The Egyptian divinities, they're
not purely gods of nature,

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.190
like the sacred
cow of the Hindus

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.582
or the light of the Persians.

00:35:38.582 --> 00:35:40.290
There's an element of
the animal present,

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.790
but now for the
first time, there's

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:44.940
also a human element,
which is introduced into it

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.650
and mixed together with it.

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:49.390
And we can find all sorts of
examples of the sort of thing

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:51.420
Hegel's talking about here.

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.870
His favorite example is
probably that of the Sphinx.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:54.560
What's a sphinx?

00:35:54.560 --> 00:36:00.540
The body of a lion and
the head of a human being.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.770
But most of the Egyptian
deities reversed this.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.350
They have a human
body and then the head

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:07.060
of some kind of an animal.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.460
So, for example,
the sun god of Ra

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.634
is represented with
the head of a hawk.

00:36:11.634 --> 00:36:15.750
Here we have Sobeck with the
head of a crocodile, Khnum,

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.790
the head of a ram.

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:20.600
This is also true of
the many female deities

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.690
that we have in
Egyptian religion.

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:24.940
Here we have the
female deity Sekhmet,

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.940
who has the head of a lion.

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:29.960
There's also Bastet, who
has the head of a cat,

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.996
and Tawaret, who has the
head of a hippopotamus.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.310
Hegel also discusses,
on this motif

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:41.230
of mixed figures,
one of the most

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:46.290
famous of the Egyptian
gods, Anubis, we saw before,

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:50.130
has the body of a human
being, the head of a jackal.

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:53.440
And since Anubis is
said to have created

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:56.260
important aspects of human
affairs, such as science

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.530
or the art of
mummification, we would

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.170
have expected him to have a
completely anthropomorphic

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:02.790
form, right?

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.580
After all, it's only human
beings who have science.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.350
But this is not the
way he's depicted.

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:10.810
He's depicted with
the head of a dog.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:12.370
And so Hegel's way
of reading this

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:14.670
is that the Egyptians,
they have recognized

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.750
a certain aspect of
this is being divine,

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:20.330
but it's still bound
up with nature somehow.

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:24.700
We can find a similar
oddity in the deity Thoth.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.980
This is the god who
has the head of an ibis

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:29.580
and the body of a man.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.900
Thoth is said to be the
inventor of hieroglyphics

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.770
and is the god of
writing and wisdom.

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:40.190
So here, we can see he's
writing something on the tablet.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:42.937
And once again, given this,
we would expect this god also

00:37:42.937 --> 00:37:44.770
to have a fully human
appearance, since it's

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:47.015
only humans, after
all, who have writing.

00:37:47.015 --> 00:37:50.250
And thus it's odd that he
has the head of an ibis

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:53.190
and that sometimes he's
portrayed as a baboon.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:55.540
So according to
Hegel, the Egyptians

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.830
have reached a level where they
regard certain human activities

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:03.080
as divine, but they've not
yet regard to these things

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:07.955
as entirely the work of the
human mind or the human spirit.

00:38:07.955 --> 00:38:12.370
That natural element is
still attached to them.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:16.980
And so for Hegel, the importance
of these mixed figures

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.330
is that they arise at
a time when there's

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:22.380
a conception of spirit, a
certain conception of spirit

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:26.790
which corresponds to a certain
conception of the divine.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:29.640
The Egyptians have begun to
attain a level, according

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.600
to him, where their
self-conception allows

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.882
them to conceive of the divine
as a self-conscious subject.

00:38:35.882 --> 00:38:37.840
And it's for this reason
that their duties have

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.427
certain human characteristics.

00:38:40.427 --> 00:38:42.010
Therefore, there's
a need to move away

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:44.880
from the representations of
the divine in terms of animals

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.875
or other objects of nature.

00:38:47.875 --> 00:38:50.520
And this is important for
Hegel because this then

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:54.060
marks that transition from
the religions of nature

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.154
to what Hegel calls the
religions of spirit.

00:38:57.154 --> 00:39:01.690
This moves us to then the Greek
religion, Greek polytheism,

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.870
which is one of the
religions of spirit.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:07.480
Hegel argues that we have the
same movement here that we

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.750
saw from nature to spirit,
which takes place not just

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:12.850
at this broad level
of the different world

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:15.040
religions as they
progress historically,

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.189
but also within the
individual world religions.

00:39:18.189 --> 00:39:19.980
Kind of a funny thought,
but his point here

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.390
is that we can see the
Greek religion itself

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:26.166
going through those same
stages that we just traced.

00:39:26.166 --> 00:39:28.830
And so this means that if you
want to look at it this way,

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.750
whatever criticisms he has
of the Asian religions,

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:35.880
he also has of the Greek
religions at an earlier stage.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:39.390
So according to Greek
mythology as we know it by,

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:42.460
for example, Hesiod, we
have the first generation

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:45.420
of the gods, which
was produced by Chaos

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:48.020
and was rather limited.

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.630
Then after this
first generation,

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:53.920
comes a larger group
known as the Titans, who

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.710
were the offspring of Gaia,
the goddess of the earth,

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:59.500
and Uranus, the god
of heaven, right?

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.132
So everything between earth
and heaven is the universe.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.570
So according to Hegel,
these earlier gods

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:10.660
represent gods of nature.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.880
They're natural
forces, primarily.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.320
From the Titans then come
the well-known generation

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.474
of the Olympians,
who are led by Zeus.

00:40:19.474 --> 00:40:21.140
The Olympians, for
Hegel, represent gods

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.440
not of nature but of spirit.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.370
The shift from the
Titans to the Olympians

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:29.840
is portrayed mythologically
as a war of the gods.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.090
Hegel recalls the myth,
again, portrayed in Hesiod,

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:35.210
of how the Titans who
were led by Kronos

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:38.150
were overthrown by Zeus
and the Olympian gods.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:41.540
So Zeus revolts against
his father Kronos

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.330
and establishes a new reign.

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.970
The war of the gods represents
symbolically a movement

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:49.570
from nature to spirit.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:51.920
So the old gods of
nature are supplanted

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:56.509
by the new Olympian gods, which
are far more anthropomorphic.

00:40:56.509 --> 00:40:57.550
I think you can see this.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:59.540
I mean, if you know anything
at all about Greek mythology

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.270
and you just read
through these names,

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:03.170
you can usually
associate something,

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:05.650
kind of an idea of
personality or in a story

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:07.150
with the ones with
the Olympians,

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:09.340
whereas these other ones,
it's a little bit hazier,

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.270
that they don't seem to
have that same degree

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.480
of personification.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.460
They don't have
developed personalities

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:21.317
or individualities in
quite the same way.

00:41:21.317 --> 00:41:22.900
Hegel gives us several
examples of how

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.070
this shift in focus
from nature to spirit

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:28.400
is seen in the conception
of individual gods.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.700
He points out that
the Olympians maintain

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.000
some of the natural
powers like the Titans,

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.620
but then new powers,
significantly new powers,

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.500
are added to reflect the
development of spirit

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.640
or human culture.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.770
So, for example,
Zeus is like Uranus

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:46.280
in that he's still responsible
for weather phenomena,

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:49.730
like rain, thunder,
lightning, things like that.

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:52.210
But he surpasses Uranus
because he's also--

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:53.180
he gets new quality.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:56.140
He's responsible for the
state and for civic life, that

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.960
is, human culture.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:02.060
So the Titans represent merely
these natural forces and not

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:05.840
yet more developed
individual personalities.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:11.090
This is also the case with the
god Oceanus, who was merely

00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:13.130
[INAUDIBLE] from the
earlier group of gods,

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:16.040
from the Titans, who
represents the symbol

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.960
for the force of the sea.

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.125
By contrast, the analogous
god among the Olympians,

00:42:20.125 --> 00:42:23.230
that is Poseidon, has
other characteristics

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:26.500
that transcend the
merely natural power.

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.130
In addition to
being the wild force

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:31.220
of the sea like his
predecessor, Poseidon also

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:34.400
has qualities associated
with human life and culture,

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.520
for example, the
building or construction

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.900
or the breeding of horses.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.750
The comparison of these
two generations of gods

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:44.150
represents for
Hegel, symbolically,

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:49.112
the movement of religion from
natural religion to spirit.

00:42:49.112 --> 00:42:50.570
And here I think
you can see if you

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:53.340
look at some of the
images, the ancient images,

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.520
you can see the kind of
thing that Hegel is talking.

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.310
For example, here
in this mosaic.

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:01.090
You see strange imagery.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:04.100
We have Poseidon
riding the chariot

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.100
through the waves,
strange image,

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:08.610
the fish swimming around.

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:12.770
And below him, we have
Oceanus and his wife Tethys.

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:15.750
I look at the way in which
these divinities are portrayed.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:19.820
You look at Poseidon, he
looks like a Greek warrior,

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:23.020
looks like a strong guy.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:26.150
He's mastered certain elements
of human culture, right?

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:28.100
He's riding a chariot,
human technology.

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.900
He's trained horses.

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:33.586
Down below here with Oceanus,
this is not the case.

00:43:33.586 --> 00:43:35.460
First off, he's in this
subordinate position.

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:38.560
He's been exiled into
limbus in the fringes,

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.610
and he no longer plays
a significant role.

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:42.710
But look at the way in
which he's portrayed.

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:46.370
His lower body, actually not in
the picture, is that of a fish.

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:50.180
You have this eel or serpent
thing sort of wandering along.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:54.740
And if you look on his head,
he has the claws of a crab

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.800
or a lobster or
something like that.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.910
He's still nature, right?

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:03.650
He's not quite made it to a
fully human or anthropomorphic

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:04.150
conception.

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:06.734
He's still bound up
with that nature,

00:44:06.734 --> 00:44:07.900
and that natural conception.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.270
Another example that Hegel
gives of how the Greeks have

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:15.860
advanced beyond the
realm of is their use

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.980
of animals as symbols.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:21.350
And here, we can compare
the different images

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:23.760
that we've seen before
with the religions

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.034
that Hegel's traced so far.

00:44:25.034 --> 00:44:26.450
If you'll just
recall those images

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:27.616
that we've looked at before.

00:44:27.616 --> 00:44:31.970
We have the sacred
cow of the Hindus,

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:34.765
where the animals themselves
are something sacred.

00:44:34.765 --> 00:44:38.000
Or for the Egyptians, we
have like the god of Horus,

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.020
who has the head of
a hawk or a falcon.

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:44.660
It's a mixed image, so
there's something sacred

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.000
about the human and
the animal, right?

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.440
They're both together.

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.980
Now compare those
images to these.

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:53.750
Now something entirely
different is going on here.

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:56.690
We have Zeus, who's
entirely anthropomorphic.

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:59.230
He looks like a human
being, but what's happened?

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.100
The animal is reduced.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:05.800
The animal's become a
sidekick, a mascot, a symbol.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.380
He's portrayed with the eagle.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.510
So according to
Hegel's story, the bird

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:15.860
has gone from being a full blown
deity to a symbol in the course

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:17.360
of the development of time.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.130
And parallel to
that development,

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:21.560
it's the human form
which has emerged

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:24.122
as a form of the divine.

00:45:24.122 --> 00:45:27.070
And this is not just
sort of happenstance.

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:28.660
I didn't just pick
these examples.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.750
You can find these all
over Greek mythology.

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:35.210
Here, you have Athena, who
has the owl, Aphrodite,

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:36.604
the sparrow.

00:45:36.604 --> 00:45:38.020
The other Greek
gods and goddesses

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:39.978
have their favorite
animals as symbols as well.

00:45:39.978 --> 00:45:42.920
We saw Poseidon with the horse.

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:45.970
We could also make
the case that we

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:49.210
can see a vestige of this
even in the Gospel writers,

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:54.850
right, who are also portrayed
with animals symbols.

00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:58.750
We have another contrast that
Hegel makes with the Greeks

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:05.530
in Asian religion in terms
of the god or goddess

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:07.060
Artemis or Diana.

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:09.670
He goes back and forth
between the Greek and Roman

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:10.200
designation.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.480
This doesn't matter.

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.725
Here he writes, the
Diana of Ephesus

00:46:16.725 --> 00:46:20.110
is still Asiatic, and is
represented with many breasts

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.840
and covered with
images of animals.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:25.110
She has, in fact, as the
basis of her character,

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:28.960
natural life, the producing
and nourishing power of nature.

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.660
On the other hand,
Diana of the Greeks

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.170
is the huntress
who kills animals.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:39.830
The worship of Artemis
originated in Ephesus

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:43.000
in Asia Minor, so
modern day Turkey,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.510
where her temple was celebrated
throughout the ancient world.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:48.580
This cult was then
later brought to Greece,

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:53.950
where the conception of this
deity was then reconceived.

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:57.130
So for Hegel, it is makes sense,
according to the narrative

00:46:57.130 --> 00:47:01.410
he wants to tell, that this
Asian Artemis, if you will,

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:04.540
is portrayed in this way that
she's associated with nature.

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:07.740
She's wearing animal skins.

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.240
She's continuous with nature.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:16.670
She has multiple breasts,
which look a little bit odd,

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:18.320
but the symbolism
is clear, right?

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:22.780
She's the nourishing
natural goddess

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:25.030
who is looking out for
all of the animals.

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:26.790
you see the different
animal heads below

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:29.560
that she's presumably
protecting.

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:33.730
Now we contrast that to the
Greek Artemis down there.

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:36.340
We're in a completely
different world, right?

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:39.760
The Greek Artemis is, again,
completely anthropomorphic,

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:43.010
looks just like a human
being, looks like a woman.

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:48.151
And here instead of a nurturing
nature, what's Artemis?

00:47:48.151 --> 00:47:49.150
She's the hunter, right?

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:51.260
She is dominating nature.

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:55.300
She's getting ready to kill this
deer that she's just caught.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.350
She's superior to nature.

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:00.130
The natural has lost
the sacred status here.

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:07.200
Another example that Hegel
uses to illustrate his point

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:12.040
has to do with a comparison
and contrast between Egypt

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.020
and the Greeks.

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:16.294
Take the pyramids.

00:48:16.294 --> 00:48:17.210
What are the pyramids?

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:20.650
Of course, we all know they
play an important religious

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:21.370
functions.

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:25.810
The pyramids were the great
funeral monuments to pharaohs.

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:28.360
They're intended to facilitate
the journey of the pharaoh's

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.890
spirit to the world of the dead.

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:33.220
The deceased pharaoh,
however, is not

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:37.360
something who's accessible
to religious believers,

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.950
but rather he's
cut off from them.

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:41.640
They have a series of
different sarcophagi

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.540
in the pyramid itself.

00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:47.400
For Hegel, this represents a
form of religious alienation.

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:51.280
Let me explain what he means
by that just by comparison

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.860
with Greek architecture.

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.740
When one thinks about the
Parthenon and other public

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:59.640
temples or sanctuaries on
the Acropolis at Athens,

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:02.620
they are open and accessible,
inviting the citizen

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:05.090
to come and enter.

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:07.600
They're elaborately
decorated precisely in order

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.670
to be viewed from the outside.

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:12.100
These structures are
located in prominent places

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.530
where the citizens
came together and met

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:17.230
to attend to public business.

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:22.230
They in a certain sense beckoned
the visitor to approach.

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:28.060
So the building of the Parthenon
played an important role here,

00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:31.570
primarily to showcase the great
sculpture of the patron deity

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:36.300
Athena, which is made accessible
to the Greeks on festival days.

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:40.060
Also the image is
shown on Greek coins.

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.990
So for Hegel, what the
Greek mind is all about here

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:44.800
is transparency.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:48.040
It's simply showing
immediately the divine

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.260
without anything
hidden or mysterious.

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:53.470
These great monuments are
intended to show things

00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:55.940
and not to hide things.

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:59.380
He thinks, think of this in
contrast to the Egyptians.

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.600
After the completion
of the pyramids,

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.521
the entrances are sealed
and hidden from view.

00:50:03.521 --> 00:50:04.770
We tend to forget this, right?

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:07.630
We're used to seeing all
these great shows about Egypt

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:09.370
on Discovery Channel
or something,

00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:11.830
where they take you
inside the pyramid.

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:14.280
you weren't supposed to
ever see that stuff, right?

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.540
The thing was closed off.

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:20.410
The only thing that the average
religious believer or whatever,

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:23.780
the devotee, could see
was from the outside.

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.610
And there on the
outside of the pyramids,

00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:28.750
there's nothing striking
or ornamental about it

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:31.900
apart from the massive size.

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:35.710
By contrast, the Parthenon
is elaborately decorated

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:37.810
with these detailed
friezes depicting

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:39.980
scenes of Greek mythology.

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.370
The visitors enjoined
to stop to contemplate

00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:44.480
those depictions at length.

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.960
So indeed one needs to
come up close in order

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:49.390
to see them properly.

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:53.590
And so the idea for Hegel
is that the monuments

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:57.790
for the Egyptians are intended
not to reveal or to clarify,

00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:01.080
to explain something, but
rather to hide something within.

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:03.400
It's all about a
mystery or an enigma

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:07.810
that you're left to sort
of puzzle about afterwards,

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:10.480
whereas for the Greek
mind, according to Hegel,

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:14.110
has sort of reached this point
of realization of what spirit

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:17.320
is and that's why
it's able to make

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:18.560
this transparent to people.

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:21.401
There's nothing that's
mysterious about it.

00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:27.820
There's a somewhat
odd result that

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:31.690
comes from this analysis, which
I suggested at the beginning.

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:33.220
Although Hegel's
stated goal here

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:36.700
is to demonstrate that
the truth of Christianity,

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:39.820
in fact, his methodology
demonstrates something that's

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:42.400
quite different, namely
that the different religions

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:45.430
of the world all have
certain common features

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:48.490
in the course of
their development.

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:51.670
The Greek religion runs through
the same developmental pattern

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:53.970
as the religions of nature.

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:55.720
And moreover, there
are still vestiges

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:59.080
of the religions of nature,
even in Christianity.

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.450
So this means that there's
no one religion which

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:03.300
has a monopoly on truth.

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.520
Instead, religion is
a fundamental aspect

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.890
of the human
experience, and truth

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:12.190
can be found in all
religious traditions.

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:15.040
In this sense, Hegel can
be said to anticipate

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:16.110
the modern movement.

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:18.430
We know it today as
comparative theology,

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:21.850
which attempts to compare
various doctrines and dogmas

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:23.710
across different
religions in order

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:26.740
to determine their
commonalities or differences.

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.480
This movement thus
believes, for example,

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.600
that Christian truths can be
found in Buddhist or Hindu

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.930
texts, and vice versa.

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:36.460
Some might say that
this is reading

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:39.440
Hegel against his own
goals and intentions,

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.580
and I'm open to this criticism.

00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:43.990
I can acknowledge that
to a certain degree,

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:46.796
but I don't feel like
I'm doing violence

00:52:46.796 --> 00:52:48.670
to the text with this
reading because I think

00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:50.350
this is-- if you
read the text, you

00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:51.940
see what he's doing
methodologically.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:55.110
This is what he's seeing.

00:52:55.110 --> 00:52:57.755
Although, to be sure, there's
a lot in Hegel's lectures

00:52:57.755 --> 00:53:00.719
that we should
reject, even condemn,

00:53:00.719 --> 00:53:02.260
but I also think
there's a lot that's

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:04.870
intriguing and
insightful, especially

00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:06.790
in our modern
globalized world, which

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:10.570
is so fraught with religious
prejudice, misunderstanding,

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:11.380
and conflict.

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:15.610
I think he's still got a
valuable message for us.

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:18.310
Religious belief and
practice are a universal part

00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:21.534
of the human experience
that we can't escape.

00:53:21.534 --> 00:53:23.200
This is an experience
that we all share,

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.930
regardless of what denomination
we personally belong to.

00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:28.870
And so Hegel's plea
is that it's not

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:32.400
that is often thought we should
simply stand back and celebrate

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.570
Christianity as the
truest and best religion

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:37.280
to the exclusion
of everything else.

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:41.080
Instead, I think his view, which
maintains its relevance for us

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:44.650
today, is rather that
this quotation here,

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:47.230
in every religion there
is a divine presence,

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:49.570
a divine relation,
and philosophy

00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:51.970
has to seek out the
spiritual element in the most

00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:53.810
different forms.

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:57.760
And so his idea is, he
often uses the metaphor

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:01.110
of a plant, right, the
plant being humanity, which

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:02.949
is growing in different ways.

00:54:02.949 --> 00:54:04.990
And so Although you can
look at different aspects

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:08.180
of the plants, the seed, or the
stalk or the leaf or whatever

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:09.740
and they look very,
very different

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.323
the way religions
look very different.

00:54:11.323 --> 00:54:13.720
Instead, they're a part of
the same organic growth,

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:17.340
the same way humanity
is an organic growth.

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:21.490
And I think those are the kind
of images that are useful,

00:54:21.490 --> 00:54:24.550
so the point is that
for Hegel, there's

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:25.880
a truth in all religions.

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:30.040
And if we can take a right
philosophical approach,

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:32.200
then we can learn
to recognize them.

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.550
And I think this is
a valuable lesson

00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:41.110
that he can share with us today
in our modern globalized world.

00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:44.290
So I thank you for your
attention and interest.

00:54:44.290 --> 00:54:46.090
