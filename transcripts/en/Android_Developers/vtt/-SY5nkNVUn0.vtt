00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:01.740
MALE SPEAKER: Since
Android 2.0, you've

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.490
been able to take
advantage of instant run

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.150
to dramatically increase
your incremental builds.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.920
But did you know
that Android 2.1

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.460
enables Dex in Process
to improve the time taken

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.990
for full builds, as well
as improving instant run

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.100
performance?

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.780
Dex in Process allows
multiple Dex processes

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.900
to run within a single VM
that's also shared with Gradle,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.150
a feature that significantly
improves build times,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.080
including initial
and clean builds.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.080
That means you need to
increase the maximum heap

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.550
size of the Gradle daemon
to incorporate the memory

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.620
requirements of
the Dex processes.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.780
Open your project's
gradle.properties,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.795
and modify it from the
default value of one gig

00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:35.970
to at least two.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.370
We're incorporating the
memory requirements of Dex.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.680
So if you've increased
the Java max heap

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.840
size in your module
level build.gradle file

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.870
from default of one
gig, you'll need

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.260
to increase the Gradle
daemon's VM size accordingly.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.590
The best values vary, so
experiment with the max heap

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.930
size and Gradle daemon
VM values to see

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.810
what values work best for you.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.270
Upgrade to Android
Studio 2.1 now,

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.410
and increase the memory
allocation of your Gradle

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.239
daemon VM to at least two
gigs, to enable Dex in Process

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.840
and enjoy much faster
build times for all

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.020
your Android projects.
