It's always intimidating [LAUGH]
when you start with a blank sheet.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.770
I can't tell you how many times I've
gone to start writing some article and

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.790
I'm just looking at the blank page and
I'm thinking, where do I start?

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.681
Do you get that feeling sometimes,
Duran,

00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:16.222
when you start with something new?

00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:17.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's hard.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.650
You have to kind of psych yourself up.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.830
Everyone has their own techniques for
just getting moving on a project.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.870
Often you can just start with the things
you know, like you're going to use

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.020
a model view, some kind of controller
thing, so what can you start adding?

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.040
If it's a map,
maybe you're talking about places,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.740
just finding some place you can start
and just start adding things and

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.410
then eventually the questions
will maybe just come.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.296
But yeah, staring at that blank
sheet of paper, as you say,

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.010
is definitely difficult.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.280
I would say too, kind of just pick one
part of the project to figure out first.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.330
Whether it's the list view, whether you
want to get the search box working,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.370
whether you want to get
parts of the map working.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.840
I would pick one thing,
kind of figure out bits and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.710
pieces of it,
kind of put that part together.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.190
And also, don't hesitate to kind of
step away from the big project and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.750
maybe start just a little sample
project where you're like,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.690
I'm really having a hard time figuring
out how to sort stuff in my list or

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.320
how to get all my markers to
have unique info windows.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.940
It's good practice to maybe just say,
okay,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.740
I think I've done a lot on my project,
I don't want to break what I have,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.330
let me kind of write something up here
and just sort of a little side project.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.230
And see if I can get this
functionality working and

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.950
then figure out how to apply it back to
my architecture that I've designed here.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.480
I do that a lot myself.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.128
There's a lot of times where
I'm working on a project and

00:01:53.128 --> 00:01:57.918
I'm like, I can't figure out how to
get this navigation to pop out right.

00:01:57.918 --> 00:02:00.459
So I kind of make a little dummy site.

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.290
I kind of play around with things.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.330
It's easy for me to do it that way
because it's on a much smaller scale,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.783
and I'm less worried about breaking
a ton of [LAUGH] stuff in the process or

00:02:12.783 --> 00:02:15.930
having to do like 100 git commits or
something.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.260
It's definitely useful
to take a step back,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.260
look at sort of the smaller problems and
knock out some smaller things first.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.735
&gt;&gt; This is the first project where
student's aren't really given anything.

00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:35.300
[INAUDIBLE] but they don't really
any code to begin with, so

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.869
all the projects before this they were
given some sort of template code or

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.908
something to work off of.

00:02:42.908 --> 00:02:47.510
And I think just opening up your text
editor to just a blank page could be

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.470
a little daunting at first, especially
for someone who's really new at this.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.146
What kind of advice would you
give to somebody who's kind of

00:02:56.146 --> 00:02:57.919
faced with this blank page?

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:03.986
&gt;&gt; Well, first I'll tell you that
as someone who's been coding for

00:03:03.986 --> 00:03:10.071
a long time, I still get writers
block from a blank page, right.

00:03:10.071 --> 00:03:10.953
&gt;&gt; I do too.

00:03:10.953 --> 00:03:11.848
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I do too.

00:03:11.848 --> 00:03:15.630
&gt;&gt; It's not something that
entirely goes away, but

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.793
it is something we get better at, right?

00:03:18.793 --> 00:03:23.881
If you open up your text editor and
there's nothing there,

00:03:23.881 --> 00:03:27.557
right, so
what do we know should be there?

00:03:27.557 --> 00:03:29.720
Well, we definitely need an HTML file.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.525
Without an HTML file,
you got nothing, right?

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:34.370
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So you need an HTML file.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.690
You need all of the basic
HTML [INAUDIBLE], right?

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.760
Depending on your tools,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.220
you can actually install plug-ins
instead of just put all of the doc

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.590
type HTML, HTML head, body,
all that stuff in there for you.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.943
So that unblankifies the page
a little bit, right?

00:03:53.943 --> 00:03:57.532
But still, effectively,
you don't have any content,

00:03:57.532 --> 00:04:00.615
any stuff that you've put on your page,
right?

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:03.440
You also need to link up
your CSS file probably.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.333
Unless you're making something that's
just, I don't know, a proof of concept,

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:09.070
a CSS stylus.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.190
You also need a JavaScript file,
at least one.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.615
You also have multiple [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:13.615 --> 00:04:19.129
It depends on how you want
to organize your code,

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:23.439
but then, where do you go from there?

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:26.343
And I'd suppose if,
I can tell you I would do.

00:04:26.343 --> 00:04:30.343
I can't really tell,
I can't speak for everyone, but

00:04:30.343 --> 00:04:35.549
what I would do is I would start by,
I wouldn't worry about the styling.

00:04:35.549 --> 00:04:38.830
I wouldn't worry about CSS or
any of that stuff.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.156
I would just put some divs on
the page that represent the different

00:04:43.156 --> 00:04:44.750
areas, right.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.060
We know we need a map.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.040
So I don't look at the Google Maps.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.671
But actually even before you that,

00:04:53.671 --> 00:04:58.340
I would try to get an idea of how
generally to get started with Knockout.

00:04:59.925 --> 00:05:02.890
Well, I might even go to
the Knockout homepage and

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.190
look at the very basic examples and just
get their examples of writing, right?

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.920
Even though I don't necessarily need
a text box that says hello or a but

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.810
box says the same thing.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.716
I may not need that, but
it gets something on the screen.

00:05:18.716 --> 00:05:21.189
And once you have
something on the screen,

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:25.102
you can be like, that's right okay,
I've got observables,

00:05:25.102 --> 00:05:28.484
I've got data binding,
a data bind to connect things up.

00:05:28.484 --> 00:05:33.009
All right, now my memory is jogged,
I'm ready to move forward so

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:34.460
I want to put a list.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.694
All right, so what could I use?

00:05:36.694 --> 00:05:39.570
An observable, an observable array.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.270
How do I connect that up, all right,
let's look at that example, right,

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.350
that's how that works.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.360
So it's not so

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.509
much about necessarily going in
the right direction right at the start.

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:56.274
It's about getting your bearings and-
&gt;&gt; Maybe it's kind of

00:05:56.274 --> 00:05:57.830
picking something to begin.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.480
&gt;&gt; Picking something,
just go in some direction, right?

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.651
&gt;&gt; Don't go off the deep end.

00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:08.012
Don't start coding in a different
framework than you append to,

00:06:08.012 --> 00:06:10.799
obviously, but this builds something.

00:06:10.799 --> 00:06:15.551
Once you've built something, it'll be so
much easier to course correct,

00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:19.130
change your course towards
where you ultimately end up.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.180
So that's a little bit about how I work.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.360
I don't know, it may not be for
everybody but that's been useful for me.
