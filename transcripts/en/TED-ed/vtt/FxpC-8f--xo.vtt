00:00:06.655 --> 00:00:09.547
On October 4, 1957,

00:00:09.547 --> 00:00:12.439
the world watched in awe and fear

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.133
as the Soviet Union launched Sputnik,

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.442
the world's first man-made satellite,

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:18.743
into space.

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:20.982
This little metal ball,

00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:23.072
smaller than two feet in diameter,

00:00:23.072 --> 00:00:24.865
launched a space race

00:00:24.865 --> 00:00:27.190
between the U.S. and U.S.S.R.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.214
that would last for eighteen years

00:00:29.214 --> 00:00:31.906
and change the world as we know it.

00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:34.045
Sputnik was actually not the first piece

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:36.225
of human technology to enter space.

00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:38.967
That superlative goes to the V-2 rocket

00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:41.012
used by Germany in missile attacks

00:00:41.012 --> 00:00:43.357
against Allied cities as a last-ditch effort

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.752
in the final years of World War II.

00:00:45.752 --> 00:00:47.238
It wasn't very effective,

00:00:47.238 --> 00:00:48.943
but, at the end of the war,

00:00:48.943 --> 00:00:51.733
both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had captured

00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.730
the technology and the scientists that had developed it

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.577
and began using them for their own projects.

00:00:57.577 --> 00:00:59.510
And by August 1957,

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.253
the Soviet's successfully tested

00:01:01.253 --> 00:01:05.670
the first intercontinental ballistic missile, the R-7,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.665
the same rocket that would be used

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:09.101
to launch Sputnik two months later.

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:10.659
So, the scary thing about Sputnik

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.562
was not the orbiting ball itself,

00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:14.511
but the fact that the same technology

00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:18.063
could be used to launch a nuclear warhead at any city.

00:01:18.063 --> 00:01:20.116
Not wanting to fall too far behind,

00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:22.160
President Eisenhower ordered the Navy

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.687
to speed up its own project

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:26.724
and launch a satellite as soon as possible.

00:01:26.724 --> 00:01:29.730
So, on December 6, 1957,

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.480
excited people across the nation

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.721
tuned in to watch the live broadcast

00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:37.351
as the Vanguard TV3 satellite took off

00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:40.260
and crashed to the ground two seconds later.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.568
The Vanguard failure was a huge embarassment

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:44.209
for the United States.

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:45.526
Newspapers printed headlines like,

00:01:45.526 --> 00:01:47.830
"Flopnik" and "Kaputnik."

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.989
And a Soviet delegate at the U.N. mockingly suggested

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:53.068
that the U.S. should receive foreign aid

00:01:53.068 --> 00:01:55.143
for developing nations.

00:01:56.404 --> 00:01:58.258
Fortunately, the Army had been working

00:01:58.258 --> 00:02:01.015
on their own parallel project, The Explorer,

00:02:01.015 --> 00:02:05.483
which was successfully launched in January 1958,

00:02:05.483 --> 00:02:07.547
but the U.S. had barely managed to catch up

00:02:07.547 --> 00:02:09.438
before they were surpassed again

00:02:09.438 --> 00:02:12.362
as Yuri Gargarin became the first man in space

00:02:12.362 --> 00:02:15.575
in April 1961.

00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:16.729
Almost a year passed

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.677
and several more Soviet astronauts

00:02:18.677 --> 00:02:19.824
completed their missions

00:02:19.824 --> 00:02:21.742
before Project Mercury succeeded

00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:24.100
in making John Glenn the first American

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.699
in orbit in February 1962.

00:02:31.346 --> 00:02:33.489
By this time, President Kennedy had realized

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.743
that simply catching up

00:02:34.743 --> 00:02:37.233
to each Soviet advance a few months later

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:38.640
wasn't going to cut it.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.153
The U.S. had to do something first,

00:02:41.153 --> 00:02:44.869
and in May 1961, a month after Gargarin's flight,

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:46.184
he announced the goal

00:02:46.184 --> 00:02:47.825
of putting a man on the moon

00:02:47.825 --> 00:02:50.224
by the end of the 1960s.

00:02:50.224 --> 00:02:52.962
They succeeded in this through the Apollo program

00:02:52.962 --> 00:02:55.442
with Neil Armstrong taking his famous step

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:58.784
on July 20, 1969.

00:02:58.784 --> 00:03:01.040
With both countries' next turning their attention

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.851
to orbital space stations,

00:03:02.851 --> 00:03:04.489
there's no telling how much longer

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.936
the space race could have gone on.

00:03:06.936 --> 00:03:08.549
But because of improving relations

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.316
negotiated by Soviet Premier Leonid Breshnev

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:13.064
and U.S. President Nixon,

00:03:13.064 --> 00:03:16.283
the U.S.S.R. and U.S. moved toward cooperation

00:03:16.283 --> 00:03:18.294
rather than competition.

00:03:18.294 --> 00:03:19.996
The successful joint mission,

00:03:19.996 --> 00:03:21.548
known as Apollo-Soyuz,

00:03:21.548 --> 00:03:23.528
in which an American Apollo spacecraft

00:03:23.528 --> 00:03:25.865
docked with a Soviet Soyuz craft

00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:27.415
and the two crews met,

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:28.065
shook hands,

00:03:28.065 --> 00:03:29.285
and exchanged gifts,

00:03:29.285 --> 00:03:33.264
marked the end of the space race in 1975.

00:03:33.264 --> 00:03:34.892
So, in the end, what was the point

00:03:34.892 --> 00:03:36.438
of this whole space race?

00:03:36.438 --> 00:03:38.729
Was it just a massive waste of time?

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.052
Two major superpowers trying to outdo each other

00:03:41.052 --> 00:03:42.880
by pursuing symbolic projects

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.889
that were both dangerous and expensive,

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.221
using resources that could have been

00:03:46.221 --> 00:03:48.047
better spent elsewhere?

00:03:48.047 --> 00:03:50.228
Well, sure, sort of,

00:03:50.228 --> 00:03:52.041
but the biggest benefits of the space program

00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:55.469
had nothing to do with one country beating another.

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:56.699
During the space race,

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.348
funding for research and education, in general,

00:03:59.348 --> 00:04:00.848
increased dramatically,

00:04:00.848 --> 00:04:02.164
leading to many advances

00:04:02.164 --> 00:04:04.334
that may not have otherwise been made.

00:04:04.334 --> 00:04:06.761
Many NASA technologies developed for space

00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:09.334
are now widely used in civilian life,

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:11.080
from memory foam in mattresses

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.906
to freeze-dried food,

00:04:12.906 --> 00:04:15.445
to LEDs in cancer treatment.

00:04:15.445 --> 00:04:17.703
And, of course, the satellites that we rely on

00:04:17.703 --> 00:04:19.890
for our GPS and mobile phone signals

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:20.950
would not have been there

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.619
without the space program.

00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:23.890
All of which goes to show

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.567
that the rewards of scientific research and advancement

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:28.007
are often far more vast

00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:31.089
than even the people pursuing them can imagine.
