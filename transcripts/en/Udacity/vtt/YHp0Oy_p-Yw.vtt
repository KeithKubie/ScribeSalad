00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.010
Now it's time for a question. I'm showing

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.070
you three different structures here for the operating

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.220
system. Here are the monolithic structure and here

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.620
is the micro-kernel base structure, and here is the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.030
spin structure with extensions. And the question to

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.990
you is, which of the above structures will

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.080
result in the least number of border crossings?

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.940
Is it the monolithic structure, is it the micro-kernel

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.940
structure, or the spin structure, or

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.646
either spin or monolithic structure? So, these

00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:35.090
are the four choices available to you, for you to pick one correct choice.
