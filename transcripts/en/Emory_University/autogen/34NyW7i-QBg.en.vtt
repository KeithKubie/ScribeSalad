00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.719
context of what we've done you heard
about the fact that when I started my

recovery from brain injury back in the
 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:37.100
recovery from brain injury back in the
1960s and it was all because of the

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110
1960s and it was all because of the
 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.770
1960s and it was all because of the
event of an observation that I had made

I was studying learning and memory and I

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110
I was studying learning and memory and I
 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.779
I was studying learning and memory and I
had some great teachers and we were

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789
had some great teachers and we were
 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.279
had some great teachers and we were

involved in memory storage short and
 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.909
involved in memory storage short and
long-term memory and I was doing this

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919
long-term memory and I was doing this
 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.339
long-term memory and I was doing this
work contented as a graduate student and

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349
work contented as a graduate student and
 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:00.080
work contented as a graduate student and
I was doing these lesions I was trained

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090
I was doing these lesions I was trained
 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.520
I was doing these lesions I was trained
to do the surgery to remove this

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530
to do the surgery to remove this
 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.110
to do the surgery to remove this
structure and look at the deficits that

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120
structure and look at the deficits that
 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.330
structure and look at the deficits that
followed everything was going along fine

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340
followed everything was going along fine
 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.180
followed everything was going along fine
and then I noticed that about 30% of my

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190
and then I noticed that about 30% of my
 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.870
and then I noticed that about 30% of my
animals were perfectly normal and I knew

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880
animals were perfectly normal and I knew
 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.279
animals were perfectly normal and I knew
I had done the surgery on time so my

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289
I had done the surgery on time so my
 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:14.749
I had done the surgery on time so my
first response is Oh nuts

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759
first response is Oh nuts
 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:16.790
first response is Oh nuts
I've done really bad surgery and you

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800
I've done really bad surgery and you
 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.770
I've done really bad surgery and you
know I've got it now add more animals so

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780
know I've got it now add more animals so
 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.689
know I've got it now add more animals so
this is a surgical group but when I went

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699
this is a surgical group but when I went
 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.159
this is a surgical group but when I went
and we moved the brains to do the

and we moved the brains to do the
 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.040
and we moved the brains to do the
histology those animals that did

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400
were running and he said don't study
 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.159
were running and he said don't study
that he said it's just normal variation

your life here is a PhD student rather
than getting your degree and I had a

than getting your degree and I had a
 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.330
than getting your degree and I had a
baby and a young wife and you know

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340
baby and a young wife and you know

$1,800 a year stipend so I had to play a

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919
$1,800 a year stipend so I had to play a
 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.180
$1,800 a year stipend so I had to play a
little politics here and I managed to

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190
little politics here and I managed to
 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.420
little politics here and I managed to
finish up and go to MIT where I began to

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430
finish up and go to MIT where I began to
 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.769
finish up and go to MIT where I began to
do other work in other parts of the

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:06.779
do other work in other parts of the
 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:08.149
do other work in other parts of the
brain and so the same kind of phenomenon

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159
brain and so the same kind of phenomenon
 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.820
brain and so the same kind of phenomenon
that you could get a lot of damage in

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830
that you could get a lot of damage in
 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.290
that you could get a lot of damage in
depending on how that damage was

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300
depending on how that damage was
 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.570
depending on how that damage was
inflicted and still get a lot of

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580
inflicted and still get a lot of
 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.769
inflicted and still get a lot of
functional recovery and this was a

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:15.779
functional recovery and this was a
 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:17.659
functional recovery and this was a
puzzle because in the day that I was a

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669
puzzle because in the day that I was a
 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.209
puzzle because in the day that I was a
student and as a young professor we were

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219
student and as a young professor we were
 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:22.580
student and as a young professor we were
teaching and being taught that once the

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590
teaching and being taught that once the
 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.519
teaching and being taught that once the
adult brain is injured there's no repair

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:25.529
adult brain is injured there's no repair
 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:27.709
adult brain is injured there's no repair
there's no regeneration and all you can

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:27.719
there's no regeneration and all you can
 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:30.709
there's no regeneration and all you can
hope for is some type of retraining

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:30.719
hope for is some type of retraining
 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:32.689
hope for is some type of retraining
that's what rehabilitation is all about

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699
that's what rehabilitation is all about
 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.360
that's what rehabilitation is all about
is to teach you to cope with the deficit

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370
is to teach you to cope with the deficit
 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.649
is to teach you to cope with the deficit
that you're just going to have to live

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659
that you're just going to have to live
 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:37.800
that you're just going to have to live
with for the rest

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810
with for the rest
 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.680
with for the rest
and I got the same story at MIT this is

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690
and I got the same story at MIT this is
 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.840
and I got the same story at MIT this is
you know not something that's worthy of

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850
you know not something that's worthy of
 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.760
you know not something that's worthy of
serious study everybody knows how the

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770
serious study everybody knows how the
 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.470
serious study everybody knows how the
brain is localized and has all these

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:46.480
brain is localized and has all these
 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.030
brain is localized and has all these
different functions and once you damage

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040
different functions and once you damage
 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.340
different functions and once you damage
that structure that's the end of it so

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350
that structure that's the end of it so
 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.170
that structure that's the end of it so
you know it bothered me and I couldn't

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180
you know it bothered me and I couldn't
 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.580
you know it bothered me and I couldn't
do much about it until I got my first

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590
do much about it until I got my first
 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.260
do much about it until I got my first
job and I ended up going to a small

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270
job and I ended up going to a small
 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.900
job and I ended up going to a small

space pioneer was and that's where they
 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.760
space pioneer was and that's where they
developed the pill with Hudson colon and

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770
developed the pill with Hudson colon and
 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.080
developed the pill with Hudson colon and
Gregory Pincus so it's a very kind of

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.090
Gregory Pincus so it's a very kind of
 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.300
Gregory Pincus so it's a very kind of
odd place and they let me explore all

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:12.310
odd place and they let me explore all
 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.010
odd place and they let me explore all
this stuff and that's where we first

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.020
this stuff and that's where we first
 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.630
this stuff and that's where we first
made the observation when I was looking

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:15.640
made the observation when I was looking
 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.490
made the observation when I was looking
at still in all these laboratory rats

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500
at still in all these laboratory rats
 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.010

that we decided to look at sex

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:20.020
that we decided to look at sex
 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.380

differences are between males and
 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.510
differences are between males and
females so we decided to look at this

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520
females so we decided to look at this
 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.510
females so we decided to look at this
and what we found was that when we

estrus cycle at the time they had their
 

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.460
estrus cycle at the time they had their
injury and the estrus cycle is like the

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:11.470
injury and the estrus cycle is like the
 

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.800

told us how to look at this and so we

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:25.390
told us how to look at this and so we
 

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.120

what do you mean you're gonna give a

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:12.380
what do you mean you're gonna give a
 

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.640
what do you mean you're gonna give a
female hormone to male rats and see what

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:15.650
female hormone to male rats and see what
 

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.020
female hormone to male rats and see what
happens it doesn't make any sense

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:17.030
happens it doesn't make any sense
 

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.970

sure enough we found that in the male

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:40.100
sure enough we found that in the male

treatment the outcome was so much better
 

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.450
treatment the outcome was so much better
than if they were not given the

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:46.460
than if they were not given the
 

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.530
than if they were not given the
treatment the only difference was

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:47.540
treatment the only difference was
 

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.930
treatment the only difference was
whether they got a three-day treatment

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:49.940
whether they got a three-day treatment
 

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.730

Forum and I was on a work which is now

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:05.390
Forum and I was on a work which is now
 

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.050
Forum and I was on a work which is now
much more developed and a general got up

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:08.060
much more developed and a general got up
 

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.550
much more developed and a general got up
after my presentation and he said you

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:09.560
after my presentation and he said you
 

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.140
after my presentation and he said you
know that's all well and good doctor

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:11.150
know that's all well and good doctor

Stein but don't you think this treatment

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:12.680
Stein but don't you think this treatment
 

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.610
Stein but don't you think this treatment
could turn some of our troops gay so I'm

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:15.620
could turn some of our troops gay so I'm
 

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.590

00:16:40.479 --> 00:16:40.489
patients enroll all over the European
 

00:16:40.489 --> 00:16:42.220

Singapore and China so it's really

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:45.980
Singapore and China so it's really
 

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.729
Singapore and China so it's really
become a major operation in a sense and

00:16:48.729 --> 00:16:48.739
become a major operation in a sense and
 

00:16:48.739 --> 00:16:50.859
become a major operation in a sense and
this trial will in these two trials will

00:16:50.859 --> 00:16:50.869
this trial will in these two trials will
 

00:16:50.869 --> 00:16:52.509
this trial will in these two trials will
enroll close to three thousand patients

00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519
enroll close to three thousand patients
 

00:16:52.519 --> 00:16:55.239
enroll close to three thousand patients
and if it works and so far none of the

00:16:55.239 --> 00:16:55.249
and if it works and so far none of the
 

00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:57.009
and if it works and so far none of the
trials have there been any adverse

00:16:57.009 --> 00:16:57.019
trials have there been any adverse
 

00:16:57.019 --> 00:16:58.269
trials have there been any adverse
events through the treatment which is

00:16:58.269 --> 00:16:58.279
events through the treatment which is
 

00:16:58.279 --> 00:16:59.979
events through the treatment which is
again pretty amazing because now this

00:16:59.979 --> 00:16:59.989
again pretty amazing because now this
 

00:16:59.989 --> 00:17:02.019
again pretty amazing because now this
close to 600 patients there was a

China which even just took severe brain

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.010
China which even just took severe brain
 

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.500
China which even just took severe brain
injury patients and they looked at three

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:08.510
injury patients and they looked at three
 

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:09.909
injury patients and they looked at three
months and six months out and found

00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919
months and six months out and found
 

00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:12.340
months and six months out and found
almost exactly the same results as we

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:12.350
almost exactly the same results as we
 

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:15.490
almost exactly the same results as we
did so where are we going now this is an

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:15.500
did so where are we going now this is an
 

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.610

to be very very promising what's

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:25.069
to be very very promising what's
 

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:27.100
to be very very promising what's
happening now is that it's moving off in

happening now is that it's moving off in
 

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:28.480
happening now is that it's moving off in

get the FDA to approve it and to go
 

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.510
get the FDA to approve it and to go
forward with that and so that should

forward with that and so that should
 

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.220
forward with that and so that should
start probably and that will be run by

severe traumatic brain injury so that's
 

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.390
severe traumatic brain injury so that's
in the planning stage and we're working

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400
in the planning stage and we're working
 

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.190
in the planning stage and we're working
very closely with them to develop all

very closely with them to develop all
 

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.320
very closely with them to develop all
the preclinical data we need to inform

now but the politics and the sociology

00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900
now but the politics and the sociology
 

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.840
now but the politics and the sociology
of science preclude that and it's

of science preclude that and it's
 

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.580
of science preclude that and it's
probably just as well that we get the

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:01.590
probably just as well that we get the
 

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:05.150
probably just as well that we get the
safety data and lastly it took years

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160

medical school I was already a PhD with

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:02.580
medical school I was already a PhD with
 

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:06.020
medical school I was already a PhD with
an interest in normal processes and I

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:06.030
an interest in normal processes and I
 

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.780
an interest in normal processes and I
was severely disappointed by my

was severely disappointed by my
 

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.580
was severely disappointed by my
experience in medical school because

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:10.590
experience in medical school because
 

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:13.160
experience in medical school because
there was no health or normality on the

there was no health or normality on the
 

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:16.540
there was no health or normality on the
horizon and I found that to be

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:16.550
horizon and I found that to be
 

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:20.480
horizon and I found that to be
fundamentally disturbing so coming full

very serious conversation they sat down
 

00:27:50.459 --> 00:27:54.409
very serious conversation they sat down
and said look it's a no-brainer if we're

00:27:54.409 --> 00:27:54.419
and said look it's a no-brainer if we're
 

00:27:54.419 --> 00:27:58.039
and said look it's a no-brainer if we're
causing our ill health we need to take

00:27:58.039 --> 00:27:58.049
causing our ill health we need to take
 

00:27:58.049 --> 00:28:00.709
causing our ill health we need to take
the time and focus attention on how what

00:28:00.709 --> 00:28:00.719
the time and focus attention on how what
 

00:28:00.719 --> 00:28:03.379
the time and focus attention on how what
can we do about this how can we begin to

00:28:03.379 --> 00:28:03.389
can we do about this how can we begin to
 

00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:06.680
can we do about this how can we begin to
intervene now that's the beginning of

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:06.690

this is a wonderful new definition

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:25.880
this is a wonderful new definition
 

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.400
this is a wonderful new definition
because in general we think about health

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:28.410
because in general we think about health
 

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:30.560
because in general we think about health
as being some professional thing with

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:30.570
as being some professional thing with
 

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.140
as being some professional thing with
medication but she said you know I was

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:33.150
medication but she said you know I was
 

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:35.870
medication but she said you know I was
an English major and if I realised that

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880
an English major and if I realised that
 

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.540
an English major and if I realised that
what's important to my health is to not

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:38.550
what's important to my health is to not
 

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:41.210
what's important to my health is to not
be stressed and to feel happy then what

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:41.220
be stressed and to feel happy then what
 

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.770
be stressed and to feel happy then what
makes me happiest is going to the

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:42.780
makes me happiest is going to the
 

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.020
makes me happiest is going to the
theatre and if that's good for my health

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:45.030
theatre and if that's good for my health
 

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.550
theatre and if that's good for my health
I'm going to continue to go to the

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560
I'm going to continue to go to the
 

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.810
I'm going to continue to go to the
theatre because it's not my job and it's

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:50.820
theatre because it's not my job and it's
 

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.990
theatre because it's not my job and it's
not money and in that moment was the

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000
not money and in that moment was the
 

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
not money and in that moment was the
best pitch I've heard in a long time for

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:56.010
best pitch I've heard in a long time for
 

00:35:56.010 --> 00:36:00.640
best pitch I've heard in a long time for
a liberal arts education and I mean that

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:00.650
a liberal arts education and I mean that
 

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:04.370
a liberal arts education and I mean that
every person in the end lives in a

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:04.380
every person in the end lives in a
 

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.550
every person in the end lives in a
health sphere that is fundamentally

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560
health sphere that is fundamentally
 

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.870
health sphere that is fundamentally
defined by who they are so that's where

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880
defined by who they are so that's where
 

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.450
defined by who they are so that's where
we are in the science of predictive

we are in the science of predictive
 

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.900
we are in the science of predictive
health it is a new way of thinking about

health it is a new way of thinking about
 

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:20.750
health it is a new way of thinking about
health and in every predictive health we

changing healthcare at large

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:25.650
changing healthcare at large
 

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:29.450
changing healthcare at large
it's a ground-up effort but it's a very

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460
it's a ground-up effort but it's a very
 

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.210
it's a ground-up effort but it's a very
well-grounded effort and it has the

well-grounded effort and it has the
 

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.900
well-grounded effort and it has the
potential of fantastic effects now that

anything feels nobody changes behavior
 

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:47.900
anything feels nobody changes behavior
so you're in a really doomed attempt

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:47.910
so you're in a really doomed attempt
 

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:50.350
so you're in a really doomed attempt
behavioral change is a great challenge

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:50.360
behavioral change is a great challenge
 

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.060
behavioral change is a great challenge
indeed we all know whether it's you

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:53.070
indeed we all know whether it's you
 

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:54.680
indeed we all know whether it's you
wanted to stop smoking or you wanted to

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:54.690
wanted to stop smoking or you wanted to
 

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:55.970
wanted to stop smoking or you wanted to
eat less so you needed to start

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980
eat less so you needed to start
 

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.770
eat less so you needed to start
exercising or pick pick your pick your

exercising or pick pick your pick your
 

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.260
exercising or pick pick your pick your
poison you don't decide one day and

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:00.270
poison you don't decide one day and
 

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:01.700
poison you don't decide one day and
next day well you might do it the next

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:01.710
next day well you might do it the next
 

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:03.290
next day well you might do it the next
day and three weeks later well that was

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:03.300
day and three weeks later well that was
 

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.450
day and three weeks later well that was
my effort or you fell in a hole walking

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:05.460
my effort or you fell in a hole walking
 

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.610
my effort or you fell in a hole walking
and that was exactly what you got for

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:07.620
and that was exactly what you got for
 

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:12.560
and that was exactly what you got for
trying to exercise so how do we do that

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:12.570
trying to exercise so how do we do that
 

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:15.440
trying to exercise so how do we do that
and how do we tackle that end we're also

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:15.450
and how do we tackle that end we're also
 

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:17.810
and how do we tackle that end we're also
working on that and in the Center for

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.820
working on that and in the Center for
 

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.670
working on that and in the Center for
Health Discovery we've had some

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680
Health Discovery we've had some
 

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:25.580
Health Discovery we've had some
wonderful outcomes for the model that we

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:25.590
wonderful outcomes for the model that we
 

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:30.770
wonderful outcomes for the model that we
are research our research has begun and

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:30.780
are research our research has begun and
 

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.980
are research our research has begun and
in the center we've developed a model of

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:33.990
in the center we've developed a model of
 

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:36.550
in the center we've developed a model of
a health partner working with an

a health partner working with an
 

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.410
a health partner working with an
individual so we're working on the level

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:39.420
individual so we're working on the level
 

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:44.390
individual so we're working on the level
of personal health but the protocol is

very simple it's educate give you the
information let me give you your

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:50.490
information let me give you your
 

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:52.820
information let me give you your
thumbprint back on where your health

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:52.830
thumbprint back on where your health
 

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:55.700
thumbprint back on where your health
status is today and then I work with you

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:55.710
status is today and then I work with you
 

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:58.520
status is today and then I work with you
and try and engage you in what do you

00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:58.530
and try and engage you in what do you
 

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:00.760
and try and engage you in what do you
want from this do you want to be healthy

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:00.770
want from this do you want to be healthy
 

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:03.980
want from this do you want to be healthy
you want to be healthier and if so what

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:03.990
you want to be healthier and if so what
 

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:05.740
you want to be healthier and if so what
can we do about it what are your values

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:05.750
can we do about it what are your values
 

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:08.870
can we do about it what are your values
you have to be invested in wanting to do

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880
you have to be invested in wanting to do
 

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.400
you have to be invested in wanting to do
something before you're going to do it

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:10.410
something before you're going to do it
 

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:12.410
something before you're going to do it
and that relationship sets that

and that relationship sets that
 

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.650
and that relationship sets that
groundwork and finally we empower people

at college and the great transition from

at college and the great transition from
 

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.740
at college and the great transition from
adolescence to adulthood and we really

adolescence to adulthood and we really

adolescence to adulthood and we really
wanted to take the model that we did a

wanted to take the model that we did a

but right now what we started to do is
 

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.760
but right now what we started to do is
and we're going to roll it out in August

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:20.770
and we're going to roll it out in August
 

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:22.200
and we're going to roll it out in August
