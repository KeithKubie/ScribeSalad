00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.490
Welcome back.

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:02.990
We're on problem number 13.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.340
And actually, I started problem
number 13 at the end

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.360
of the last video, and then I
realized when I was going

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.400
through the choices that
I wasn't explaining

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.180
it perfectly correctly.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.310
And I have to admit, this is the
first problem that of any

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.950
of the problems we've seen on
the SAT, this is probably the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.520
one that-- the wording
is probably the most

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.110
difficult to interpret.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.940
But I think I've figured
it out now.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.570
So they're saying Kyle's lock
combination consists of three

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.900
two digit numbers.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.420
The combination satisfies
three conditions below.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.710
One number is odd, one number
is a multiple of 5, so we'll

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.540
just write that as times 5, and
then one number is a day

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.805
of the month of Kyle's
birthday.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.790
And actually, this is what
confused me, it actually

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.450
matters that it's his birthday,
not that it's just a

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.940
day of the month, and
I'll show you why.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.840
So let's say we have choice A.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.930
And let me color code
these conditions.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.500
So odd I'll do in
this blue color.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.690
Let me see, and times 5
in this yellow color.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.570
And then-- let me pick another
good color-- brown, the day of

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.820
the month of his birthday.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.560
So the first choice-- and now
let me write these down in a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.780
fairly neutral color,
in this magenta.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:37.340
So choice A says
14, 20, and 13.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.550
So what we can do is, let's see,
one of the numbers has to

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.610
be odd, and only one of
the numbers, right?

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.280
So let's say this one.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.620
This satisfies the odd
condition, and actually only

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.350
satisfies the odd condition.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.670
Then let's see, what number
here is times 5,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.080
a multiple of 5?

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.110
Well, this number-- let me do it
in the yellow-- this number

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.510
is a multiple of 5.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.740
And then, finally, if that one
is the multiple of 5, which

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.620
one has to be the day of the
month of his birthday?

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.840
Well, it's this choice,
right here.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.060
Now what confused me, when I
first did this problem, and

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.840
probably confused you as well,
it says if each number

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.980
satisfies exactly one of the
conditions-- exactly one,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.820
exactly one, right?

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.090
So to me that means that it can
only satisfy one of the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.690
conditions.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.780
And what confused me was that 20
satisfies multiple of five,

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.480
but to me 20 could just
as easily be a

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.390
day of a month, right?

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.070
But the problem that this
encounters is here we have to

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.740
kind of assume that the
14th is his birthday.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.480
Because-- let's put it this
way-- if the 20th was his

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.970
birthday, this works
if, and only if,

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.670
the 14th is his birthday.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.010
Which it could be.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.940
And if the 14th is his birthday,
then 20 doesn't

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.440
satisfy the day of the month
of his birthday.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.870
It satisfies a day of the month,
it wouldn't satisfy the

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.030
day of the month of
his birthday.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.700
That might seem a little
technical, but I think you'll

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.290
see why I have to make that
distinction, as you go

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.690
on to choice B.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.190
Choice B says-- let me do it in
that neutral color-- it's

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.870
14, 25, and 13.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.610
So here, once again, 13
satisfies the odd criteria.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.950
We could say that 14-- we'll
assume that his birthday is

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.050
the 14th, we don't know, they
haven't told us, but

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.000
it could be, right?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.575
That's what they're asking, what
could be the combination

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:41.790
of the lock.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.840
So we'll say that the 14th
could be his birthday.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.840
And if the 14th is
his birthday,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.800
what does 25 satisfy?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.620
Well, 25 now satisfies the odd
criteria, and it satisfies the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.450
multiple of 5 criteria.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.080
So this option, choice
B, does not work.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.175
Because 25 satisfies two
of the criteria.

00:04:04.175 --> 00:04:06.540
And I know what you're saying,
well look, in choice A,

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.400
doesn't 20 satisfy
two criteria?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.660
Doesn't it satisfy that it could
be a day of the month?

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.330
And what I'm saying is, if we
assume that the 14th is his

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.579
birthday, than 20
does not satisfy

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.630
the day of his birthday.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.910
Right?

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.769
We're assuming the 14th
is his birthday.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:22.750
I want you to think
that about it.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.570
20 satisfies a potential day of
the month, but if we assume

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.610
his birthday is the 14th,
then obviously

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.800
20th is not the 14th.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.750
And we could go through
the other choices.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.920
Choice C says 15-- let
me do it in a neutral

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.770
color-- 15, 18, 16.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.640
And here, let's say one
of them has to be odd.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.400
There's only one odd option
here, it's this one.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.730
One of them has to be
a multiple of 5.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.100
Well, there's no multiples of
5 here, so we know that C is

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.990
not the right answer.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:04.370
D-- 20, 15, 20.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.760
Well here we have two of the
same number, so they're going

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.570
to satisfy the same criteria.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.480
So they're each either going
to satisfy two criteria, or

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.470
they're each going
to satisfy none.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.860
And they actually both satisfy--
you know, there's

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.540
only one odd one here, so one of
the 20's has to satisfy the

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.340
day of the month of
his birthday.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.980
But if the day of the month of
his birthday is 20th, and then

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.600
we used the multiple of five
as being the 20th as well,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.470
then both of these numbers
satisfy the day of his

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.120
birthday, and a multiple of 5.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.940
So that can't be the choice.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.240
Then E, choice E-- let me do it
in a neutral color again--

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.630
is 34, 30, 21.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.620
And see 34, it's not odd, it's
not a multiple of 5, and it

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.660
can't be a day of the month of
someone's birthday, so that

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.160
one doesn't work.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.470
I think these three are
obvious to you,

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.930
why they don't work.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.150
Here the subtlety is that
this criteria isn't just

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.070
a day of the month.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:08.020
The criteria doesn't just say,
any number between 1 and 31.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.470
It has to be the day of the
month of his birthday.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.770
So we have to kind of pick, we
have to say, let's assume that

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.250
his birthday is the 14th.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.630
If his birthday is the 14th,
and this is the day of the

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.390
month of his birthday, then 20
is of course not the day of

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.170
the month of his birthday.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.000
So it doesn't satisfy
this criterion.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.080
It only satisfies times 5.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.160
So that's how you have to think
about it, and I have to

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.140
completely admit that I think
that this is a little bit of a

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.830
too nuanced question.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.900
Out of the five tests we've done
so far, this is the first

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.250
one that I had to take a little
bit of off time to

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.730
figure out on my own.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.800
Let's move on to the next
problem, now that we have that

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.050
one out of the way.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.930
Problem number 14.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.310
Just hope you don't face that
when you take the SAT.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:01.000
Square root of x plus 9
is equal to x minus 3.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.020
And they say, for all values
of x greater than 3, the

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.770
equation above is equivalent
to which of the following?

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:12.490
Let's see where this goes.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.201
So let's square both sides
of this equation.

00:07:16.201 --> 00:07:18.150
Let's square both sides,
just to get rid of

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.580
the square root sign.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.650
So the left hand side-- I'm
going to switch colors--

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.980
becomes x plus 9.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.700
And then we just have to
multiply that out, so that

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.950
becomes x squared-- x
times x-- and then

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.510
minus 6x plus 9, right?

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.740
You have x times minus 3 is
minus 3x, and when you

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.390
multiply it again, you
get minus 3x again.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.100
And if you don't remember how to
do this, you might want to

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:45.010
just multiply it x minus
3 times x minus 3.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.050
Going back to this, so
this is the relation.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.590
And they want us to write
in terms of x.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.220
So let's subtract 9
from both sides.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.800
We get x is equal to
x squared minus 6x.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.100
And that is choice C.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.790
And we are done.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:08.950
And the reason why they said x
is greater than 3 is because

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.090
they actually-- well, they
didn't want you to take the

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:15.970
negative square root, right?

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.820
They wanted you to make sure
that this is the positive

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.850
square root.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:27.350
Next problem, problem 15.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.240
How many integers in the set of
all integers from 1 to 100

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.140
inclusive are not the square
of an integer?

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:40.309
So it's 1 to 100 inclusive,
so it includes 1 and 100.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:43.320
So what we have to think about
is how many squares are there

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.140
between 1 and 100?

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:52.560
Well, 100 is 10 squared, 1 is
1 squared, so every number

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.930
between 1 and 10 squared
is going to be

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:55.790
in this range, right?

00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:00.390
2 squared-- so these are the
numbers whose squares-- 4, 5,

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.900
6, 7, 8, 9, 10-- and
of course, those

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.420
are 10 numbers, right?

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.540
So they're 10 numbers-- you
know, 1 squared is 1, 2

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.030
squared is 4-- all of these
numbers are going to be

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.400
between 1 and 100 inclusive.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.880
So all of these numbers are
there, there's 10 of them.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.770
So how many of them are
not a perfect square?

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:22.340
It's going to be 100 minus 10--
minus these 10 numbers.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.040
So it's 90.
