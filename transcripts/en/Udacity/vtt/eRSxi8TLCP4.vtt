00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.700
The answer is 96.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.550
The first thing that we need to do is
evaluate what's inside the parentheses

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.550
which is 6 squared- 10.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.590
We should treat what's inside the
parentheses as a unique expression and

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.340
follow the order of
operations to evaluate it.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.028
So exponents will need to be
simplified first, 6 squared is 36.

00:00:21.028 --> 00:00:26.030
So the expression inside
the parentheses becomes 36- 10.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.470
And our full expression
becomes (36- 10) * (4- 8).

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.180
Next, we subtract within
the parentheses and 36- 10 is 26.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.862
So with the expression inside
the parentheses simplified to 26,

00:00:42.862 --> 00:00:47.358
we can rewrite our full
expression as 26 * 4- 8.

00:00:47.358 --> 00:00:52.368
Now we should multiply 26 * 4,
which gives us 104.

00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:55.650
And our expression becomes 104- 8.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.110
And when we subtract 8 from 104,
we get 96.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.770
It's important to write out
all the steps you are taking

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.660
as you do these problems.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.540
Otherwise, it will become difficult
to keep track of what to do next.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.200
I also recommend you do
one thing at a time.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.720
Let's try another practice problem.
