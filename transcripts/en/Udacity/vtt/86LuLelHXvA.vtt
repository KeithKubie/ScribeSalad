We already saw that order
matters in subtraction.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.973
If I start off with 3 cupcakes and
promise 2 to my friends,

00:00:07.973 --> 00:00:13.520
I'm better off than if I start with 2
cupcakes and promise 3 to my friends.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.155
The order matters for division too,

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:21.070
10 divided by 2 is not the same
thing as 2 divided by 10.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.610
Would you rather divide $10 between two
people or divide $2 between 10 people?
