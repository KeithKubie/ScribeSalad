00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:02.874
- [Voiceover] Now I come
to another configuration

00:00:02.874 --> 00:00:03.822
for an op-amp.

00:00:03.822 --> 00:00:05.793
And it's partially drawn here.

00:00:05.793 --> 00:00:07.407
And I'm gonna talk about this

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:08.916
as I draw the rest of this circuit in.

00:00:08.916 --> 00:00:11.958
So this is gonna be made
from a resistor configuration

00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.059
that looks like this.

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.809
We'll have a resistor on the top.

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:22.813
And this will be v-out,

00:00:22.813 --> 00:00:24.346
as we did before.

00:00:24.346 --> 00:00:26.888
And now we have a connection like this

00:00:26.888 --> 00:00:29.721
and the connection here to ground.

00:00:31.358 --> 00:00:33.413
This terminal is the minus terminal;

00:00:33.413 --> 00:00:35.758
and this terminal is
the positive terminal.

00:00:35.758 --> 00:00:39.241
This is upside down from
what we've done so far.

00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:41.087
But now pay particular attention here,

00:00:41.087 --> 00:00:43.433
this one has the minus on top.

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:45.516
So now we have R1 and R2.

00:00:47.763 --> 00:00:49.180
And this is v-in.

00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:53.928
In particular, what we wanna
do is find an expression

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:54.761
for v-out

00:00:55.903 --> 00:00:57.736
as a function of v-in.

00:01:02.694 --> 00:01:03.527
All right.

00:01:03.527 --> 00:01:07.527
And in this video, I'm
gonna do it the hard way.

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:13.381
And what the hard way
means is we're gonna do

00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:15.517
all the algebra to do this.

00:01:15.517 --> 00:01:19.999
And then in the next video I'm
gonna show you the easy way.

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:21.845
The easy way is really fun to learn,

00:01:21.845 --> 00:01:24.434
and it really helps to see
it the hard way one time

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:28.021
just so you appreciate the easy way.

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.914
The other thing we get to do in this video

00:01:29.914 --> 00:01:32.456
is we'll do the algebra and
we'll see how this gain,

00:01:32.456 --> 00:01:36.623
we take advantage of this
gain to make some assumptions.

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:38.795
OK, so let's go after this.

00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:42.987
Let's develop an expression
for v-out in terms of v-in.

00:01:42.987 --> 00:01:47.154
First, let's write some things
we know about v-out, OK?

00:01:48.118 --> 00:01:51.799
We know that v-out equals A times...

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.922
Now, it's usually v-plus minus v-minus.

00:01:54.922 --> 00:01:56.172
This is v-plus.

00:01:57.104 --> 00:01:58.437
This is v-minus.

00:02:00.796 --> 00:02:03.792
Usually the expression here
is v-plus minus v-minus.

00:02:03.792 --> 00:02:06.148
And since v-plus is zero,

00:02:06.148 --> 00:02:09.315
we're just gonna put in minus v-minus.

00:02:11.605 --> 00:02:13.938
This is equivalent to saying

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.584
that v-minus equals

00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:21.074
minus v-out over A.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.940
So what else can we
write for this circuit?

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.670
OK, let's look at these resistors.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.587
Let's call this plus and minus vR1;

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.829
and we'll call this one plus minus vR2.

00:02:43.175 --> 00:02:47.342
So there's a current flowing
here, and that we'll call I.

00:02:48.492 --> 00:02:51.163
So I'm just gonna use Ohm's Law on R1 here

00:02:51.163 --> 00:02:53.740
and write an expression for I.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.573
I

00:02:55.748 --> 00:02:56.581
equals

00:02:59.081 --> 00:02:59.914
vR1

00:03:01.117 --> 00:03:01.950
over

00:03:02.847 --> 00:03:03.680
R1.

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:05.700
Right?

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.085
Another way I can write that.

00:03:07.085 --> 00:03:07.979
What's this voltage here?

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.312
This is v-minus.

00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:15.640
So I can write this in terms
of v-minus, and that equals

00:03:16.651 --> 00:03:17.484
v-in

00:03:18.506 --> 00:03:19.589
minus v-minus

00:03:23.278 --> 00:03:24.111
over R1.

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:29.663
That's the current going
through this guy here.

00:03:29.663 --> 00:03:31.428
Now I'm gonna use something special.

00:03:31.428 --> 00:03:32.449
I'm gonna use something special

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:34.911
that I know about this amplifier.

00:03:34.911 --> 00:03:38.440
What I know about an op-amp
is that this current here

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.857
is equal to zero.

00:03:41.157 --> 00:03:44.652
There's no current that
flows into an ideal op-amp.

00:03:44.652 --> 00:03:46.056
So I could take advantage of that.

00:03:46.056 --> 00:03:49.223
What that means is that I flows in R2.

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.359
So let me write and expression for I

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.621
based on what I find
over here, based on R2.

00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:58.371
I can write I equals,

00:03:59.393 --> 00:04:01.143
let's do it, it's vR2

00:04:04.385 --> 00:04:05.218
over R2.

00:04:07.462 --> 00:04:09.379
And I can write vR2 as:

00:04:10.713 --> 00:04:11.546
v-minus

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.327
minus v-out

00:04:19.643 --> 00:04:20.476
over R2.

00:04:23.057 --> 00:04:25.971
All right, so I took
advantage of the zero current

00:04:25.971 --> 00:04:28.444
flowing in here to write
an expression for current

00:04:28.444 --> 00:04:30.882
going all the way through.

00:04:30.882 --> 00:04:31.715
All right.

00:04:31.715 --> 00:04:34.446
So now we're gonna set these
two equal to each other.

00:04:34.446 --> 00:04:38.068
Now we're gonna make these
two equal to each other.

00:04:38.068 --> 00:04:41.528
Let me go over here and do that.

00:04:41.528 --> 00:04:42.361
V-in

00:04:43.873 --> 00:04:44.956
minus v-minus

00:04:47.484 --> 00:04:48.317
over R1.

00:04:50.445 --> 00:04:52.581
That equals this term here,

00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:54.998
which is v-minus minus v-not,

00:04:56.865 --> 00:04:57.948
v-out rather,

00:04:58.792 --> 00:04:59.625
over R2.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.352
How many variables do we have here?

00:05:05.352 --> 00:05:09.229
We have v-out, we have
v-in, and we have v-minus.

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.632
And what I want is just v-out and v-in,

00:05:12.632 --> 00:05:15.078
so I'm gonna try to eliminate v-minus;

00:05:15.078 --> 00:05:17.702
and the way I'm gonna do that
is this expression over here.

00:05:17.702 --> 00:05:20.732
We're gonna take advantage
of this statement right here

00:05:20.732 --> 00:05:23.232
to replace minus v-out over A.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.640
So I'll do that right here.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.789
So let me rewrite this.

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:29.872
It's gonna be

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.923
v-in

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:33.642
minus

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:36.303
minus v-out over A,

00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:38.347
so I get to make this a plus,

00:05:38.347 --> 00:05:40.764
and this becomes v-out over A

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:44.909
all divided by R1.

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:48.229
And that equals...

00:05:49.562 --> 00:05:51.979
V-minus is minus v-out over A

00:05:56.806 --> 00:05:57.723
minus v-out

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.423
over R2.

00:06:05.142 --> 00:06:07.894
All right, let's roll down a little bit,

00:06:07.894 --> 00:06:09.061
get some room,

00:06:11.992 --> 00:06:14.396
and we'll keep going.

00:06:14.396 --> 00:06:17.102
What am I gonna do next?

00:06:17.102 --> 00:06:21.149
Next, I'm gonna multiply both sides by A,

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:23.750
just to get A out of the bottom there.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.750
So now I get

00:06:26.173 --> 00:06:27.173
A times v-in

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.013
plus v-out

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.893
over R1

00:06:35.438 --> 00:06:36.271
equals

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.107
minus v-out

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.860
minus Av-out

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.033
over R2.

00:06:50.888 --> 00:06:52.769
There's a lot of algebra
here, but trust me,

00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:56.020
it's gonna simplify down
here in just a minute.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.448
All right, so now I'm gonna break this up

00:06:57.448 --> 00:07:02.370
into separate terms so I
can handle them separately.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.453
Av-in over R1

00:07:06.616 --> 00:07:08.116
plus v-out over R1

00:07:10.738 --> 00:07:12.905
equals minus v-out over R2

00:07:16.624 --> 00:07:18.374
minus Av-out over R2.

00:07:24.809 --> 00:07:28.579
Let's change colors so we don't get bored.

00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:30.669
Next, what I'm gonna do is start to gather

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:33.131
the v-out terms on one side

00:07:33.131 --> 00:07:35.104
and the v-in terms on the other side.

00:07:35.104 --> 00:07:37.066
So that means that this v-out term here

00:07:37.066 --> 00:07:39.566
is gonna go to the other side.

00:07:44.984 --> 00:07:45.817
Av-in

00:07:47.242 --> 00:07:48.075
over R1

00:07:49.344 --> 00:07:50.609
equals,

00:07:50.609 --> 00:07:52.942
let's do minus v-out over R2

00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.851
minus Av-out over R2.

00:08:00.547 --> 00:08:02.979
And this term comes over as

00:08:02.979 --> 00:08:04.646
minus v-out over R1.

00:08:10.677 --> 00:08:13.427
Haven't made any sign errors yet.

00:08:15.908 --> 00:08:17.233
Now let me clear the R1.

00:08:17.233 --> 00:08:19.900
We'll multiply both sides by R1.

00:08:21.436 --> 00:08:22.269
Av-in

00:08:23.735 --> 00:08:24.568
equals

00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:27.644
R1 over R2

00:08:30.143 --> 00:08:30.976
minus

00:08:32.134 --> 00:08:32.967
v-not

00:08:33.849 --> 00:08:34.682
minus

00:08:35.797 --> 00:08:36.630
R1 over R2

00:08:39.523 --> 00:08:40.356
Av-not

00:08:42.472 --> 00:08:43.472
minus v-not.

00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:49.078
Yeah, the R1s cancel on that last term.

00:08:49.078 --> 00:08:49.911
All right.

00:08:50.761 --> 00:08:51.594
Av-in

00:08:52.767 --> 00:08:53.600
equals.

00:08:56.215 --> 00:08:58.215
Out of here I can factor

00:08:59.303 --> 00:09:00.553
this term here.

00:09:02.055 --> 00:09:04.269
Minus R1 over R2 times v-not,

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:07.694
I can factor that out of here and here.

00:09:07.694 --> 00:09:09.361
So I can do minus R1

00:09:10.265 --> 00:09:11.348
over R2 v-not

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:15.196
times

00:09:15.196 --> 00:09:16.029
one plus A

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:20.399
minus v-not.

00:09:25.192 --> 00:09:26.829
So let's take a look at this expression

00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:30.829
and use our judgement to
decide what to do next.

00:09:32.146 --> 00:09:34.500
Now, because A is so huge,

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.238
that means that this first
term is gonna be gigantic

00:09:38.238 --> 00:09:40.944
compared to this v-not term here.

00:09:40.944 --> 00:09:43.521
V-not is some value like five volts

00:09:43.521 --> 00:09:45.866
or minus five volts or
something like that.

00:09:45.866 --> 00:09:49.964
And A times this is something like 100,000

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:52.182
or 200,000, something like that.

00:09:52.182 --> 00:09:55.955
It dwarfs this v-not, so I'm
gonna ignore this for now.

00:09:55.955 --> 00:09:58.010
I'm just gonna cross that out,

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.681
and we'll move forward
without that little v-not

00:10:00.681 --> 00:10:03.235
on the end of the expression.

00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:05.278
This is after we've left that out.

00:10:05.278 --> 00:10:08.366
Now we have v-in on this side.

00:10:08.366 --> 00:10:12.033
And I'm gonna take A
over to the other side.

00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:20.431
One plus A over A.

00:10:24.164 --> 00:10:26.881
And this is a point where we
get to use our judgement again.

00:10:26.881 --> 00:10:30.236
Again, A is a huge number, like a million;

00:10:30.236 --> 00:10:33.486
and so A plus one is a million and one.

00:10:34.764 --> 00:10:39.048
That fraction is really
really close to one,

00:10:39.048 --> 00:10:41.637
so I'm gonna ignore it; I'm
gonna just say it's one.

00:10:41.637 --> 00:10:44.137
So we'll send this one to one.

00:10:45.666 --> 00:10:47.071
And let me roll up a little bit more,

00:10:47.071 --> 00:10:50.071
just to have a little bit more room.

00:10:53.689 --> 00:10:55.035
Now what we have is what?

00:10:55.035 --> 00:10:55.868
V-in

00:10:57.346 --> 00:10:58.596
equals minus R1

00:10:59.691 --> 00:11:00.524
over R2

00:11:01.374 --> 00:11:02.524
times v-out.

00:11:02.524 --> 00:11:05.693
And I want the expression
just in terms of v-out,

00:11:05.693 --> 00:11:07.655
so I'm gonna spin this around,

00:11:07.655 --> 00:11:10.572
and we'll get v-out equals minus R2

00:11:11.518 --> 00:11:13.101
over R1 times v-in.

00:11:22.002 --> 00:11:23.837
So this is what our
op-amp is doing for us.

00:11:23.837 --> 00:11:26.832
It basically says v-out is the ratio

00:11:26.832 --> 00:11:29.386
of two resistors times v-in.

00:11:29.386 --> 00:11:31.650
The gain of the overall circuit

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.228
is determined by the ratio
of those two resistors.

00:11:34.228 --> 00:11:36.770
And very importantly, there's
a minus sign in front of it.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.162
The minus sign came all the way through.

00:11:39.162 --> 00:11:42.829
Again, let me sketch
the circuit real quick.

00:11:45.245 --> 00:11:47.662
We had the minus sign on top.

00:11:49.123 --> 00:11:50.290
There's v-out.

00:12:01.012 --> 00:12:03.012
And there was R1 and R2.

00:12:04.852 --> 00:12:07.801
And the positive input,
the non-inverting input,

00:12:07.801 --> 00:12:10.308
was connected to ground.

00:12:10.308 --> 00:12:11.342
OK?

00:12:11.342 --> 00:12:13.269
So this pattern with the resistor going

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:15.080
over the top to the minus,

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.247
this is called a inverting

00:12:20.304 --> 00:12:21.137
op-amp.

00:12:28.199 --> 00:12:31.694
And this is a really familiar
pattern in op-amp circuits.

00:12:31.694 --> 00:12:33.006
You can see these on schematics,

00:12:33.006 --> 00:12:35.688
and you'll be designing these on your own.

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:37.696
So this was quite a bit of algebra it took

00:12:37.696 --> 00:12:39.298
to get down to this point,

00:12:39.298 --> 00:12:41.156
and in the next video I'm gonna show you

00:12:41.156 --> 00:12:44.151
a really easy way to shortcircuit all this

00:12:44.151 --> 00:12:47.193
and be able to do this
analysis really quickly;

00:12:47.193 --> 00:12:49.296
and that's called the virtual ground.
