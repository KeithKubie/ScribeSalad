00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here once again, we're presenting familiar material in an unfamiliar way.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This time, I'm going to give you the parse tree,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and I want you to tell me what the grammar would have to be.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Over here on the left, I have a parse tree for the string (int + int), and over here on the right,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I have a grammar with three holes.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'd like you to fill in each blank with a single symbol and a word

00:00:20.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to make this grammar fit with this parse string.
