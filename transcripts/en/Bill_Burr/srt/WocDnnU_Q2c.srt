1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,180
Okay.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,600
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:08,160
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast and

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,920
Ahhh,

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,280
just checking in on you.
Just checking in on you.

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,420
What's going on? Let me do that.
Like I'm falling off a cliff.

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,363
Oh,

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,500
I woke up this morning.

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,610
[inaudible] I had the dumbest song in my
head and I can't get it out and now I'm

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,240
going to sing it to you so
it'll be stuck in your head.

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:39,710
It's a very vengeful thing for me to
do. It's something that, you know,

12
00:00:39,711 --> 00:00:42,260
pieces of shit guys. Do
you know if I'm going down,

13
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:44,830
I'm taking you down with me and
all those kinds of pieces. Shits,

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,280
you know they do that. Uh, the ladies,
the ladies like to dabble in that. Well,

15
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:51,860
fuck you. This is in a relationship.

16
00:00:51,861 --> 00:00:53,810
At least I'm getting some
of your tee shirts, right?

17
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:56,880
They're going to get
something from it. Well, look,

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,490
this song's going to be stuck in my head.

19
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:01,490
I'm sorry to say that it's going to
be stuck in yours head too. All right,

20
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:05,530
and I've given you a good, I've been
talking about this for a good 18 seconds.

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,270
Says plenty of time. Even if
you're driving in the car,

22
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,520
he hit pause and you're choosing not to.

23
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,400
Why do you do this to yourself?

24
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,850
Why don't you just choose the road that's
going to bring you true happiness is

25
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,951
the,

26
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:23,360
because you grew up and you watched
people being abused and you felt like you

27
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,030
didn't have a choice in life
that this is the way it was.

28
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,690
You know what that last 10 seconds is
probably going to be worse than the song,

29
00:01:29,691 --> 00:01:30,524
but here it is.

30
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,970
[inaudible] I hold up my head

31
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,300
and at the edge

32
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,500
it's something. It's up dead.

33
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,510
Huh? I don't know who sings that song.

34
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:52,740
I don't think I've ever gotten past
those first two lines of that song.

35
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,050
It's always comes on session presents
love songs from the 70s or the,

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,953
yeah, this one

37
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,460
[inaudible] big [inaudible]

38
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,860
right,

39
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,680
and you sit in and go look at this
fucking horse shit and you start thinking

40
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:12,680
about your childhood. Next thing you know
you're on the phone with the operator.

41
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,050
Could they get the deluxe edition? Yeah,
I still have a CD player in my car.

42
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,760
Well, because I'm frugal.
It's not because I'm failing.

43
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:26,600
And I resent you saying that.
Of course. I still want the CDS.

44
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,610
I'm speaking of my old car, my car.

45
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:36,130
I've had it since, uh, October
of 2007. It's a 2008. Oh,

46
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,790
is it brand new? It will hit it
fucking stars in its eyes, right.

47
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:44,710
Just stepped off the bus here in Hollywood
with a piece of Straw between its

48
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,190
seat. Like axl rose in
the guns and roses video.

49
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:53,150
A welcome to a welcome to
the jungle. I'm there now.

50
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:54,620
Look at it. Oh, this thing,

51
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:57,830
it looks like somebody attacked it
with a fucking can opener. Right?

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,580
It did as until as of the other day.

53
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,360
My, uh, my wife was out of town.

54
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:07,570
She was in New York City for the
great Patrice O'Neal benefit.

55
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,530
I want to thank everybody who came out
and I want to thank everyone who did the

56
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:15,700
show. I unfortunately was not able
to get a fucking flight in and time,

57
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,270
if you can believe that. I
actually missed the benefit.

58
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,250
Fucking brutal. I had a
flight out a Saturday morning,

59
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,420
Saturday,

60
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,720
and I believe that when I was on American
Airlines and they just gave me a call

61
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,450
and like, like a, you know, when
a one 800 number and I went hello.

62
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,140
And they were like, hello that says
American Airlines at four McGill,

63
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:43,250
they have like two nighter was three
as by gads you're then relocated.

64
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,830
No, you might want to grab
a pad. You'll now bed.

65
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:50,530
Rebooked like ever. What? Zev it thanks.

66
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:54,730
Zero out of l a x on Tuesday,

67
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,760
January 26 at 1:50 PM a the benefit was
on the 26th I was supposed to be flying

68
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:03,670
out on the 23rd.

69
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,290
They pushed it three fucking days and I
was gonna leave for 15 east coast time

70
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,800
when the show starts at seven. So
I'm like, well that's not gonna work.

71
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:14,530
So I call my travel agent, you know,

72
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,080
and so she got me a flight on JetBlue,

73
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,710
7:45 AM on, um,

74
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,570
Sunday, the 24th. So I'm like, no
worries. All right, so I miss a day,

75
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:28,780
no big deal. Blah, blah, blah,
blah. Right. And then I get a call,

76
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,460
I get a call like the night before,

77
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,160
I'm all packed and got my shit right
next to the door and there's like that

78
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,170
[inaudible] blow inmate one out of
their bed and a piece of paper, right?

79
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,340
And then they fucking Bob me to fucking
Tuesday. So I said, fuck these guys.

80
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:47,140
I call my travel agent again.
Now I'm on virgin. All right.

81
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,790
I don't know why they call
it Virgin Airlines and then
it looks so dizzy in that

82
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,330
fucking thing. It's like at the
w hotel was a plane, you know,

83
00:04:55,331 --> 00:05:00,331
with the fucking aquarium lighting that
just says no one wants to see a good

84
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:04,240
look of their face in a mirror after
they do what they do in here. Right.

85
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,530
So they booked me on that fucking
thing and they're like, well,

86
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:12,310
the time we can get you out is right when
the New England patriots game starts.

87
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,990
And I'm like, oh, that guy, you
got TV, I fuck it. Put me on it.

88
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:19,150
Right. And then that one got canceled.

89
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:24,151
So at that point I did deduced
if I'm using the word properly,

90
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,930
that uh, that the fucking every,

91
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,820
every poor bastard from Saturday and
Sunday now that those flights at all been

92
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:38,200
canceled, we're now eating up all
the Monday and Tuesday ones. So, um,

93
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,510
I had my travel agent go after another
flight and then meanwhile I called my

94
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:46,570
manager, who knows all
these big guys and I said,

95
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:49,160
can you get me a
replacement in case I could,

96
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,130
I'm not going to be able to
get it. Long story short,

97
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,330
I wasn't able to get in in time.
We got a replacement and a,

98
00:05:55,331 --> 00:06:00,331
I wish I could have been there because
a rich vos who crushed it as a host once

99
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:03,950
again this year and he said,
a blah, blah, blah, blah.

100
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:07,400
Unfortunately bill burrow can't be here.
And everyone's like, oh, what the fuck?

101
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,530
Where is the red country? Right. And he
said, ah, that's the bad news. He said,

102
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:16,640
the good news is Louis C K and Louis
C K walked out and they would fucking

103
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:20,240
absolutely mental. And, uh, you know,

104
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:25,250
I was replaced one balding redhead
with another balding red head with more

105
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:30,170
credits so nobody missed me. Um,

106
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,510
and I guess he fucking murdered it.

107
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:36,530
And then the only to do is 15 cause
he's such a great guy, didn't like 25,

108
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,870
um, and just fucking destroyed and
everybody had a great time. And uh,

109
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,400
somebody sent me a picture of, um, I've,

110
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:49,940
everybody in the end coming out, Al del
Benny flew in all the way from Sydney,

111
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:50,480
Australia.

112
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,030
That's another reason why I didn't want
to reschedule cause this guy flew in

113
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:57,980
from the other side of the
fucking world. And um, Oh,

114
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:58,581
who else was there?

115
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:02,870
Rachel phones find saying Greer
Barnes who absolutely murdered,

116
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,950
you know, one of the greatest to
ever did it. Greer Barnes. Um,

117
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,930
Jim Norton, I don't have it in
front of me. I wasn't there too,

118
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:16,820
so I know I'm going to end up forgetting
somebody. But uh, anyways, everybody,

119
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,140
God freak did it. Everybody fucking
killed. And uh, they had a great time.

120
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,721
So anyway,

121
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:25,760
so I was out here and I was supposed
to be in New York from Saturday until

122
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,800
Wednesday. So nobody knew that I was
out here, you know, so I was just like,

123
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:33,920
well fuck it. I'm not
telling anybody I'm here.

124
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:38,950
And I just started handling a bunch
of shit that I'd been putting off for

125
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:43,190
months, if not years. Um,

126
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:49,040
I did everything from, uh,
get my last will together, my,

127
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,630
you know, when I die or whatever,

128
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:54,230
make sure that everything goes
to the people who needs to go to.

129
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:59,090
So there's no fighting
hopefully. Um, which is actually,

130
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:03,830
it's really morbid, but it's also fucking
kind of cool. It's, I can't fucking,

131
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:06,380
you take this and you take
that in a, I'm out of here.

132
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:12,170
Good luck to is I had a
great time and a great ass.

133
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,110
Um, I rolled change that we hadn't jars.

134
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,640
I handled that and I dropped my fucking
Prius off and I had all the fucking

135
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:28,040
dense repaired you should
say. Looks Brand fucking new.

136
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,470
There's a couple of little ones
that they just stay left in there.

137
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,910
They buffed the whole thing up. I didn't
get new bottlers because you know,

138
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,110
you have new bumpers out here.

139
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:40,760
They last for about three days before
somebody just bumps into them. So a,

140
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:43,220
I just had them bought those things
up and it looks fucking great.

141
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:44,390
And I'll tell you right now,

142
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,160
having a paid off Prius with
80,000 something miles on it.

143
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,510
I'm in La. La is the greatest fucking
car you could ever drive. It's just,

144
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,390
it's the shit and it takes the hits
too. It's like Ben Roethlisberger.

145
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,800
It just fucking shakes him off and he's
get keeps going and amount of how bad

146
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:05,790
the gas prices get. I've never
paid more than 40 bucks a gallon.

147
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,600
I don't give a fuck if
somebody runs into it. Um,

148
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:14,130
I could park it wherever I want. Nobody's
gonna take it. It's fucking perfect.

149
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,720
Right? I bought my wife a nice
car. It's nice. I can't stand it.

150
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,380
I can't, you know, I feel like
when I'm driving that thing.

151
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,120
Do you guys ever see that
fucking hilarious Howard
Stern's movie, private parts?

152
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,440
Do you remember when he was showing
himself when he first became a DJ in lake?

153
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:35,340
When he went to put the needle on the
record and he scratched and he fucked the

154
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,470
whole thing up. Remember that noise?
Who's making, who's going home?

155
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,950
Hello? Hello? Hello. That's

156
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,750
what I feel like when I drive that car.

157
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,530
Like I'll be going to the grocery
store and I'll just be thinking like,

158
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,580
God damn and I need to go in there and
buy some fucking hamburger. But you know,

159
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:52,460
if I don't see a bunch of wide open
spaces, I won't parking in there.

160
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:56,090
Cause I know somebody's going to come
in and just park right next to it and

161
00:09:56,091 --> 00:09:59,930
fucking oh fun door right into the side
of it and it's gonna make me fucking

162
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:04,190
sick. You know, it's like
when you go to a movie, right?

163
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,650
Like right now is a great
time to go see star wars.

164
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:09,170
Maybe in another fucking week.
Right? Nobody's going to be there.

165
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:13,790
You go see a matinee, right?
It's during the work week.

166
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,290
You're a comedian, you got a Gig
that night. You say, fuck fucking,

167
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:17,751
I'm going to go.

168
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:22,370
I'm going to go see a matinee showing
of star wars fucking six weeks after it

169
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:26,540
came out, right? You go in there,
there's nobody fucking there.

170
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,460
You get your feet up,
you having a great time.

171
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:33,461
It is fucking inevitable that someone's
gonna walk in during the fucking

172
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:34,370
trailers.

173
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,150
They're gonna sit down or right behind
you and they're going to talk much

174
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:39,860
popcorn fucking loudly.

175
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,140
Or they're going to be fucking dress
like Chewbacca and there's going to going

176
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,440
to be getting hair in
their mouth or their thing.

177
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,200
Gonna be doing that the entire
fucking time. It's a net the same,

178
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,770
the same way that is inevitable. If
you park in a, in a, in a parking lot,

179
00:10:51,771 --> 00:10:52,520
some con,

180
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,490
even if there's a bunch of fucking spaces
is going to pull in right next to you

181
00:10:55,491 --> 00:10:57,860
and they can open their fucking
door right into it, you know,

182
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,090
and that's just regular people
forget about out of shape.

183
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:03,910
People who they,

184
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:08,240
they gotta like put stress on their
hinges of their doors to just make it wide

185
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:12,590
enough, you know? You know,
that's where you know you're fat.

186
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:15,830
When you get like one of those Formula
One fucking steering wheels that just

187
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:17,540
pops out so you can get your gut out.

188
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,670
You keep lying to yourself. I'll tell you,

189
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:26,960
they don't make these Ford Broncos as
big as they used to. Yeah, they do. Yeah,

190
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:31,640
they do. They most
certainly fucking do. Um,

191
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,780
so anyways, speak at a cars too. And I
saw there's somebody up the street, man.

192
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,200
It's going to kill a fucking car.
It's one of those Volkswagen. Uh,

193
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,000
it's not the bug. It's not the Carmen
Guian. It's the fucking station wagon.

194
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,650
And they put some white walls on
it and some fucking fog lights.

195
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,640
They got the luggage rack on
it. It's fucking cool as shit.

196
00:11:52,641 --> 00:11:55,930
I love station wagon. Ah,
I love a station wagon.

197
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,050
I'm sorry, I got a little fucking,
uh, who's that guy? It's as big as oh,

198
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:05,230
well, and it's about test sets sail.

199
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,103
So,

200
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,760
um, hang on. Sorry. Sorry. I'm
singing all these fucking songs.

201
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:18,090
It's a little old place where you
could get together and do what,

202
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,760
what kind of depravity
goes on in a love shack.

203
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:23,980
Okay.

204
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,330
Does that song even make sense?

205
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,450
Okay.

206
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,160
They just went out to a shack
and they fucked, I mean,

207
00:12:29,161 --> 00:12:33,960
maybe I'm taking it too literally. Uh,
what was I looking up? Oh yeah, the, uh,

208
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:37,100
the Volkswagen station
wagon. The Volkswagen.

209
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,130
This is Zyvox Vox Vargon
station. Vagan uh,

210
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,160
classic VW station or Wag on,

211
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,530
let's see what this thing's
called. There it is.

212
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,370
The fuck is it called? So I got
all the, uh, the pictures of it.

213
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,240
That's such a fucking cool car,
man. I love the front end on it.

214
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,880
And the guy also had it in a stick shift,

215
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,240
which I think is a picture below a rear
view of the Volkswagen beetle from 61 to

216
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:12,420
seven 67. That's not what I
wanted. One of these days.

217
00:13:12,421 --> 00:13:14,160
One of these days, I'm
just going to look shit up.

218
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:15,310
Yeah.

219
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,020
You know, before it starts.

220
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:21,840
And I'll have a nice news
podcast. I'm imitating my,

221
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,920
my science teacher from a

222
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,230
okay.

223
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,040
From high school when he was talking
about some sort of biology thing, he said,

224
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,220
there's, there's rough and smooth, I
forget what it was. And he was like,

225
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,430
this is all rough and smooth.

226
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,780
And he used to make a joke out of it and
everybody would laugh and you'd never

227
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:40,060
get it wrong on the test. Bam.

228
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,850
You know why there's not more funny
teachers is because they all become

229
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:44,350
comedians. Cause it just like, all right,

230
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:48,610
I'm basically doing stand up here and a,

231
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:49,900
I'm not making any money,

232
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,860
so fuck these kids and their future.

233
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,623
Yeah.

234
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,420
Volkswagen type three square back.
That's all it's called. Come on.

235
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,360
They had to give it a
better name than that. Oh,

236
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:05,900
this is some fucking gearhead
thing. God Damn fucking bastards.

237
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:08,270
Can you just tell me the
name of the fucking car?

238
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,470
Well, he did formation.

239
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,190
You think I could look it up

240
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,660
by the mid sixties it was clear
that Volkswagen's iconoclastic,

241
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,740
thinks small campaign on behalf of
the lowly beetle had succeeded in

242
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:31,180
transforming the third
hike. Wait a minute. Wait,

243
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:32,350
what the fuck is this about Hitler?

244
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,030
I'm trying to read about the fucking
Karmann Ghias type two maybe it is a

245
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,770
Karmann Ghia. I, you know what the
fuck I'm talking about. You know what?

246
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:41,890
I'll just put a picture up. How about
that? I'll, I'd put a picture of that.

247
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,530
Hey, did anybody see bill
Bellacheck a football life?

248
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,760
It was a two Pi and I gotta
admit I was bored shitless.

249
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:52,660
I,

250
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,660
I've never been more bored watching a
football life even when it was him and Tom

251
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,080
Brady's sitting in the office. I
was, it was fucking egghead shit,

252
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,510
but it was just all monotone. Just
calling. Yeah. Yeah. Lions have a,

253
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,170
uh, a good defense. So, uh, you know,

254
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:13,170
I'm gonna put together a game plan
and then Tom Brady be like smiling,

255
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:15,550
but just going like, yeah, I
thought maybe we could have the, uh,

256
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,690
the running back come out
of the backfield. We could
explain some things, uh,

257
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,850
the underneath of their a secondary.

258
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,133
Okay.

259
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,820
Oh yeah. Tell him I'm going
to look into that. Okay, Bill.

260
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,020
And that'll be like seen. It was like
fucking, even when he got emotional,

261
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:34,130
when he went to giant stadium,
I was just like, this is a no,

262
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,270
he didn't get in volt motion of like,

263
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:37,560
if you want to see the emotional why
you got to see the Dick from meal one.

264
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,030
But I was, I, I can't even watch
it. I feel like a bad patriots fan.

265
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,450
I cannot get fucking through it. Um,

266
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,840
maybe I will eventually. So actually, um,

267
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,720
that was another thing I did when I was
here. I was just binge watching shit.

268
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,530
I watched the whole first
season of top boy on Netflix.

269
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,180
It's only four episodes
a fucking good show, man.

270
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,380
And I just started the
second one last night and a,

271
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,120
yeah,

272
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,660
I watched this documentary
on na's who I never got,

273
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,710
I never got it. When illmatic came
out I was like, I don't like this.

274
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,280
I don't get it right. And now I went
back and listened to it as like, oh,

275
00:16:17,281 --> 00:16:21,930
wait a minute. This is fucking
unbelievable. You gotta admit.

276
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,120
Okay. When you're younger, there's a lot,

277
00:16:24,121 --> 00:16:26,850
sometimes there's albums that come out or,

278
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,710
or artists that come by and you just
don't see them cause you're like, Eh,

279
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:32,340
you know, he's an older
guy. Like, like David Bowie.

280
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,540
I never want to see that guy
live. And now doing the classic,

281
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:41,340
now that he's dead, let me take
another listen to his fucking music.

282
00:16:41,341 --> 00:16:46,260
And I, you know, I had that fucking
album. Like everybody has that album.

283
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:49,460
I had the Ziggy stardust one and a,

284
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,410
that's still an amazing fucking album
obviously, but it's been played to death.

285
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:56,100
But that was killer. But I downloaded
diamond dogs. It's fucking on.

286
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,490
It's unreal. And I was like, I many
times could I have seen this guy,

287
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,820
I could have seen him on the
let's dance. Toilet dance.

288
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,840
Well yeah, red shoes, a little blue.

289
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,170
Um, I could have seen him on
any of those and I never did.

290
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,580
You know Bob Newhart's play
playing out Friday night.

291
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,490
I'm not going to get a chance to see
him. His fucking show is sold out.

292
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,120
It's like way the fuck
out in the desert and a,

293
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:25,270
I got something nine 30 the next morning
so I can't go fucking see the guy.

294
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:30,190
And uh, so I'm trying to make a bucket
list of guys I gotta go fucking see.

295
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,181
I hope they don't,

296
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:34,210
none of nobody plays this farm cause
I'm going to see them because not only I

297
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:36,880
respect him as an artist, but I also,
it's, I'm afraid they're gonna die,

298
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,230
you know? Uh, I don't want to
jinx anybody, but you know,

299
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:46,240
they are our even you just want to
see before they quit touring, right.

300
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,040
Everyone from Tony
Bennett to Stevie wonder

301
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,660
to Bob Newhart to Morton Downey jr right.

302
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,430
I'm joking. I already saw him and he's
dead. All right, let's plow ahead.

303
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,960
I think I got to do a read
for the week here. Um,

304
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,140
why don't I do the read and I'll be
singing the melody to one. I need. Love,

305
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,620
Delilah. Shaky.

306
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,623
Hello.

307
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,620
Lots of play.

308
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:19,770
I'll be spotting playoff bits
now that the poles seasons here,

309
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,160
leaf.

310
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,240
I can't do the whole thing that to the
pros kickoffs a year the right way with a

311
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:29,010
fresh blade shave.

312
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,040
That's why me and millions of others
have joined the dollar Shave club.com

313
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:38,340
Revolution Dollar Shave Club knows that
the key to getting an amazing shape is

314
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:39,270
simple. One,

315
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,890
use a fresh dollar shave club
blade to use their fucking doctors.

316
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,000
Ca Bzz shape

317
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,693
that said,

318
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,260
those shake club delivers amazing razors
right to my door for a third of the

319
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:56,380
price of those greedy
mega razor corporations.

320
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,280
That means listeners who switch now
can afford the luxury of shaving with a

321
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:03,760
fresh blade anytime and save
hundreds this year. And uh,

322
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,440
what do you combine the
fresh blade? Any what you do,

323
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:08,740
if you really want to feel like a rich
guy is get one of those barbershop chairs

324
00:19:08,741 --> 00:19:12,040
and fucking lay back in it and have one
of your drunk friends shave your face

325
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,290
for you. Don't have them go
up. You'll get ingrown hairs.

326
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,130
And when you combine that fresh blade
with the doctor cabbies easy seat,

327
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,560
it just glides. It's
like lube for your face.

328
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:26,100
It's unimaginably smooth.
Uh, I'm telling you,

329
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,970
it's not the average shamed shave
foam. It won't dry out your skin.

330
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,420
The all natural ingredients.
Leave your skin feeling soft,

331
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:37,830
smooth and moisturize after
every shave. Take it from me.

332
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,290
Use a fresh dollar shave club,
bay blade with doctor cabbies.

333
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:46,610
Easy shave butter if you want to.
The most gentle shave imaginable.

334
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,210
Joined the dollar shave

That's dollar shave club.com/bar

336
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,533
hi

337
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,100
dollar shave club.com/
[inaudible] all right, legal zoom.

338
00:19:59,310 --> 00:19:59,521
All right,

339
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:03,330
before another year pass is take the time
to get your life organized with legal

340
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,170
zoom. This is what I've been
doing. Do you have a family?

341
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,820
Do you have any assets of property?
If any of those answers are yes,

342
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,390
you should have an estate plan.
Fuck you, man. I already did this.

343
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:19,110
This is for other people. Uh, don't
worry if that sounds complicated.

344
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:21,300
Legal Zoom can help. Yes,
they can. Legal zooms.

345
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,180
Estate Plan Bundles eliminates the
guesswork. Yes, they do. This is,

346
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,930
this is a personal testimony.

347
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,110
You don't have to figure out on your
own whether a will or living trucks.

348
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,720
Trust works better, best for you. Instead,

349
00:20:33,721 --> 00:20:36,840
you work with an independent
attorney available in most states.

350
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,230
They'll walk you through your options
and recommend an estate plan that offers

351
00:20:40,231 --> 00:20:42,960
the best solution to fit your needs.
You know, it's funny, you know,

352
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:45,750
if it's not available in your state,
they don't think your state's cool.

353
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,250
There's not enough fucking
for them to make money on.

354
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,600
Like if you're out there and wow,
wow, I think I'm doing a Gig.

355
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,740
They're coming up and Cheyenne, I've got
a gig coming up in Denver. All right?

356
00:20:56,741 --> 00:21:00,370
They'll walk you through your options
and recommend an estate plan that offers

357
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:03,820
the best solution that fits your needs.
Since legal zoom is not a law firm,

358
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,670
you can count on the F
on efficiency and value.

359
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,040
Everything is your schedule in your terms.

360
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:13,930
Plus you'll know what your estate plan
bundles costs upfront instead of worrying

361
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:15,010
about hourly rates.

362
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,160
That's how legal zoom has become the
lead in helping small business owners and

363
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:24,760
families with great, with their
legal, with their legal needs.

364
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,670
You get legal help and
walk away feeling great.

365
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,430
There's the great that I was
looking at a fucking line below.

369
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:47,130
All right, there we go. And
that's the end of the reads. Uh,

370
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,190
what did I just want to talk
about? Something in there
reminded me of something.

371
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,940
Oh yeah, the fucking, I'm going to be
going to Denver when I go to Denver.

372
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,590
They're either going to be super bowl
champions or they're going to be depressed

373
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:00,221
that they lost,

374
00:22:00,221 --> 00:22:03,040
but they're probably still going to
give me shit that they beat my patriots.

375
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:07,390
But I've got to tell you this,
man, this is pretty cool.

376
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,130
Do you know Denver's the only team,

377
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:11,260
the New England patriots
have a losing record too.

378
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,530
And I know a lot of you
guys love fucking Denver,

379
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,640
and I'm actually thinking like,

380
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:19,240
I can't believe that's true because I
watched the Patriots before Tom Brady.

381
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:20,740
All right?

382
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,920
And I think there was very few people
that we had a winning record against.

383
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,720
And the fact that, uh,

384
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:30,430
who's kidding who bill Bellacheck came
in with drew Bledsoe and that really

385
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:33,520
started turning shit around and, um,

386
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,880
just the way that they've won over this
since like 2000 or 2001 by really like

387
00:22:39,671 --> 00:22:43,810
the last 20 years, the way
they've won, they were, let's see,

388
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,020
20, 35, they were 35 years or 35,

389
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,900
33 years in or 32 years in when drew
Bledsoe took over and drew Bledsoe took

390
00:22:55,421 --> 00:23:00,280
over 24 years ago. So, you know,

391
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,173
that's what it took.

392
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:06,630
It took two and a half decades to undo
fucking three decades of fucking up.

393
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:10,900
And, um, I think that's amazing. Now
you're probably going, well, why,

394
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:13,420
why the fuck? What are the Broncos doing?

395
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,390
You always got to play in that
altitude. It was always snowing.

396
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:21,450
And then they had Craig Morton and
the orange crushed defense in the 70s.

397
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,430
And, uh, I think before that they had
that Floyd little great running back,

398
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,570
Randy gradish shack, um, Hayven Moses,

399
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,540
Rick up church there. They
always had some fucking guys.

400
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:38,500
And then they got John Elway in 83
and that fucked after Craig Morton,

401
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,431
they went, you know,

402
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:44,170
a few years and then 83 Elway came
in and that fucked us from 83 to 98.

403
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:45,830
So even when we had drew Bledsoe

404
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,330
for the first fucking six,
seven years, it was against, uh,

405
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,080
John Elway who's like top three all
time, I think, you know what I mean? Um,

406
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,660
I'd actually put him ahead
of a Peyton, Manny, um,

407
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,600
personally, personally speaking. Um,

408
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:05,720
so I'm actually excited that there's
32 fucking teams were one of them.

409
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:09,440
So up the 31 other teams, 30 of them,
we had a winning record against.

410
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:14,210
Can anybody else make that claim? I
don't think they can. All right, sorry.

411
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:19,220
So Anybody Watch, AH, 60 minutes.
This past week they did a, um,

412
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,900
they did this feature Phagia on mountain
lions and now California is the only

413
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:30,200
state that has mountain lions.

414
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:35,540
Just walking around. I, I'm
gonna fuck this up in a,

415
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,410
in a park,

416
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,480
I guess maybe the size of like
Griffith Park or Runyon Canyon or,

417
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:45,140
or whatever those ones are out in, uh,

418
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,690
out in the valley. I guess they have
these fucking things. And, um, so anyways,

419
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,720
I was watching it because a few of the
places was where I hike with my dog and

420
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:57,860
this thing has intermittently, this, this,

421
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,100
this group of fucking mountain
lions has been around there.

422
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:04,910
But fortunately they, they
try to avoid you I guess, um,

423
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,840
at least during the day if then I fucking
hungry. But they showed this fucking,

424
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:12,890
uh, these people, this
mountain lion, right, okay.

425
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:14,000
They were having some work done.

426
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:18,140
So they had somebody going underneath
the house into the crawl space of their

427
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,060
house and they were right
up against this park.

428
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,080
And the guy went down there
and he immediately came
back up and he was fucking

429
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:28,850
like white as a ghost and they
were like a don de s, you know,

430
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,080
fucking white people turn to
speak Spanish three Oh eight. Um,

431
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,750
is it French? I don't know. Um,

432
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,390
and a guy comes out of the fucking hole
and was like, yeah, man, I fucking, uh,

433
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,840
there's a mountain lion down there. I
just came faced and I get outta here.

434
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,783
You shy.

435
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,160
I asked that and they
will let, he's like, yeah,

436
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:54,020
it's fucking down there.
And, and so anyways,

437
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:57,980
they interview this fucking La couple and
they are the quintessential fucking la

438
00:25:57,981 --> 00:26:02,960
couple, you know what I mean? He looks
like the leading man of a B movie,

439
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,670
right? She's got like bleach blonde
hair. She's wearing fuck me pumps.

440
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,180
She's on 60 minutes. Where in fuck
me pumps. It's fucking hilarious.

441
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:15,050
Walking around, done up
to the nines. And um,

442
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,270
I actually, uh, was pretty cool. I was
trying to figure out where the house was.

443
00:26:20,271 --> 00:26:24,290
I Google mapped it and I
think I was able to find it.

444
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,650
But um,

445
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,000
fuck this state is so fucking
insane with the droughts, the fires,

446
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:36,890
the rattlesnakes, the coyotes,
the mountain lines, you know,

447
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:40,190
and everybody's in this place is so
phony and so plastic. Well, you know,

448
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,940
it can get, uh, that can all go away
pretty damn quick with the wildlife.

449
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:50,640
It's sort of like a fucking
Australia light, like super light.

450
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,670
You know what I mean? As I
was throwing that out there,

451
00:26:53,671 --> 00:26:55,510
I just heard everybody
down there all flow.

452
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,920
Give me a fucking brain of flipping
out about how dangerous their fucking,

453
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,330
you know, how dangerous Australia is.
Let me tell you something right now.

454
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,530
There's no fucking snakes in
Sydney, Australia. All right?

455
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:09,840
There's all that shit's in the
middle of their fucking country.

456
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:12,990
Every where there's
some at the zoo, right?

457
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,440
Every once in a while you'll see
somebody you know goes to pick up a snake

458
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,940
thinking it's a garden snake.

459
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,340
He goes fucking bit and that goes jogging
and it racist through his veins and he

460
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:29,550
fucking dies. Yes, that does happen. But
you know, people don't, you know what?

461
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:31,770
Let's, let's actually, let's
look up some stats here.

462
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,250
Let's go to the stats here cause I don't
think you're going to hear enough stats

463
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:38,040
between now and the Super Bowl, you know,

464
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,980
is that as they sell the game layup
start new talent cab note and whether his

465
00:27:45,311 --> 00:27:50,000
whole career ahead of them cover it up
against the Lally lance on the plate and

466
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,920
LATIC though went to Germany
and God knows what happened,

467
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:55,300
but he's not on the patriot.

468
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:59,200
So ESPN is not gonna cover it.

469
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,530
Um, I'm not, I don't even think
he did anything, but you know,

470
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:04,990
but the accusation was out
there. I mean it came from algae.

471
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,310
Xera I mean who knows more
about NFL football than Algiers?

472
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:12,370
Z Al Jazeera.

473
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,330
All right, what was, what the
fuck was I looking up? Alright.

474
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:17,600
Okay.

475
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,120
Snake by death.

476
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,423
Okay.

477
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,160
And Australia comes right up.
This is all touristy shit. Like,

478
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:29,490
am I going to die if I go
down there? Snake bite debts,

479
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,690
2015 list of fatal snake
bites in Australia.

480
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:37,260
Gotta love the Internet. I'm not
saying the information is right,

481
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:40,860
but they always have an answer.
All right, snake bite. Dell,

482
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:45,861
east eastern Brown snake is responsible
for about 60% of deaths caused by snake

483
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,900
bite in Australia. All right?
Is the numbers the 2000 tens?

484
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,790
All right. Uh, in 2015, there was one,

485
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,970
one brown snake or tie pant.

486
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,570
The species is unconfirmed. You know why?

487
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,870
Because the snake left
didn't hang out like Yo,

488
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:12,490
I did that shit like the little found
as a snake. You get it. I'm sorry.

489
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,800
Um, in 2014, there was two a right?

490
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,800
That's big, bad, dangerous fucking
Australia. Let's check out the u s

491
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,500

492
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,230
Where then the fuck love

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,353
United State's

494
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:37,760
list of fatal sneak bites in the
u s all we got to do is be one.

495
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,300
One ties it and it goes in overtime

496
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,750
and the 2010,

497
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,680
whoa, we crushed them. One, two, three,

498
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,800
four, go fuck yourself.
Australia, Paula Herald,

499
00:29:59,130 --> 00:29:59,650
wall forest,

500
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,520
39 year old female, a
green, Mojave rattlesnake,

501
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,770
Russell Lee Davis, 39. Jesus 39 was
an unlucky year. Timber rattlesnake.

502
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,013
You want to hear the story?

503
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,410
Dave was sitting around the fire at his
family's camp when he was bitten by a

504
00:30:14,411 --> 00:30:18,760
rattlesnake. Jesus Christ. In the balls
right in front of his whole family.

505
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:23,380
He was taken to the hospital and from
there air lifted to the a Pittsburgh area

506
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:25,120
hospital. While on route,

507
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:29,080
the helicoptered Davis
suffered a cardiac arrest.

508
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,740
Jesus Grant Thompson 18 male.

509
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,483
Yeah,

510
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,640
a Cobra. Who the fuck has a cobra?

511
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,160
He got hit by a car.

512
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,570
Wayne Thompson was found unresponsible
in his car in North Austin.

513
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,990
Lowe's in North Austin, and
a low store parking lot.

514
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:54,640
How the fuck do you get
by a monocled Cobra? Oh,

515
00:30:54,641 --> 00:30:58,840
it's got the one fucking glass
on it too. What little I grass?

516
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,990
Because I said it was evil like it's
a James Bond villain. All right.

517
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:07,490
It's a Colbert species, which
is widespread across the
south and Southeast Asia.

518
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,670
Oh Jesus. Somebody fucking ordered one.

519
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:18,670
A Monaco Cobra that he was known to own,

520
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:22,660
was missing and was
later found dead nearby.

521
00:31:22,661 --> 00:31:24,850
Haven't been run over by a car.

522
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,520
Wait a minute, I, I'm sorry. We got,

523
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,540
we got to get to the bottom
of this fucking story.

524
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,290
So this fucking kid
ordered a Goddamn Cobra.

525
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,680
Wait a minute.

526
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,460
Do one of these people gonna
fucking La. Let me, let me, let's,

527
00:31:45,461 --> 00:31:48,460
let's not get crazy here. Let's, let's
find out what happened to this kid.

528
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,400
Jesus Christ. Greer Thompson

529
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:57,930
grant t h o M.

530
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,030
Thompson Cobra. Alright.

531
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,790
Grant Thompson committed
suicide by allowing a Cobra.

532
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,753
Okay.

533
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:11,630
This is the most, this can't be true.
Suicide by Snape by question mark.

534
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:12,650
Is this click big?

535
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,723
Okay.

536
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,640
I was going to say this kid looks just
like Lance Bass and it was actually

537
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:19,690
clickbait on the side.

538
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:24,691
Says Lance Bass shows us the most
expensive item from his wedding registry.

539
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,350
Isn't that a little disrespectful
to have next to this kid? All right,

540
00:32:29,351 --> 00:32:30,460
so the kids sitting here,

541
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,423
okay.

542
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,350
What the parrot from one of his, uh,
like one of those Beretta parrots,

543
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,263
police,

544
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,730
Texas teen's death after he leaves
a cryptic message on Facebook.

545
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:48,590
The decks death of a Texas teen who was
killed after being bitten by a Cobra

546
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,950
last Tuesday is being
investigated as a suicide.

547
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:56,930
Austin police confirm to people.
Is this people magazine? Yeah,

548
00:32:56,931 --> 00:32:58,460
they're in deeper into
what people are doing.

549
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:03,790
Grant Thompson was found unresponsible
inside his car and a Lowe's parking lot

550
00:33:04,741 --> 00:33:09,741
last week with puncture wounds to his
wrist and a snake cage beside him.

551
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:11,700
Yeah.

552
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:16,440
KWTX reports. He was discovered surrounded
by a large, by a number of animals,

553
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:20,670
including a non venomous snake.
Six tarantulas in a frog,

554
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,680
but as pet cobra was missing,
this was in his fucking car.

555
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:30,630
Thompson was rushed to blah, blah,
blah, or he later died. Yeah,

556
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,400
I don't think in Austin they're going to
have shit for a cobra unless they got a

557
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:38,860
zoo nearby rang. It was
located above. Above.

558
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,210
Police believe that Thompson committed
suicide by allowing the venomous snake to

559
00:33:42,211 --> 00:33:45,630
bite them. Surely before
he was found Tuesday,

560
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:49,770
the team posted a cryptic message to
his Facebook page. Writing, I'm sorry.

561
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,260
Thompson's family owns a
pet shot in temple, Texas.

562
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,540
He'd worked for the
store most of his life.

563
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,540
He could handle tarantulas
like they were kittens.

564
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,780
He loved the animals and loves
spreading awareness about animals in the

565
00:34:03,781 --> 00:34:07,620
community. NAHB Saatchi
was performed Thursday,

566
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:11,040
but authorities at waiting
for the toxin. What the fuck?

567
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:17,050
Jesus do that as hardcore. Do you
have you heard those things that

568
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:23,050
there is nothing like the hiss of a
fucking reptile and that fucking reptilian

569
00:34:23,051 --> 00:34:25,210
look like what are the look are
they going to have in their face?

570
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,550
How is Lance Baz reverse aging?

571
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,790
Jesus Christ fucking teeth of like,

572
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:39,650
does he even eat anything? His teeth
are like brand new, like out of the box.

573
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,440
Um, all right. I think it's time
to wrap this up. Wrap it up.

574
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:48,110
I'll take it. Um,

575
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,510
wait a minute. Where the fuck am I here?

576
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,440
Where's the rest of this shit? Ah,
Jesus Christ. Bill. What are you doing?

577
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,600
All right. And that's not it.
Is this it? That's not it.

578
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:07,250
That's a shit about my will.

579
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,420
I don't know what this is and I don't
know where a very maybe with everything

580
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:15,530
went. I give up. Oh, fuck it. Anyways,

581
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:17,270
that's the end of the
podcast. Jesus Christ.

582
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,380
Mike and Dolan says to
anybody knew that kid holy.

583
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,270
You know what are the odds for this?
No Way. He was covered for that, huh?

584
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,650
And your fucking insurance.

585
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:32,030
Accidental death accidentally getting
bit by a Cobra and the wrist in the

586
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:36,830
parking lot of a Lowe's
in Austin, Texas. All,

587
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,330
all right. Anyways, that's the podcast.

588
00:35:39,331 --> 00:35:42,840
I hope you guys have a great weekend
and stay away from the snakes.

589
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:47,220
So you know what Australia,
alright, that was deliberate.

590
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:49,630
So we can't count that one. So we, we uh,

591
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,480
we had three times as
many deaths as you did.

592
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,070
So why don't you tone down how fucking
nuts you stayed as or your country,

593
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,990
whatever it is. Right island, you know,

594
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,980
it's not that fucking
dangerous. You know what it is.

595
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:09,510
We buy into it because of the fucking,
uh, the shrimp on the Barbie guy,

596
00:36:09,511 --> 00:36:12,750
Paul Hogan and then the
crocodile hunter. You know,

597
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:15,840
and when you really think about it,
how did the crocodile hunter die?

598
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,710
Was it one of those snakes that
he was constantly fucking with?

599
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,000
Was it any other, the land animals
that he was constantly fucking with?

600
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:25,020
It was not,

601
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,700
he fucked with the sting ray and he
forgot that those things always are armed.

602
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,850
They always have a shank.
He got stuck right,

603
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,060
like a fucking prisoner. Um,

604
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:41,330
as enough time gone by that you can
actually address the foolishness of that

605
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:46,260
death. Like, let me fucking go. Just
jump on the back of a sting ray.

606
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,850
You know, and I'm not talking
about the corvette people,

607
00:36:50,851 --> 00:36:52,890
I'm talking about the actual fucking fish.

608
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,970
Where do you job boasting raid?

609
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:02,340
You gotta Watch that tail a
little stab you in the heart.

610
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,030
You swim to the surface and police out.

611
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,150
I'm sorry. Anyways, that's, that's the
podcast for this Thursday afternoon.

612
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:18,150
Have a wonderful weekend you cards. Um,

613
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,360
my condolences to their kid in the Lowe's
parking lot into the crocodile hunter,

614
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,990
even to Paul Hogan. You know,
I don't know what he's up to.

615
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:29,310
I hope he's got a new hat though,
you know, nice new, fresh head. Um,

616
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,510
and with that,

617
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:33,030
here's a little bit of music from
Andrew [inaudible] and a little bit of

618
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:34,170
throwback podcasts

619
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,330
from a, from a year ago.

620
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,380
[inaudible]

621
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,380
I'm not crazy like my brother,

622
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,330
but it's where the
Achoo whoever this auto,

623
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:14,430
I know Brown with the session when I
got Gamblin who is what y'all bread,

624
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,590
man, mom, all that. I was that positive

625
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,630
and that wasn't a

626
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,213
[inaudible].

627
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:40,010
That is, it built a bit of a
dilemma here for you. I'm an

628
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:44,480
18 year old male who is about to graduate
from high school. Congratulations.

629
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,470
Um, over the past few years I've
been told I'm a really good dancer.

630
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,960
Not Ballet or artsy stuff, but
just good dance floor dancing.

631
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,980
Oh my God, I'm going to take
over the dance floor. Hey Angie,

632
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:01,100
watch me your John
Travolta. This is great.

633
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:04,850
Do you go out to the a Staten island
bridge and do headstands with your,

634
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,410
with your buddy Bobby? You
know, if he didn't have an Afro,

635
00:39:09,411 --> 00:39:12,800
he never would've fell off that
bridge if he had it high and tight.

636
00:39:12,801 --> 00:39:17,130
Like all these Armenians out here, all,
every Armenian looks like they know, uh,

637
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,480
they, they know m m m m a moose.

638
00:39:20,481 --> 00:39:24,230
Last time you saw in our Armenian
dude in his twenties or thirties,

639
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,650
and he did not look like he could put
you in an armbar within two seconds if he

640
00:39:27,651 --> 00:39:28,484
wanted to.

641
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:35,230
If I W if I was Dana white and I was
running the UFC at one point that this

642
00:39:36,801 --> 00:39:38,060
point, what are up to like what,

643
00:39:38,061 --> 00:39:42,650
like UFC 2006 you know,

644
00:39:42,651 --> 00:39:46,070
they're like running, they've run out
of adjectives this time. It's really,

645
00:39:46,071 --> 00:39:49,160
really personal, right? Not Saying
I'm not a fan of a huge fucking fan,

646
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:52,530
I'm just saying, you know, the way they,

647
00:39:52,531 --> 00:39:56,360
they have those things like every other
week there's only so many like you know,

648
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:00,050
redemption. I mean you've
run out of words. Um,

649
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:02,930
I'm such a fucking idiot.

650
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,650
This is what I would do if I was dating
white at some point I would have,

651
00:40:06,651 --> 00:40:08,690
you know, you know what I would,
this is what I would branch off.

652
00:40:08,691 --> 00:40:12,080
And when they had those
tough man competitions and
they would have just people

653
00:40:12,081 --> 00:40:13,580
coming in, throwing haymakers,

654
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,640
which is some of the best boxing ever
is when you watch people who just aren't

655
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:19,080
trained whatsoever and
they just start, you know,

656
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,200
cause somebody is going to connect. Right.

657
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:25,550
I think that they should have one week
they should have the Armenians versus the

658
00:40:25,551 --> 00:40:29,390
Russians. Tough man competition.
Because I really think that that needs,

659
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:34,040
it needs to be decided who is
the tougher of the two? Uh,

660
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:37,650
cause more now when it comes
to white people, that's,

661
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,880
that's who I got my money
on. All right. That, those,

662
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:45,710
those are the crips and the bloods of
white people is the army and the Russians,

663
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,480
all of them, they just have that vibe.
This something you just like, yeah.

664
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:54,620
I'm not fucking with that guy. Just
really, I'm really not doing it anyways.

665
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,860
Uh, not a ballet or artsy stuff. Uh,

666
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:02,240
but just ballroom dates in a
full contagion over here. Uh,

667
00:41:02,241 --> 00:41:06,740
I kinda think of think dancing is
gay from an outside point of view.

668
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:12,260
Um, I it isn't, it really isn't.

669
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,820
That's just how white people look at it.

670
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:17,600
It's considered gay cause it involves
like letting yourself go and actually

671
00:41:17,601 --> 00:41:22,530
admitting that you have emotions as a
man, as a white male. Yeah. It's, yeah,

672
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,250
it is. It's considered gay. Um,

673
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,620
as is crying,

674
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:32,950
as is showing any sort of emotion as
is not dying for no good goddamn reason

675
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:37,250
before you're 56. I'm
not dying, I should say.

676
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,970
If you live to be 60, I believe amongst
white men, that's also considered gay.

677
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,820
Cause that means at some point you cried
something out of your chest and you

678
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:47,860
didn't have a heart attack. Um,
anyways, he says, I think, uh,

679
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,210
dancing is gay from an
outside point of view,

680
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:54,680
but I'll be the first one to admit that
I'm actually a pretty good dancer if I

681
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:57,740
didn't think so, I wouldn't be out
there doing it. Yeah. But Dude,

682
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,690
you gotta be getting some, I'll, I'll
fucking, women love a guy who can dance.

683
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,710
If you can dance and you're wearing
like a silk scarf, it's fucking over.

684
00:42:06,711 --> 00:42:09,680
It's going to be rain and pussy.
As far as my outside view,

685
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:14,150
my freckled view from over in the bar
trying to stand out from underneath those

686
00:42:14,151 --> 00:42:16,940
hot lights so I don't
get burned. Uh, you know,

687
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,660
red heads with the closest
thing to vampires. You know,

688
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,880
we have, we, we have none
of the powers of vampires,

689
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:27,810
but the sun affects us the same.

690
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,400
Okay.

691
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,020
A friend of mine who is a female dead
keeps telling me I could make money doing

692
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:40,640
it on commercials or music
videos, parentheses clothes on.

693
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:45,710
Or You could go to fucking Broadway and
be like one of the five straight men who

694
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:50,711
dances on Broadway and just tag every
fucking lonely chick out there who's all

695
00:42:51,441 --> 00:42:54,140
stretched out. Just make
sure you keep their shoes on.

696
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:58,400
Dancer's feet are always fucked up.
Uh, here's where it gets complicated.

697
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:03,380
I plan on becoming a policeman. Oh
Dude, this is, this is a no brainer.

698
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:08,180
You need the dance it Bachelorette parties
dressed as a cop. All you need, dude,

699
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:11,810
is that a fake uniform on a boombox
and you're on your way to making money?

700
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,420
Dude, you should fucking
do that in a second.

701
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:16,640
And then you write a book about it.

702
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,360
I was a gyrate and cop
for Bachelorette parties.

703
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:23,630
You write a tell all book
about how many fucking broads,

704
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,600
who bought ready got married, go
get married, sucked your Dick.

705
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,540
You really need help on this one. I
mean I'm going to read the rest of it,

706
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:32,000
but I think I've already come
with the solution anyways.

707
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:34,580
How is anyone supposed to take
me seriously on the force?

708
00:43:34,581 --> 00:43:36,770
If there's a video going with me,

709
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:40,430
pop and locking next to little
Wayne at the same time, I'll, dude,

710
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:42,050
you should fucking pull people over.

711
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,880
You should pull people over and fucking
moonwalk up to their car and just freak

712
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:49,340
them out. Even if they
were reaching for a gun,

713
00:43:49,341 --> 00:43:51,440
they'd be laughing too hard and
they, they, they wouldn't shoot you.

714
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,840
Then you could rest them and then
you move up. Next thing you know,

715
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,760
you're a commissioner, right?
Nothing. Anyways, at the same time,

716
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:02,720
I'm getting laid a lot because of
it. Of course you are. I'm a seven.

717
00:44:02,721 --> 00:44:06,350
On a scale of 10. I like this
guy. He's honest and um, uh,

718
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,690
and like having a jumpshot, it's
put me up to an eight, five,

719
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:15,500
um, Bang, intense. I've always
wanted to be a cop at the parks here.

720
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,280
Seen better. If I was able to make
money doing it over in a dancing thing,

721
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:24,670
I wouldn't just be getting hammers
for letting gross moms off on speeding

722
00:44:24,741 --> 00:44:29,420
tickets. I could be banging
J-lo. She's into dancers, right?

723
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,590
Thanks. Yeah. APP's a fucking lutely dude.

724
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:37,710
You're basically saying,
what should I do here?

725
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,320
Should I bang j Lo's beat down at the
club and make all this fucking money?

726
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:48,690
Or should I take a job where I'm going
to get shot at and not be appreciated?

727
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,310
You know, I'll tell you every cop
out there with dance, if they could,

728
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,390
as opposed to being a cop, I don't care
if they'd like seven generations in.

729
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:02,640
Dude, this is what I think of as
far as like dancing. I think if I,

730
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:07,140
if I like compare it to
being a comedian, oh,

731
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:11,430
the open mics would be getting a piece
of part cardboard and being on a subway

732
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:13,140
platform, making money that way.

733
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:18,770
And then when you move up to hosting a
show that would be addressed as a cop and

734
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:22,650
you fucking dance it. Bachelorette
parties, that's what you do on the side.

735
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:27,270
That's like your fucking day job. That
bullshit. And then during the day, I,

736
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:29,070
yeah, I would try out
for those. Fuck, I don't,

737
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:33,480
did they make music videos
anymore or fucking, uh,

738
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:38,340
I dunno. I believe it or not. I don't
know how to climb the ladder as a dancer,

739
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:40,530
but dude,

740
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:44,550
apps a fucking lutely if you
could make money doing that shit.

741
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:50,280
And then what the great thing is, is
once you get to a certain level to, to,

742
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:54,300
uh, make more money, you know, once
you've got some credibility, you can,

743
00:45:54,390 --> 00:45:58,730
you always have the fallback where
you can teach your class. They can,

744
00:45:58,731 --> 00:45:59,331
you can be like,

745
00:45:59,331 --> 00:46:03,380
I danced for nine years and Chitty
Chitty Bang Bang and fucking banged every

746
00:46:03,381 --> 00:46:04,580
fucking broad on there.

747
00:46:04,581 --> 00:46:07,490
And then if you'd like to know how to
fuck the women in your cast while still

748
00:46:07,491 --> 00:46:12,140
not losing your job, come on down the
Frankie's fucking data studio or whatever,

749
00:46:12,141 --> 00:46:17,140
just you'll figure it out as
you go in there. And, um, yeah,

750
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:21,230
absolutely. Absolute fucking
Lulea. I would definitely do it.

751
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,590
You want to do what you want
and taking the time, um,

752
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:29,990
to write in. So your big fears should
be whatever, everybody's big fears.

753
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,420
Like what if I fucking go after this
dream and I'm 30 and I'm sleeping on a

754
00:46:33,421 --> 00:46:36,420
fucking futon and it hasn't happened yet.
Well, I gotta tell you something, sir.

755
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:38,850
I'd been there. I was there at fucking 34.

756
00:46:38,851 --> 00:46:42,430
I was still sleeping on a futon and a
fucking studio apartment that they call

757
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,170
the one bedroom,

758
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:46,020
cause they slammed a fucking wall
in there and put a door on it.

759
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:49,650
And then one day I was trying to bang
the girl upstairs who had the fucking

760
00:46:49,651 --> 00:46:53,950
apartment, right, right, right above
me. And it was the exact same unit.

761
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,910
And hers was a studio,

762
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:57,370
but she had been there longer so
they never slammed a wall in there.

763
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:00,790
And I realized, Hey, wait a minute,
I'm getting fucked. You know,

764
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,280
I should go down there and try to
get some money taken off of this.

765
00:47:03,281 --> 00:47:06,910
I should go down to the A, they're fucking
me over rental board. But I didn't,

766
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:12,100
I said, fuck it. Just keep
writing jokes. Right. So whatever

767
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,780
all you gotta do, you just gotta
commit to this shit. And, uh,

768
00:47:16,781 --> 00:47:17,890
and then realized that, you know,

769
00:47:17,891 --> 00:47:21,430
sleep on Futon when you're 30 is
not the worst thing. It isn't.

770
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,370
You don't see what, you know, it's
worse than sleeping on Futon at 30,

771
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:28,150
sleeping in a king bed next to a fucking
woman you're not really love with,

772
00:47:28,151 --> 00:47:30,450
but for some reason and a,

773
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,700
you've got a couple of kids and you've
got a job that you fucking hate. Okay?

774
00:47:33,701 --> 00:47:37,630
You'll be laying there fantasizing about
fucking sleeping on a, on a, on a, uh,

775
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,600
on a futon there.

776
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:45,280
There's no risk when you go after
a dream, it's all fucking reward.

777
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:47,560
It's all gonna lead to
something good. It always does.

778
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:52,890
There's a tremendous amount of
risk to playing it safe and uh,

779
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:58,060
that leads to unbelievable
levels of regret,

780
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:01,150
which is something else I've also
experienced. Cause I'm an old man.

781
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:05,933
[inaudible]

782
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:08,110
no man. Cross

783
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:18,650
[inaudible] to and

784
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:34,403
say

785
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,310
down. This is titled the frayed

786
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:46,790
break up with girlfriend.
You Man, I'm gonna read slow.

787
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:51,170
So this takes up as much time
as possible. Hey Bill. Um,

788
00:48:51,171 --> 00:48:52,670
I'd like to get your advice on something.

789
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:55,940
I've been dating my girlfriend for
almost a year now and I've been thinking

790
00:48:55,941 --> 00:48:59,300
about breaking up with her. Well,
it's time to break up with her, sir.

791
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:02,390
All right. And dating her for a year.

792
00:49:02,391 --> 00:49:04,580
You know you have to still even
thinking about breaking Ed's time.

793
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,533
Okay.

794
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,880
I says we get along fine and we rarely
argue. I was just thinking of a great,

795
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,640
a great way to break up with someone
they should invent like a breakup suit,

796
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,833
right?

797
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,900
Just something where you just cannot get
injured and you just put the thing on

798
00:49:20,901 --> 00:49:23,990
with the fucking helmet.
You don't wear the helmet,

799
00:49:23,991 --> 00:49:26,990
you just put the ones he'd zip up on
and which totally protects everything.

800
00:49:26,991 --> 00:49:31,930
Right? And then you get in the passenger
seat and you let her drive. Oh,

801
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:34,390
why are you gonna let me drive?
Why did you just drive tonight?

802
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:39,310
But you always liked to drive
honey. You just drive. Okay,

803
00:49:39,311 --> 00:49:43,120
why are you wearing that suit? It's all
going to make sense at about five miles,

804
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:43,961
right?

805
00:49:43,961 --> 00:49:48,880
You get out on the fucking highway and
you just start talking to her and out of

806
00:49:48,881 --> 00:49:53,680
no way. He just put the helmet on, you
know, when she says, what are you doing?

807
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:56,260
And just say, listen, I don't
want to go out with you anymore.

808
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:59,170
And then she goes, what?
And you go, hey, watch this.

809
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,830
And he just opened the door and you
roll out of the fucking car. That's it.

810
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:07,630
You're out. You know, type
up the fake police report.

811
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,640
You tell him that you died,
then she feels bad for you.

812
00:50:09,641 --> 00:50:13,510
You don't have to deal with any sort
of repercussions. Um, anyways, he says,

813
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,280
we get along fine and we rarely argue,

814
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,670
but I'm starting to realize I don't
really want to be with her for the long

815
00:50:18,671 --> 00:50:21,760
haul. When we started dating,
oh, this fucking thing.

816
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,790
These iPads suck by the way. All
right. You know what an iPad is?

817
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:31,310
It's fucking laptop for pussies. What's
the matter? Your laptop is too heavy.

818
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:34,880
You fucking douchebag this thing doesn't
have a keyboard. It's got nothing.

819
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,760
You think that they don't know how to
make this thing into a fucking laptop

820
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:39,140
already. Of course they do.

821
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:44,230
This is the Steve jobs way of doing things
rather than just giving you the whole

822
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:45,074
fucking thing.

823
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,020
He's going to give you an intro
increments like a God damn drug dealer.

824
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,720
You know? That's why I haven't bought one
of these yet. This is Nias by the way,

825
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:57,980
borrowed this fucking thing
and I am not enjoying it.

826
00:50:57,981 --> 00:51:01,400
As you can tell as I'm throwing a
temper tan from here. You know what?

827
00:51:01,401 --> 00:51:04,520
I'm going to buy a fucking iPad. I'm
going to buy it when it is a laptop,

828
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:07,340
when it is a little light
laptop. Until then I'm not,

829
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,830
I'm not having this
fucking this. This is like,

830
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,480
this is like when you know you go,

831
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:14,840
I know I really want to get the new
Camaro and then you get the one with the v

832
00:51:14,841 --> 00:51:17,930
six engine rather than getting the
full out one with the stick shift,

833
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:23,420
which is a laptop, right.
It's too heavy, you know,

834
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:28,160
fucking deuce. Do Shoulders at the
gym next time you do that. Okay.

835
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:32,150
Maybe do that. Maybe to do some stuff
to build up your risks. Oh God. Bill.

836
00:51:32,151 --> 00:51:35,450
Can you get through the question?
All write a well, um, he says, uh,

837
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,640
when we first started dating,
I loved hanging out with her,

838
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:41,510
but I'm just not into it anymore. Does
that make me an asshole? No, it doesn't.

839
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,030
Why would your own true feelings
make you an Asshole, sir?

840
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:49,490
How awful were your parents? Um, he
says, I'm 23 years old with a somewhat,

841
00:51:49,491 --> 00:51:51,710
why am I, you know, I'm a
really being a cunt this week.

842
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,430
This guy's him for my advice. Let's
try to bring the anger down. Bill,

843
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:58,580
you're frustrated. It's
fucking hot in here.

844
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,400
You can't open the window
because you say cunt too much.

845
00:52:01,401 --> 00:52:03,770
This building's a co op and
they'll kick you up. Okay.

846
00:52:03,771 --> 00:52:06,770
That's what's going on here. It has
nothing to do with this person. Okay?

847
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:11,570
Why don't you just try to be a nice guy
so I should've done off the Mike like

848
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:13,460
I'm scolding myself. Just
try to be a nice guy.

849
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:17,570
Let's not take out your bad
day on everyone else. Okay?
You're embarrassing me.

850
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,580
All right. I'm 23 years old,

851
00:52:19,581 --> 00:52:23,480
but somewhat of a decent job and really
just want to go back to being single for

852
00:52:23,481 --> 00:52:27,830
a while. Exactly. Dude,
you're 23 years old, dude.

853
00:52:27,831 --> 00:52:29,660
You're fucking movie star at that age.

854
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:33,650
I don't care what you're doing for a
living. Should definitely be single.

855
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,660
I said, the problem is
she's got a lot less,

856
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,330
she's got a lot of stress in her
life right now. Not your problem.

857
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:42,890
She's finishing nursing school and
trying to find a job. All right,

858
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,640
well tell her to put on the outfit
Banger one more time and hey, watch this.

859
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:53,150
You bail out of the car.
That's mean. Um, anyways.

860
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:58,070
He says, oh, and she has a history
of depression over the past year.

861
00:52:58,071 --> 00:53:01,310
I feel like she is becoming
emotionally dependent on me.

862
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,700
Like I'm keeping her going or
something. Well, Jesus Christ the one.

863
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:07,520
Do you want to get rid of
her? You don't want this.

864
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,793
You know,

865
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,040
you want something that someone
that's gonna be fun to be around.

866
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:17,600
You don't want her, you know,
it's sunny out and she's like,

867
00:53:17,601 --> 00:53:21,170
it's raining out the fucking
head under the pillow.

868
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,040
One of these days, you know,

869
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,060
he stayed with that long enough one
these days you just gonna it's going to

870
00:53:27,061 --> 00:53:29,800
smother with that pillow. So anyways,

871
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:34,840
so how do I go about breaking up with
her while causing the least amount of

872
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:37,840
damage? Uh,

873
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:41,300
he said also she always leaves some
of her shit in my apartment. Yes.

874
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:45,720
Cause she's, she wants to fucking
Oh yeah, she's calling an idea.

875
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,560
You says clothes, blanket.
Other random shit.

876
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,930
I tried to get her to
take a shit home with her,

877
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:55,910
but how do I avoid after the after
breakup coming over to get my stuff?

878
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:00,560
I hate that. Anyway. Go
Fuck Yourself. All right,

879
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,293
look,

880
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,430
there's no way. There's no easy way
to break up with somebody. All right.

881
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,910
There's just easier ways. Uh,

882
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:15,200
the sooner the better. Um,

883
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:20,010
oh Diane, I'll do this is, this
is like dismantling a bomb.

884
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,720
So you know what you would like to do
is say, Hey, can you come by today?

885
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:27,730
I want to talk to you about something.
Right. And she always share.

886
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:30,660
I'll be right over and then
immediately just take out a box,

887
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:35,550
put all over shit in it. Tape it up
and then she rings the Bell Bing Bomb.

888
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:37,780
You Open the door, you get, yeah,
don't want to date you anymore.

889
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:40,590
And he just handed the box
and close the door right

890
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:43,620
to there's money to be made in this man.

891
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:48,650
Does anybody have a professional breakup
service at such a pussy thing to do?

892
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:52,860
But that would be phenomenal.
You know, you feel,

893
00:54:52,861 --> 00:54:54,720
you make your person
feel like they got fired.

894
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,250
You're like what a corporation fires you
and just two security people show up,

895
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,103
you know,

896
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,290
confiscate your computer and then escort
you out of the building when that'd be

897
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:07,560
great. Do, that's what you should do.
Just hire two of your friends to dress up.

898
00:55:07,561 --> 00:55:10,800
Like security guards. Tell her
you want to break up, you know.

899
00:55:10,801 --> 00:55:14,100
And then they have all their shit
in the box. Then they escort,

900
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,010
escort or right out of your apartment
building. Like she got fired.

901
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,660
They come off as professional
rather than like personal. Um,

902
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:26,250
how do you go about breaking up with
it? You know what I would do? Um,

903
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:30,660
I wouldn't put all this shit in the box
cause that's going to come off cold,

904
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:35,490
you know, and you don't want to hurt
her feelings like that. So I would just,

905
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:40,470
uh, uh, fuck it. I don't know.
I don't know how to do it.

906
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:43,170
Why did I drink last night? And
then I got up and did open Anthony,

907
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:45,520
what the fuck is wrong with me? I
knew I had a podcast to do. Yeah,

908
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:50,520
he embarrassing. Um, I don't know.

909
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:54,270
Fucking no. Have a come over
and just say listen. Um,

910
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,550
I'm not happy. Oh, that's a great
one. That's a classic. You know,

911
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:02,190
like if you were a singer songwriter
the second you said that the whole crowd

912
00:56:02,191 --> 00:56:04,530
would start applauding,
recognizing the big hip.

913
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:13,170
Well, of all the girls I do before, you
know, they all start fucking clapping.

914
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,350
You know, if they just came out, you
just did classic breakup monologues.

915
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:21,210
Listen, um, I'm just not happy everyone,
just that smattering of applause.

916
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:24,790
You wait for it to die down. Let
the orchestra come around again.

917
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:29,280
She jumped back in on the one, um, match.

918
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:32,300
Tell you're not happy. I'm
not happy anymore. And Dude,

919
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:35,040
let me tell you something. Her being
depressed is not your fucking problem.

920
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:41,080
Alright? Her being depressed
is the fucking problem.
How can you do this to me?

921
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,870
What do you mean? How can I do this
to you? You don't want be wars.

922
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:46,390
If I fucking stayed with you and I didn't
love you, I don't love you anymore.

923
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:49,570
I don't love you. Depressed whore.

924
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:56,010
I just called you a whore as a
generic term. You know, I don't, I'm,

925
00:56:56,011 --> 00:56:59,860
I'm not happy I want out, okay? I just
feel like I want to be single right now.

926
00:56:59,861 --> 00:57:02,500
I just don't feel like I'm going
to be with you in long haul. Uh,

927
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:06,250
we'll just be wasting each other's time.
My time is important and so is yours.

928
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,880
All right? I don't want to go
anymore, but I'll tell you what.

929
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:14,680
If you go to stamps.com they'll
give you $55 free stamps at a scale.

930
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:19,730
That's what you do. Just tag every mean
thing you say with all the advertising.

931
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:25,330
You know, if you go to amazon.com
through bill burrows website, you know,

932
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:29,530
click on the Little Amazon banner,
whatever you buy, you know,

933
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:33,070
portion of that money goes back to bill
burn and then the percentage of that

934
00:57:33,071 --> 00:57:34,600
goes to the wounded warrior project.

935
00:57:34,601 --> 00:57:37,240
So I know I'm breaking up with
you right now, but you could,

936
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,010
we could also support the troops,

937
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,113
right,

938
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:44,650
sir? Look, there's no
fucking easy way to do this.

939
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,680
And you're going to be sitting
there. How many more holidays?

940
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:52,120
How many more birthdays? How many more
Christmases, which is a holiday? Sorry,

941
00:57:52,121 --> 00:57:54,730
you always need three examples. Do you
want to go through with this person?

942
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,510
How many more times do you want to go
out and rent bikes? Go to a picnic,

943
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,550
sit there on a sunny day.

944
00:58:00,551 --> 00:58:03,190
Is she sitting there with that
cloud over her fucking head?

945
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:05,103
You know,

946
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:09,180
dude, you know, don't do that yourself.

947
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:13,890
You want to fucking people who have just
wonderful human beings and they just

948
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:17,460
end up with assholes. I
swear to God, assholes.

949
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:21,240
They look for wonderful
human beings because other
assholes are not going to put

950
00:58:21,241 --> 00:58:25,440
up with them. You know, so you need to
be an asshole here at, you know, the,

951
00:58:25,441 --> 00:58:28,470
the how society looks as an, as an
asshole. Like you're being selfish,

952
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,660
not being selfish. All
right? Choose yourself.

953
00:58:30,661 --> 00:58:33,540
Choose your own fucking life
dumper you get on with your life.

954
00:58:35,330 --> 00:58:36,163
You know,

955
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:38,810
this is what you do.
You get yourself a six,

956
00:58:38,811 --> 00:58:41,180
a fucking Pale Ale or
whatever beer you like.

957
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,310
You stick a couple of glasses
in the fucking freezer.

958
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,600
All right?

959
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,940
Like anticipation of this championship
that you know you're gonna win. You know,

960
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:56,380
like they did the red sox dugout when
they had the champagne on ice and game six

961
00:58:56,650 --> 00:59:00,400
in 1986 before they had to
quickly wheel it out, okay?

962
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,890
Except you're not going to let
this one go through your leg, sir.

963
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:04,240
You kicking this one, right?

964
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:07,690
The client and you'd taken home the
fucking championship and when it's over,

965
00:59:07,691 --> 00:59:10,930
all you gotta be just thinking about
those frosty fucking bruise in the fridge.

966
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,640
Just think about that. Just look at
the clock when she walks in. All right.

967
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:20,170
Let's say she comes in at 10
past two. Just say to yourself,

968
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:23,840
worst case scenario by three fucking 30,

969
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:28,820
I'm going to be sitting down on
this fucking couch. All right.

970
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,820
With my goddamn phone off,

971
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:35,300
drinking a couple of five
or six of these things

972
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:39,370
and then that's it. All right. Okay.

973
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:44,400
And then don't fucking
have a post breakup sex.

974
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:47,730
Don't do that. Cause then she'll
think that you're back together again.

975
00:59:47,731 --> 00:59:52,600
Fuck all of that. All right. Your
mind just see got to come back.

976
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:57,300
Yeah, my staff. Okay. When
do you want to come by?

977
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,180
This is coming off really cold.

978
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:04,440
She's going to do all of that and just
try to keep dragging you back into the

979
01:00:04,441 --> 01:00:06,990
fucking thing. Um,

980
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,660
I dunno if this is a punk thing to
do, but after you break up with her,

981
01:00:13,661 --> 01:00:16,600
just don't answer the phone when she
calls and then she'll find, just say,

982
01:00:16,601 --> 01:00:21,160
listen, I gotta I gotta come by and
get my stuff. Can you text her back?

983
01:00:21,161 --> 01:00:24,700
I fucking just be a man. What does
she going to do? Body Slam you.

984
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:28,600
She's just going to make
you feel bad. All right.

985
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:34,570
[inaudible] is it you
little blue? You would.

986
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:41,110
No, it's cause you're a mopey.
You're sucking the life out of me.

987
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:44,260
You know when, when you get
that sad look on your face,

988
01:00:44,261 --> 01:00:47,590
you look like a muppet
there. I said it all right.

989
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:49,030
There's your shit over
there in the corner.

990
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:51,910
I've got a couple of cool ones in the
fridge, so why don't you do me a favor.

991
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:54,250
All right, get over there
Ben down. Lift what you need.

992
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:59,290
Get your shit and get the fuck out of
here. What do you say that touch? Yep.

993
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,150
Prince Jarman is out there somewhere.

994
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,770
You know and ain't here.

995
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:08,380
I'm not riding that horse anymore. Okay?
I just shot it in the back of the head.

996
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,530
It's over. Okay, so why don't
you trudge on out of here?

997
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:14,710
They're fucking Cinderella.
Go look in a mirror.

998
01:01:14,711 --> 01:01:17,140
Go climb up in a tower and
fucking drop your hair out.

999
01:01:17,141 --> 01:01:19,120
Whatever the fuck you
supposed to do. Kiss a frog.

1000
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:24,360
All right. I got drinking to
do, but I don't want to bait it.

1001
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:26,213
Something like that.

1002
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,680
Like I said, all that bullshit.

1003
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:32,690
I said 10 past two which over by
three 30 by three 30 at Busan.

1004
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,750
All right. I don't know

1005
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:41,930
now the fucking brutal breaking
up to something as brutal, brutal,

1006
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:43,920
just awfulness at this
five minute podcast.

1007
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:44,813
But other than that

1008
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:20,783
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1009
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:45,250
I've been all over the map politically,
but it's why like, you know,

1010
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,810
certain ways of looking at shit,
like when people talk about guns,

1011
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:52,720
like let's just make them what? Let's
just make them illegal and then no,

1012
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:55,180
we all have them. You know,

1013
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:58,060
like that sort of like
thought process is your,

1014
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:03,090
you're acting as though the world is a
utopia and that there's not morons and

1015
01:03:03,761 --> 01:03:08,230
that there's not, uh, people who say,
I don't give a fuck what the rules are.

1016
01:03:08,231 --> 01:03:11,320
You're totally not even taking
into consideration sociopath,

1017
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:15,550
which is why that new fucking
thing that Obama signed,

1018
01:03:15,551 --> 01:03:20,230
that whole defense package where now they
can just arrest people without a trial

1019
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,780
Jay and put you in jail forever with,

1020
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:25,720
without a trial because they just
think you're a fucking terrorist.

1021
01:03:25,721 --> 01:03:28,750
You can't give people that level of power.

1022
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:33,130
I'm a fucking moron. And I know
you can't do that. Historically,

1023
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,070
no one has ever handled
that level of power. Well,

1024
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:38,230
anybody here want to go live in China?

1025
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:42,670
Now we out there practicing your nunchucks
wearing your wooden slippers and all

1026
01:03:42,671 --> 01:03:45,670
of a sudden a van pulls up and you
disappear and that's it forever.

1027
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,410
You want to live there?
Of course you don't.

1028
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:50,080
You want to live here where they can't
fucking do it. Well, they can do it now.

1029
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:54,940
You know? They just put in a fucking
order for a bunch of black fans.

1030
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:59,140
That's what I heard. According to Holy
shit.com that's what's going down.

1031
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:04,560
I don't understand why stuff at that
level that affects citizens to that level.

1032
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,380
Why we don't get to vote on it.

1033
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:14,200
Do you think it's because we'd
say, Hey, you know what? Fuck that.

1034
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,620
Do you understand like that
is just a jump off point.

1035
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:19,880
Do you think like that's just how it's
going to stall as though you're not a

1036
01:04:19,881 --> 01:04:22,120
terrorist there, you ain't
going to fucking problem.

1037
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,310
You think it's just
going to stop with that.

1038
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:26,860
That's not how you take away freedom.

1039
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:30,130
You don't just fucking do it all in
one fell swoop. It's incremental.

1040
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,310
It's just like when you're dating some
fucking woman and you're not paying

1041
01:04:33,311 --> 01:04:36,610
attention and she just gradually, every
day takes another foot of real estate.

1042
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:38,650
Next thing you know you're
in goal line d going,

1043
01:04:38,651 --> 01:04:40,330
how the fuck did I end
up in this situation?

1044
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:44,930
We started at the 50 little push little
pole, right? Everything was fine.

1045
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:46,270
Next know you're up against the Golan.

1046
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:48,880
The you think that they're just going
to keep it with the terrorist thing,

1047
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:50,400
you know?

1048
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:54,190
You know they'll wait for a whole nother
generation of babies to be born and

1049
01:04:54,191 --> 01:04:57,520
they always grew up with government having
that level of power and then they add

1050
01:04:57,521 --> 01:05:00,550
something else to it. Then they
had something else. Then that's it.

1051
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:03,790
You can't have it. Okay.

1052
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:08,860
If Tiger Woods can't handle the
level of free pussy on a golf tour,

1053
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:14,340
how the fuck is our government going
to handle a new defense package,

1054
01:05:15,881 --> 01:05:20,650
which basically gave a mute
button when you love the egg,

1055
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,080
how would you handle that if
you had that power, do you,

1056
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:27,110
how long before you just
started abusing that?

1057
01:05:27,111 --> 01:05:31,790
If you could just hit mute on anybody who
ever disagreed with you and then just,

1058
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:33,680
and you could have them whisked away.

1059
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:38,180
Okay.

1060
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:43,160
I mean, that is the sociopath's
wet dream. That's what that is.

1061
01:05:43,161 --> 01:05:46,660
That is a fucking mute button, Mr Style.

1062
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:51,270
And don't you think that's it? He hit
mute. You're done. You're gone. See Ya.

1063
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:57,560
I think it's, it's
fucking insane. And I'm,

1064
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:02,900
the only thing that I get out of it is
that I feel like I was proven correct

1065
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:05,810
that I don't think it
matters at that level.

1066
01:06:05,811 --> 01:06:10,340
Whether you vote Democrat or Republican
Obama, the first black president ever,

1067
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:14,260
you would think this would
be the most liberal, uh,

1068
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:16,850
politician in the history of this country

1069
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:21,510
because of his background. You would
think that he signed off on that shit.

1070
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:23,120
Okay.

1071
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:27,260
All right. I'm telling you, I don't know
what happens when you become president,

1072
01:06:27,261 --> 01:06:31,650
but I think they let you peek just
enough behind the curtain and you there,

1073
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:35,580
there was a fucking agenda that we
are moving towards because it does,

1074
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,150
I don't think of fucking
matters. I really don't,

1075
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:43,520
which is why I always
vote for the Ralph Nater,

1076
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:45,110
the fucking Ron Paul,

1077
01:06:45,111 --> 01:06:49,460
all those guys that all those fucking
idiots go to cause you did that.

1078
01:06:49,461 --> 01:06:53,600
You've ruined the election. Really? Did I?

1079
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,740
I feel like those guys wouldn't
have signed shit like that.

1080
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:02,160
I feel like their track record shows
that they would not sign shit like that.

1081
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:08,460
I don't know. I have no, I imagine I'm
going to get a ton of fucking emails.

1082
01:07:08,461 --> 01:07:08,720
I'm almost,

1083
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,150
somebody was yelling at me one time saying
that because I voted for Ralph Nader

1084
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,030
in 2000 that's why George W.

1085
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:19,310
Bush won and they was just going on
and on and on about it. And I was like,

1086
01:07:19,311 --> 01:07:22,820
dude, I live in New York.
Al Gore won my state.

1087
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:25,940
Okay. Do you understand that?

1088
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:28,970
So your whole fucking theory
right now is out the window.

1089
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:33,440
I voted for Ralph Nader in New York
and Al Gore still won the state.

1090
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:35,510
So go fuck yourself. What?

1091
01:07:35,511 --> 01:07:40,511
I'm trying to do a mister
fucking red and blue tie here.

1092
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,840
I'm trying to fucking encourage
more people like that to vote.

1093
01:07:44,841 --> 01:07:48,350
So mission accomplished. That's what I'm
trying to fuck and have to vote to run,

1094
01:07:49,710 --> 01:07:50,543
you know

1095
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:57,230
uncorruptible how far can you get if
you're uncorruptible I would say that you

1096
01:07:57,380 --> 01:07:58,910
could get to the uh,

1097
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:01,990
okay.

1098
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:05,540
Whatever level politics is when you
decide whether or not they should put a

1099
01:08:05,541 --> 01:08:09,170
gazebo in the center of town. I
think beat. Once you get beyond that,

1100
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:11,840
you gotta you gotta be
a little dirty. Right.

1101
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:18,290
I love talking about this shit cause it
just people up, you know. Oh you know,

1102
01:08:18,291 --> 01:08:22,240
maybe you should all read a little more
before the next time you fucking own.

1103
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:27,980
Really. What are you reading and what
are you reading? What they give you?

1104
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,540
Is that what you're reading? Fuck head.

1105
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:32,720
Why you acting like you have clearance
to the bottom floors of the fucking

1106
01:08:32,721 --> 01:08:37,250
Pentagon? You're guessing? Just
like I am. All right, Mr. Informed.

1107
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:41,900
I read the pamphlet. I know
by a fucking word of it.

1108
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:44,203
You know,

1109
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:49,610
you can use Coca-Cola to take rust
off of metal. You can use it for that.

1110
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:50,473
You know,

1111
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:55,850
you understand that yet they're
still able to sell it to us.

1112
01:08:55,851 --> 01:08:56,780
Like it's refreshing.

1113
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,890
I don't know what that point man either

1114
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,153
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1115
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:14,440
[inaudible] [inaudible]
ladies and gentlemen.
