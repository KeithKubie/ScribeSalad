00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:04.810
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY: Wow.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.590
One word?

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.090
MATIAS DUARTE: One word.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.256
You want me to say one word?

00:00:07.256 --> 00:00:09.410

best describes a designer?

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.260
DUSTIN SENOS: Can
I make a word up?

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.544
Solutioner.

00:00:12.544 --> 00:00:13.460

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.000

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.580
SHALIN AMIN: Storyteller.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.340
ANDRE PLAUT: I think
the word "synthesis."

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.460
MICHAEL RENAUD: Punchline.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.500
JONATHAN LEE: Dexterous.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.501
RICHARD THE: Thoughtful.

00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:22.625
SCOTT DOORLEY: Intentional.

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:23.790
ENRIQUE ALLEN: Intentional.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.470
JON WILEY: Inquisitive.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.615

00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:28.620
RACHEL BEEN: Neurosis.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.109
MARK KAWANO: Unsatisfied.

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.400
FEMALE SPEAKER: What do you
consider to be good design?

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.890
TYSON EVANS: I mean, the
best design's invisible.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.490
SHALIN AMIN: Invisible.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.610
KOEN BOK: Design that
you don't really notice,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.720
but you start remembering
it for being good,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.110
because it was
never in your way.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.010
DUSTIN SENOS: Frictionless.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.100
MAYKEL LOOMANS: You design
as little as possible.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.366
MICHAEL RENAUD: Less design.

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.740
JONATHAN LEE:
Appropriate design.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.948
JON WILEY: Design is not art.

00:00:46.948 --> 00:00:48.705
Design is about
solving problems,

00:00:48.705 --> 00:00:52.485
and so I think a good design
solves an important problem

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:53.081
to people.

00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:55.330
RACHEL BEEN: It's a product
that solves a user's need.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.038
VIVIAN ROSENTHAL: A
solution to something

00:00:57.038 --> 00:00:58.890
that should be designed,
not just designed

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.776
for design's sake.

00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:02.310
BRYNN EVANS: Good design
is thoughtful and thorough.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.518
CLARK VALBERG: Crystallizing
all of the conversations

00:01:04.518 --> 00:01:07.419
that need to happen to really
fully realize a strategy.

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:09.710
SOLEIO CUERVO: Operating not
just at the surface level,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.050
but creating rich, engaging,
beautiful experiences,

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.460
but really thinking through,
how does this product,

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.060
how does this service, fit
within a person's life?

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.680
ANDRE PLAUT: Solves a problem
while motivating people

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.660
to do more.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.985
MATIAS DUARTE: Solves
people's problems and touches

00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:24.515
them emotionally
at the same time.

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:25.890
JOSHUA TOPOLSKY:
Something that's

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.130
beautiful, and functional,
and immediately says

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.690
what it does, what it
is, what it's there for.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.356
DANIEL BURKA: Design
that makes products

00:01:34.356 --> 00:01:37.044
that help people's lives,
make people's lives easier.

00:01:37.044 --> 00:01:38.960
MARK KAWANO: If it moves
somebody in some way,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.940
that's good design.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.270
MIA BLUME: Hopefully, it's
delightful and beautiful.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.040
But at the end of the day, if
it didn't solve the problem,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.760
it didn't work.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.440
SCOTT DOORLEY: Being intentional
to help other humans.
