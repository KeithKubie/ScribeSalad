00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:14.333
I am a visual artist,

00:00:14.357 --> 00:00:17.738
and I make revolutionary art
to propel history forward.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.780
I'm going to come right out
and tell you something:

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:22.669
I don't accept the economic foundation,

00:00:22.693 --> 00:00:23.854
the social relations

00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:25.578
or the governing ideas of America.

00:00:26.523 --> 00:00:28.457
My art contributes to fundamental change

00:00:28.481 --> 00:00:32.360
by encouraging an audience to address
big questions from that perspective.

00:00:32.892 --> 00:00:36.178
Social change is hard,
but ideas matter tremendously.

00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:40.714
When I say I'm an artist,
most people think, "Oh, he's a painter."

00:00:40.738 --> 00:00:43.271
Behind me, you can see
some of the kind of work I do.

00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:45.632
"Imagine a World
Without America" is a painting,

00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:47.149
but I work in a range of media,

00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:50.173
including photography,
video and performance art.

00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:56.354
A current project,
"Slave Rebellion Reenactment,"

00:00:56.378 --> 00:00:59.354
is going to be reenacted
on the outskirts of New Orleans

00:00:59.378 --> 00:01:00.537
this November.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.379
In 1989, I had an artwork that became
the center of controversy

00:01:06.403 --> 00:01:09.051
over its transgressive use
of the American flag.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.254
"What is the Proper Way
to Display a US Flag?"

00:01:12.278 --> 00:01:15.352
is a conceptual work that encouraged
audience participation.

00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:18.700
It consisted of a photo montage
that had text that read,

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:21.219
"What is the Proper Way
to Display a US Flag?"

00:01:21.243 --> 00:01:24.841
Below that were books that people
could write responses to that question in,

00:01:24.865 --> 00:01:28.062
and below that was a flag
that people had the option of standing on.

00:01:28.086 --> 00:01:31.146
The photo montage consisted
of images of South Korean students

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.617
burning American flags,

00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:35.465
holding signs that said,
"Yankee go home. Son of a bitch,"

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:38.728
and below that were flag-draped coffins
coming back from Vietnam.

00:01:39.461 --> 00:01:41.529
People wrote long and short answers.

00:01:41.553 --> 00:01:45.095
Thousands of people engaged with the work
in a lot of different languages.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.715
Some of the people said,

00:01:47.414 --> 00:01:48.668
"I'm a German girl.

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:51.714
If we Germans would admire
our flag as you all do,

00:01:51.738 --> 00:01:53.473
we would be called Nazis again.

00:01:53.497 --> 00:01:56.103
I think you do have too much
trouble about this flag."

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.762
"I think that the artist
should be returned to his heritage,

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:02.431
i.e., the jungles of Africa,

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:05.081
and then he can shovel manure
in his artistic way."

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:10.582
"This flag I'm standing on stands for
everything oppressive in this system:

00:02:10.606 --> 00:02:13.674
the murder of the Indians
and all the oppressed around the world,

00:02:13.698 --> 00:02:15.702
including my brother
who was shot by a pig,

00:02:15.726 --> 00:02:18.762
who kicked over his body
to 'make sure the nigger was dead.'

00:02:19.776 --> 00:02:21.379
That pig was wearing the flag.

00:02:21.403 --> 00:02:23.745
Thank you, Dread Scott,
for this opportunity."

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:25.860
"As a veteran defending the flag,

00:02:25.884 --> 00:02:28.153
I personally would never
defend your stupid ass!

00:02:28.177 --> 00:02:30.695
You should be shot!" -- US Navy Seal Team.

00:02:32.463 --> 00:02:35.925
As you can see, people had
very strong reactions about the flag then,

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:37.180
as they do now.

00:02:37.606 --> 00:02:41.390
There were demonstrations of veterans
in front of the Art Institute of Chicago.

00:02:41.414 --> 00:02:42.663
They chanted things like,

00:02:42.687 --> 00:02:44.935
"The flag and the artist,
hang them both high,"

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.483
evoking images of lynching.

00:02:46.507 --> 00:02:48.145
I received numerous death threats,

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:50.299
and bomb threats
were phoned in to my school.

00:02:50.323 --> 00:02:52.003
It was a very dangerous situation.

00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:54.934
Later, President Bush called
the work "disgraceful,"

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:56.753
which I viewed as a tremendous honor,

00:02:56.777 --> 00:02:58.302
and Congress outlawed the work.

00:02:58.326 --> 00:02:59.431
(Laughter)

00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:03.472
I became part of a Supreme Court case
when I and others defied that law,

00:03:03.496 --> 00:03:05.681
by burning flags
on the steps of the Capitol.

00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:09.605
That action and the subsequent
legal and political battle

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.307
led to a landmark First Amendment decision
that prevented the government

00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:15.709
from demanding
patriotism be mandatory.

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.389
But let me back up a bit.

00:03:17.413 --> 00:03:19.673
These people literally wanted me dead.

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:23.257
What I would do at this moment
would make a difference.

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:25.328
This is me at the exact same moment,

00:03:25.352 --> 00:03:27.133
eight stories above that crowd.

00:03:28.368 --> 00:03:30.249
It was supposed to be for a photo shoot

00:03:30.273 --> 00:03:34.068
that was going to take place on the steps
where the veterans were at that time.

00:03:34.092 --> 00:03:37.118
It wouldn't have been safe
for me to be there, to say the least.

00:03:37.142 --> 00:03:39.283
But it was really important
to do that shoot,

00:03:39.307 --> 00:03:42.196
because while some wanted to kill me,
it was also a situation

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.910
where those who viewed the American flag
as standing for everything oppressive

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:47.090
in this system

00:03:47.114 --> 00:03:48.409
felt that they had a voice,

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:50.400
and that voice needed to be amplified.

00:03:50.837 --> 00:03:52.061
The point is this:

00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:53.455
changing anything --

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:57.481
whether it's conventional ideas
about US national symbols,

00:03:57.505 --> 00:04:00.427
traditional thinking challenged
by scientific breakthroughs

00:04:00.451 --> 00:04:02.879
or ousting an authoritarian president --

00:04:02.903 --> 00:04:04.230
requires a lot of things.

00:04:04.254 --> 00:04:05.866
It requires courage,

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.045
luck

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.713
and also vision and boldness of action.

00:04:10.971 --> 00:04:12.141
But on luck --

00:04:12.165 --> 00:04:15.638
I have to say, the photo shoot we did
might not have worked out so well.

00:04:15.662 --> 00:04:18.092
We laughed after we were out of the area.

00:04:18.116 --> 00:04:19.984
But the thing is, it was worth the risk

00:04:20.008 --> 00:04:22.015
because of the stakes that were involved.

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.192
And in this case, the luck
led to a wonderful,

00:04:24.216 --> 00:04:25.727
profound and powerful situation

00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:27.217
that was also humorous.

00:04:27.241 --> 00:04:28.405
Thank you.

00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:30.805
(Applause)
