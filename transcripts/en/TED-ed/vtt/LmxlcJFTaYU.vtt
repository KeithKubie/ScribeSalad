00:00:07.693 --> 00:00:10.063
How do you know you're real?

00:00:10.087 --> 00:00:12.932
It's an obvious question
until you try to answer it,

00:00:12.956 --> 00:00:14.661
but let's take it seriously.

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:17.135
How do you really know you exist?

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:19.849
In his "Meditations on First Philosophy,"

00:00:19.873 --> 00:00:23.018
RenÃ© Descartes tried to answer
that very question,

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:26.148
demolishing all his preconceived
notions and opinions

00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:28.963
to begin again from the foundations.

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:32.272
All his knowledge had come
from his sensory perceptions of the world.

00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:33.645
Same as you, right?

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:37.400
You know you're watching this video
with your eyes, hearing it with your ears.

00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:40.275
Your senses show you the world as it is.

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:43.165
They aren't deceiving you,
but sometimes they do.

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:46.032
You might mistake a person
far away for someone else,

00:00:46.056 --> 00:00:48.449
or you're sure you're about
to catch a flyball,

00:00:48.473 --> 00:00:50.649
and it hits the ground in front of you.

00:00:50.673 --> 00:00:52.501
But come on, right here and now,

00:00:52.525 --> 00:00:54.766
you know what's right
in front of you is real.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.364
Your eyes, your hands,
your body: that's you.

00:00:57.388 --> 00:01:00.837
Only crazy people would deny that,
and you know you're not crazy.

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:03.339
Anyone who'd doubt that must be dreaming.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:06.376
Oh no, what if you're dreaming?

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.084
Dreams feel real.

00:01:08.108 --> 00:01:10.067
You can believe you're swimming, flying

00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:12.553
or fighting off monsters
with your bare hands,

00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:15.029
when your real body is lying in bed.

00:01:15.053 --> 00:01:16.068
No, no, no.

00:01:16.092 --> 00:01:18.406
When you're awake, you know you're awake.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.761
Ah! But when you aren't,
you don't know you aren't,

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:24.962
so you can't prove you aren't dreaming.

00:01:24.986 --> 00:01:29.025
Maybe the body you perceive
yourself to have isn't really there.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.970
Maybe all of reality,
even its abstract concepts,

00:01:31.994 --> 00:01:36.434
like time, shape, color
and number are false,

00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:38.288
all just deceptions concocted

00:01:38.312 --> 00:01:40.267
by an evil genius!

00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.957
No, seriously.

00:01:41.981 --> 00:01:46.870
Descartes asks if you can disprove
the idea that an evil genius demon

00:01:46.894 --> 00:01:49.721
has tricked you into
believing reality is real.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.969
Perhaps this diabolical
deceiver has duped you.

00:01:53.993 --> 00:01:56.769
The world, your perceptions
of it, your very body.

00:01:56.793 --> 00:01:59.696
You can't disprove
that they're all just made up,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.820
and how could you exist without them?

00:02:01.844 --> 00:02:03.830
You couldn't! So, you don't.

00:02:03.854 --> 00:02:05.819
Life is but a dream,

00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:10.270
and I bet you aren't row, row,
rowing the boat merrily at all, are you?

00:02:10.294 --> 00:02:11.939
No, you're rowing it wearily

00:02:11.963 --> 00:02:17.205
like the duped, nonexistent
doof you are/aren't.

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:18.778
Do you find that convincing?

00:02:18.802 --> 00:02:20.049
Are you persuaded?

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:23.236
If you aren't, good;
if you are, even better,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.205
because by being persuaded,

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:28.283
you would prove
that you're a persuaded being.

00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:31.749
You can't be nothing
if you think you're something,

00:02:31.773 --> 00:02:34.171
even if you think
that something is nothing

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:37.590
because no matter what you think,
you're a thinking thing,

00:02:37.614 --> 00:02:42.305
or as Descartes put it,
"I think, therefore I am,"

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.781
and so are you, really.

00:02:43.805 --> 00:02:44.938
