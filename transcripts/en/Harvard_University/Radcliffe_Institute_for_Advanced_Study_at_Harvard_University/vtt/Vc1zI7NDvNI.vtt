00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.824
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.760
-Thank you, Judy, for that
very generous introduction.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.900
And thanks to all
of you for coming.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.290
Like everybody, I'm
especially appreciative

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.250
of the opportunities that being
at the Radcliffe Institute

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.930
offers for those of us who
just need an extended time away

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.840
from administrative duties,
in particular in teaching,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.670
to work on a monograph
project like this.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.550
So my aim today is to
offer a summary of one

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.884
of the chapters of my book.

00:00:36.884 --> 00:00:38.550
But before I do that,
I want to give you

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.680
a little bit of background
on the book itself.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.670
It's part of a trend
in the last 20 years

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.790
that has seen a real
explosion of interest

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.730
in the sea, prompted
in part by concerns

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.920
about the negative
impact of humans

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.690
on the marine environment.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.550
The historical
ecology of the sea

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.270
has become a particularly
lively field, reflected

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.610
in new international
research initiatives,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.010
such as Oceans Past and the
History of Marine Animal

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.060
Populations, that focus on human
responsibility for rising sea

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.560
levels and the depletion
of fish stocks.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.230
For geographers and historians,
globalism and the unifying role

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.190
of oceans has stimulated
projects such as Seascapes

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.970
and Oceans Connect.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.230
For archaeologists, research
on wetlands and coastal spaces

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.250
has boomed in the
last two decades,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.240
evident in CITiZAN, a massive
UK network of volunteers,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.700
to identify and
monitor important sites

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.260
around the coastline.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.610
Maritime anthropology,
for long a leader

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.660
in framing humans'
relationships with the sea,

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.230
has responded to
this new interest--

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.780
I think is very interesting--
by focusing much more on policy

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.920
issues and on the
human dimensions

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.380
of environmental change.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.460
Now, historians
have been interested

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.620
in all of these developments.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.710
The rich interdisciplinary
perspectives

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.610
produced by this
new work, however,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.920
rarely consider the Middle Ages.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.830
And that's roughly the
thousand-year period

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.330
from around the fifth century,
the Fall of the Roman Empire,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.280
to the 15th century,
the Renaissance,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.572
exploration by sea-- expansion
of European exploration.

00:02:13.572 --> 00:02:15.030
Now, I think that
this oversight is

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.960
due primarily to the paucity
of documentary sources

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.220
for such investigations.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.760
I mean, medievalist simply lack
the personal correspondence

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.020
or the government commissions
or the captain's logs

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.300
and oral histories
upon which most

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.522
maritime and environmental
historians rely.

00:02:32.522 --> 00:02:33.980
Now medievalists
are more fortunate

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.210
when it comes to the
work of archaeologists,

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.000
but even their
excavation material

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.600
has been employed largely for
understanding ship technology

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.860
and exchange by sea.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.960
Another difficulty with
medievalists taking advantage

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.690
of this interest in the sea
is that although medievalists

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.180
have uncovered rich evidence
on how humans interacted

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.300
with and transformed
their natural environment,

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.130
the human-nature balance
was pretty different

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.370
than it is today.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.040
Medieval people certainly
changed their physical world,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.240
but nature, through such
events as sea storms and sea

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.890
surges, volcanic eruptions,
and epidemic disease,

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.120
was the chief protagonist of
medieval environmental change.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.280
So my project, therefore,
focuses not only

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.890
on people as ecological
actors, but also-- and probably

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.990
to a greater extent-- on
how the maritime environment

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.530
itself influenced the people
who lived on its shores.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.570
I'm especially
interested in analyzing

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.270
the impact of
marine environments

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.190
on the types of work, economic
strategies, value systems,

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.290
and family structures of
those residing near the sea

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.414
in medieval England.

00:03:43.414 --> 00:03:44.830
And here, particularly,
the period

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.320
from the 12th through the
15th century, because that's

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.780
when both the documentary and
the medieval sources are best.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.370
So this afternoon,
I want to focus

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.990
on how we can gender female
the maritime world of ships,

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.230
waterfronts, and coastal
communities-- a world

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.250
that scholars have
largely populated

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.780
with adult males--
focusing on four questions.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.470
First of all, just saying, was
there a female presence at sea?

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.640
Two, what was the
experience of women

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.240
on shore, particularly in terms
of maritime-oriented work?

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.350
Three, what can a closer or
prosopographical examination

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.560
of one maritime community reveal
about women's status and family

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.710
strategies?

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.920
And last, how did the
marine environment

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.160
work through
demographic processes

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.850
to shape the role of women
and household dynamics?

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.120
So first of all, women at sea.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.120
Now, medievalists have
really made almost no attempt

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.530
to gender female the maritime
world of medieval England

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.960
or even to explore women's
relationship to the sea.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.790
And this is in
contrast to historians

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.440
of later periods, especially
the 17th century and later,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.390
who have done absolutely
terrific work on this issue.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.170
Even the recent survey by Susan
Rose, called, The Medieval Sea,

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.370
devotes one and
a half paragraphs

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.110
in the entire book to
women, alluding briefly

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.930
to the role of ship
owners and suppliers.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.250
Nicholas Rogers' magisterial
The Safeguard of the Sea

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.590
does not even list women or
wives or widows in the index.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.890
The two seminal works on
the medieval English Navy

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.460
by Nicholas and Laird both
restrict their coverage

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.190
of women to a short
paragraph-- they

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.320
use the same incident pointing
to a chronicler's assessment

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.580
of the failure of
a naval expedition,

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.926
as due in part to the presence
of prostitutes on board ship.

00:05:31.926 --> 00:05:33.060
[LAUGHING]

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.240
Now, when the scarce
evidence is assembled

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.990
for the medieval period,
there are in fact

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.940
no signs that the sexual
geography of the maritime world

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.030
of medieval England
was any less divided

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.080
and dichotomous than early
modern and modern scholars have

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.660
found for their periods.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.550
Indeed, the medieval world may
have been even more strictly

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.560
divided along gender lines.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.810
With the exception of
some intriguing stories

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.000
about Viking women
sea raiders-- highly

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.510
suspect-- nowhere
are to be found

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.220
the female tars or the pirate
queens or women in disguise

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.260
as seamen that those writing
about the early modern world

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.540
have discovered.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.110
And medieval women
just simply never

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.070
appear on board ship as
fishers, ship masters,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.140
mariners, or even on
shore as shipwrights.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.530
When English women in the
Middle Ages do go to sea,

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.590
it was mainly as
ship passengers,

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.070
although the
references are limited

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.790
to the voyages of
wealthy princesses

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.600
who go off to be married
or to female pilgrims--

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.210
sometimes, people
like Margery Kempe.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.890
Women accounted for barely 3%
of the known English pilgrims

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.490
to Santiago in
northern Spain-- that

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.590
was really one of the
big pilgrimage sites--

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.340
a very small number,
even for a list focused

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.350
on those wealthy enough to
receive protections and safe

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.180
conducts for the journey.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.420
Sea travel was dangerous
in the Middle Ages,

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.490
especially for women.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.720
I mean, witness the tragic
fate of two female passengers

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.720
on a 14th century English ship
that was attacked by pirates.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.562
They threw all the sailors
overboard, but kept the women

00:07:01.562 --> 00:07:04.020
alive for three days so that
they could have sex with them,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.840
and then threw them
overboard, as well.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.820
So these are stories
that would put fear

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.460
into any woman's
heart who is thinking

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.070
about getting on a ship.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.130
Medieval chroniclers
and sermon writers

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.110
also mention a few
prostitutes who

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.460
board ships, but their
numbers were minuscule

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.980
and their presence a device
to push a moralizing agenda.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.570
Having "harlots" aboard
was to invite disaster,

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.870
if not a failed
expedition, then a storm

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.610
at sea, as several
exempla-- exempla are

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.500
kind of didactic stories that
are inserted into sermons--

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.310
as these exempla make clear.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.640
In medieval England, prostitutes
were not, in fact, regularly

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.650
allowed on board
naval ships in the way

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.380
they were in the later
period, as this 16th century

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.610
painting shows.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.730
Where prostitutes
were more prevalent--

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.050
and this is a good example of
similarities across centuries--

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.300
were in waterfront
areas, especially

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.710
in the large port towns.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.600
So in a place like
medieval Sandwich, the town

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.880
itself established the
"common house" or the "stews",

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.810
which they called
the galley-- which

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.600
is pretty indicative
of the clientele

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.360
that they expected to come.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.340
According to medieval
preachers, sailors' association

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.370
with prostitutes was seen
as one of their major vices

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.700
and linked with tavern visits
and profligate spending

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.204
of wages.

00:08:24.204 --> 00:08:25.620
Now, although there
is, therefore,

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.480
little evidence of
women on board ships,

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.800
it is worth thinking more about
the contradictory impulses

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.480
evident in sailors'
superstitions

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.159
about women at sea,
compared to their tendency

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.549
to gender all ships female.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:44.570
And this is grammatically
and largely in ship names.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.580
And what are we to make of the
association of pagan goddesses

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.130
with controlling
the sun and stars

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.047
and protecting mariners at sea?

00:08:51.047 --> 00:08:53.380
Which, in turn, may have
promoted the role of the Virgin

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.620
Mary as patron of mariners
caught in dangerous storms.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:59.540
Then there's the
women in the sea,

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.980
such as sea nymphs who
frolicked in the ocean riding

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.190
on the backs of dolphins.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.360
Or sirens, who are the
half-animal, half-human woman,

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.060
whose songs lured
sailors to their death.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.050
Both date from the
Greek period, but were

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.240
firmly entrenched in
the medieval psyche,

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.170
as was the half-human, half-fish
mermaid, who tended to be

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.754
associated with vice and death.

00:09:18.754 --> 00:09:20.170
By the way, they're
all associated

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.020
with very negative things.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.460
All of these females of the
deep appear in medieval art

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.540
and in a wide variety of
secular and devotional texts,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.900
and await the attention
of medieval scholars

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.900
interested in interpreting the
often conflicting evidence they

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.070
present about gendering
the maritime world

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.190
of the distant past.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.960
It is not surprisingly
much easier

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.220
to find women ashore, working
at sea-related tasks for a wage

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.450
or profit.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.470
It is important, however, to
distinguish between the work

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.720
profile of women in
larger port towns,

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.260
and what they did
in these smaller

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.500
coastal settlements that
were devoted more to fishing.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.770
Women's work in
the seaport towns

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:02.210
was part of a very
occupationally diverse group

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.380
of people, and the
maritime work was dominated

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.770
by overseas trading interests.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.620
And frankly, the work that women
did in these big seaport towns

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.120
was not that different
from the work

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.931
that they would do in
even a big inland town.

00:10:14.931 --> 00:10:17.180
But there were a few exceptions,
and those are largely

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.420
ship-owning and overseas trade.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.970
So Alice Chester of
Bristol was a widow

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.950
who continued her merchant
husband's business, regularly

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.960
trading with Iberia
and Flanders,

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.880
sometimes in partnership
with her son, John.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.330
She invested her substantial
profits from these ventures

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.910
in property, constructing
new buildings,

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.380
loaning money, and
donating copiously

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.400
to religious and
charitable institutions.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.840
She also built a
crane-- public-minded--

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.160
on Bristol Quay, for the
large sum of 41 pounds.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.070
That is the equivalent
to the annual wages

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.660
of 10 labors over one year.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.320
So this is really a
large amount of money.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.010
Similar merchant widows can
be found in other port towns,

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:00.390
but like Alice Chester,
they were almost all widows

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.330
of wealthy merchants
who took advantage

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.650
of their dead husband's
business connections

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.370
and commercial capital
to continue the husband's

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.780
maritime trade.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.540
They also represented a
really tiny percentage

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.410
of an already elite group.

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:18.420
Women, for example,
imported less than 1%

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.690
of over 5,500 incoming cargoes
at the southwestern port

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:25.960
of Exeter, from the late 13th
to the early 15th century,

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.040
and less than 1% of
all overseas imports

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.310
in late medieval Bristol.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.920
Now, at the lower end
of the wage spectrum,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.260
we do find women more closely
involved with maritime work.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.310
In Southampton,
for example, there

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.310
was a female guild
of wool packers

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.700
who seemed to control
the packing of wool

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.560
to be loaded onto ships.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.860
Their guild ordinances
in 1503 make

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.980
it clear their proximity
to quayside business,

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.400
as well as their
ability to elect

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.710
two wardens to govern themselves
from amongst their membership.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.600
But guild vacancies
were to be filled

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.900
by the nomination of the
mayor and the corporation who

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.367
kept control of this guild.

00:12:02.367 --> 00:12:04.200
And there's really
little trace of the guild

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.370
in later centuries--
in later decades even.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.970
More common seems to
be these female vendors

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.990
of naval supplies for shipyards.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.460
Naval accounts of the
construction and repair

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.950
of the king's ships record
a number of women selling

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.640
something called towe--
T-O-W-E-- or oakum.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.630
And these are the rough
fibers of flax or hemp

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:26.210
which were used to caulk ships.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:30.530
Several of these women had the
surname Flaxwife, a reflection

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.290
of the work that
women did, often

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.530
in the tedious and
very uncomfortable

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.230
process of separating
and processing

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.840
the fibers of flax and hemp to
make linen, wicks, and rope.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.680
No women, however, ever appeared
amongst the ranks of the people

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.130
actually doing the caulking or
as shipwrights or as waterfront

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.870
porters, wine drawers, weighers,
crane operators, or custom

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.520
house officials that populated
the quays and the wharves

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.990
and storehouses of
medieval waterfronts.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.400
The waterfront activity that
employed by far the largest

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:06.980
number of women was vittling,
particularly of ale and fish.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:11.080
Now women brewed ale everywhere
in England, but in port towns

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.950
some of them did
operate on a larger

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.590
scale by selling wholesale
to departing ships,

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.160
particularly those
in naval service.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.030
Such female wholesalers
were, however,

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.830
relatively few compared to
the number of male vendors,

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.670
and were often at the mercy
of the precarious payment

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:32.630
system of the English Navy,
which was always in arrears.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.430
More numerous were female
sellers of fish, some of whom,

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:37.420
like Agnes Acrouch
of Winchelsea,

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.150
were wholesale
agents who supplied

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.950
substantial amounts of fish
to customers that included

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.110
large monastic households.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.820
But most women who sold
fish in medieval England

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.460
did so at the lowest
level, as street hawkers

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.900
who worked for fishmongers
and other middlemen,

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.070
barely scraping out a living.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.750
These fish sellers, like many
female hucksters of foodstuffs,

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.080
also acquired an
unsavory reputation.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.390
So it's hard to know
where the term "fishwife"

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.590
acquired its negative
connotation of overly

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.580
aggressive rough
women who sold fish,

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.870
but as Isaac Land points out
for the later period, "Her life,

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.820
labor, and language, all marked
her as part of the maritime

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.060
world. "

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.590
Now, medieval women were
also strongly associated

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:23.450
with gutting, cleaning,
packing, and curing fish,

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.920
especially herring--
an association that

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.880
is found in most
fishing societies,

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.370
regardless of
location or period.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.944
The most famous
medieval examples

00:14:31.944 --> 00:14:33.860
are the women who gutted
herring and laid them

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.040
in brine at the seasonal
fishery of Scania, which

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.780
is in southern Sweden.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.850
In its 14th century
heyday, this fishery

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.740
attracted 25,000 fishers,
merchants, vittlers,

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.560
and fish processors, from
late July to late September.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.950
An account from 1494
indicates that about 175 women

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:57.960
were employed on a seasonal
basis there to gut and clean

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.700
the herring catch, as well
as some 100 alewives who

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.150
filled over 2000
barrels with ale

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.200
during the two-month season.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.020
So these female migrants
were the predecessors

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.740
of the more well-known
Scottish women, most

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.010
young and unmarried, who
in the early 20th century,

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.870
moved steadily southwards,
following the herring as they

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:23.400
spawned down the Atlantic coast,
going from camp to camp to gut

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.860
and pack herring over the
course of seven months.

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.620
In the decade
before World War I,

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.950
about 12,000 Scottish
gutting quines

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.180
participated in this trade.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.810
Now, there's no traces
in medieval England

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.750
of women working on this
type of massive scale

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.560
in fish-curing,
although there is plenty

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:46.040
of anecdotal references to
women helping to gut and clean

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.650
and cure fish, particularly
in the inshore household

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.820
industry, where wives
and daughters were really

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.710
essential to producing
a saleable product.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:56.880
Herring spoils within two
days if you don't cure it.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.850
So if you want a commercial
product, you need to cure it.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.820
Now, the evidence
that I presented here

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.610
on the work of medieval
women in maritime communities

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.330
suggests that the maritime
environment offered women

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.790
several types of employment
that were generally not

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.240
available inland,
including high-status

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.650
ship-owning and overseas
trade, middling status

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:19.340
naval suppliers, and
organized wool packers,

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.400
and household-linked work making
and repairing nets, baiting

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.480
hooks, and gutting fish.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.160
Three other forms of
employment-- prostitution,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.530
fish selling, and brewing--
were strongly associated

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.264
with the sea, but were not
peculiar to the maritime world.

00:16:34.264 --> 00:16:35.680
I mean, you could
find these women

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.780
in any town or
bigger settlement.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.680
No women at all
seem to have worked

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.100
at sea as mariners or fishers.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.600
Only the ship owners, the
merchants, and the wool packers

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.020
received profits that would
be commensurate with men

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:48.730
in these jobs.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.030
But the female practitioners
of these trades

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:53.800
were a minuscule proportion
of the total numbers making

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.890
a living from this type of work.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.310
And the fact that
the female ship

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.690
owners and overseas merchants
were widows building

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.080
on their husband's
businesses, and the tendency

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.180
for much of the work
done by maritime women

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.890
to be typically gendered
female and often of low status,

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.550
detracts from the independence
that such activities

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.780
might otherwise suggest.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.420
Another approach that I
lean on heavily in my book

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:21.390
is called prosopography,
a methodological technique

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.609
that compensates for the
type of poor record survival

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:27.740
that we have for the
Medieval period by combining

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.300
all extant sources to create
a collective biography

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.490
of a particular social group.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:36.110
Now, the method often draws
on quantitative analysis

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:38.980
to track patterns in things
like occupations, and office

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.490
holding, and wealth,
to uncover more

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:46.120
about poorly-represented
groups in the pre-modern past.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.510
Now, prosopography
is labor intensive,

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:52.510
and it's not without
problems, chiefly, name

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.930
linkage across
different sources,

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.530
because the aliases
that medieval people use

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.026
or the different spellings
of their surnames.

00:18:00.026 --> 00:18:01.900
And because in England,
I'm reading documents

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:07.430
in Latin and Anglo-Norman
and in Middle English.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.070
So tracking these people through
even these different languages

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:13.560
and different documents
can be hard to do.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.370
But this technique does
provide valuable insights

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:20.110
into the work regime, status
networks, and family strategies

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.700
in smaller communities,
like maritime communities,

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.940
given the right set of sources,
as I have here for Hythe.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.350
Now, I do employ this technique
at several points in my book.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.020
It's one of the reasons
I call it an ethnography,

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.800
because I'm substituting
prosopography

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.220
for the kind of
in-person fieldwork.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.050
But in this chapter
on women and family,

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:42.170
my prosopographical analysis
focuses on the fishing port

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.180
of Hythe in Kent, which
had about 700 people

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.730
in the early 15th century.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.760
Because there's a huge
array of rich sources,

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.220
as you can see here.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.350
Now, the maletolt taxes
are particularly good,

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:56.876
and they show that about
21% of the households

00:18:56.876 --> 00:18:58.756
were involved in
fishing in some way.

00:18:58.756 --> 00:19:00.630
And that's actually a
quite large percentage.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.959
And now there's two
tables that have

00:19:04.959 --> 00:19:06.500
been handed out
because they're going

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.050
to be hard to see up here.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:11.410
So especially revealing in
table one are the 205 wills

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.720
from before 1527.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.350
Over 1/4 of these contain
maritime quests of high value

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:20.720
items, such as ships, vote
shares, and fishing cabins,

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.710
as well as fishing
gear-- so this

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:26.020
would be hooks, ropes, nets,
and other items associated

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.850
with seafaring or fishing.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:31.960
An extraordinary large percent--
41% of these maritime bequests

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.050
went to women,
particularly widows.

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.880
Indeed, a percentage of sea
craft-related items bequeathed

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.820
to women in Hythe was
considerably higher

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.020
than bequests of
work-related equipment

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.590
to non-fishing families.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:47.500
You know, smiths don't tend
to bequeath their smithy

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:52.990
to women in the family, or even
a forger or tongs or something

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.030
like that.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.430
Also striking is the
contrast between the wills

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.610
of Hythe, this
small fishing port,

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.930
with those of the big seaport
of Bristol, where only 4%

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:05.510
of almost 300 medieval wills
contained maritime bequests.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.180
And really, 1/3 of
these were simply

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.920
legacies to dockside
workers, not equipment.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.660
The Bristol testators tended
to be well-off ship owners,

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.920
ship masters, and shipwrights,
more than fishermen,

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.890
like the testators of Hythe.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.880
And with the exception of
ship owners, about 1/4 of whom

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.180
left shares in their ships
to widows and daughters,

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.320
the other maritime
occupations in Bristol

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:31.210
never left the tools of their
trade to their female kin.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:34.510
And I've also added here the
ports of Lydd and Folkestone

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.990
to show you that it's not just
Hythe, but these neighboring

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.580
ports where you find a
similar type of profile.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.370
And most of the women
in the Bristol ports

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:43.950
who inherited ship
and boat shares

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:47.410
co-owned their vessels with
sons or with their husbands'

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.590
partners, suggesting that these
maritime bequests were meant

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:53.640
to represent forms of
easily-liquified capital

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.560
for widows and dependents.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.530
And really, at a
place like Hythe,

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.090
or at Lydd and
Folkestone, the frequency

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.270
with which fishing
equipment, in particular,

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:06.960
was bequeathed to all family
members, including women,

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.240
suggest inheritance
strategies that

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:12.850
emphasized a shared identity
and a common investment

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:14.750
in the maritime enterprise.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.620
So the co-ownership
of such capital assets

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:21.000
as fishing captains, and boats,
and capstans, and windlasses,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.220
and even nets, I
think also points

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:27.140
to the collective nature of
risk management in these fishing

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.860
communities.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.127
Now, this is not to deny the
privileging of male heirs,

00:21:32.127 --> 00:21:33.960
which you're going to
see right away looking

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.210
at table two-- especially sons.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:39.340
A hefty percentage of the widows
receiving maritime bequests,

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.770
for instance, were
guardians of minor sons.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.650
And when older sons were around,
widows' share of these bequests

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:46.430
did tend to be lower.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.340
Male kin were also
favored over female kin.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.170
Male servants and
fishing partners

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.260
could be beneficiaries,
although sustaining the family

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.900
enterprise seems to
have been paramount.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.610
A number of the
wills, for example,

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.460
make clear that
whoever of several sons

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:04.090
pursued fishing was to get
the testator's boat or nets

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:05.060
and hooks.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.650
Others gave first crack
at buying these implements

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:09.010
to their brothers.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:11.740
And although it's impossible
to value the bequest because we

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.440
don't have inventories,
my impression

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.770
is that, by far, men got the
higher value fishing gear

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.410
than the women.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.020
The most frequent
maritime bequests

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.290
were nets, which accounted
for just under 1/2

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:27.310
of all the legacies, compared to
25% for boats and boat shares.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.450
As I said, sons were the single
largest beneficiaries of nets,

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.440
but really daughters
were not that far behind.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.600
After that, came hooks,
which were the most commonly

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.364
bequeathed items to daughters.

00:22:38.364 --> 00:22:40.780
And you have to think about
this-- they were not going out

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:44.220
to fish, and yet they were
receiving these bequests.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.726
So the relative
frequency with which

00:22:45.726 --> 00:22:47.600
women were receiving
these types of bequests,

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.800
and even on occasion
bequeathing them in turn,

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.330
reinforces other evidence
that women's maritime labor

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.330
within fishing household
was oriented, in large part,

00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:00.530
towards making and
repairing nets and baiting

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.870
hooks for longline fishing.

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.530
Both tasks could be done
on shore, close to home,

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:09.200
and required skills, such
as spinning and twisting

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.950
fibers, threading and knitting,
that were usually associated

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:14.510
with women's household work.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.450
Women were also involved
in the growing, processing,

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:20.060
and spinning of hemp
and flax, material

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.210
used in ropes and fishing lines.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.240
In other words,
this maritime work

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.740
reflected typical gender
divisions of labor.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.870
I also want to argue
that this type of work

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:35.450
brought women into-- firmly--
into the maritime sphere.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.290
So in his will, John Tiedemann
of Folkestone, for example,

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.190
ordered that his wife
should be allowed

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.770
to dry the nets that he had
left to her outside the fishing

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.300
cabin that he'd actually
bequeathed to his son,

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:50.120
implying his woman supervised or
shared in a fishing enterprise

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.230
separate from the son.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.670
It's unlikely that Tiedemann's
wife ever went to sea,

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:57.200
but she was the
stakeholder or an investor

00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.370
who owned and looked after
capital equipment, such as nets

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:04.340
and hooks, and thus, was due a
share of the fishing profits.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:07.050
And we can see other
evidence of joint enterprises

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:09.780
like this in a lot
of references that I

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.340
had to take out of the paper in
order to meet the time limit.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.740
So on to the fourth
and last question,

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.640
and that concerns how the
marine environment worked

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.940
to shape demographic forces.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.390
These would be things
like mortality, migration,

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:29.480
marriage-- in
maritime communities.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.360
Now, this demographic
question has

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.610
been addressed by early
modern and late modern--

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.193
there's quite a few
articles on this--

00:24:35.193 --> 00:24:37.359
but no medievalist has
ever tried to take this on,

00:24:37.359 --> 00:24:38.650
because we don't have the data.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.490
I mean, demography tends
to be highly quantitative.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:42.500
You need numbers.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.920
So you need parish
registered data

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.837
about when people were
born and when they died

00:24:45.837 --> 00:24:46.919
and when they got married.

00:24:46.919 --> 00:24:47.970
And we don't have that.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:51.230
So what I have done, and what
most people in my position,

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.320
is we look around
for what we can get.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.560
And we often take observable
phenomena in the later period.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.320
And so I have six separate
demographic characteristics

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.240
that I've identified in
later maritime communities.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.700
And we look for traces
of those things.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.514
We look for hints--
little bits and pieces.

00:25:07.514 --> 00:25:08.930
So that's what I'm
going to do now

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.310
is quickly run through
this list of six things

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.530
to make some
suggestions about what

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.820
I think are real parallels
between the demographic

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:21.710
situation in medieval English
communities and later ones,

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.840
anywhere from the 17th
to the 19th century.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.790
So the first of these is the
regular and often long male

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:33.510
absences from home, due to the
demands of fishing expeditions,

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.760
naval ventures,
privateering, and piracy,

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.050
or coastal and overseas
trading voyages.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:39.800
Now, I stress here,
these absences

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.030
were highly seasonal,
affected not only

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:44.820
by weather-- I mean, the Baltic
just shut down in the winter,

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:45.320
for example.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.740
Nobody was going to Scandinavia
in January and February.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:53.100
As noted here, also, there was
an abundant-- largely anecdotal

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.710
evidence, however-- that
medieval fishers and seafarers

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:58.090
were often away from home.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.340
And they didn't hesitate to
migrate to other regions,

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.300
as well.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:05.050
And these absences actually grew
longer in the later Middle Ages

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:08.280
because English and
French and Iberian fishing

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.386
all started to expand
to Greenland and Iceland

00:26:11.386 --> 00:26:12.760
and further north
in Scandinavia.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.930
And so, of course, they're
away for months at a time.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:16.513
In England, they
went first to Ireland

00:26:16.513 --> 00:26:18.466
before they went anywhere else.

00:26:18.466 --> 00:26:20.340
And then you also have
the Hundred Years' War

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.173
during this period,
which means a lot of men

00:26:22.173 --> 00:26:24.230
are away on naval ventures.

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:27.110
Second is very high
male mortality.

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:29.150
The risks of
drowning in shipwreck

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.830
are apparent to anyone who
reads the long list of victims

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.280
in the eyre rolls,
which recorded

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.170
these problems in detail.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.020
Some losses were so
dramatic that they

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.880
were noted by chroniclers, as
when a sudden gale destroyed

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.100
25 English ships and all
their crew on their way

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.710
to Iceland in 1419.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:48.370
The naval service required of
so many mariners and fishers

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.760
also took its toll, in deaths
at the hands of the enemy

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.870
or pirates in long captivities,
and at-large ransoms that

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:58.730
took months, if not
years, to collect.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:01.460
The small fishing port
of Budleigh in East Devon

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:05.310
complained, in 1347, that
in effect, continual service

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.900
to the Crown had cost its
residents three ships, 12

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.670
boats, and 141 men.

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:14.500
And even today, I
might add, fishing

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:19.480
has the highest mortality rate
of any occupation in the UK.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:24.610
Three, the seasonal work
regime of fishers and mariners

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:26.960
that I've been talking about
affected the seasonality

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.700
of marriages and births.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.110
In the early modern
fishing ports

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:32.540
of Brighton and Lowestoft,
for example, marriages

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:35.820
peaked in the winter after
the fleets returned home

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.330
from two to three months
fishing in the Yarmouth herring

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:39.320
fisheries.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:44.030
So basically, nine months to
10 months later, lots of babies

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:44.760
were born.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.290
And I could show you the graph.

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.920
I mean, it just goes up
like that all of a sudden.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.660
Very few conceptions
or marriages

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:54.110
occurred in the fall months
when the fishers were away.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:57.140
These seasonal patterns could
vary by maritime occupation,

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.290
however, since sailors
on trading voyages

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:04.310
were more likely away in
the spring and summer.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:05.840
And the type of
maritime activity

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.990
pursued by male
householders thus shaped

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:11.750
the timing of the births in
the settlements, and their work

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.570
regime, was affected
by the seasons

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.440
of when they could catch
fish, most of the time-- when

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.800
they could go to sea.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.870
Now, we have no firm
quantitative data

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.880
for this process
in the Middle Ages.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.130
But we do know-- and I have
numbers for tens of thousands

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:29.670
of fishers who were at the
Yarmouth and the Scarborough

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.920
fishing-- they call them
fishing fares, F-A-R-E-S--

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.450
and they were away for two
to three months of time,

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.060
in a very similar
seasonal pattern.

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.580
And they probably
had a similar pattern

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:42.800
of conceptions and births.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.080
Fourth are low sex
ratios, and that

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.550
is more women than men in
maritime communities, which

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:50.730
was a result of the frequency
of these male absences

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.870
and the high male mortality.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:56.030
Maritime scholars have argued
that the surplus of women,

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:58.940
combined with the
authority that women

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:02.280
had to assume when their men
were away for long periods,

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.790
in the essential role
that fisher's wives played

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:07.610
in baiting hooks, and mending
nets, and curing and selling

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:10.000
the catch, endowed
maritime women

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.360
with more agency and
influence than they would have

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.895
had in land-based societies.

00:29:13.895 --> 00:29:16.510
And I'll come back to that.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:18.570
Five is that young
seafarers tended

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:22.060
to marry at a younger age
than landward counterparts.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.030
And six, that seafarers,
especially fishers,

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:27.430
had endogamous marriages.

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:30.810
That is, fishers married the
daughters of other fishers.

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:32.790
Now, this practice may
have been encouraged

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:36.720
by the co-ownership of boats and
the ease with which young men

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.470
could start fishing
and make money

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:41.170
to support a family, especially
when the fisheries were

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.460
booming.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.372
Age at marriage in a
pre-industrial society

00:29:44.372 --> 00:29:45.830
is determined-- to
a large extent--

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:47.663
is about when you can
afford to get married.

00:29:47.663 --> 00:29:50.552
And if you're involved in an
industry where you can quickly

00:29:50.552 --> 00:29:53.010
make a lot of money, you can
afford to get married earlier.

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.430
And especially fishing
families, they simply

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.030
could not survive without wives.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:59.186
They're very much
like farming families.

00:29:59.186 --> 00:30:01.060
A study of the early
modern fishing community

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.760
of Lowestoft in
Suffolk found that 40%

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.630
of seafarers' marriages
were to other fishers.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:10.290
That's an enormous
percent, really,

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.500
suggesting that this pattern
of endogamous marriage

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.980
may have stretched back
across previous centuries.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.270
Now interestingly, fishers
married earlier than mariners,

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:22.840
perhaps because wives were
so essential to the success

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.820
of the family
fishing enterprise.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.650
Different types of
fishing enterprises

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:30.260
seem also to have wielded
different influences.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.570
So this deep-sea
fishing for things

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:35.189
like cod, where you're
going to-- initially you're

00:30:35.189 --> 00:30:36.980
going to Iceland and
Greenland and Ireland,

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.540
and then you go to
Newfoundland-- they

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.530
had less incentive to keep
boats and tackle in the family

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:45.200
because these guys were
heavily paid by wages.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.070
And so it may be that
their marriages were

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:50.070
less endogamous and
maybe less early

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.195
for these types of reasons.

00:30:53.499 --> 00:30:55.165
There's also some
quantitative evidence,

00:30:55.165 --> 00:30:57.350
yay-- we don't have much,
but when you have it,

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.120
you have to make the
most of it-- that

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:02.120
can be employed to reinforce
the hypothesis that medieval

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.710
and later maritime
communities had

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.819
similar demographic regimes.

00:31:05.819 --> 00:31:07.360
It comes from one
of the more-- well,

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.320
it was the most robust
tax return, actually,

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.590
from medieval England, and
it's called the 1377 Poll Tax,

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:16.630
because they taxed every single
person over the age of 14.

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:18.770
And that's quite remarkable
for a medieval tax.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:20.520
And we have their
names, and they're often

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.640
grouped by
households, so we know

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.330
who's living in the household
and who's part of the family.

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:27.599
Now, we don't have
returns for everywhere.

00:31:27.599 --> 00:31:29.890
And unfortunately, for the
places that I'm looking for,

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:33.160
which are these rural
maritime communities,

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.959
there's only a set of three,
which is in Lincolnshire.

00:31:36.959 --> 00:31:38.500
But anyway, and it's
called Skirbeck.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.830
It has three bills.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:42.180
But I was able to compare
it with a very large sample

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.930
of inland villages, and it
provides some suggestive data.

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:48.930
For example, two measures
point to the possibilities

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:52.070
of high male
mortality or absences.

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:55.750
The quite low sex ratio, column
two, for the three Lincolnshire

00:31:55.750 --> 00:32:00.105
villages-- 94.7 compared to 100.

00:32:00.105 --> 00:32:02.760
The 100 would be equal men
and equal numbers of women.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.440
So 94 means you have
substantially more women

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.710
in that community.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:08.320
And the high percentage
of households

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.600
that were headed by
women, column four,

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.760
over 21%, which compares
to only 18% to 14%

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.660
for the inland villages.

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.725
The relatively high
percentage of single people--

00:32:18.725 --> 00:32:20.600
that's column three--
in maritime communities

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.280
could also be interpreted as
a reflection of male absences,

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.230
especially given
the low sex ratios.

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:30.050
The fourth measure, the
high mean household size

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.210
in the Lincolnshire
maritime villages,

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:35.020
could be construed as an
indication of early marriage

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.446
because it would lead
to larger families.

00:32:37.446 --> 00:32:38.820
But it could also
be a reflection

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.710
of the considerable prosperity
of this particular region

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:44.830
of Lincolnshire, since we know
that richer regions, richer

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.570
households, married
earlier and had

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:48.170
more children than poorer ones.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.400
So the jury's still out on that.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.380
Now, medievalists
don't really have

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.900
the firm solid
demographic data enjoyed

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.990
by scholars of later
materials, but I

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:59.890
think that this type of
material I've presented here

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:03.550
offers suggestive
parallels of continuities.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:05.410
The medieval evidence
for male absences

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:07.640
and high male
mortality is anecdotal,

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.952
but frequent and regular,
while the surplus

00:33:09.952 --> 00:33:11.660
of women in medieval
maritime communities

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.360
can be seen in the poll
tax data on low sex ratios,

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.530
the high percentages
of single people,

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:20.870
and the large numbers of
households headed by women.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:23.380
And then if we add to this
this will evidence that I have

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.700
from Hythe and some of
these other places that

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.780
reinforces studies of later
centuries, that have outlined

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.650
how male absences
and high mortality

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:33.570
may have increased
female autonomy

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:37.590
and fostered very specific
types of inheritance strategies

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:41.800
that kept assets, especially
fishing tackle, in the family.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.990
There's less evidence of
early and endogamous marriage

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:46.990
in the medieval
records, although I

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:48.890
think there's some
possibility with surname

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.530
studies of pre-14th
century material

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:54.250
that could prove fruitful.

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:57.710
Certainly, further analysis
of the wills will be helpful.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:01.400
The Kentish fisher, Adrian
Dynes, for instance,

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:06.670
only bequeathed cash legacies
of six shillings eight pence--

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:08.639
a couple months'
wages for a laborer,

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:10.530
not very much-- to
each of his daughters

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.550
if they married a landsman.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.159
But if they married
fishermen, they

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:16.960
were to get a sprat net,
which was likely worth more

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.679
than the cash legacy.

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:20.610
Several other
fishermens' wills also

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:23.420
mention the fishing equipment
that came with their wives

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.580
into marriage, either from a
first marriage to a fisherman

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.280
or from a fisherman father.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.150
So I think that this
type of evidence,

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:33.050
as I'm starting to
accumulate more and more,

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:36.230
really offers these quite
interesting parallels

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:40.130
to the firmer evidence we
have for later periods.

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:44.300
So in conclusion, what I've
tried to do here is quickly

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.469
bring together a wide
amount of scattered evidence

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:50.199
to show how the marine
environment influenced

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:52.710
the role of women,
their work, and family,

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:56.960
in maritime communities in one
location-- in medieval England,

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.760
and particularly, in the
12th to the 15th centuries.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.870
I've argued that prevailing
gender norms prevented

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:05.940
the participation of
women in work at sea

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.610
and limited their work
options, even on shore,

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:12.070
to those traditionally taken
up by women, which were often

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:14.910
linked to household work,
such as ale brewing, vittling,

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:17.140
and working with hemp and flax.

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:20.420
Some women were able to take
on more remunerative work

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:22.570
as vendors, selling
naval supplies

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:27.990
or even trading overseas,
although, the higher

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:30.170
profile that these few
women enjoyed usually

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.060
came by virtue of
their position as wives

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.350
or widows of prominent men.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:38.350
The situation was different
in the smaller maritime

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:41.050
communities, especially
fishing villages, where

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:43.730
the work of female
householders in mending nets,

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:45.830
baiting hooks, and curing
and selling the catch,

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:48.520
was really crucial to the
survival of the household

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:49.750
economy.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:52.390
The maritime work
that women did,

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:55.360
as well as their inheritance
of fishing equipment, also

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.910
show how fishers' wives
and daughters could

00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:59.940
be drawn into the
male maritime world

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.710
that we are familiar with
more than their landwards'

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:06.290
counterparts, who did
not enjoy the same access

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:08.840
to these work-related bequests.

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.880
Unfortunately, what
the sources don't tell

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.931
us is how much maritime work
was really socially valued.

00:36:14.931 --> 00:36:16.430
I mean, you can
make all the guesses

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:18.660
you want about its
economic value,

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.920
but we just don't
have declarations

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.870
or any type of
evidence to say we

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:25.680
know that that economic
value was there.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.299
But how much was
it socially valued?

00:36:27.299 --> 00:36:29.090
And I think one of the
problems with people

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:33.620
who declare how important,
economically, women's work was

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:36.230
in the fishing industry, is
that they never compare it

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:40.000
to the work of farming families,
where women's work, wives'

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.960
work, was just as essential.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.240
There are not a lot
of unmarried farmers,

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.240
just as there's not a
lot of unmarried fishers,

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.660
because that
household economy is

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:52.370
so dependent on wives and other
women within the household.

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:54.410
And that's the next
step is to do more overt

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.990
comparisons there.

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:58.660
There were, however,
several aspects

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:00.700
of the marine
environment that may well

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.950
have augmented female agency.

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:04.830
Despite the strong
sexual division

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:06.850
of labor in medieval
maritime work,

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:09.220
the relegation of
women to specific tasks

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.780
does not seem to
have resulted always

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:15.070
in the feminization of work
that was associated with women.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:17.630
And I think this is particularly
the case with fish curing,

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:20.010
although I can show
you lots of pictures

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:21.340
of women in fish curing.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:22.840
It never loses prestige.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.810
You have men doing fish
curing all the time,

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:27.226
and if you know anything about
the Newfoundland fisheries,

00:37:27.226 --> 00:37:31.840
men completely controlled fish
curing for centuries there.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.010
That part of it
was not low status.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:36.760
Another example is how the
marine environment shaped

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.420
the seasonal demands of
fishing and seafaring,

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.970
and thus, men's frequent
absences and high mortality

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.640
which, in turn, left many
women to manage the household.

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.560
Now, coping on one's
own is a mixed blessing.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.420
But in Paul Thompson's
words, it quote,

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.430
"gave women a practical
basis for power."

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:55.780
This autonomy could
be legally sanctioned

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:59.080
as it was in medieval Barcelona,
where seamen's wives enjoyed

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.370
unusual legal and
inheritance rights

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:03.970
that helped families cope
with the long absences

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:07.230
and early mortality of
fathers and husbands.

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.290
Now, written laws to
this effect are not

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:10.400
found in medieval England.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.610
I've looked.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:14.780
But customary practices, such
as the inheritance strategies

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:18.060
evident among the fishing
families in medieval Kent,

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.460
provide suggestive
evidence about how

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.270
dependence on
marine resources may

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:26.100
have occurred the development
of different types of family

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.730
dynamics.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.410
And finally, let me say
a few words about how

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:34.240
the coastal ecosystem may have
encouraged shoreside family

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.290
members to identify
with the norms

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:40.810
and practices of the maritime
culture of seagoing men.

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:42.690
Residents of
shoreside communities

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.680
were very familiar with
the wrath of the sea,

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:47.550
particularly, the storms and
the destructive flooding that

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:49.540
could wash away
whole settlements,

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:51.970
as a series of early
14th century storms

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:54.850
did to the Yorkshire
settlement of Ravenser

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:57.160
and to the low-lying
pastures of Sussex

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.860
or the Suffolk town of Dunwich.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.550
These places are just
under the sea now.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.580
Flanders has the same problem.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:05.990
To combat these dangers,
maritime communities

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:09.970
formed collaborative enterprises
to maintain seawalls and dikes,

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:14.420
or cooperatives to reclaim
low-lying lands from the sea.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.350
And they also developed
customary laws,

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:18.300
such as the Statutes
of Romney Marsh,

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:21.830
to adjudicate problems and
assess financial responsibility

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:24.780
for the repair of sea
walls, since one breach

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.630
could destroy hundreds and
even thousands of acres

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:29.890
of a family's livelihood.

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:32.970
Now, women did not serve as
jurors in the Romney courts,

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:35.660
but they did appear as
litigants and landowners

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:38.930
with a stake in upholding
this collaborative system.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.470
Similarly, women did not
play the same active role

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:43.460
as men in such
maritime enterprises

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.350
as smuggling and wrecking.

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:47.580
Wrecking is the salvage
of goods washed up

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.070
on shore, which in
maritime communities,

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:52.030
may have actually been
hastened by, let's say,

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:54.330
false beacons and lights
and things like that.

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:57.390
And it was profitable.

00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:59.630
But the women colluded
and facilitated

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.980
the disposal of goods
acquired through these means.

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:06.520
They're often named as receivers
of stolen or wrecked goods.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.020
Although the women
and a fair number

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:11.390
of men in coastal communities
never worked at sea,

00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:13.720
many of them lived
from the sea, in that

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.730
they or their households
labored in ancillary shoreside

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:18.050
occupations.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:20.150
Their reliance on the
sea for a living, or even

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:23.290
coastal residents' proximity
to, [INAUDIBLE] action

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:27.040
with what we call the maritime
cultural landscape-- of beaches

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.570
and dunes, fishing
cabins, beacons,

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:33.440
and boats, a very specific
kind of maritime landscape--

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.720
meant that they
probably absorbed

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.390
many of the same
superstitions and traditions

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:41.570
of their seagoing relatives,
participating, for example,

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:43.630
in the annual
blessing of the nets

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:47.320
or the yearly breakfast that
was hosted by signorial lords,

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.750
such as the Lord of Otterden, at
the end of the fishing season.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:53.380
It's also likely that
the distinctive shoreside

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:56.800
activities undertaken to
support maritime households,

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.890
such as working the salt
pans or mending nets, gutting

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:03.370
and curing fish, collecting the
harvest of inshore seawares,

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:05.740
and shellfish beds, and
retailing the catch,

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:08.970
all helped to deepen the
investment of all family

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:11.310
members in the maritime
enterprise-- and, I think,

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:13.460
extended identification
with the norms

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:16.210
and practices of the
maritime subculture

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:18.490
to those who stayed ashore.

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:21.080
So I think by broadening
the scope of the inquiry

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:24.510
here to assess how the sea
shaped the lives of those who

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:26.610
lived on its shore,
we can now argue,

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:29.250
find a place for women in the
family in medieval maritime

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:29.880
history.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.880
Thank you.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.730
[APPLAUSE]
