1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,990
What's up everybody. This is Jad
radio lab surprise podcast here.

2
00:00:03,991 --> 00:00:07,410
Tomorrow is the big
game. Go Eagles. And uh,

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,470
whether you like football or
not, I happen to be a fan.

4
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:11,430
But whether you like it or not,

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,210
it's one of the biggest
sporting events in the world.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,580
And it's a game that in many ways has
always been wrapped up in what America is

7
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:21,414
and what it isn't.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,680
And so what we thought we'd do just as
a corrective measure is bring back an

9
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:29,910
episode that we put together a couple
of years ago about the origins of that

10
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:32,910
game. It's kind of an
amazing story and look, Geek,

11
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:37,440
we're all going to be sitting
there watching Tom Brady probably,

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,510
but hopefully not win another Superbowl.

13
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,990
And we'll be watching timber buns do the
halftime thing. And throughout it all,

14
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:47,520
no one will be talking about the people
without whom the game would be nothing.

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,080
So this is an honor of them to story that
we got two from journalist and author

16
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:56,130
Sally Jenkins from her book,
the Real All-americans.

17
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,150
I mean, football, football is as old
as sort of the Celtic civilizations.

18
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:04,780
I mean, you can trace a
primal games of, you know,

19
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:08,920
Danish invaders kicking skulls
around the shores of England. I mean,

20
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,530
that's not a football
that's exactly different,

21
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,960
but organized football
is really a creation of,

22
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,690
of the 1860s and
seventies in this country.

23
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:20,610
It's a post civil war
creation comes along, uh,

24
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,600
just really a couple of
years after, you know,

25
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,660
the last great conquering armies
settle the West. Basically she says,

26
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:31,780
you had these kids whose parents had
fought in the civil war and then some of

27
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:35,650
them had gone west to fight the, a
Lakota, the Cheyenne, the Rapahoe,

28
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,210
the Apaches, and now those wars are
winding down, which oddly enough,

29
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:42,700
created kind of an issue
for young men at the time.

30
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,450
If you're a young student, say back
east at a fancy school like Harvard,

31
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:50,600
how are you going to prove
your own toughness? I mean,
your older brother, your,

32
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,830
your father, he, they may be fought.
Gettysburg, add a little big one.

33
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,550
What the hell have you done? The
American frontier experience was over.

34
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,040
There was this feeling among a lot
of intellectuals that, um, that um,

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,200
American men were losing
their masculinity.

36
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:07,300
They were being feminized in a sense.

37
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,020
So according to historian David Adams,

38
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,310
you just heard those kids were
desperate for opportunities to man up.

39
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,600
There was this cult of metal

40
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,500
around this time,

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,840
David and see a bunch of
violent sports take off.

42
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,540
And in particular for our purposes,

43
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,880
you see these kids at Harvard and Yale

44
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,050
getting together and

45
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,190
knocking the snot out of each other in
this game that's kind of like rugby,

46
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:38,590
but just more violent.

47
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,220
The game used to be basically brutality.

48
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,990
The origin of football was such a
profoundly different game, right?

49
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:51,290
A chuck Klosterman and before him
historian Dr. Conrad Crane, you know,

50
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,990
a first down instead of 10
yards was only five yards.

51
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,590
You had three downs to get five yards
and basically all the teams did okay.

52
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,010
Sort of slam each other

53
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,170
and try to move the ball incrementally.

54
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:06,580
It was almost as if every play of the
entire game was the goal line stand.

55
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,310
You know, w the,

56
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,900
the metaphor people always
use when discussing football
of course, is military.

57
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,360
It's the idea of taking
land and giving life. Well,

58
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:16,240
the origin of football
that was even amplified.

59
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,180
There were formations and
strategies and that kind of thing.

60
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:23,800
But it was pure like right out of
Napoleon's military playbook. I mean,

61
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,640
where you concentrate your force. Yeah.

62
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,060
Shoulder my shoulder next to your
shoulder, nick. The his shoulder.

63
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,740
I think it's a lot like
you bunch up all the,

64
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,200
all your man and then pierce
the other guy's army. Yeah.

65
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,670
That was the basic idea. And so you
just end up with piles of guys. Yeah.

66
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:38,670
And inside those piles there's all
kinds of things go on in those scrums.

67
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:40,330
I mean there's kicking in
bite and there's gouging.

68
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,340
I'm languaging and crotch
kicking and wow. Head wrenching.

69
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:47,040
And I remember we were talking
with Harvard boys doing this.

70
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,310
I have to work to imagine that because
I think of Harvard and Yale now and I

71
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:54,360
think of like, I think neck geeks.
Yeah. I don't think of him as big guys.

72
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,010
Well at the time they were the, the,

73
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:59,640
I mean there are all these wonderful
stories about these chops that they would

74
00:03:59,641 --> 00:04:00,570
eat for dinner. I mean,

75
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:05,490
they were drinking milk by the gallon
and the Ivs were the great power of the

76
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:10,260
time physically as well as intellectually.
But then along comes this school,

77
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,110
this tiny little school, uh,

78
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,150
founded in 1879 in the middle of nowhere
that if you're a football fan or just a

79
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:18,390
fan of American history,

80
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,830
kind of changed everything where it
was Carlo Carlisle was in Pennsylvania,

81
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,160
right. Very close to Gettysburg.
Let's go there. Let's, so, so,

82
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:30,600
so tell me about a car. What is the,
when did it formed and what was it there?

83
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:33,570
The Carlisle Indian school
is formed by a former of,

84
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:37,380
well actually he was an active military
officer at the time named Richard Henry

85
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,370
Pratt. The guy shock of white hair,
large nose crowd, had stripped gallantly,

86
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:43,020
quite gallantly in the civil war.

87
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,520
And then he had actually served
out West in Oklahoma territory. Uh,

88
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,130
he had fought, uh,
American Indians himself.

89
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,500
And it was after winning a lot of
those fights, too many of those fights.

90
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,241
Really? No,

91
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:58,700
we're talking a 1870s now that
Pratt had a change of heart and he,

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,340
he suddenly became concerned about the
very people he had just been fighting.

93
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,580
The fact of the matter is that Indians
were in very, very desperate situation.

94
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,300
The bison were almost extinct.

95
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,500
They were being pushed onto reservations
and population at fallen to two.

96
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,780
It's almost all time low.

97
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,260
Uh,

98
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,180
Pratt, um,

99
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,940
and a lot of other policymakers came
to the conclusion that something had to

100
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:28,180
happen fast or Indians would
literally become extinct.

101
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,970
They would in fact become
the vanishing race.

102
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,150
And so Pratt, um, he comes
to Washington with an idea.

103
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,690
His idea was to start a boarding
school specifically for American Indian

104
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:44,720
children. That was kind
of a radical experiment.

105
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:47,810
Children would be taken removed
for several years at a time.

106
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,910
They would be stripped of their, uh,

107
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,050
what was called their savage heritage
and they would be civilized, I.

108
00:05:54,051 --> 00:05:58,900
E they would be white enticed.
It was forcible. A Pratt had a,

109
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,850
a slogan, kill the Indian, save the man.

110
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,630
That's Barbara Landis Carlisle
Indian school biographer.

111
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,690
We went up to Carlisle to talk with
her and her colleague Cara Curtis,

112
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,080
and they told us that prep basically
made that pitch, kill the Indian,

113
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,180
save the man, not just to Congress,

114
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,650
but directly to American Indian families
all over the country. I want your son.

115
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,850
Is that, how does that work?

116
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,320
I want your children because white
people are gonna keep coming and coming.

117
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:25,880
They want to settle in your lands.

118
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:30,140
They want to take your lands and you
need to learn how to deal with these

119
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:34,460
people. So we need to teach your
children how to speak English.

120
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,550
We need to teach them how to communicate
with the white man so that when the

121
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:40,280
white man comes and tries to get
you to sign away the black hills,

122
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,550
you won't fall for it again. And
it was a convincing argument.

123
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,420
Well, do you know back in those days or
you're talking about survival over here?

124
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,200
Would you mind introducing yourself?
Okay. My name is Joe American horse.

125
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,460
I'm 79 years old and I'm a
grandson of chief American heart.

126
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,400
Joe Lives near the Pine Ridge
reservation in South Dakota.

127
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:02,990
He's Lakota and he told us the story
about his grandfather who was a famous

128
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:04,820
Lakota chief in the 1890s.

129
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:08,270
His grandpa led a delegation
of American Indians too,

130
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,560
Washington. Well,

131
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:13,460
he went to Washington d
C and he was down there,

132
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:17,840
but he's a lot of people downer just as
his grandpa had this moment where he was

133
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:20,840
just stunned by how many white
people there were. His face was,

134
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,620
they're like ants and pretty soon
they're going to come to the area.

135
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:29,480
So he had the idea of uh, trying to
send his kids to school so they can,

136
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,440
uh, inner mingle or you
know, intercepted, whatever.

137
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,980
Basically Joe says his grandpa just
had this realization, we can't,

138
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,340
we can't go back. We've got to go forward.

139
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,580
And it seemed to him
Carlisle was the way forward.

140
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,390
So where are we going
now? Is Our photo archive

141
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,360
the kids who are admitted,
here's how it would work.

142
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:55,140
They would come in and they'd immediately
have their picture taken on arrival.

143
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,370
Then they'd be given an extreme makeover,
which would also be photographed.

144
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,450
Really? Wow.

145
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,800
This is Tom tour, Leno. Wow. This
is, this is Tom Turley as he,

146
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,090
as he comes in,

147
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,560
Barbara showed us a picture of a
Navajo kid looking maybe 18 years old,

148
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,430
does 1882 this is when he arrived.
So you, he's got kind of dark skin,

149
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:21,060
high cheek bones in long
hair. Yeah. Earrings.

150
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,620
He's wearing elaborate necklace.

151
00:08:22,621 --> 00:08:25,790
It looks like it might be made of bone
and he's wrapped in a blanket and then,

152
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,930
and then now here he is in a suit with
clean cut hair. And the second picture,

153
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:34,350
his hair is very short. Not
long, no blanket swearing.

154
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:38,640
A three piece suit sitting there with
a cro and a spread collar and a part at

155
00:08:38,641 --> 00:08:42,810
here. Wow. It's like in a
snapshot. You have Tom Indian,

156
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,310
Tom White Man.

157
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,140
Well, and Sophie,

158
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,520
Joe American Horse said his family saw
that transformation firsthand and Sophie

159
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:54,930
was there and Kyle for five
years. And when she came back,

160
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,490
she looks like a wild woman. You know,

161
00:08:56,491 --> 00:09:01,280
she had a real tiny waist and
a vomit and everything and uh,

162
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,150
she can't speak Lakota.

163
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,660
She forgot. [inaudible] it. Just
think about this for a second.

164
00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:11,500
Just think about this. When we spoke
with one guy, a professor, Eric Anderson,

165
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,210
who teaches at Haskell, he's also part
Pottawatomie. Just imagine the parents,

166
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:19,120
he says, wow. The first time
they see their kids, parents

167
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:24,330
seeing their students marched around in
essentially the uniforms of what had not

168
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:32,050
very long before for many of the
tribes been the uniform of the enemy

169
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,420
at the very least.

170
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,110
I think that would be startling

171
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,160
ninny case. According to Sally Jenkins,

172
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:44,710
after the kids were re
cropped and redressed,

173
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,190
Brett would run them through a bunch of
drills and in Carlisle was a a little

174
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:52,120
military academy and the Indian
kids were so unhealthy at first.

175
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:53,890
They had been put on an unfamiliar Diet.

176
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,550
They had been sleeping indoors for the
first time in their lives and a lot of

177
00:09:57,551 --> 00:09:58,450
them were getting sick.

178
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,240
I mean we know that in the 39
year history of the school,

179
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,720
at least 200 kids died of disease
or poor health or even homesickness.

180
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,500
And so Pratt was constantly trying to
get the kids outside and at a certain

181
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:16,550
point he had hired some teachers and
Sally thinks that one of those hires,

182
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,220
probably one of the
first dormitory masters,

183
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,680
this guy who had formerly
taught at an Ivy League school,

184
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:24,240
he showed the Carlisle Indian kids. Yeah,

185
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,390
this game that the kids
at Harvard were playing.

186
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Maybe he thought it would toughen
him up. Who knows? But suddenly

187
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,980
they were playing football. Now
keep in mind, this is, you know,

188
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:37,400
at a point back in 1882 where
football is barely a thing,

189
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,380
not so many schools had teams.

190
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,450
There wasn't such a thing
as a head coach back then.

191
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,320
They were volunteer coaches who tended
to be students or ex students with the

192
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,590
Carlisle kids self organize
level. The field start to play.

193
00:10:48,591 --> 00:10:52,790
They even start to scrimmage some kids
across town and at one of those games,

194
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,110
according to Barbara, Stacy Matlack,
who is a Pawnee student at Carlyle,

195
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,350
later became a plenty
chief. He broke his leg

196
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:06,100
playing football and precedent. That's
it. No more football because in his mind

197
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,020
he was trying to civilize these kids
and football was doing the opposite.

198
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,230
Uh,

199
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,960
but a short time later, since David Adams,

200
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,800
approximately three dozen Carlisle boys
came in to Pretz office and they said,

201
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:19,030
we want to play football.

202
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,870
Do we know what they said? Exactly.

203
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:26,260
We don't have, we don't have the exact
words, but Pratt says at one point,

204
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,251
he says,

205
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:30,580
while they stood around my desk and I'm
quoting him while they stood around my

206
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:35,350
desk, they're black eyes intensely
watching me. Um, he says,

207
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:40,351
the orator gave practically all the
arguments in favor of are contending and

208
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:41,980
outside football.

209
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,880
And ended up requesting
the removal of the embargo.

210
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,441
His memoir,

211
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:52,441
Pratt was sort of bowled over by the
eloquence and passion of the appeal.

212
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,550
So we said, okay, you can play if you
do these two things. One, he says,

213
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,210
never slung people who are looking on,
we'll say there, that's the Indian of it.

214
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:04,600
Just see them. They are savages and
you can't get it out of there. Okay.

215
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,500
And the other one was you have to
beat the best teams in America.

216
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,400
And at that early point in
American football, far and away,

217
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:17,020
the most powerful team was Yale,
which brings us to October 24th, 1896.

218
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,773
It's

219
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,410
a raw fall day in New York. I
played in New York. Yes. At, uh,

220
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,640
the old polo grounds barely.
There was a [inaudible]

221
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,860
4,000 people in the stands,
including a handful of newspaper men,

222
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:35,090
New York newspaper men, newly Jimmy was
a big story. How did they publicize it?

223
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:37,790
What did they say? Well, the
newspapers became incredibly intrigued

224
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,170
on one side were the undergraduate
showed an old and great university

225
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,113
[inaudible]

226
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,120
hey,

227
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,280
represent basically the perfection of
modern athletics or intellectually the

228
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:52,150
culture and refinement of the best
modern American life. On the other side,

229
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,870
let's me aborigine the real showing of
the forest and playing the red skin of

230
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:04,810
history. Story of war developed over me,

231
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:07,260
or as the case may be by education.

232
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,790
And if you read the newspaper stories,

233
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:13,290
they're written as they're written in
this kind of blood curdling shot through

234
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:17,670
with Indian cliches. You know, the red
skins here come the red skins, right?

235
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,730
Right. According to David Adams. In one
paper it was a reference to yodeling.

236
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:24,540
The writer said that then the fans
were yodeling in that Indian fashion.

237
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,750
I mean try to put yourself
in the shoes of a New Yorker.

238
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:32,640
In the early 1880s your contact with an
American Indian was in a wild west show.

239
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,140
It was theater and here comes a
football game and all of that.

240
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:40,830
These American Indian kids run onto the
field and there's literally an instance

241
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,520
in one of the [inaudible]

242
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,680
first games with someone
in the audience says, well,

243
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:47,780
they look just like our boys because
of course that's what Brad wanted.

244
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,180
Now one thing that was
immediately [inaudible]

245
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,460
clear to everyone in attendance when they
saw the Carlisle players was that they

246
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:55,470
were physically outmatched.

247
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,380
Yeah. Around average
weight is 164 fingers,

248
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,840
Shaklee 20 pounds by two to one man

249
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,400
and going in is that there'll
be an absolute smear job
or at the very least the

250
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:06,380
odds are heavily against him. But

251
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,010
three minutes into the game,
in the midst of a big pile up

252
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:15,823
[inaudible]

253
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,990
a Yalie fumbles the ball.
It comes squirting out.

254
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,600
Carlisle guy picks it up. Yep.

255
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,800
And runs the entire length
of the field. 63 yards

256
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,183
scores a touchdown.

257
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,600
Now nobody had scored on Yale in
seven games. They were furious.

258
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:40,610
So what they do is they use their bulk

259
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:46,150
to slowly push the pile down
the field twice to take leave.

260
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,770
Yeah. And

261
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,813
with three minutes left,

262
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,450
yeah. Let's up. 12 to six Carlisle has
the ball, Carlisle running back charges.

263
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,373
The pile in

264
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,360
[inaudible] gets clobbered,

265
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,470
falls backwards. And just as he's about
to hit the earth, he laterals the ball

266
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,210
to a teammate who grabs
it, runs around the scrum.

267
00:15:09,211 --> 00:15:10,470
The entire length of the field score

268
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,070
[inaudible]

269
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,950
Carlisle scores a touchdown
that would have tied the game,

270
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,623
what

271
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,300
it's called back by a
referee who was a Yale man.

272
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,390
Why the call was that the referee claim
that a whistle had blown the play dead.

273
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,100
And what was the crowd's reaction?
Well, they were, they were furious. Yes.

274
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,240
Bullying and, and hooting.

275
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,030
Everyone knew it was a terrible
miscarriage of justice.

276
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,120
And some of the Carlisle players
said, oh, we're gonna Walk Outta here.

277
00:15:46,121 --> 00:15:50,130
We are leaving this game. But
according to David at the last moment,

278
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,230
Pratt runs down from the stands, comes
onto the fields, is wait a second,

279
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:55,390
wait a second. Wait, don't
forget. Rule number one,

280
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,370
be a gentleman.

281
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:02,350
Pratt did not want this game to
end because of their tempers,

282
00:16:02,351 --> 00:16:05,320
even though they'd been
wronged by a by that call.

283
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,030
So the Carlisle boys finished the
game and when they walk off the field

284
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:20,530
[inaudible],

285
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,300
they get a standing ovation. Carlyle wins,

286
00:16:22,301 --> 00:16:26,590
incredible respect and renown in
the aftermath of the game. In fact,

287
00:16:26,591 --> 00:16:29,830
one of the newspaper men after another
Carlisle Yale game or something

288
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,910
similar happened,

289
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,930
wrote something to the effect of
Carlisle could beat 11 year men,

290
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:37,540
but they couldn't beat 11
Yale men and a Yale referee.

291
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,723
Yes.

292
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:45,130
After the Yale game of
1896 pret is committed.

293
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,130
Pratt believes that it's the greatest
thing that can happen to his school.

294
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,320
It is an instant way to do what he's
been struggling to do for 15 years at the

295
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:56,981
Carlisle school,

296
00:16:56,981 --> 00:17:01,090
which is to prove the value of these
American Indian kids against their white

297
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:05,350
peers, to prove the value or to civilize
them well, both to civilize them,

298
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:09,910
but also to prove that given
education and equal opportunity,

299
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,073
they were the [inaudible].

300
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,970
Cool. Have there. Hmm. That's
interesting. Their white peers,

301
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,900
I mean he was for all of his forcible
assimilation methods, which were,

302
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,800
you know, to remain extremely
cruel and destructive.

303
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,780
He truly believed in the
concept of, of racial equality.

304
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,250
The complicatedness of Pratt and of the
whole Carlisle idea kept smacking us in

305
00:17:33,401 --> 00:17:35,890
the face as we were putting this show
together. I mean, on the one hand,

306
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,360
they were clearly students who felt that
Carlisle was prison and in fact Barbara

307
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,780
Landis,

308
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,710
when she took us on a tour of the grounds
of the former Carlisle Indian school,

309
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:48,440
she said that kids would even set
fire to the buildings. It's a, yeah,

310
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:52,590
some did down, which is kind
of typical on Indian campuses,

311
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,230
a lot of fires and
burning buildings. Why I,

312
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,920
it's a form of resistance.
On the other hand,

313
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,340
no, you please.

314
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,450
When we started looking
around for original archival
recordings of some of the

315
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:09,870
earliest Carlisle players, pretty
much the only recording we could find

316
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:14,150
has this tape. We would like for it to
be too much of your making is possible

317
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,010
was this oral history with
a guy named [inaudible].

318
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,190
Your name, your full name
is Andrew, actually nine

319
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,330
Albert x and Diane.

320
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,200
The interview was done in the early
seventies when he was 88 he entered the

321
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:25,920
school

322
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,920
just before 1899 you were 50 years old.

323
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,020
That's fair.

324
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,800
Can't really play you too much of this
cause the audio quality is really bad.

325
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,370
But in the interview, [inaudible],

326
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,450
r, h Prac, Pra, d, g

327
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,190
and x and Diane talks about them with a
great deal of affection and gratitude.

328
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:47,140
We call him the diff father
of [inaudible] education.

329
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,450
We call him the father of
Indian education. Yeah.

330
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,800
Oh, he lies. I had one wonderful man.

331
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,620
So he's a tough figure. Pratt, and
he's got a very mixed legacy. I mean,

332
00:18:56,621 --> 00:18:58,420
I like to say Pratt was his country.

333
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,420
Whenever you think of him, he was
his country. So. Okay, so 1896,

334
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:09,290
he gets the bug like he sees
peak football's good PR. Yes.

335
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,120
What happens next? Well, he, he hires,
uh, he begins looking around for coaches,

336
00:19:14,121 --> 00:19:18,920
full time coaches to come in and coach
the team. Uh, and he winds up, um,

337
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,670
with a, a Cornell Grad,
uh, named Pop Warner

338
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,053
Glen Pop Warner.

339
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:31,430
Pop Warner is an interesting guy is
this pops right here just to give you

340
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,000
visual. Yep. Woo. Look at his farm.

341
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,000
And Carrie showed us pictures. It
looks kind of like a Mike Ditka.

342
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:43,860
If Mike Ditka had Einstein's hair up,
pops a little bit of a, of an outlier. Uh,

343
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:49,110
he's, he's got these Texas roots. He's
a bit of a rogue can be kind of vulgar.

344
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,780
I like to party a little bit.

345
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,790
He liked to gamble really well and that
is exactly what he does in spectacular

346
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:00,200
fashion. When he gets to Carlyle
because pop Warner looks at,

347
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,110
at his squad and he realizes that,
sure, they're fast, they got heart,

348
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,000
but they're underweight and
they're small waist wall. You know,

349
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,860
while they might occasionally forced
a tie with it with a Yale if they,

350
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,980
you know, have killed
themselves physically,

351
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,340
they weren't going to beat the Ivy
Leagues on any kind of consistent basis

352
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,740
without, without doing
something different.

353
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:24,510
And there was a very fine line
between innovation and cheating

354
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,360
and pop Warner starts IX exploiting
that line. Absolutely. Uh,

355
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,400
as hard as he can. And
he comes up with, uh,

356
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,560
the trick play for example, 1903 pop
Warner devices, the hidden ball trick.

357
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,633
But what is that?

358
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:47,020
The hidden ball trick is
I'm the quarterback takes
the ball and actually behind

359
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,000
this

360
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
huge pile of men tucks it under another
guy sweater while the big pile of men is

361
00:20:53,891 --> 00:20:55,870
struggling in the mud in
the center of the field,

362
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,670
not knowing quite where the football is,

363
00:20:57,671 --> 00:20:59,710
but believing it's somewhere
in the middle of the pile.

364
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,860
Here's this kid who squirts around the
end with the football hidden under his

365
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:06,250
Jersey and he's 30 yards downfield
before anybody realizes it.

366
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,150
And how does he keep the ball
from falling out of his jersey?

367
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:14,080
I think they actually sewed the Jersey
so that the ball would stay in there

368
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:18,340
without falling out. So they made a
cheating pocket, made a cheating pocket.

369
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,580
Was that legal? But they got
it. Did they get a religion?

370
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,080
Was it legal?

371
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:27,081
You ask pop Warner would have said there
was nothing in the rule book against

372
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:27,954
it.

373
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,020
Another thing he does,

374
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:34,021
which actually works brilliantly is he
sows footballs onto the front of their

375
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,220
jerseys, which are really
bulky sweaters at the time.

376
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:44,221
He sows leather football shaped patches
onto the front of their jerseys in order

377
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:47,800
to try to disguise who's
got the ball. Really,

378
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:50,530
I guess Harvard and the
Harvard coach goes insane.

379
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,730
[inaudible] sent me pregnant.
This is the kind of thing,

380
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,700
but Harvard did not take this line down.

381
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,950
Harvard retaliates by painting the
football's the same color as their jersey.

382
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:08,340
It's Maroon everywhere. So when they
held the ball against their chest,

383
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,190
the ball basically, well you can't see it.

384
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,470
I mean they all broke the rules.

385
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,460
American football is essentially a
rule breaking experience as opposed to

386
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:20,130
British football, which
didn't have referees.

387
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,280
At least initially a British
football ran on the honor system,

388
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,490
but with American football, the rest were
there practically from the beginning.

389
00:22:26,491 --> 00:22:30,210
And she says it was largely a
response to the brutality of the game,

390
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:34,170
but also to the kind of rule bending
that you saw from pop Warner and the

391
00:22:34,171 --> 00:22:37,410
Carlisle Indians. Every time pop
Warner came up with an innovation,

392
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,240
the next year there was a rule against it.

393
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,510
So immediately the Ivy League would get
together and pass a rule and say, okay,

394
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:43,344
no more of that.

395
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,830
And that's how the rule book really
burdens in an American football.

396
00:22:46,831 --> 00:22:51,630
And it's thanks to pop Warners slights
of hand and pop Warner's greatest slight

397
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:55,980
of hand and maybe the Carlisle
Indians most soaring moment.

398
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:01,070
And I mean that literally happened at a
moment when the game almost disappeared.

399
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,373
That's coming up.

400
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,373
[inaudible]

401
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,280
start of message. Yes, this is
David. Adam, this is Conrad Crane.

402
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:19,820
Can I get an email message
asking me to read credit texts?

403
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:24,500
Radiolab is supported in part by
the Alfred p Sloan Foundation,

405
00:23:27,951 --> 00:23:32,780
More information
aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org. Okay.

406
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:37,130
There it is. If you can use that,
they care. And this message,

407
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,300
Hey, uh, Simon Adler here. Uh,

408
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:45,680
I'm one of the producers here at Radiolab
and I wanted to take a quick to tell

409
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:46,430
you about something

410
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,880
that, uh, that I think is pretty
interesting that, that we make here, uh,

411
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,300
besides the show. So we have a newsletter,

412
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,330
which I know everyone
does, but hear me out.

413
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,380
Unlike a lot of other
newsletters out there, uh,

414
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:04,130
we don't waste your time by just blabbing
about what our next release will be or

415
00:24:04,131 --> 00:24:08,640
begging you for money. Uh, actually
we, we do a a little bit of that. Uh,

416
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:13,220
but what we also do is each
time a new episode drops,

417
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,340
we send you a list of staff picks,

418
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,420
essentially a collection of things to
folks here who make this show have come

419
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:23,150
across recently and are excited about, uh,

420
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:28,190
they range from books and music to TV
shows, youtube clips, art exhibits, blogs.

421
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,030
It's sort of a repository for this
stuff that's got us interested.

422
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:36,650
But for whatever reason, uh, we're not
sure how to turn into a radio story.

423
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,740
So if that sounds
interesting to you at all,

424
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:42,200
I hope you'll sign up for our newsletter.

425
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:46,130
It's free and you can sign up in
about just 30 seconds at radio

426
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:54,190

just text r l news as in Radiolab news to

427
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,640
seven zero one zero one that's RL news
to seven zero one zero one and thanks.

428
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:09,390
Hey, I'm Jen Abu Moron. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab.

429
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:14,391
And getting back to our
story on the Carlisle Indian
school and the birth of the

430
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,880
monitor game of football, one of the
most important moments in this story,

431
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:22,740
a happens at a time when football was
right on the edge of disappearing.

432
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:30,350
Talking about 1905 this was the most
violent year in football to this point,

433
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,020
19 people died on the football team.

434
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:38,630
One nine one death is alon
19 that's crazy. Yeah.

435
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,760
Cause what would happen is that Carla
would try and do these things to sort of

436
00:25:41,761 --> 00:25:42,594
open up the game.

437
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,410
The ivies would consistently respond by
making the game more about brute force,

438
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,520
more about violence.

439
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,870
So you had all these desks and suddenly
all the major programs were spooked.

440
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,720
You know, Columbia polls, their
PR or their football team.

441
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,980
Harvard even thinks
about doing it. And so,

442
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,170
and this is kind of odd
into the fray steps,

443
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:02,420
the president of the United States
of America, Teddy Roosevelt,

444
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,110
in order to get him, because he was
a fan, according to Conrad Crane,

445
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,570
he liked football. He liked
the, the manly aspects of it,

446
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:11,530
the tough aspects of it. But
nobody liked people dying.

447
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,760
And then there was his kid,
his, his son was playing and,

448
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,150
and getting beat up pretty
badly as well. Broke his nose,

449
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,970
slid his eyebrow and one
game he got knocked out cold.

450
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,650
So after the violence of
oh five the president calls
the presidents of all these

451
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:30,070
colleges and so on and to Washington
and according to David Adams,

452
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:32,980
he basically tells them that
the rules had to be rewritten.

453
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,970
It had to become a little bit more
safe at least, or it would be banned

454
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,390
out of that. We see a couple
of rule changes. First,

455
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,340
the schools decide in order
to loosen up the, so to speak,

456
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,840
they're going to tinker
with the down yardage ratio.

457
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,570
Instead of going from three
downs to gain five yards,

458
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,690
it becomes three downs to gain
10 yards. The three downs,

459
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,540
you get tenure to four downs to get 10
years before we'd come a couple of years

460
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,430
later. Oh. But the second rule change,

461
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,880
which is maybe the most important for
our story is for the first time they

462
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:08,540
legalize the ability to move the
ball through the free floating air.

463
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,730
It surrounds us all. Okay, so where do
we go watch the next day? So if I could,

464
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:16,080
if I could place you in a moment,

465
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,080
unless there's a moment before
this you'd like to hit. Uh,

466
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,850
I believe November 23rd,
1907, yes. Big Moment.

467
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,640
Okay. Can you set the
scene? Well, the scene

468
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,710
from the standpoint of broader American
history, things have gone airborne.

469
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,950
You mean Wilbur and Orville, right.
I'm talking about not just them,

470
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:39,540
but I'm talking about hot air balloons.

471
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:42,730
[inaudible]

472
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,910
there are aeronautical experiments
happening really all over the world.

473
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:48,850
In France, everyone is
experimenting with flying machines.

474
00:27:48,851 --> 00:27:50,200
Things are going up in the air,

475
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,790
but not so fast with football because
when the rural committee had made that

476
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:55,780
rule about Ford passing,

477
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,320
they had also hedged a little bit saying
if you throw a forward pass and you

478
00:27:59,321 --> 00:28:02,500
receiver doesn't catch it,
you are penalized 15 yards,

479
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:06,280
which back in the day was a monster
amount, so nobody threw the ball.

480
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:10,240
It was too risky. But story goes.
As soon as that rule got passed,

481
00:28:10,241 --> 00:28:11,950
pop Warner goes back to his garage.

482
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,790
It's always a garage of quest with a
ball and he starts to experiment in any

483
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,451
certain thing like, okay,

484
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:19,690
what would be the most efficient
way to toss this thing?

485
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:22,930
People have to understand
that the footballs in those
days are not the footballs

486
00:28:22,931 --> 00:28:24,960
we have today with the Nice, you know,

487
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:28,180
whatever that old blades spheroid or
whatever they call it with the Nice points

488
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:31,840
and things. These are rugby balls,
sort of imagine a deflated basketball.

489
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,630
They're thicker in the middle,
they're not as well shaped.

490
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,870
They're really tough to get
your hand on to throw. Right.

491
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:43,050
And in 1906 there's a tiny bit of tape
in Albert x and Diane's oral history

492
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:48,040
where he talks about this in 1906 he
says, pop called all the players together.

493
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,993
He tells them

494
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,230
high rollers, if you were to have to learn

495
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:55,770
[inaudible]

496
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,170
he says, I think you're going to
have to learn to spiral. The ball

497
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,480
does far as the ball

498
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,950
because if you throw the ball in a spiral,

499
00:29:00,951 --> 00:29:04,610
it gets 10 times less air drag
than if you throw it end over end.

500
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,280
Plus it's easier to catch. Yeah. They
start experimenting with it a little bit.

501
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,510
And in 1906 but they come out
in 1907 as a throwing offense,

502
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,020
which gets us to that game.

503
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,230
November 23rd, 1907 Carlisle
place, the University of Chicago,

504
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:20,160
last game of the season,

505
00:29:20,161 --> 00:29:23,970
we're in Chicago and the Chicago team
is arguably the best in the nation,

506
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,960
the best.

507
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:27,600
I don't think it's even arguable what
Carlisle is good at this point though.

508
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,060
Yeah. But Chicago is like stag field

509
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:35,940
and there are 27,000
people in the stance. Well,

510
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,100
what happened was, uh,

511
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,310
the Chicago players had decided to
try to defeat Carlisle's innovative,

512
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,990
folded passing by just knocking the crap
out of their receivers every time they

513
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:50,200
came off the line of scrimmage. And
so Carlisle's greatest receiver,

514
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,153
Albert x and Diane,

515
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:54,820
our guy had been stymied the entire
game because the minute the ball was

516
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:55,190
snapped,

517
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:59,890
Chicago players would hit him and try
to throw him down or knock him out of

518
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:00,724
bounds.

519
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,790
So pop Warner said to x and
Diane, here's what we're gonna do.

520
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,710
Next time they hit you out of bounds,

521
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,820
sneak around the bench and get
back on the field by some accounts.

522
00:30:10,821 --> 00:30:13,160
This was x and Diane's idea.
But whoever thought of it on the

523
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,280
Albert x died as expected.
Ends up out of bounds.

524
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,160
[inaudible] but he keeps running.

525
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,070
He runs around the back of the
bench, runs around the spectators,

526
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,640
maybe around the band and comes back
on the field right at that moment,

527
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,900
Hauser the quarterback of Carlyle

528
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,620
lets loose a vicious spiral. Can I
have you read recently? Sure. Hold on.

529
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,340
This is cell, his description
of that moment from her book,

530
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,450
the real all American.

531
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,280
Yes. For a moment. It was a
frozen scene and a stage drama.

532
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,810
The ball hung in the air.

533
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:54,190
A tantalizing possibility
could x and Diane reach it.

534
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,340
Would he catch it or drop it?
Defender's wheeled and stared down.

535
00:30:58,341 --> 00:31:02,470
Field spectators watching from the
stands found that the breath had died in

536
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:03,700
their collective throats.

537
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,650
The spiraling ball seemed to defy
physics. What made it stay up?

538
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,650
When would it come down?
In that long moment,

539
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:17,770
27,000 spectators mashed together on
benches and crammed on platforms may have

540
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:22,280
felt their loyalty to the home team
evaporate in the grip of a powerful new

541
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:23,114
emotion.

542
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,860
They may have noticed something they
never had before that a ball traveling

543
00:31:27,861 --> 00:31:30,860
through space traces a
profoundly elegant path.

544
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,660
They may have realized something
else that it was beautiful.

545
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,020
The ball struck it's human target x
and don caught the pass all alone and

546
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:48,730
trotted over the Chicago gold line.

547
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,310
The stadium exploded in sound and motion.

548
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,680
It was the game breaker. The
rest was just anticlimax.

549
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,930
The final score was 18 to four for Carla,

550
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,510
but the very next year the Ivy League
passes a rule that you can't leave the

551
00:32:18,511 --> 00:32:21,300
field and then come back
onto [inaudible]. Okay. Yes.

552
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,350
That's where that rule comes from.

553
00:32:22,351 --> 00:32:25,320
I get to say that that description
of the ball [inaudible] in

554
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,510
the air is,

555
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,480
is timeless in a way.

556
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:34,480
That's exactly why football is still
beautiful at times. That's, that's,

557
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,170
that's when Carlisle in 1907 is when
American football becomes the sport that

558
00:32:39,171 --> 00:32:40,010
you watch today.

559
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:46,360
That's exactly our style. Oh Wow.
This is this the field field.

560
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,520
This is the fee. Can we get out?

561
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,503
Yeah.

562
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,483
[inaudible]

563
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,380
after we'd spent an entire day
looking at pictures of, you know,

564
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:05,280
Albert x and dine and Pratt
and pop Warner and Dulles,

565
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,860
Lone Wolf and Tom Leno and
all these Carlisle players.

566
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:13,510
Barbara and Cara took us to the field
where they practiced and so this is the

567
00:33:13,511 --> 00:33:18,511
Carlisle Indian school
football field covered in snow,

568
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,390
like 10 degrees out here. Really,

569
00:33:22,391 --> 00:33:25,960
really bright sun going off
this now and it's just empty.

570
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,310
And we just kind of walked around
and tried to imagine all this stuff.

571
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,080
We'd just seen in photos. He was a
little bit like walking among ghosts.

572
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,780
Yeah. That's the sound of the
flag blowing in the background.

573
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:00,400
I remember standing on that field and
I'm having this thought that I couldn't

574
00:34:00,401 --> 00:34:01,234
quite articulate.

575
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,690
Okay.

576
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,370
But later, Eric Anderson,

577
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:07,430
that professor from Haskell is a
member of the Pottawatomie nation.

578
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,310
He sort of put his finger on it
and he essentially said that like,

579
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,200
there's a lot of room on a football field.

580
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,800
I mean there's room for
anger and war in violence,

581
00:34:19,801 --> 00:34:23,970
but there's also room for pride
and a kind of coming together.

582
00:34:23,971 --> 00:34:27,120
That's not a Pratt coming together
where one side gets erased,

583
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,560
but it is a coming together. Yeah.
I mean there is a middle ground.

584
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,750
Clearly it's more than a game.

or will we be accepted through this as
