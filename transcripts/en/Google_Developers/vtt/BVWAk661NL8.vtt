00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.100
Hello everyone.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.040
It's good to be here.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:03.540
[BEEP]

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.620
Sorry, I guess I forgot
to turn off my phone.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.340
But the good thing
is in [INAUDIBLE] we

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.055
have this nice
feature by which I

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:13.530
can put stuff in do not disturb.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.512
So I think I'm
good, or so I think.

00:00:18.512 --> 00:00:21.760
There you are.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.400
It's good to be here.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.250
Thanks.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.320
For me, when I first heard about
this forum, I was very excited.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.890
It's really nice
that we have a way

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.430
to connect with the web
developer community.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.000
The web itself is something
near and dear to my heart.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.140
I wouldn't have joined Google--
I was outside Google when

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.610
I saw Gmail getting
launched at that time.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.530
And the fact you could write
an application like Gmail

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.210
in the web was an important
realization for me

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.180
for how important a role
our developer platform

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.940
was going to play in computing.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.880
And we've come a long way.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.460
But it's really exciting for
me to see all of you here,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.520
and a way for us to connect
with the developer community.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.450
The web is at an important
inflection point,

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.040
and I think
something in which it

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.900
will play even
stronger all over time.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.110
When I look at mobile, it's
a very, very profound shift.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.740
A few months ago I'd gone back
to India to launch Android One,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.930
and seeing people come and
get their first ever computing

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.500
experience on a smartphone
is really amazing.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.550
The PC throughout its life
cycle probably reached about 1.6

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.960
to 1.7 billion users.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.500
Mobile is already beyond
that, just smartphones.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.040
And in our lifetime
for sure it's

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.160
going to be the first computing
platform which will nearly

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.590
reach the entire world.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.000
So we expect over 5 billion
people in the next few years

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.800
to have a smartphone connected.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.870
And so to me, we haven't
lived through a phase

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.350
in which computing
reaches that many people.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.520
So it's a really profound
shift, and so I'm

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.449
excited to see the
next wave and the role

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.050
that the web will
play in that paradigm.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.410
We are seeing great traction.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.660
We're deeply committed
to this area.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.830
We're investing a lot.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.520
You probably heard
from the team Chrome

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.790
on mobile has had over
400 million users.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.450
And so for me, we feel a
huge sense of responsibility

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.780
in terms of making sure the
web evolves well on mobile.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.840
And the web has such
unique properties,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.740
and things which
make it particularly

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.850
good at what it does.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.680
And I don't think we have seen
anything quite like it again.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.615
So when I look at
how as a developer

00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:47.700
you can write something,
it could be the long tail.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.539
You could reach your users.

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:51.580
People can search for it.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.660
People can find a link
in a social network,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.970
get to your website.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.390
And the model is simple.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.700
It's universal,
and it just works.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.480
There's no installs, downloads,
nothing to deal with.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.180
And that model I think is
something really important

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.290
in computing, and it's
important to preserve that.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.870
And to me, so I'm excited to see
what all we can do with mobile.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.730
As a platform, the
work I've seen around--

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.750
be it focused on
performance around getting

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.750
60 frames per second,
be it to work offline

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.710
with service workers,
the Polymer stuff

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.300
so that you can build great
design with material design,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.170
et cetera, really excites me.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.290
And so hopefully we can
continue pushing all of that.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.590
And especially when I use
the [INAUDIBLE], for me

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.210
I can see how interestingly
apps and the web and the browser

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.490
can all come together.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.370
And we are in early
stages of this,

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.000
and the lines are blurring.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.150
And so if you fast forward a
few years, I think hopefully

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.500
we surprise users and
all of us with the way

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.090
these things evolve.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.420
And I think it's important
to keep an open mind.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.820
And so don't have
much to say other

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.620
than this is an incredible time.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.000
For me, the web
wouldn't be where

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.660
it is without
developers like you.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.580
That's the crux of it in
the end, people building

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.709
great applications which really
advance the state of computing,

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.100
what users can do
with their devices.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.520
And given what I talked about
earlier is an opportunity

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.259
to reach 5 billion
users, I think

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.300
that's one of the biggest
opportunities all of us

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.490
will see in our
lifetime in computing.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.930
So hopefully you all
take advantage of that.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.130
And with that, I want to say
thank you all for coming.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.120
And you guys have a day
two tomorrow, so good luck.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.460
And I'll see you guys soon.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.210
[APPLAUSE]
