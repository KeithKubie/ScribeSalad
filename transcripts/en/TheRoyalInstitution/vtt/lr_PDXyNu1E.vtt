00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.424
 

00:00:09.424 --> 00:00:13.500
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.900
 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.670
Mars is our next door neighbour.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.860
And so the one massive,
resounding question

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.880
that obsesses me is,
does Mars have life?

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.395
 

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:35.020
For a long time
there's been this idea,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.452
has there been liquid water?

00:00:36.452 --> 00:00:37.910
If it's got liquid
water of course,

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.410
it's long been
understood that's one

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.350
of the prerequisites of life.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.300
When we're exploring Mars,
we don't do it in person.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.690
We don't send human
astronauts, at least not yet.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.260
And we send our machines.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.160
We send robotic explorers and
beam back all that information

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.510
back to us, so we can
piece it together and learn

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.930
as much as we can
about this other world.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.076
So if you want to design
an instrument for Mars,

00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:00.665
for operation on Mars,
there's some key things

00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:02.000
which you have to bear in mind.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It needs to be low mass.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.530
It needs to be
lightweight and compact.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.280
Even just to launch mass
into low Earth orbit,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.035
I believe it costs something
like 20,000 pounds per kilo.

00:01:11.035 --> 00:01:12.520
If you want to
get the equivalent

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.275
mass to the surface of
Mars, it costs an awful lot

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.520
more than that.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.110
It needs to be able to survive
the vibration of launch.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.230
It needs to be able to survive
high radiation environments.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.084
And an average
surface temperature

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.500
is something like
minus 60 degrees

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.455
centigrade, so you got to
operate Curiosity and all

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:30.660
these instruments under
these extreme conditions.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.670
 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.690
Obviously, it's nice to
see it as a challenge.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.090
And it's amazing
what can be achieved.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.340
You put it in the pointy
end of a massive firework,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.330
launch into space where it
travels through the very

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.590
brutal and an
unforgiving environment,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.160
and then arrives at an
incredibly high speed.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.380
So you've got to go from 6
kilometres per second to 0

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.750
in 7 minutes, that's
the challenge, landing

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.980
this 1,000 kilogramme rover.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.384
And not end up burying
your years of working

00:02:01.384 --> 00:02:03.300
and your millions of
pounds worth of equipment

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.700
and hardware in
a smoking crater.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.630
It was a bit of a
step into the unknown.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.400
 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.570
Touch down confirmed.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.990
We're safe on Mars.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.872
 

00:02:22.872 --> 00:02:24.330
That's when the
exploration starts.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.800
 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.280
A sol is Mars for a day.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.450
It's about 24 hours
and 37 minutes.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.030
We have to get our instruments
up to a working temperature,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.479
so we only work after 11:00
AM local time on Mars.

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:43.520
But if you want to get
the most out of your rover

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.700
and your science and engineering
team in the first 90 days

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.980
when don't know if
things are going to last,

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.260
then it's best to switch to
Mars time into the rhythm

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.010
that Curiosity
has to go through.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.390
 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.670
What that means in practise is
that every couple of weeks you

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.504
end up working at 2
o'clock in the morning.

00:03:05.504 --> 00:03:06.170
But that was OK.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.690
No one was complaining
because we had our fantastic

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.830
rover on Mars that
we were operating.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.500
Some people got watches
made to run on Mars time.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.450
So if you ever see anyone around
Pasadena with two watches on,

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.265
then you know they're working
on a recent Mars mission.

00:03:21.265 --> 00:03:24.520
 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.940
Since the 17th century and the
first telescopic observations

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.660
of Mars, we've got to
learn our neighbour,

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.950
this other world
much, much better.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:44.404
 

00:03:44.404 --> 00:03:46.270
We have high resolution
colour images.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.590
We have stereo images so we
can get accurate distances

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.390
and elevations.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.910
 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.940
And we have chemical and
x-ray diffraction data.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.430
So we take all those
different data sources,

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.124
work out what's been happening
on Mars from billions of years

00:04:04.124 --> 00:04:05.290
ago right up to the present.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.810
 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.350
And then, we discuss
on the telephone

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.740
what we think of the data
and what we need to do next.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.010
So we might decide well, that's
a really interesting outcrop.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.925
Maybe there's some
sign of water there.

00:04:19.925 --> 00:04:21.300
But we need to
get another image.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.924
We need to get a high
resolution image.

00:04:22.924 --> 00:04:24.930
Perhaps we need some
x-ray diffraction.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.130
And we make a plan for next
day and a longer term plan.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.800
Then, we make sure that we've
used an appropriate amount

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.020
of power and the data
resources are OK.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.990
And then, we upload
it to the rover.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.395
And so the cycle repeats.

00:04:39.395 --> 00:04:42.310
 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.060
I'm an astrobiologist,
and my thrill

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.760
is into looking into the
possibility of their being life

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.410
on Mars.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.920
And we're not, obviously,
talking about little green men.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.895
We're talking about
hardy, microbes

00:04:52.895 --> 00:04:55.020
called bacterial lifeforms.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.040
And then, that's going
to be hard to find.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.790
And actually, one of
the bigger questions

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.910
is whether the
environment on Mars

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.020
was ever conducive, was
ever clement for life.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.810
We need to look at
the rocks and see

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.420
under what processes
they formed.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.120
And to do that, we use tricks
like x-ray diffraction.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.730
So we take our sieved material,
for instance, from the drill,

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.730
and we put it onto a
little vibrating stage.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.460
Vibrating this fine
grade material,

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.620
we make sure we got an even mix
of all the different minerals

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.170
and all their different
crystal orientations.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.720
The CheMin instrument
takes a source

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.820
of x-rays focused
through a pinhole.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.260
Then, we direct
it onto the stage.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.950
A very narrow beam of x-ray.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.720
It's almost like a torch
shinning not with visible light

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.720
you can see with your
eyes but x-ray light.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.200
And you collect
the x-rays, which

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.320
have defracted
through your sample.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.250
Focused onto a CCT,
bit like at the back

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.980
of your digital camera.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.970
And what we get there are these
rings, called Debye rings,

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.682
and measure the radius of
those rings using something

00:06:04.682 --> 00:06:06.390
called Bragg's Law--
so that's going back

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.700
to beginning of the
century-- allows

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.210
us to measure the spacing
between different layers

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.710
of atoms.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.101
And that's the information.

00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:15.350
It tells you what kind of
mineral or what kind of rock

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.100
you're looking at.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.840
And on Mars, some
of the minerals,

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.280
it's about one nanometer.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.127
That tells us it's clay.

00:06:23.127 --> 00:06:24.210
It was this kind of stuff.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.360
This is modellers
clay I've got here.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.980
It's the kind of thing you might
play with and make things out

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:29.480
of.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.430
It's a very commonplace
material on Earth,

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.010
but to find this on Mars
is absolutely mind-blowing.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.410
This is clay that was formed
in an aqueous environment.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.080
And so what Curiosity
had essentially found

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.420
was river mud, the
mud on the bottom

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.380
of what would have
been a babbling brook

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.150
billions of years ago on
an ancient Martian surface.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.870
And the conditions
needed to make this clay

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.610
would have been not too
acidic, not too alkaline, not

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.390
too salty.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.190
And, in fact, if you
could have jumped

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.660
into a spaceship
and a time machine

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.740
and gone back to that place
on the surface of Mars

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.990
billions of years
ago and knelt down

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.050
and scoped up some of
that water in a glass,

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.020
you could have drunken
that Martian river water.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.830
It's only really
because of Curiosity

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.530
that we know we've had these
long-standing bodies of water,

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.745
lakes, which lasted
for thousands of years.

00:07:18.745 --> 00:07:27.798
 

00:07:27.798 --> 00:07:32.310
The same technique that solved
the structure for salt in 1914

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.820
is being used today to
help in the search for life

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.900
on other worlds.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.570
I don't suppose
they could possibly

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.380
have imagined that
x-ray diffraction would

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.660
be used on Mars.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:50.000
But it shows just how important
the work was that they did.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.370
With all of this
space exploration

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.559
and trying to get to
know other worlds,

00:07:54.559 --> 00:07:56.350
you're obviously always
trying to push back

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.960
the very frontiers of
what we know already

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.340
and what we've been able
to achieve in the past.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.830
And you can't always
play it too safe,

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.370
and you have got to take risks.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.529
You've got very little
chance, or no chance at all,

00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:11.320
of being able to repair
an instrument which

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.460
isn't working properly.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.930
The answer to this is
really lots of testing.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.660
 

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.600
You have this building
accumulation of knowledge.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.050
And this helps us decide
the most exciting places

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.470
we want to go to next time.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.850
Mars 2020 is an
interesting mission

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.250
because that is likely to be
the first part of Mars sample

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.940
return that we can take back to
Earth to do all sorts of tests

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.419
for presence or past
presence of life.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:44.030
 

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:49.330
For me, I think having
mankind in space

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.445
is about the spirit
of exploration.

00:08:51.445 --> 00:08:53.030
There really is an
awful lot that you

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.370
can do with machines
like Curiosity.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.340
I think that, in the
end, you have to do both.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.930
And, ok, you can get instruments
to the surface of Mars

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.720
at significantly less cost,
but, ultimately, there's

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.440
a limit to what you can
really do with machines alone.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.710
And sending man there, you'd
have so much more flexibility.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.870
And you can make decisions
right there and then

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.120
with a trained eye.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.760
And I think that opens up
massive possibilities in terms

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.040
of science that you can do.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.820
I would love to go.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.040
But, yes, I'm probably
not young enough anymore.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.070
 

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.940
it'd be a really
major challenge just

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.830
for these people to survive.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.340
And that could happen
as early as the 2020s.

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.380
So there are
possibilities there.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.530
In terms of a space agency
sending people there,

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.446
then they're going to
want to bring them back.

00:09:43.446 --> 00:09:45.030
And 2030s is
probably the earliest

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.520
that that could
realistically happen.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.275
So if you'd been a microbe on
Mars four billion years ago,

00:09:52.275 --> 00:09:54.500
yeah, it would have
been habitable for you.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.390
We don't yet know
if there were any.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.830
Whether it did support
life is the next stage.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.710
To think of the
cosmos as a whole,

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.740
and there are grand questions
to which we, at the moment,

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.670
we don't really have
much idea about.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.770
So, for example, things like
why is the universe here

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.150
and how did it originate and--
OK, there is a simple answer

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.930
if it originated
in the Big Bang.

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.665
But, why did the Big Bang occur?

00:10:18.665 --> 00:10:20.290
And, of course, day
to day, I'm working

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.060
on much more mundane things.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.220
But, in many ways,
those are the things

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.750
which ultimately motivate
me to work in space science.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.760
My long-term hope
is we get closer

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.980
to finding life on another
world because I think

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.990
that would be one of the most
fundamental and revolutionary

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.470
discoveries that we
could make as a species.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.260
We know that we're not
alone in this universe.

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.060
It is necessary to
put in big effort

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.730
to get some worthwhile
harvest of knowledge.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.390
You have to be prepared
to go a long distance .

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.540
Of course, we went a
very long distance,

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.750
over 60 million
kilometres to Mars,

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:01.500
and used a lot of resources,
both financial and manpower,

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.790
but I'm confidant it's
all been worth it.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:43.488
