00:00:13.793 --> 00:00:15.321
Come on:

00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:17.703
Hasn't everyone here dreamt of flying?

00:00:18.758 --> 00:00:22.521
So why haven't humans flown yet?

00:00:23.153 --> 00:00:26.309
I've been obsessed with
learning to fly my whole life.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:31.453
I grew up a feral, adopted child
on the northern shore of Lake Ontario,

00:00:31.477 --> 00:00:35.656
following my bricklayer/fisherman
father around.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.254
I was always fascinated
by things that moved,

00:00:38.278 --> 00:00:41.358
catching small animals,
holding them in my hands,

00:00:41.382 --> 00:00:43.269
feeling the magic of their movement;

00:00:44.412 --> 00:00:46.086
playing with fire,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.940
thrilled and terrified at
its unrelenting force,

00:00:49.964 --> 00:00:52.980
accidentally burning
my father's barn down --

00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:54.323
just once.

00:00:54.347 --> 00:00:55.896
(Laughter)

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.417
That was my first brush with real danger,

00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:00.565
the fire and my father.

00:01:01.174 --> 00:01:05.582
When I was about eight or nine years old,
I caught a fly in a mason jar.

00:01:05.606 --> 00:01:07.868
Studying that fly, I thought, "Wow,

00:01:07.892 --> 00:01:11.479
it's changing directions
in midair with acute angles,

00:01:11.503 --> 00:01:13.835
and it's going so fast, it's a blur.

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:16.635
Why can't we do that? Can we?"

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:21.812
Everywhere I looked,
there were things moving.

00:01:21.836 --> 00:01:25.315
And these things moved
with their very own causal rhythms,

00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:28.356
their very own mechanistic anatomies.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.080
It was clear to me -- and to Newton --

00:01:31.104 --> 00:01:34.026
that things move based
on their component parts:

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.785
worms squirmed, birds flew,
kangaroos hopped.

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:43.018
And a human's first bout with flying
was falling accidentally, tripping,

00:01:43.042 --> 00:01:46.039
or slipping on that fabled banana peel.

00:01:46.603 --> 00:01:50.143
Once your ground is dragged
out from under you,

00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:53.051
a world of wonder comes rushing in.

00:01:54.132 --> 00:01:56.483
I had found my territory.

00:01:56.507 --> 00:01:58.980
I was seized with a compulsion,

00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:02.041
a primordial urge to learn how to fly,

00:02:02.065 --> 00:02:03.228
like a human.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.877
For the next 10 years,
I did my experiments alone,

00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:08.262
on my own body.

00:02:08.286 --> 00:02:11.370
I drove my Honda 350
across the United States

00:02:11.394 --> 00:02:13.424
in an "Easy Rider" kind of way.

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:18.985
I got my degree in modern dance.
I mimicked that fly in the box.

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.062
I dove horizontally through glass;

00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:22.961
on the way, I punched a hole in it.

00:02:22.985 --> 00:02:25.819
I was trying to figure out
something about flight.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.914
When I was 27 years old,

00:02:28.938 --> 00:02:32.950
I found myself in a rat-infested
New York City loft,

00:02:32.974 --> 00:02:35.282
getting ready to hurl myself off a ladder.

00:02:35.815 --> 00:02:37.435
I climbed higher, higher, higher,

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.673
and I jumped.

00:02:38.697 --> 00:02:40.899
Wham-o! I landed.

00:02:41.543 --> 00:02:42.703
That hurt.

00:02:42.727 --> 00:02:43.754
(Laughter)

00:02:43.778 --> 00:02:47.806
And it occurred to me that people
didn't really enjoy getting hurt,

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.609
and that maybe the reason
that we weren't flying yet

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:54.027
is that we were still attached
to that false idea

00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:56.848
that we would fly the way birds do,

00:02:56.872 --> 00:02:58.581
or butterflies.

00:02:58.605 --> 00:03:02.335
Maybe we needed to assumption-bust,

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.195
to ask a different kind of question --

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:06.798
about duration, for instance.

00:03:06.822 --> 00:03:09.449
Humans in the air? A few seconds.

00:03:09.473 --> 00:03:14.003
Birds and butterflies?
Minutes, maybe hours.

00:03:14.706 --> 00:03:16.234
And what about fear?

00:03:16.892 --> 00:03:20.058
I think fear is complex and personal.

00:03:20.892 --> 00:03:23.410
I really think it has to do with curiosity

00:03:23.434 --> 00:03:26.176
and not taking yourself so seriously.

00:03:26.764 --> 00:03:28.896
We might need to get a little hurt,

00:03:29.514 --> 00:03:31.395
just not too hurt.

00:03:32.175 --> 00:03:34.079
And pain: redefine it.

00:03:34.502 --> 00:03:38.415
Rather than "pain," say, "another
rather interesting, foreign sensation."

00:03:39.296 --> 00:03:40.629
Something like that.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.294
I realized then that to learn to fly,
we were going to have to learn to land.

00:03:46.318 --> 00:03:49.292
My hero, Evel Knievel --
one of them -- said,

00:03:49.316 --> 00:03:51.564
"Anyone can jump a motorcycle.

00:03:51.588 --> 00:03:53.980
The trouble begins
when you try to land it."

00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:56.086
(Laughter)

00:03:57.062 --> 00:03:58.630
Landing hurts.

00:03:59.961 --> 00:04:01.113
I was curious, though.

00:04:01.137 --> 00:04:04.551
I thought, "Well, why don't we invent
an impact technique?

00:04:04.575 --> 00:04:07.530
Why don't we just expand
our base of support?"

00:04:07.554 --> 00:04:09.698
I had seen pieces of plywood fall,

00:04:09.722 --> 00:04:12.048
and they didn't flinch on the way down.

00:04:12.072 --> 00:04:14.595
So I made my body into a perfect line

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:16.037
and tilted back.

00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:17.251
Whaft!

00:04:17.275 --> 00:04:19.896
It was a totally different
sound than "wham-o."

00:04:20.721 --> 00:04:23.596
And I rushed out onto
the streets of New York City

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.358
and went up to complete strangers,

00:04:25.382 --> 00:04:27.341
and I said -- well, I thought --

00:04:27.365 --> 00:04:29.595
"I did a backfall today. Did you?"

00:04:30.214 --> 00:04:35.684
In 1985, we started to tour
all over the world a little bit,

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:37.888
and I started my company,

00:04:37.912 --> 00:04:39.652
called STREB EXTREME ACTION.

00:04:40.205 --> 00:04:43.355
In 2003, we were invited
to go to Kitty Hawk

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:47.571
to celebrate the 100th anniversary
of flight with the Wright Brothers.

00:04:47.595 --> 00:04:49.873
We had gotten very good at landing;

00:04:49.897 --> 00:04:52.315
now we needed to get up into the air.

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:54.888
And like them, we wanted
to stay there longer.

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.889
I came across this quote by Wilbur:

00:04:58.357 --> 00:05:02.442
"If you are looking for perfect safety,
you will do well to sit on a fence

00:05:02.466 --> 00:05:04.055
and watch the birds;

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:07.506
but if you really wish to learn,
you must mount a machine

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.690
and become acquainted
with its tricks by actual trial."

00:05:11.906 --> 00:05:13.516
Ah, machines.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.160
It incited the hardware
junkie inside of me.

00:05:16.906 --> 00:05:20.963
And if we did want to go or travel
to unhabitual places in space --

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:24.430
to that banana peel spot that confuses us;

00:05:24.454 --> 00:05:27.783
to that place outside
our vertical comfort zone,

00:05:27.807 --> 00:05:30.967
where we encounter unexpected turbulence

00:05:30.991 --> 00:05:34.165
and get accelerated oddly,

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:37.687
where the ground changes
and moves out from under us --

00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:40.540
like the composer
who is trying to hit a note

00:05:40.564 --> 00:05:43.199
higher than the human voice can sing,

00:05:43.223 --> 00:05:45.629
he invents a piccolo or a flute,

00:05:45.653 --> 00:05:49.530
I set about the invention
of my prototypic machines.

00:05:50.601 --> 00:05:54.369
And if we wanted to go
higher, faster, sooner, harder,

00:05:54.393 --> 00:05:57.377
it was necessary that we create
our very own spaceships.

00:05:57.401 --> 00:05:58.564
And we did.

00:05:58.588 --> 00:06:03.462
And we did travel to unknown,
invisible, dangerous territories,

00:06:03.486 --> 00:06:04.975
and it changed us.

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:08.895
If any of you want
to try this, let me know.

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.015
(Laughter)

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.462
In 2012, we brought all
of our best machines to London

00:06:13.486 --> 00:06:16.809
and put them in their most iconic places.

00:06:16.833 --> 00:06:18.766
We got on the London Eye.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.214
It was 443 feet above the earth.

00:06:22.238 --> 00:06:25.714
And as we reached the zenith,
we unlocked our brake and fell --

00:06:27.071 --> 00:06:29.202
200 feet on the radius,

00:06:29.226 --> 00:06:31.534
on the spoke that we were attached to.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.306
We reached as far up as heaven that day,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.873
I'm pretty sure of it.

00:06:36.897 --> 00:06:38.793
And then I and two of my dancers

00:06:38.817 --> 00:06:41.261
walked down the outside
of London's City Hall.

00:06:41.285 --> 00:06:44.545
As I stood up there,
300 feet above the ground,

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:45.826
and looked down,

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.740
I saw 2,000 eyes staring up at me,

00:06:48.764 --> 00:06:53.303
and they saw what they usually do --
the sky, a bird, a plane -- and then us.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.985
And we were just a tiny speck up there.

00:06:56.858 --> 00:06:59.095
And I realized that action
is for everybody.

00:06:59.778 --> 00:07:02.956
Now we have our very own
mason jar in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

00:07:03.448 --> 00:07:06.904
It's called SLAM: STREB Lab
for Action Mechanics.

00:07:06.928 --> 00:07:09.466
It was a former mustard seed factory.

00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:12.993
And I designed it after
the use of a petri dish,

00:07:13.017 --> 00:07:14.439
and in that petri dish,

00:07:14.463 --> 00:07:17.314
I put Kid Action, STREB EXTREME ACTION

00:07:17.338 --> 00:07:18.728
and circus arts,

00:07:18.752 --> 00:07:23.087
and we all learned to fly, fall and land
and invent extreme action together.

00:07:23.111 --> 00:07:24.825
And you know what we found?

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:27.124
In comes everyone --

00:07:27.148 --> 00:07:30.302
every size, shape, age, capacity,

00:07:30.326 --> 00:07:35.190
every nationality, every race,
every class, all genders,

00:07:35.214 --> 00:07:38.254
the timid and the bold,
the outcast and the cool,

00:07:38.278 --> 00:07:41.683
the risk avoiders and the risk obsessives.

00:07:42.422 --> 00:07:45.760
And these buildings exist
all over the world,

00:07:45.784 --> 00:07:50.754
and every one of them can be
a flying training center.

00:07:51.754 --> 00:07:53.361
And you know, as it turns out,

00:07:54.329 --> 00:07:56.573
people don't want
to just dream about flying,

00:07:57.287 --> 00:07:59.349
nor do they want to watch us fly.

00:07:59.803 --> 00:08:01.868
They want to do it, too, and they can.

00:08:01.892 --> 00:08:03.709
And with a little training,

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.889
they learn to relish
the hit and the impact,

00:08:06.913 --> 00:08:09.816
and, I guess even more,
getting up afterwards.

00:08:10.872 --> 00:08:16.048
I've found that the effect of flying
causes smiles to get more common,

00:08:16.072 --> 00:08:18.657
self-esteem to blossom,

00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:21.507
and people get just a little bit braver.

00:08:22.713 --> 00:08:25.032
And people do learn to fly,

00:08:25.984 --> 00:08:27.967
as only humans can.

00:08:28.482 --> 00:08:29.836
So can you.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.210
Come fly with us.

00:08:32.015 --> 00:08:36.634
(Applause)

00:08:36.658 --> 00:08:43.034
(Music)

00:09:07.698 --> 00:09:11.231
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

00:09:11.255 --> 00:09:12.767
(Applause)
