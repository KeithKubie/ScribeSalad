00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.410
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Hello it's --

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.750
my name is Nancy Groce
and its June 6, 2017.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.700
And I'm here with Burt Feintuch
to talk about his career

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.860
and his experiences as a folklorist
and a scholar and a musician.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.330
And first of all thanks
so much for joining us.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.630
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: My pleasure.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.010 position:56%
I was flattered that you invited me.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.130
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah, and you're
here for a Batten lecture,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.440
which will be given tomorrow.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.000
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Right, mm-hmm.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.790
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Talking
about New Orleans and -

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.570
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: And this
idea of cultural integrity

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.400 position:56%
that I've been talking about lately.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.590
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So I understand
that your very generously going

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.100
to have some of your collections
come here to the library,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.010
so we wanted to just talk to you
about how these collections came

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.550
to be and how you came to
be a folklorist and very -

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.450
kind of just an overview.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.570
So, do you want to start with, did
you start off to be a folklorist

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.610
or a musician or where
did you grow up?

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.130
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I grew up mostly
in the suburbs of Philadelphia.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.110
I grew up in Flutatown.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.410
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Flutatown.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.710
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: That's
in Pennsylvania.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.010
Yeah I was born in Jersey City

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.940
which my mother concealed
from me for years.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.240
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
what year was that?

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.490
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: That was 1949.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.210 position:56%
I lived for the first several years
of my life in Rutherford, New Jersey

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.590
and then my father's
business from work,

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.490
took him to the Philadelphia
area, and we moved.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.020
And how I became a folklorist?

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.950
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.600
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Well
I have a number of ways

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.290
of answering that question.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.860
One is that I would say that when
I was 13 the mother of a friend

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.330
of mine took the two of us

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.120
to hear the Kingston Trio
at Princeton University.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.900
And then retrospect and
that just fired me up.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.900
In retrospect I think
it may have been more

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.160
that it was maybe the first
life music I'd ever encountered

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.650
or live music on stage
that I'd ever encountered,

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.630
but something really excited me.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.700
And then I think inexplicably my
mother took me to see Pete Seeger

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.470
after that at the Academy
of Music in Philadelphia,

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.980
which really fired me up

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.730
and you know Bob Campbell has
written something about being taken

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.440
to hear Pete Seeger young

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.530
and how things were never
quite the same after that.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.670
And I think that was true
for me, and so this was

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.360
of course during the great
folk song revival of the 60's.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.960
And it meant that I got active in
the folk song club in high school

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.320
and all this sort of stuff.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.150
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Were
you a singer or -

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.750
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I was mostly
trying to play guitar and banjo

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.280
in those days, in those days.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.900
And then I went on to
college at Penn State

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.180 position:56%
where Sam Bayard was still teaching.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.480
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh really?

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.780
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Samuel
Preston Bayard, yeah.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.080
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So did
you study with him?

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.380
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I did, yeah.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.160 position:56%
Three or four courses and he had
studied with George Lyman Kittredge.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.970
He had published one of the
first significant collections

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.030
of instrumental folk music
of fiddle and fife tunes

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.850
from southeastern Pennsylvania.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.140
And it was a great old character.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.950
I also had a course
from Bruce Rosenberg

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.720
who was there very briefly.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.770
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: He must
have been quite young -

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.900
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I
think he was quite young.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.400
I never really got to know him.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.730
He was going through some personal
difficulties and was barely around.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.230
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Was
this in Harrisburg?

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.730
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: No,
this was in State College.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.560
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh in
State College, oh okay.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.050
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: And I was
an American Studies major

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.020
but taking all the folklore courses
I could and became dimly aware

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.680
that there was such a thing as
a graduate degree in folklore.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.460
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: What was
Bayard like as a professor?

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.800
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: He
was a great character.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.780
He seemed like an old guy then.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.920
In retrospect I'm not
really sure how old he was,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.760
but he had that kind
antiquarian feel about him.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.830 position:56%
He - what I think everyone remembers

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.490
about Sam Bayard is
that he used snuff.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.520
That as he snorted,
he sniffed snuff.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.360
And he had a collection
of antique snuff boxes.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.380
And so he would come to
class and in the middle

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.510
of class he'd be dipping snuff,
or whatever the expression is;

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.910
I don't know what it is when you
inhale it as opposed to tuck it in.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.520
But - and everybody would be
watching to see what sort of horn

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.610
or silver or whatever snuff box he
would pull out of his coat pocket.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.680
And when he finished teaching
there was a fine powder

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.660
on the floor around him.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.810
And you also knew that you'd
made it in his estimation

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.980
if he offered you a pinch of snuff,
which eventually he did for me.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.210
It burned like crazy,
that's what I remember.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.790
But he was very much
of an era, you know?

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.060
I think I had some sort of
general folklore class from him

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.060
where he used the croppy book,

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.380
the Science of Folklore,
from the 1930's.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.020
I had an I think Folk Song and
Ballad or maybe just ballad class

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.660
with him where we basically
worked our way

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.460
through the Albert Freedman book

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.120
with him talking about
each of the texts.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.520
He was also one of those
people of that generation

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.010
who had just this deep
knowledge of the material itself.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.340
You know years later I
sent him some recordings

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.760
of some instrumental music
from the northeast of England,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.500
I sent him some tune book copies
too, and he was able to talk

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.330
about the tune histories of all
that sort of stuff, you know?

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.130
He had that remarkable
kind of knowledge

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.850
that I think most of
us no longer have.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.750
And he was you know,
encouraging about the idea

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.150
of studying folklore as well.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.860
I also got to know Saul Brody
in those days, who was either in

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.190
or had finished I guess the
graduate program at Penn.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.400
I guess he hadn't finished
his dissertation, which -

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.010
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: I think that
took a little bit longer.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.730
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: That
took a while, yeah.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:12.260 position:56%
But I lived in a house that had been
off campus, that had been claimed

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.000
by people who were involved

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.240
with what was called the
Penn State Folklore Society,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.620
but was really a folk song society
sponsoring concerts and things.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.280
And Saul used to come and stay
there when he was around town,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.860
so learn some things about
the field from him as well.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.250
Really I had no idea what
I was getting into honestly

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.470
between Sam's terrific but quite
old fashioned way and that sort

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.040
of generalities from Saul.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.070 position:56%
And in fact, sometimes these days I
tell people that I think it's likely

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.940
that I would have become a
musicologist if I'd known there was

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.060
such a field back then,
but I really didn't.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.950
Because I went into the field,
you know because of a passion

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.450
for traditional music,
for vernacular music.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.560
And it seemed like that was
the way to go in those days,

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.290
I'm not sure it is anymore.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.440
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So you
did an undergraduate at -

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.160
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: At Penn State -

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.940
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And then
where did you go next?

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: University of
Pennsylvania for my Master's and PhD

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.540
in folklore and folk life.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.570
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And so - and
who were your professors there?

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.190
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Those days it
was Kenny Goldstein, Don Yoder,

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:31.050
Dan Benimos, Kenny and Dan,

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.940
Tris Koffin were the sort
of core of that program.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.540
There was a guy named Tom Burns,

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.570
I don't know if that name
means anything to you.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.750
Tom eventually sort
of left the field.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.500
I went through that program
really quickly; you know I went

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.050
through from entering to
finishing my PhD in four years.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.650
Barbara KG came in the year
that I was basically not there,

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.730
writing my dissertation,
so I never really got

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.230
to know her in that context.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.980
I think that's who was there then.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.360 position:56%
I also did some course work with Ray
Birdwhistle out of the department

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.320 position:56%
and someone in anthropology as well.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.070
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
what did you write on?

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.370
What were you studying?

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.670
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I
wrote a dissertation

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.020
about a traditional fiddler
from southeast Pennsylvania,

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.350
his name was Earl Zeigler or Earl
Haffler actually, it's complicated

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.740
but Pop Haffler who was known as
sort of old time fiddle circles

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.310
and actually had a connection to
Alan Jabber and to Henry Glassy,

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.030
when Henry was state folklorist.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.610
I didn't know Henry in
those days before my time,

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:39.350
he had recorded Pop Haffler for
whatever sort of work he was doing.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.520
Alan had visited him either
through library or NEA

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.200
or something at some point.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.350
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Were you
playing fiddle at this time?

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.950
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I started
playing the fiddle a year or two

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.960
into graduate school; so yes.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:56.070
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Because you're
quite well known as a fiddler.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.850
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I'm
flattered; thanks.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.240
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah, and when
you were collecting from him,

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.980
were you playing fiddle
with him or were you -

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.480
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: To some extent
and he was an elderly man.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.390
He was a taxidermist and I
spent a year visiting him.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:14.520 position:56%
He lived in a small town not too
far - I never lived in Philadelphia.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.060 position:56%
When I was in graduate school in
Philly, I lived out in Bucks County,

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.650 position:56%
commuted an hour, hour and a half
in because my then wife was teaching

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.860 position:56%
in that area and it just made sense.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.100
So I was living in a
place called Lahaska,

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.680
Pennsylvania between New Hope and
Doylestown, if that means anything

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.860
to you; if you know
that part of the world.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.100
And Pop Haffer lived in a town

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.660
about half an hour away
called Quaker Town.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:42.860
And it was just a great
Pennsylvania name, isn't it?

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.540
And he had a son who was older
than I was, who was a fiddle player

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:52.400
as well and we had more in common
in terms of repertoire than Pop,

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.930 position:56%
who had become kind of an attraction
in old fiddlers picnics and things

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.600
in that part of Pennsylvania.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.900
At that point there
weren't many people known

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.220
who could sort of fit that bill.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.400
The old traditional musician.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.040
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
playing regional repertoire?

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.340
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Yeah.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.820
You know it's been so long since
I've listened to any of that

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.680
or thought about it, I can't
really talk much about it anymore.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:21.610
I think my interest has always been
more in sort of understanding kind

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:25.890
of why people make music and how
people make music and how it fits

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.440
in their lives then it
is in repertoire itself.

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.310
So, I spent pretty much a
year visiting and interviewing

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.300
and traveling around
a little bit with him.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.920
His wife died in that time and
he went into a deep depression

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.520
and stopped playing and you
know I happened to be with him

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.920
when he picked it up again, which
was an emotional moment for him.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.670
It was a terrific experience.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.060
It was also a dissertation
that was very much influenced

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.670
by all the performance theory
stuff that was happening

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.340
in those days for better or worse.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.760
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: We've
recovered from the field but -

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.400
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Yeah,
but it's sort

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.930
of not the dissertation
I would write now.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.890
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And you were also
doing some collecting in Kentucky

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.690
and Tennessee early
in your career, right?

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.010
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: A
little bit later.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:21.100 position:56%
What happened was in the year that
I was finishing - when I was at Penn

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.010
which was kind of the burgeoning
periods I think for that program.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:29.210 position:56%
Although I think they kind of
fooled us in that they made us think

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.780
that it was a better
established program

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.180
and better established
discipline than it really was,

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.370
which I think is part of
the job they had to do.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.460
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: This would be
like in the mid to late 70's?

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.440
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: This
was '71 to '75.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.600
And you know the new perspective
stuff had just come out -

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.700
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So you were all
sure you'd have careers and -

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.790
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Yeah, in fact
they used to say that everyone

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:54.090
who finished the degree there and
wanted an academic job got one.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:58.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Penn was certainly
the leading proponent at that point.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.980
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: The year that I
was finishing that didn't happen.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.530
The bottom kind of fell out
and people weren't getting jobs

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:10.400
and it was a difficult
and frustrating time.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.940
At the very last moment really
I learned about an opening

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.710
at Western Kentucky University,
which I think I learned about that

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.100 position:56%
in you know April or May, very late.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.660
And it was because
Mary Clark, of Mary

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.530
and Kenneth Clark, do
you know those names?

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.830
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yes.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.880
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Had announced
her retirement I think late.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.260
And I applied for and got that job.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.690
So that took me to Bowling Green,

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:42.550
Kentucky Western Kentucky
University in the summer of 1975.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:47.220
Where there was a great
archive of a lot

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.140
of old film music among
lots of other things.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.420
Lynwood Montell had
been there for years;

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.280
DK Willis had been there
before he went to UCLA.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.510
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: I'd forgotten that.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.810
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Yeah, this was
before - DK was before my time.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:07.750
But there were terrific recordings
of very archaic local fiddle music

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:12.700
that in many cases were done by
DK with Archie Green visiting.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:18.880
Some Ed Conn and it was often, I
think Lynwood who was sort of from

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.980
that part of the country or not
far from that part of Kentucky.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.100
I think it was Lynwood
who led them to some

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:30.660 position:56%
of these people whom he'd known just
by virtue of having grown up there.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:33.160
And I kind of got very
interested in that.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.380
And I also early on met a fellow,

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.110
a wonderful fiddle player
who's become kind of legend

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:43.770
in old time fiddle revival,
a guy named Bruce Green.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.380
I don't know if that name
means anything to you?

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.760
Bruce was from New
Jersey, very bright guy

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:56.500
who had gotten very interested
in archaic Kentucky fiddle music

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:01.200
and had gone to Western Kentucky
as an English major with the idea

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.090
that he might be able to do some
visiting and field research.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:11.640
And he had done a wonderful job of
sort of turning up very old players

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.900 position:56%
who had played a repertoire that
you just didn't hear any place else.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.940
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Very
regional repertoire?

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.570
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Yeah
very regional; yeah.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:23.040
And it found a home recordings
and things of this sort.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:28.220 position:56%
And was an incredibly talent, almost
mimic of some of those players

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.840
that he really kind of got that.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.210
You know many of us are
more kind of interpreters.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.450
He was really kind of
able to replicate things.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:42.100
And he used to - by that time
he had graduated, was there part

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.310
of the year and picking
apples in Vermont

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.670
to support himself
the rest of the year.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:52.180
This really sounds like it's
certainly - but I was lucky enough

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.920 position:56%
that he introduced me to some of
the old time musicians that he knew.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:02.390
We got an early NEA folk arts grant
together to produce a double album

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:06.000 position:56%
of both instrumental and vocal music

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.770
from that south central Kentucky
area and some of that was

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:14.360
from the archive, and some of
that was recordings that I did

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.610
with the folk like
center, borrowed -

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.030
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: From
the Library of Congress?

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.970
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Yeah from
the Library of Congress.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:28.970
And it was one of the early NEA
grants to do a sound recording.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.160
Yeah and then he ended up
moving out of the area,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.460
moving to North Carolina.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.810
I haven't seen him for years,
but he's sort of remained kind

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:40.110
of shadow legendary
figure for that kind

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:46.150
of old repertoire,
to some extent; yeah.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:51.480
So that's really what got me
interested in both playing

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.440
and learning something of the
music from that part of the world.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:01.170
In those days western was a
master's program in folklore

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:05.410
and just getting interested
in developing strengths

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:08.350
in the public sector, so it
was a pretty exciting time

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.350
to get there, to be part of that.

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:13.250
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Can you talk a
little bit about public sector

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.430
because that's really when
public sector folklore started

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.190
to take off, right?

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.770
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Well I
guess one of the times; yeah.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:28.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, when I got there in '75,

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:33.510
I'm trying to remember
this, cloudy history.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.280
There was a student
- a recent graduate

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.130
of the program named Linda White
I think who had gotten a job

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.790
as I think it was State
Folklorist in Tennessee.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:46.940 position:56%
It was very early, before Roby
Cogswell who you would know I think.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.720
And there was a lot of sort
of excitement in the program

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.640
about the possibility of
helping students think

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.830
about careers in that direction.

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:59.060
One of the first experiences I had
with student, was I think it was

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.800
in the summer when I had arrived,
before I started teaching,

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.150
I sat in on a master's
thesis defense

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.500
by a young student named
Peggy Bulcher, for instance.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.170
And of course we know
that history as well.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:18.280
I guess she was coming up from
Florida at that point and working;

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.170
so there were - and I also was

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:22.870 position:56%
on the thesis committee again I
think before I even started teaching

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.320
of a guy named George Reynolds
who was working for Fox Fire.

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:31.090
So there was a little bit of,
sort of direction developing

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:34.630
where students were getting their
masters degrees and moving off

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.920
into more public or
applied kinds of work.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.980
And we began talking about
what can we do to help that

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:46.150
and to encourage it and work to
develop some internships and work

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.720
to develop some courses
and actually work

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:55.390
to develop what was called
historic preservation option.

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:58.800
I think which was a non-thesis
option for the master's degree.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.470
We had people writing pretty
serious masters theses,

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.720
but we came up with
this more courses -

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:10.240
and some of those students actually
went into historic preservation.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.700
But it was also a way to
begin to move into more public

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.260
or applied kinds of work
through internships,

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.180
through their own ingenuity.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:27.840
And also in '85 I organized the
conference that became the book,

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.470
the Conservation of Culture,
which was published in '88.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:36.030
So that was one of the first
big public folklore conferences.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.900
There'd been Bob Byington
did something

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.230
in Pittsburgh years earlier that
people talked about quite a lot.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:47.290
And we did a smaller one either the
late 70's or early 80's at Western.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:50.680
And then '85 did one
that was quite a big one.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.500
And that led, the library's
cultural conservation report

00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:02.110
that Ormond Loomis I guess had
kind of led - had been published.

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:06.650
So that there was a lot of this
conversation going on in lots

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:14.030
of places by then, but we had this
conference that had stellar line

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:17.760
up of people who are
committed to the idea of what

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.930
in those days was called
cultural conservation.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:26.130
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Are you in touch
with Max Hall NEA quite a bit?

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.500
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Mm-hmm, and we
had Archie there to give a keynote,

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:34.710
Archie Green came to give a
keynote and Alan Jabbour was there

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:42.560
and that led to that book which for
a while was probably you know one

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.660
of the main texts for people
interested in you know reading

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.620
about public folklore anyway.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:48.920
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Did you
write it or did you -

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.220
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: No it was edited.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.190
It was based on that conference,
on the papers from that conference.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.350
I had an editor from the
University Press of Kentucky,

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:03.110 position:56%
which is one of those consortium
presses who had been sort of curious

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:06.260
about the possibility of publishing
this, come down to the conference

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.010
and he left very excited
about the possibility.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:14.640
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That
was really classic book;

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.640
it's still in print, isn't it?

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.940
&gt;&gt; No.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.630
No, I think that there's
an online version available

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:27.010
through the Kentucky Press although
I don't actually know for sure.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:30.850
There was a brief moment where it
looked like another press wanted

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:36.090
to reissue it and I had the
copyright reverted to me,

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:40.160
or whatever the term is for
that and then that fell through.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.970
It suddenly was one of those times

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.050
when all the university
presses were saying "Oh God,

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.930
we're in trouble now;
what can we do"?

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:50.190
We only need to publish bestselling
fiction and cook books you know?

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:53.370
So, it never happened.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.840
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So how long
were you at Western Kentucky?

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.380
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I
was there for 13 years.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.400
I was there from '75 to '88.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.150
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And then
you got lured away by -

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:09.470
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: No then I
worked hard to find another job.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:13.590
I - there was a lot I really
loved about being at Western.

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:19.520
I wasn't wild about - my then wife
and I weren't wild about the idea

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.170
of having children grow
up there at that point.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:28.440
And a funny way the longer
I was there the less it felt

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.540
like home I think too, sort
of culturally you know?

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:36.580
It was a very religiously
conservative place.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.790 position:56%
It was an hour or so from Nashville;
this is before Nashville kind

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:42.990
of had the renaissance
that it's gone through.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:49.190 position:56%
It felt kind of remote and again, we
weren't so comfortable with the idea

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.480
of having kids grow up in a
place where they were fighting

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.260
about the Ten Commandments
on the wall

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.100
of classrooms and things
of that sort.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.440
So I actually started
looking for a job and I had -

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:04.330
I had gotten involved with the
Kentucky Humanities Council,

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:08.230
the state council there and in
fact had ended up chairing it

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.020
in what turned out to be a
sort of challenging year.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.380
And our executive director
resigned to take another job.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.660
And also a really rewarding year.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:19.980
We had an early award from
excellence from the NEH,

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:24.950
which was then recognized in
certain councils for excellence.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:29.960
And as I was looking for other
kinds of jobs I started applying

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:35.030 position:56%
for humanities and directorships and
ended up in New Hampshire in '88.

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:39.410
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So you
went to New Hampshire as -

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:42.110
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: As Director
of the Center of Humanities.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:45.890 position:56%
Not really as a folklorist, in fact
they weren't quite sure I think what

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:48.750
to do with me as a folklorist.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.540
There had been someone
in the English Department

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.980
who had taught a little bit
of folklore and literature

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.500
but was a literary scholar
and no training in folklore

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:01.160
or any allied field at all.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:06.490
And there was also a name that you
probably know, Linda Morley living

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.160
in Manchester, New Hampshire
who had done some work

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.980
as a state folklorist before
my time, was doing a little bit

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:16.300
of teaching for the University
for the English Department.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:20.240 position:56%
And although I've never really asked
I think what happened is some higher

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.420
administrator said "Okay
we're going to hire this guy,

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.490
where are we going
to put a folklorist"?

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:25.820
And they said, "Let's
put him in English"

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.340
because at least the word
shows up occasionally

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.760
in the catalog or something there.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.790
In some ways in retrospect I think
I would have done just as well

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:35.720
or maybe better in Anthropology.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.410
I mean I'm very happy in English
and my colleagues are great

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:41.670
and they're very supportive
and interested in what I do,

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:48.480
but really that was in a
certain sense a turning point

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.170
in my career as an academic.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:56.140 position:56%
You know I continued to write and do
the research that I do in the field,

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.400 position:56%
but that's not really why I'm there.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.280
I teach one course a year.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.920
I've been teaching, early on I
taught some folklore you know,

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.440
Introduction to Folklore courses

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.080
and I was teaching
some graduate students.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.410
I eventually decided I didn't want
to teach graduate students anymore,

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.080
although I taught mostly
grad students

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.070
at the masters level at Western.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:19.700
Because I just didn't really enjoy
teaching English Lit grad students

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:23.990
who wanted things from me that
I was interested in giving them.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:25.290
And you know with my much more kind

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:29.070
of ethnographic orientation
in that era anyhow.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:33.040
And now in recent years I've been,
for a while I was teaching a course

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.580
that I called The Ethnography
of Music,

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.320
which was a fieldwork
class basically.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.090
And the last couple of years
I've taught an American Roots

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.390
music class.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:45.600
My classes are all cross
listed by anthropology as well.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.550
But I'm really there directing
this research center, research

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:51.750
and programming center
in the humanities.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:55.130
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: But in your
spare time you continue

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.350
to do research and fieldwork?

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:58.650
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Sure, yeah.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:02.490
I love to do that and I certainly
have continued to do that.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.610
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So will your
next big research project

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:07.440
after leaving Western
Kentucky, I always think of you

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.070
about that time starting
to work in North Umberland,

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.350
but maybe that was
a little bit later.

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.090
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Yeah
actually I should tell you this,

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:16.840
how are we doing on time?

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.750
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: We're doing fine.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.340
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I should tell
you this little bit too I guess,

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.790
back to why I chose
to be a folklorist.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:34.640
In 1969 in my junior year as an
undergraduate I studied abroad

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:38.300
at the University of Durham
in the Northeast of England.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:44.220
And it was a brand new program
then and I was vaguely aware

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.690
that there was something akin to
the US folk song revival happening

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:51.200
in the UK, but didn't
know much about it.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.590
In fact, I remember Michael Cooney,

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.600
if you remember - he
told me about that.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.530
And so I got there and I
asked one of the faculty

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.300
where I might go hear some music.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:03.970
And he said "Go to New Castle",
which was about 20 minutes away

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:08.810 position:56%
on the train on a Thursday night and
go to this pub called the Bridge,

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:12.560
which turned out to be one of the
legendary clubs in the folk revival

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:18.930
in England, sort of powerful
commitment to regional music there,

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:23.870
to local music in New Castle
as then the sort of main city

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:25.650
of the North Umberland region,

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.540
although technically
now it's not part

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.860
of the county of North Umberland.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:34.570
It had a huge history, industrial
history and a lot of music call

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.820
and a lot of local song
and also a lot of -

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:42.020
and also the whole north Umbrian
piping tradition, the small pipe,

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.840
a distinctive instrument from that
part of the world, to manuscripts

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.190
and libraries dating back
to the 1660's and so forth.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:53.480
And I just stumbled on
this and although had sort

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:57.930
of split my time listening half to
the New Lost City Ramblers and half

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:01.140
to James Brown as an undergraduate,

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.320
I didn't really get the idea
fully I think until I was there

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.370
that music is as local
as it was there.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.730
You know as people purveyed it as

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:14.950
and you know you could hear people
play a tune named for a street

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:17.580
that you'd walk down as you went
to the train station to go back

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.880
to where you were living.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.340
And that really made a
powerful impact on me as well,

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:25.930
I think intellectually and
in my interest and also

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:31.610
because the musicians are
essentially doing tune scholarship.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:33.470
You know helped me think about -

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.830
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: It's Allister
Anderson was probably there

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:37.130
at the time -

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:38.430
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: The
group the High Level -

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:39.730
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh yeah -

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:44.010
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Colin Ross who
was one of the first fiddle players

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:50.770
in the revival there after Dave
Swarbuck, yeah so at some point

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:54.210
in Kentucky some years
later I got the idea

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.570
that maybe I could write an
article about the revival

00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:00.100
of the North Umbrian small pipes,
and managed to raise some money

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.640
to go do a summer of field work.

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:08.250
This would have been
around '85 I think.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:13.010
And that just sort of spun
out of control in a good way

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:17.110 position:56%
in that I kept raising money and
kept going back sort of interviewing

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:18.550
and recording everything I could.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:22.060
I was there for years,
did some - a few articles

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:27.240
about the revival there,
eventually produced Folkways CD,

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.130
a Smithsonian Folkways of Music -

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.150
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: The
North Umberland Grant -

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:32.450
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Yeah.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:33.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Which is a great CD.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.050
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Thanks, thanks.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:38.970
It was a lot of fun to do.

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:44.360
And that is one of the largest
sort of piles of recordings I have

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.860
that will be part of
the contribution.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.390
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And who were
you recording at that point?

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:51.120
Were you recording at the Bridge
or were you going out and doing -

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.940
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: No the Bridge was
sort of - it hadn't stopped then

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.890
but it had stopped
being what it had been.

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:59.740
It had become more
of a generic club.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:04.590
The people who had gotten it going
weren't really going there anymore,

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:07.310
so I was very interested
first in the history

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.440
of the small pipes
and of the revival.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.690
And talking to -- here
was older generation sort

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:17.380
of gentlemen had been involved in
that, a lot of talk with Colin Ross

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.740
who was the first sort of -
one of the first people to -

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:24.200
of a later generation to make the
instrument and make it available

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:28.150
and David Burley who was
probably the first who made -

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:30.470
David sort of made the Chevy

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:32.790
of the North Umberland
small pipes made a lot

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.220
of them on the assembly line.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.660
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: People had
stopped making that instrument.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:40.140
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: You could
barely get your hands on a set

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.930
if you wanted them and then
suddenly they were available again.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:44.560
And some people said the answer

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.060
to why there's a revival is
you can buy the pipes again.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.670
I think more complicated, but
I was going back quite a lot -

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.080
doing a lot of recording,

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.940
several hundred hours
I think of recordings -

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.350
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Were you
doing just with Umberland,

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:58.700
were you across the border at all?

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:02.230
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Some, well not in
Scotland, I never got to Scotland.

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:07.490
When you say cross the border
I think Durham, to the south.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:13.980
Yeah. And that's probably a lot
of academics of the great book

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:15.950 position:56%
that they didn't write, that's mine.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:19.100
There's a lot of material there
and you know and an assortment

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.250
of publications but the
book never got written.

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:24.910
And part never got written
because I got the job offer at UNH,

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.460
at the University of New Hampshire.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:33.390
That same year I had an NEH
fellowship offered to me and had

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:39.410
to not take the fellowship
so as to take the job at UNH.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:43.090
UNH, the search had failed the year
before and they're very anxious

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:47.970
to get someone to get it started so
they wouldn't let me wait a year.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:51.470
In those days NEH wouldn't
let you defer either.

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:55.840
So, I think I went back to
North Umberland once or twice

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.870
in the early years at UNH,
but it kind of lost momentum

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:04.050
and you know eventually I went to
Cape Brenton too and that was kind

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:07.280
of bad news for North Umberland.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.580
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Let's
talk about that

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:14.620
because in the last 20 years it's
really been a lot in Cape Brenton.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:17.460
So when did you make
that switch and being

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.470
in New Hampshire must have helped -

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.170
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: It
certainly helps logistically.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:26.000
You know this goes back to
me as a musician actually.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.810
I had started paying the fiddle as
an old time fiddle player in part

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:34.620 position:56%
because a guy who you also knew
name Jerry Milnes who was at Augusta

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.620
and West Virginia, who was -
when I was in graduate school was

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.250
around Philadelphia working
as an industrial model maker

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:44.610
and playing old time music
with a bunch of friends.

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.420
And I ran into him once and
mentioned the fact that I loved

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.720
to fiddle and he said "I'll
give you some lessons".

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.120
So, I went to him maybe
half a dozen times

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.340
and that really got me started,
but that was my only almost sort

00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:00.950
of official education in playing.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:06.410
The rest was by ear and by
trial and error, a lot of error.

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:12.920
And I got to New Hampshire in
'88 and couldn't find anyone

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.060
who played the music I played.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.590
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Which
was mostly southern -

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:18.890
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Southern
old time music

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:21.180
because that's what I'd
been doing in Kentucky.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.800
And so I had to kind of retool
to play for contra dances,

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.920
which was playing a lot of
some New England repertoire

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.480
and you know the kind of mish
mash of stuff that's played there,

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:35.310
a lot of Irish music and these days
if you're going to go to a session

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:40.200
where I live you're probably
going to play Irish music,

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.100
which led me to listen a little
bit to Cape Breton music,

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.720 position:56%
which I think I would have dismissed
as not very interesting when I was

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.720
in Kentucky because my
aesthetic was so different.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:55.210 position:56%
But I thought wow, this is kind of
an interesting thing and for reasons

00:32:55.210 --> 00:33:00.940
that I don't' fully you know,
remember decided to go spend a week

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.940
at a fiddle event in Cape Breton.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.350
I think this was 1997.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:09.020
One of these things where you
sit at the feet of masters.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:13.720 position:56%
And it was also great that you could
drive there of course as opposed

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.130
to fly to the Northeast of England.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:21.200
But it was a marvelous
experience in part because I got

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.040
to know these wonderful players,

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:26.990
Buddy McMaster, Ken
Inbeton and others.

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:33.420
And I think my sort of folklore
self, clicked in as well as soon

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:38.850
as I realized that the music was
so locked into community there too.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.940
It wasn't just going to something

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.180
where people taught
you and went home.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:46.450
They left to play for
a dance or something.

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:53.290
And so you know the folklore
made me sort of the outlier

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:56.640 position:56%
that first year there because all
the students at this thing would say

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.640
"Where are we going to get together
to play tunes with each other"

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.250
and I'd say "I'm going
to a dance", you know?

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:06.920
And it just kind of blew me away
how vital the tradition was there

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.140
compared to anything I'd known.

00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:13.600
And so I started setting
up interviews

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.220
and started going back
and kept going back.

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.620
And you know was lucky
enough to do a couple

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:24.370
of the Smithsonian folkways
projects and to do some writing.

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:30.650
And eventually got the idea
to do a book with my friend

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:34.160
and collaborator Gary
Sampson a photographer,

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.210
who had been the official
photographer

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:37.510
at the University of New Hampshire.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:40.620
But had moved on to
teach photography

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.650
at the New Hampshire Institute
of Arts in Manchester.

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:47.960
When he was still at UNH,
UNH sent him to Cape Breton

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:51.630
to do some photographs of me at
work for the university's magazine.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:55.740
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Just to make
sure you were actually working?

00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:57.870
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: And he
had been there years ago

00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:59.450
on some other assignment
and it turned

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.770
out you know we discovered
we both loved the place.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:04.560
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And this is
mostly the Gaelic tradition

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:09.280
of Cape Breton or also in French?

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.190
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: No, it's -
my work has been pretty largely

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:15.110
in what people would say
is the Gaelic community,

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.920
although they don't by and
large speak Gaelic anymore.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:21.550
I know people in the
French community as well

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:25.610
and the Scottish music or what used

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:28.260
to be called the Cape Breton
Scottish violin music before they

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:32.130
started just saying Cape Breton.

00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:33.830
So dominant there that
you hear a lot

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:37.320
of Francophones playing the music
and people playing the music

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.970
to the Francophone community,
has been working hard

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:42.490
to sort of revitalize things.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:48.370
And there is a history of you know,
publishing song books and things

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:52.460
of that sort too, that I don't'
know all that much about.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:56.870
But the kind of cultural
boundaries are really porous there.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:59.760
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You were there
just when Cape Breton music sort

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.860
of exploded on the world stage.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.510
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Yeah or
maybe just slightly afterwards

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:08.420
when I was there Natalie McMaster
and Ashley McIsaac the two people

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:12.350
who kind of caused that
explosion were riding very high.

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:16.630
Natalie continues to ride
pretty high and Ashley kind

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:18.740
of burned out a little bit.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:22.910
But these were two young people
with strong family traditions

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:28.840
of fiddle playing, lessons
from some of the same people,

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:33.180
who became immensely popular
first in Canada and beyond.

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:38.230
Ashely had done a CD that mixed
traditional fiddle music with the -

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:42.190
a lot of very in your face
rock and roll that was -

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:45.090
that went whatever it was
platinum or something.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:49.030
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And in Britain
also, it did well in Brittan.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:53.030
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I don't know
that, but I'm not surprised.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:56.560
He'd be playing at a dance in a
little community, there'd be a line

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.540
down the street of teenage
girls wanting to see it;

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.580
it was a great scene to
hear this fiddle player

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:07.440
who is a very traditional
style fiddle player or can be.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:13.850 position:56%
And Natalie had worked to create a
kind of act that made the music work

00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:17.360
for all kinds of audiences but
not so much the hard rock stuff

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.340
that Ashley was doing,
and she's really endured.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:28.190
So, yeah so it was very big
then across Canada and beyond.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:32.050
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
Celtic colors started -

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:33.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: A few years later.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:38.810 position:56%
The book that I started talking
about which was called In The Blood,

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:41.220
Cape Breton Conversations
on Culture.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.650
The idea was to talk to people who
one way or another sort of engaged

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:45.950
with culture in their lives.

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:49.540
A lot of musicians would
also one of the founders

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:54.380 position:56%
of Celtic Colors Festival Joella
Folds, who stepped away from it now,

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.250
but until recently was
really the force behind it.

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:01.000
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: I know
her from Scotland -

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.170
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Celtic
Connections - yeah I know she was -

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:06.290
she talks about being inspired
by that to start this festival

00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:09.660
that would extend the short
season in Cape Breton,

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.730
the short tour season
so they do it in October

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:17.320
and it's been a huge success I
think and it's run very, very well.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.390
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So you're recording
- you say you're as interested

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:25.190
in the stories and how people
use music as with the music.

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:29.450
But the In the Blood
Book, which we have here,

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:32.110
it has a lot of interesting
interviews with people;

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:36.810
how did you decide who to
interview for that field work?

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:41.530
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I think you
- I think what I did was sort

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:44.370
of follow my passion
more than map anything

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:46.470
out that had any kind of logic.

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:49.570
I knew that I wanted
to go beyond musicians.

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:52.170
I knew there were musicians
that I really wanted to talk

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:57.180
to who I think needed to be on
the record in terms of talking

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:59.980
about life and their stories
as much as their music,

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.710
which was already on the record.

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:03.650
But I also wanted to talk
to people who were involved

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:07.700
with language revival, with
the development of festivals

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.430
and some other sorts of things too.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:13.080
I talked to someone who is
a publisher of tune books,

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.810
whose tune books have had a
very powerful impact on the -

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:17.110
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Whose -

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:18.410
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Paul Cranford.

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:19.710
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Is he
the lighthouse keeper?

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:21.010
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Yeah.

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:22.310
Retired from that now.

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:25.780
Yeah I mean - one thing I realized
in North Umberland was that some

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.500
of the early tune books really
kind of established a repertoire.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.940
And I don't think that's so true in
Cape Breton but it's in part true

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.440
and a lot of that is Paul's work.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.670
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And it's
during Holland too -

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:37.970
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: During Holland,

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:39.880
yeah who I felt very
lucky to get to know.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.180
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah
he's a lovely guy.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:45.490
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Yeah and
just a brilliant musician.

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:49.240
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And Brenda
Stubbord is up there also.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.240
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Yeah I know
Brenda well, I haven't seen her

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:55.710
for a while, but know her well.

00:39:55.710 --> 00:40:00.950
Yeah. We went to - I interviewed
Brenda and we went to -

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:03.990 position:56%
Gary was with me and we went to do a
photograph of her and she was living

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:06.910
in a place called Florence
then in Cape Breton.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:10.740
And Gary had lights with him,
which he didn't normally have

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:13.860
but he plugged some lights
in and set up the shot

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:18.680
and tripped the shutter and the
power went out all over town.

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:24.430
It turns out she is a locally
celebrated tune composer

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:26.320
to which kept saying she was going

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.930
to write a tune called
"Burt's Power Surge".

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:35.910
She did write a tune
for me, different title.

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:38.660
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh she did,
okay we'll have to get it.

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:43.990
Have you play that at some point.

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:46.720
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Yeah so Cape
Breton just kind of kept going.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:50.600
This is about the 20th anniversary
of my starting to go to Cape Breton

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:54.190
and for a while I was going
three or four times a year.

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:58.230
You know any time I could, it's
about a 700 mile or so drive

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:02.000
from my house, but
not a bad drive at all

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.360 position:56%
and I really can't remember the
number of times that I've done that.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:08.980
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So do you feel
part of that community now?

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.280
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I
hadn't gone for a couple

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.620
of years and went back last June.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.260
I was asked to be on the board

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:19.440 position:56%
of the Celtic Music Interpretive
Center that's on the honorary board.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:23.660 position:56%
And they were having a tenth year
anniversary and I went back for that

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.710
and felt very moved
by how connected.

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:29.870
I felt two people and how
people were reciprocal and one

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:35.150
of the biggest honors I think of
my career was - so it was a dinner

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.620
and sort of celebration
for the tenth anniversary

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:42.090
and then there was a concert
in the hall next to the center.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:46.120
One of the musicians who I
know fairly well got on stage

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:50.280
and thanked someone who was a big
donor who helped support the event

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:56.120
and thanked me and said that what I
had done was archive their culture,

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.600
which is not exactly
how I would say it

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.310
but it was something
I found really moving.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:05.660
And I'm hoping at some point that
those recordings will also end

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:09.170
up in a Cape Breton institution
along with coming here

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:14.460
and have talked to the interpretive
center and to special collections

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:19.540
at Cape Breton University
about that.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.680
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: What
are you working on now,

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.570
are you doing Cape
Breton stuff or are you -

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:26.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I don't think I'll
ever stop doing Cape Breton stuff,

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:28.870
although I don't have
anything particular going on.

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:34.440
I have an article that will be
a chapter in a book in progress.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.700
A book that's being edited by
a couple of Jeff Titans friends

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:43.630
and students not quite a fetch
rift but something to recognize him

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:46.120
about music and sustainability.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.420
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Much
like a fetch rift -

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.550
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: It's not
going to be identified as such

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:53.760
but where I talk about Cape Breton
and New Orleans in the same breath

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.400
as I am going to do here.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:59.690 position:56%
After Gary and I did the Cape Breton
book we said this is really a lot

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:05.220
of fun and it was kind of - sort
of targeted in a more focused way

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.350
than a lot of my other
things have been.

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:11.250
Let's do these interviews, do
these photographs and do a book.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:13.010
And we said let's try
something else.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:17.000
We kind of know how to do this now,
let's do another one and I said,

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.990
"Let's go to New Orleans".

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:22.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And why New Orleans?

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:27.080
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I had been
in New Orleans for something,

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.190
I think Juney, my partner
and I Juney Thomas

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:31.420
and I had gone maybe
for my birthday.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:34.290
I haven't been there for
years, since I was a teenager.

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:38.990
And we went to hear one of the
musicians that's always been a kind

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:42.540
of musical hero, Walter
Wolfman Washington.

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:43.840
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Oh really?

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:47.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Great sort of soul
and funk musician, just grabs me.

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:53.490
And we left and I said I'm
going to do something here,

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:54.940 position:56%
and I thought for a while I'd like -

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:57.210
I wonder if I could
write his life history.

00:43:57.210 --> 00:43:59.570
And then I thought I don't
know, I don't know him,

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:05.060
I don't know you know how
feasible a project that is.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.250
But that led me to think
"Well Gary and I do know how

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:11.390 position:56%
to do these interview and photograph
books, let's do one in New Orleans.

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:15.290
And Gary had never been to New
Orleans, and I thought to myself -

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:19.400
so I had this sort of deep
ethnographic engagement

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:25.280 position:56%
with Cape Breton, can I do something
almost more like a journalist would,

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.570
that is sort of set some
parameters with the goal

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:30.980
of producing something and do it.

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:36.270
And so for me it was an
experiment really and we did it.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:37.840
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And
that resulted in -

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.700
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: The book
Talking New Orleans Music,

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:43.630
which came out in 2015.

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:45.340
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Was your
research done before

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.960
or after or during Katrina?

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.260
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: After.

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.380
There's some conversation
about Katrina of course,

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:54.840
more or less depending
who I talked to.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:45:01.200
It's interviews with 11 musicians,
actually one of whom is not really

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.820
in New Orleans as much a
musician as a producer,

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:06.040
a guy named Scott Billington;
I don't know if you know Scott.

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:10.850
Scott is now Vice President
for ANR for Rounder,

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:14.360
but he produced all the Rounder
recordings from Louisiana,

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:19.290
but from New Orleans
and a lot the Cajun

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:21.290
and Coast stuff they did
too starting the 80's.

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:25.140
So I knew Walter Wolfman
Washington's music thanks

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.960
to Scott's production.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.490
And Scott was in those days
living in New Bridgeport,

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:33.850
Massachusetts half an hour from
me and had grown up in kind

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:36.290
of Boston Blues Revival scene,

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:38.990
a friend of Erica Brady's
our colleague.

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:42.490
And was actually a great interview
and kind of opened the door

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:44.800
to people like Erma Thomas for me.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Opened the door, did
he put you in touch with them or -

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:51.790
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: He gave me
Erma's personal email address

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:55.200 position:56%
and let me take it from there, yeah.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.400
Yeah that to me, too is a thrill
because I've always loved her music

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:02.540
and it was hard to get
to her, not because -

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:04.500
just because of her
schedule and mine.

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.430
In fact Gary and I decided
to make one last trip

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:10.330
to shoot some more photos
and do a little bit more work

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:14.910
and I emailed her once again saying
"I'm coming, this is the last time,

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:17.980
would it be possible at
all to do an interview?

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:22.970
And remember I'm Scott's friend"
and wherever we switched plans

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:24.900
as we were flying to New
Orleans, I checked my email

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:27.490
and there was an email from
her saying call my manager.

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:33.930
Her manager is her husband you
know, and so I called and I said

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:36.860
"This is me" and "Erma
said she'd do an interview"

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.110 position:56%
and you could tell they were sitting
watching television together.

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:42.850
And then her husband said, "Hey
did you say you'd do an interview

00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:46.340
with some guy" and she
said, "Yeah I guess".

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.630
And he said, "When do you want
to come" and I said "When's good"

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:50.130
and he said, "When's good"?

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:51.990
And we set it up and
went and did it.

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:57.600
And it was really last minute
and as I said a thrill.

00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:58.900
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So are you -

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:00.200
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: So
what am I doing now?

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.500
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Or what's next?

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.260
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I'm doing what
I think is probably the last

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:06.660
of these books that I think of
somewhere between scholarship

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:10.830
and art books, thanks to
the photographic part of it.

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:13.580
We had such a good
time in New Orleans,

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:17.150
we said let's try another one and
let's try it sort of on this model.

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:20.100
You know can we do it
without spending the rest

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.200
of my life making these trips.

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:25.410
And so we're doing a book that
we're calling Creole Soul,

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:28.590
which is about [Inaudible].

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:31.930
Working both in Texas
and in Louisiana.

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:35.630
An actually started in Texas
and I'm really convinced

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:38.880
that the Texas part is more
interesting and more vital

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.400
than Louisiana part, a lot
of people don't know that.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.630
Although there's a fine
book about Zytigo in Texas

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:46.930
by a guy named Roger Wood.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:53.350 position:56%
But what happened is a lot of Creole
people from South Louisiana moved

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:56.410
to East Texas for work, starting
in the early twentieth century

00:47:56.410 --> 00:48:01.510
and in more urban environments,
some of the urban stuff you hear

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:07.040
in Zytigo now developed more in
Texas than it did in Louisiana,

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:11.420
came back to Louisiana, yeah.

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:17.180
So that's been a lot of fun and we
were there - we were in Louisiana

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:20.820
for a week or so in March.

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.190
And getting close I think
we have enough interviews.

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:26.950
We may go back to do
some more photographs.

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:30.640
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You've done so much
field work and we've spent most

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.810
of this discussion so
far talking about that.

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:36.130
But could you talk a
little bit about what you --

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:37.760
you were the editor
of the American -

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.570
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: The
Journal of American Folklore -

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:40.870
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: For a while right?

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:44.510
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: From
1990 to 1995, yeah.

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:47.980
What do you want me to talk about?

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:49.280
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That
can be an overview

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.580
of the field in a different way.

00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:55.110
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Sure
of course it did.

00:48:55.110 --> 00:49:01.050
That was - so that
started in my second year

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:02.880
at the University of New Hampshire.

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.840
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And how
did - did you volunteer?

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.380
Did you volunteer or did
someone volunteer you for this?

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:10.820
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I think
it was that I was sort

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:14.150
of foolish enough to say yes.

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:16.340
Roger Abrahams asked me if
I would be interested in -

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:19.140
and Kenny Goldstein did -

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:21.200
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So they
were both your professors -

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.570
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Roger
had not been my professor.

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:24.070
I knew Roger - I knew
Roger a little bit.

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:26.400
Roger came to Penn years later.

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.630
Of course Roger had gotten
his degree from Penn too,

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:31.870
but that was long gone
by the time I got there.

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:38.110
So it's funny, I don't remember
entirely how this happened

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:41.760
but I was sort of taken aback
to be asked if I'd be interested

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:46.770
in doing it and I think it was that
I had invited Roger to give a talk

00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:48.270
at UNH in the early years.

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:51.610 position:56%
I tried to bring some folklorists
in and that just went by the wayside

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:53.960
as my budget changed and so forth.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:58.700
But we had Barbaga KG I remember
as well and I think maybe he asked.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:03.810
And my sense is in those
days there was less interest

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:07.140
in being democratic
than there is now.

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:10.110
I mean it was in some ways, in some
ways it doesn't seem that long ago

00:50:10.110 --> 00:50:13.770 position:56%
and in some ways it was quite a long
time ago in terms of how we think

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:19.010
about how to do things openly
and fairly it seems to me.

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:20.870
So I was asked if I
would be interested.

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:24.080
Probably there were other
people asked too, I don't know.

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:27.620
And I went to my dean who in
those days was a very sort

00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:29.430 position:56%
of powerful figure at the university

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:31.740
and things were going
fairly well financial.

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:34.910
And he offered the
support that I would need

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:38.690
and I said, "Okay" and it happened.

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:43.700
Toward the end of my time I got
asked if I would be interested

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:50.930
in re-enlisting for five years
and I said no, and I realized

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:55.630
that my ego had said yes
and for the 1990-1995 term,

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:58.120
but my common sense
caught up with me during

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:01.490
that time - it was a lot of work.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:06.350
But you know I think we did some
things that made a difference.

00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:09.880
We did that key words issue,
the body [Inaudible] issue.

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:14.570
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Was that the one
you worked on with Michael Taft?

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:17.880
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: No this was the
one called Common Ground that led

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:24.310
to the Eight Words for the Study
of Expressive Culture book.

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:29.620
That was first a special issue
and in fact, the Illinois,

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.490
the press had to be convinced
that there was a reason

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:37.460
to do a book version because why
don't people just read the journal?

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:41.960
Yeah, and so that turned out to be
a pretty influential publication

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.880
and you know it was a
really interesting time.

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:49.230 position:56%
For me I said early on that had I
know differently I might have become

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:50.730
an ethnomusicologist.

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:54.580
Started graduate school I
was astonished at the range

00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:55.980
of interests other students had.

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.100
I thought we'd all be there
just talking about ballads

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:02.240
or something I guess, as having
been the student of Sam Bayard.

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:05.470
But here were these people
interested in myth and other forms

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:07.480 position:56%
of narrative and all sorts of stuff.

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:12.090
I had very little idea of
the breadth of the field,

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:13.900
and of course this was
years later but working

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:16.300
in the journal too it
certainly exposed me to that

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.200
and you know interesting
and exciting ways.

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.510
And then it became hard work.

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:22.800
I was thinking about the other day,

00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.200
this was the beginning
of email for instance.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:28.670
We were doing things by
fax and mail and so forth

00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:31.590
and I was worried it was
kind of transitional moment.

00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:35.710
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Amazingly
survived without emails

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:38.210
or computers when you started?

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:39.510
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Yes.

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:40.810
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Did you -

00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:43.800
you probably did your
dissertation on a typewriter?

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.170
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Well you paid
someone or convinced someone

00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:54.100 position:56%
to type it for you in those days but
it was done on a typewriter, sure.

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:57.790
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And you are also
I should mention just as part

00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:02.760
of the interview that you were -
was it in 2012 you became a fellow

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.100
of the American Folklore Society?

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:05.400
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I don't
remember what year it was,

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.120
but it was fairly recently, yeah.

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:11.690
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That gives you more
status in the meetings immediately.

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:17.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: I haven't noticed.

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:23.820
Nope, the fellows do a breakfast
for graduate students and they -

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:28.160
I think they find new fellows
who are the suckers who will get

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:31.060
up early in the morning and go sit
at a table with graduate students.

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:34.290
It's a nice event and the
fellows also do a reception

00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:35.590
for graduate students.

00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:36.900
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: That's true.

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:39.540
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: The ones I've
been to have been very nice events.

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:42.310
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: And the membership
has expanded and broadened too.

00:53:42.310 --> 00:53:44.630
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Well there's
some of us pushing for that,

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:47.730
it still needs to go
quite a ways I think,

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:53.860
but at least I think more
people understand why it should

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:59.120
as does the society itself
with its own membership.

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.730
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Now what part
of your career have I not talked

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:03.620
about and not asked you about?

00:54:03.620 --> 00:54:05.400
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Well one thing,
I don't know if I've mentioned this

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:09.840
as I've talked to Todd in the
library about field work material

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:13.730
that I'll be compiling and giving.

00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:18.120
The first field work I actually
did was in British Columbia

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:23.870
in my first summer after my
first year in graduate school.

00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:28.430
I got a grant that I
think channeled what was

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:33.440
in the Canadian folk music
society that this was a time

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:37.270 position:56%
when Canada was thinking a lot
about multi-culturism and developing

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:39.740
that notion of a mosaic
of cultures rather

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:42.470
than the melting pot
metaphor we're using here.

00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:45.490
And they're interested in having
someone do some fieldwork having

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:49.370
to do with bilingual
community in British Columbia,

00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:51.120
how that happened I
don't really know.

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:55.530
It's where those funds came
from, why that decision was made.

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:59.830
But I was encourage by
Kenny I think and helped

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:01.840
in my proposal writing by Dan.

00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:05.380
Wrote a proposal, got the
grants spent this summer.

00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:09.980
I could have been just kind of
blindly looking for something to do

00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:13.980
in British Columbia
but by luck ended

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:19.870
up in a failed finished
Utopian community on an island

00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:22.310
between the northern
part of Vancouver Island

00:55:22.310 --> 00:55:26.630
and the British Columbia
mainland, a place called Sointulla

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:30.400
which in Finnish means harmony,
which has been established

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:35.420
around 1900, by Finnish
immigrants from Western Canada

00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:37.710
and the upper Midwest to the US.

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:40.870
Many of whom had been
agricultural people in Finland,

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:45.750
but ended up logging or mining and
doing things they found unpleasant.

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:51.040
And brought over a kind of fiery
socialist leader from Finland

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:54.210
who led them in creating a
community on this island,

00:55:54.210 --> 00:55:57.320
which for a time the Canadian
government gave to them

00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:01.040
and became kind of extra
territorial, not part of Canada.

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:03.740
It failed as a Utopian
community in part

00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:07.530
because it wasn't suitable
for agriculture.

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:11.830
And people went back into
mostly fishing and some logging.

00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:16.240 position:56%
But at that point, this would have
been summer of 72, 500 people living

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:22.170
in this beautiful spot in a very
kind of rugged part of Canada

00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:25.100
in those days, very
hard to get to there.

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:31.090
And in the summer men would
go out fishing, come back in

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:33.190
and somebody would
have a music party.

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:37.030
And I was there recording
music and talking to people

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:40.640
and did a little bit of writing
about that, so I have that material

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:45.420 position:56%
as well and it was you know, an odd
thing because I don't speak Finnish.

00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:50.470
And Alli Congess Miranda did a
little bit of translation for me

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:54.610
for something, I don't really
remember what some time after maybe

00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:57.750
as I was writing my final report
for my grant or something,

00:56:57.750 --> 00:57:01.420
but that was a marvelous
experience in beginning

00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:05.020
to understand what field work was.

00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:10.900
Again that was after a
year of graduate school.

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:12.680
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Interesting.

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:17.980
Maybe Todd Harvey is
sitting in on this.

00:57:17.980 --> 00:57:23.230
Is there any questions you have?

00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:31.540
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: You talked
about using the Nagra recorder,

00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:35.830
talk about other gear that
you favored [Inaudible].

00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:38.690
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Yeah
I used all kinds of -

00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:42.120
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: So we had a
question from Todd Harvey who is

00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:49.360
on the side here, who is one of
our archivists and he wants -

00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:52.480
he was curious about the gear
you use both in North Umberland

00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:56.290
and in your other field
work collections?

00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:59.130
You borrowed a nagra from
the library at one point.

00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:01.680
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Yeah I was
very lucky in that you know

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:06.860
in those days this being
around '75, '76 the library,

00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:14.100
the Folk Life Center had a
program lending out nagras and I -

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:17.710
Bruce Green and I had gotten
the grant to do that piece

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:22.460
that I had mentioned to you that
involves some new field recording.

00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:27.510
And I asked if I could borrow
a machine and it so happened

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:30.960
that Carl Fleishauer
was lucky enough

00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:34.730 position:56%
to see [Inaudible] I think picking
one up some place that maybe someone

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:36.030
in Tennessee was using it.

00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:40.060
It was going to be coming - it
was in the area and it worked

00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:44.010
out that he could both drop one off
for me in Bowling Green, Kentucky

00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:46.410
and also teach me how to use it.

00:58:46.410 --> 00:58:52.530
And that was really my first
experience you know thinking

00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:54.280
about recording well.

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.850
A little bit from Kenny.

00:58:55.850 --> 00:58:59.170
When I'd gone to British
Columbia he'd loaned me one

00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:01.090
of those little five inch Sony,

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:04.610
I forget what they were a little
five inch reel to reel recorders,

00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:08.320
battery operated recorders
that Sony had out,

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:11.370
that was his own machine
and he had loaned me.

00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:16.170
I had the nagra for a while
and a few other things

00:59:16.170 --> 00:59:18.540
with it, not just that recording.

00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:23.650
But of course it went back
to the library to my dismay.

00:59:23.650 --> 00:59:27.120
And then of course what do you
do on a more limited budget

00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:34.290
when you can't afford a nagra 4S
and convince the program at Western

00:59:34.290 --> 00:59:36.420
to buy a couple of viewers -

00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:38.160
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yeah.

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.270
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: And use those

00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:48.190
and then hire quality cassette
recording became possible, the -

00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:53.800
was it Sony TCD5M, does
that sound right to you?

00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:57.280
It was a little metal cassette
recorder that people we reusing

00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:02.360
for at least broadcast
quality, so I had one of those.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.920
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You were using
it with two external mics?

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:06.740
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: External
mics, yeah, I had some kind

01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.240
of [Inaudible] in those days.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:18.220 position:56%
As I left there and went to New
Hampshire I acquired a dat recorder.

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:23.650 position:56%
I did a little bit on mini disk too.

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:28.910
The North Umbrian stuff because
of issues of portability some

01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:33.590
of that was done on that - the
Sony D5M or whatever it was

01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:38.340 position:56%
and then later a Walkman Pro I think
they were called, audio cassettes.

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:44.070
We've all seen these things if
we've been around long enough.

01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:51.370
More recently I've done some one
bit recording on a Corg MR1000.

01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:55.060
I don't know if you're
familiar with those here.

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:58.450
They never really caught
on very much,

01:00:58.450 --> 01:01:02.090
but they're very high
quality recorders,

01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:04.730
one that I bought for myself.

01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:12.320
But traveling to - on airplanes
the bigger stuff is a bother,

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:19.140
and so I started using a Task M
DR40, which I despite actually.

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:25.590
And finally in recent years bought
a Zoom H5N or whatever it is,

01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:30.980
which is to me a superior
machine, just easier to work

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:34.140
and less prone to screw ups.

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:37.960
I've kind of used a lot
of media over the years.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.010
I still have the dat
recorder if I ever need

01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:42.400
to play anything, assuming
it will play.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.120
Although I had no problems
with dats.

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.490
I know they're notoriously -

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:48.550
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Unstable.

01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:49.850
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Difficult.

01:01:49.850 --> 01:01:52.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: You've done most of
your field recording has been audio?

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:54.100
Or have you also done video?

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:55.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Very little video.

01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:59.470
You know I recorded a - I
did a little bit of video

01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:05.120 position:56%
on Sony Portapack in my graduate
school days, which was a bulky black

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.990
and white thing that
recorded on reels

01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:09.880
and I don't know what
happened to that material.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.890
Speaking of not knowing whatever
happened to that material.

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:15.500
When I got back from - I'm
jumping around, but when I got back

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:22.740 position:56%
from studying abroad in England, all
charged up I got asked at Penn State

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:26.100
by the person who ran the so
called Artisan Lecture Series,

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.450
which was a very big
attraction for students

01:02:28.450 --> 01:02:34.100
to help produce a folk festival
at Penn State and we brought in -

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:37.490
and the resources seemed unlimited,
you know in those days and I said,

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:40.180
"Let's bring in all these
people" and it ranged

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:43.860
from bringing the Balfa Brothers
and Mississippi Fred McDowell

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:47.360
to bringing big revival
acts like Joan Baez

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:52.380 position:56%
and the High level ranters were flew
in from England and Al Anderson sort

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:54.310
of credits me with
getting his career started;

01:02:54.310 --> 01:02:58.760
it was his first trip
to the US and in

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:03.800
that time I interviewed Fred
McDowell just because he was there

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:08.030
and I had this vague sort
of sense that's what you do,

01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:11.030
and I don't know whatever
happened to that recording.

01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:16.720
Likewise when I was in Durham
I - there was a local group

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.490
of young guys playing regional
music and I borrowed a recorder

01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:23.930
and recorded them, one of those
people was Dave Richardson who went

01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:29.130
on to Boys of - yeah,
who I've known for years.

01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:33.910
I haven't seen for years; so in
a sense I was doing field work

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:36.850
in the dark and I don't
know what happened

01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:39.920
to those several recordings.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.610
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Things turned out -

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:48.100
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Those
I don't think will.

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:52.190
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Well we
can - this has been great.

01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:53.490
Thank you so much for coming in.

01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:54.900
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Thanks
for doing this.

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:56.270
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: We
might do a follow up.

01:03:56.270 --> 01:04:00.620
We won't have a chance to
look at your material -

01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:04.190
but for right now this has
been really interesting;

01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:05.490
so thank you so much.

01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:06.790
&gt;&gt; Burt Feintuch: Thank you.

01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:10.300
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
