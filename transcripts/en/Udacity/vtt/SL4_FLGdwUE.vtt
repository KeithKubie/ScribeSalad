00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.340
Excellent job so far.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.750
I really hope you're excited about the new tricks that you've learned.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.050
For this quiz, I want you to use the .each method to add the number of

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.620
characters held inside these p tags to the end of them.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.600
In other words, a number should appear at the end of

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.558
the p tag indicating the number of characters inside it.

00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:26.020
The .each method let's you iterate through a jQuery collection and

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.550
run a function, like so, against each DOM element.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.400
It's kind of like a super awesome for loop that iterates over your elements.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.270
I'll give you a hint.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.410
If you want to use any of the jQuery methods on a DOM element

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.560
within the function that you pass in, you'll need

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.860
to use the $(this) selector to get that current element within your loop.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.350
Without reselecting using the jQuery object, the keyword this simply refers to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.488
the DOM element itself without all of jQuery's additional functionality.

00:00:58.488 --> 00:01:04.040
For instance, $(this).text inside of an each loop will

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.610
return the text of each element as each iterates through the jQuery collection.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.100
Take a look at the documentation for .each and add some numbers to your page.
