00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.940
As with most legal matters, answering the
question of what exactly happens when a person

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.620
is accidentally declared dead varies from
country to country, although, curiously, from

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.190
our research, with some exceptions like a
few instances we found in Canada particularly,

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.510
it seems as if the United States is one of
the few countries where the aftermath of this

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.350
can be long term devastating to the unlucky
individual, even after they get declared alive

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.350
again.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.260
But to start with, how exactly does one actually
get accidentally declared dead in the first

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.260
place?

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.020
It turns out in pretty much every nation,
most of the time simply via clerical error.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.530
In modern times, this usually just means a
typo or the like.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.790
So, yes, particularly for you U.S. citizens
reading this, just go ahead and think about

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.990
that your life could be ruined, or at least
a good portion of it, by a simple typo made

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.880
by some random person at any given moment…

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.860
On that note, although exact figures are hard
to come by, it’s estimated by the Social

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.710
Security Administration that in the US some
seven to fourteen thousand people are accidentally

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.660
declared dead each year.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.320
Numbers from other nations were seemingly
impossible to come by, but we did at least

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:37.459
dig out that in Canada from 2007-2013 they
had approximately 5500 people accidentally

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.709
declared dead, or an average of about 900
people per year.

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.590
Given that the United States has approximately
nine times as many people as Canada, this

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.709
would put the equivalent number at about 8,000
people per year, so right inline with the

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.220
low end estimate of the United States’ numbers.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.840
Alright, so a misplaced finger by some worker
at a funeral home, hospital, etc. has now

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.160
accidentally killed you as far as the government
is concerned.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.170
How do you fix it?

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.730
It turns out correcting such a mistake pretty
much everywhere we looked at, in theory, is

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.510
as simple as walking into the appropriate
government office and letting the fact that

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.570
you just walked into a government office speak
for itself, after of course you provide sufficient

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.010
identification to prove you are who you say
you are.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.200
For example, in the United States you just
need to visit your local Social Security Administration

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.709
office with one piece of appropriate picture
ID, such as a driver’s license, passport,

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.630
etc. and inform them of the mistake in their
records.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.480
And, indeed, in reports of this happening
to people in several different nations we

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.500
looked at, this seems to more or less clear
the matter up within a few weeks at most.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.230
Certainly this few weeks can be a bit traumatizing
and make things difficult in a variety of

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.370
ways, as we’ll get into, but it’s more
of a blip, outside of some isolated reports

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.370
from Canada, where for some people the ordeal
dragged on for months, and some not so isolated

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.370
reports from the U.S.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.100
In fact, the most outrageous report we could
find from Sweden, for example, simply noted

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.940
that the 47 year old Swedish woman was inconvenienced
by having to spend several hours unblocking

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.370
various accounts after the government agency
dutifully apologized for the mistake and had

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.810
it corrected in their system.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.080
For her trouble, she was awarded 20,500 kronors
(about $2,200).

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.850
Then there’s the United States… owing
to a quirk of the way the Death Master file

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.510
works and the way various entities use it,
as well as previous to a few years ago the

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.139
fact that this file was available to anyone
who wanted to buy it, let’s just say things

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.350
are a bit more complicated, even though getting
declared alive again is actually relatively

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.639
straightforward as described.

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.680
But before we go any further, we should probably
talk about what this Death Master file actually

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.750
is.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.530
Various nations have their own ways of tracking
this and rules and regulations governing such

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.900
a dataset, but it mostly just comes down to
a file maintained by some branch of the government

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.950
that gets names added to it via reports from
various groups or people about a death.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.010
In Britain, for instance, a name can be added
by anyone simply by going to the appropriate

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.110
government website and noting a death, as
well as providing appropriate proof of death,

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.430
such as a copy of a death certificate.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.820
Other sources that don’t necessarily have
to include proof of death include reports

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.300
from places like funeral homes, hospitals,
and other such institutions.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.020
As you can imagine from all this, there is
more than a little room for accidental error

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.541
here, given the wide variety of sources this
information is being collated from, and with

00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:14.419
little in the way of verification occurring
as to the accuracy of everything coming in.

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.230
In essence, these types of systems are fairly
rife for an occasional typo to pop up and

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.290
for no one to notice until the accidentally
declared dead person themselves find out,

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.380
often in traumatic fashion.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.420
This all brings us around to the United States’
Social Security Administration Death Master

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.420
file.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.919
It turns out this was never meant to be used
as a definitive record for deaths.

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.730
It was originally put in place in 1936 as
a way for the Social Security Administration

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.919
to help make sure they weren’t paying out
benefits to people no longer alive and for

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:44.340
other use internally.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.250
In fact, the Social Security Administration
explicitly notes that this data should NOT

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:54.289
be used as a definitive record of who is alive
or dead in the United States.

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:59.370
As the Inspector General of the Social Security
Administration in 2015, Patrick P. O’Carroll,

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.620
Jr., stated before Congress, “SSA does not
receive death information for all individuals,

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.620
thus SSA does not guarantee the [Death Master
File’s] completeness.”

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.949
Nevertheless, as with the Social Security
number itself, this eventually got coopted

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:17.160
by various groups who needed a reasonably
accurate dataset of who was alive and who

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.190
was not.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:24.340
This all brings us around to why being accidentally
declared dead can be so devastating to an

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.340
individual.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.569
It turns out that this data is used by many
companies, most pertinent to the topic at

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:34.080
hand being financial institutions and agencies
doling out various benefits, like retirement

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.259
and the like.

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.509
Once the death database is updated, this information
percolates out to all of these institutions

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:40.509
automatically.

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:44.721
And then, even worse, from there percolates
out to other institutions who don’t use

00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:49.780
the Death Master file directly, but buy or
share information from institutions that do.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.289
So, to begin with, upon “death” all government
benefits you may have been entitled to from

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.840
Social Security to a government pension will
be stopped.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.740
While this may or may not be an immediate
problem for a given person, it turns out that

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.210
as soon as you’re declared dead, it’s
entirely possible that your bank accounts,

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.110
credit cards, and the like will get frozen
and any attempts to retrieve money from them

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.550
by you will be flagged as fraud.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.389
Depending on the institution, there may or
may not be issues accessing any joint account

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:16.009
you hold as well.

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:19.810
On top of this, upon notification of the passing,
everyone you owe money to will suddenly be

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.699
able to claim that money from your estate,
and even potentially do so when their systems

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:22.699
find out you’re dead… because apparently
even being dead isn’t a good enough excuse

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:23.699
to stop paying back your student loans.

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:24.699
On the plus side, if you’re married at the
time you’re accidentally declared dead,

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:28.120
your spouse or whoever you named as a beneficiary
on such a plan will be eligible to claim any

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.889
life insurance policy you have in place.

00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:34.370
Unfortunately, this is money they will later
be expected to pay back once you’re proved

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.370
to be alive.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.930
So not a great perk.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.410
Being dead, of course, you can also expect
that you may end up losing your job as it’s

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.880
kind of hard to employ a dead person officially,
turns out.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.770
On that note, you’ll also find it exceptionally
difficult to find work during your time as

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:48.849
a legally dead person.

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:52.240
At best, you’ll have to work for cash under
the table.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.250
And it’s important to note in all of this,
it’s not uncommon at all for you to be suspected

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.990
of identity theft and possibly even get arrested,
which will also come with its own host of

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.969
problems when the police try to enter your
details into their system to process you.

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:10.191
Speaking of being arrested for stealing your
own identity, from 1980 to 2013 thanks to

00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:14.470
a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, the
Death Master File in the U.S. was publicly

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.860
accessible to anyone who wanted to pay the
fee to the Department of Commerce’s National

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.080
Technical Information Service (NTIS).

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.479
This file includes the person’s name, date
of birth, date of death, social security number,

00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:29.889
whether death is verified or a death certificate
documented, and, up until 2011, also included

00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:34.030
the last known zip code, and zip code where
any death benefit was sent.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.990
This made it all ridiculously easy for actual
identify thieves to work their magic and try

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:42.039
to get away with all sorts of shenanigans
in your name, with the immediate few week

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.700
window directly after you’re declared dead
being highly targeted as not every system,

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.570
and maybe not even you yourself, at this point
may be aware you’ve been declared dead.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:53.131
Thus, if you were one of those unlucky individuals,
when you once again get declared alive again,

00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:56.100
officially, you then got the reward of having
to deal with whatever the identify thief managed

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.660
to do with your good name while you were dead.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:02.670
Today, in an attempt to stop the identify
theft problem for the dead or accidentally

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.810
declared dead, only approved institutions
have immediate access to the current Death

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.020
Master file, with a three year waiting period
before the wider public’s copy of the file

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.150
will show a given person’s death, though
for various other reasons identify theft of

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.150
the recently deceased is still a major problem.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.100
This brings us around to another systemic
problem with the way the system works in the

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.550
U.S.- the way the file is updated, or not
in some cases.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:23.080
The version of the Death Master File that
is downloadable is updated weekly, but only

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.180
the last six revisions can be downloaded directly
and if you want to go any further back than

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.930
that for the full list, you have to order
a copy loaded onto a CD.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.330
The problem here is that if the institution
updates irregularly, they might completely

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:39.180
miss the revision that you were actually declared
alive again, with this marked in the file

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.880
with a “D” indicating your record should
be deleted from any copies of the database

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.130
stored by these various institutions.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.800
Miss that revision and your name will remain
in these systems’ databases.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.650
On top of that, many institutions that don’t
use the Death Master File do buy and share

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:58.860
such information from other institutions,
who may for a time have the erroneous information.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.170
Thus, it may simply be up to you in all these
types of cases to prove to them you’re once

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.630
again alive, officially.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.710
And, again, do expect when you’re doing
so that they’ll suspect you of being an

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.780
identify thief because of how relatively common
identity theft of the dead is.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.310
Also, even if you do manage to convince the
world you’re alive, there’s always the

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:20.521
chance that someone, somewhere will get their
hands on an outdated version of the Death

00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:26.210
Master File and accidentally kill you again
in whatever system they use, which in turn

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.400
might get shared around even further, even
potentially to institutions you already proved

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.910
you were alive to, but now may have to do
it again.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:38.590
For some people who’ve had this happen,
they note it can be like a game of Wac-o-mole

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:39.960
for sometimes several years later.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.270
To be fair, it’s noted that, much like in
most countries we looked at, once you’ve

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:48.310
satisfactory proven to the Social Security
Administration you’re indeed still alive,

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:53.280
it generally takes only a few weeks at most
to fix in their database, though there are

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.840
exceptions where it sometimes takes a lot
longer.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.840
Further, the Social Security Administration
will then issue you with an “erroneous death

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.901
case — third party contact” which you
can use as proof of you not actually being

00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:06.570
dead and not being an identify thief when
dealing with banks, hospitals or any other

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:07.570
service or person that currently believes
you’re not alive.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:08.570
Sometimes even this isn’t enough though
and some financial institution especially

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.570
are still noted as being difficult to convince
that you’re not a zombie- again, real identify

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.160
thieves are rather good at forging things,
leading some institutions to be skeptical.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.730
If this happens, you’re advised to contact
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.170
speak to the institution on your behalf.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.280
Alternatively, you can always contact your
“local congressional representative‘s

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.640
constituent services office” if you want
to circumvent all the red tape and have the

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.010
problem addressed directly, though your mileage
may vary with this particular avenue.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:35.540
As for how long it take to correct the mistake
in the U.S., there’s no definitive answer

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.900
but, again, there are documented cases of
people fighting with various institutions

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.889
for years to prove they’re alive and there
are examples of people dying in real life

00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:43.889
before they were able to fully correct the
mistake.

00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:47.090
A notable case is that of Judy Rivers who
spent seven years dealing with the ramifications

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:50.970
of being accidentally declared dead, during
which this woman who formerly had over $80,000

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.850
in her bank account alone, along with a rather
good career at the time, upon being declared

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:59.170
dead became financially destitute, lost her
job and house, among other things.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:03.000
In her own words to the Senate Committee on
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.770
who were looking into ways in which the system
might be fixed:

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:10.191
I could never have imagined I would reach
the point of hopelessness, homelessness, loss

00:12:10.191 --> 00:12:15.390
of reputation and credibility, unable to obtain
a job, an apartment, a student loan, or even

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.690
a cell phone.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:21.420
Suspected as an identity thief by nearly every
apartment manager or Human Resource Director

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.670
I encountered became a way of life.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:28.160
Each time I got into my car I was panic stricken
that the police would stop me and I would

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.140
have to try and prove my identity.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.600
Another example is that of retired army drill
sergeant Jerry Miller who was accidentally

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.020
declared dead four times, each time resulting
in him having his veteran’s benefits and

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.350
government pension stopped.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:43.690
And, no, he wasn’t the random victim of
an unfortunate typo four times in a row to

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:44.690
the Social Security Administration.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:45.690
That just happened once.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.060
His case was one of those where an old copy
of the Death Master File was being passed

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:52.890
around and simply just kept getting him declared
dead again by the U.S. Department of Veterans

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:53.890
Affairs.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.680
Each time he’d prove he was still alive
and it would be fine for a while, until he’d

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.470
once again find himself declared dead by them.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.810
Miller almost lost his house, suffered failing
health when he was unable to get needed prescriptions

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:07.320
and received a letter asking him to pay back
around $94,000 dollars worth of benefit cheques

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.000
he’d supposedly fraudulently cashed while
previously being “dead”.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.700
Of course, he was very much alive and entitled
to those cheques but was now in a bit of legal

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.120
hot water over the matter.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.220
Perhaps the most bizarre story of all though
is that of Donald Miller Jr whose request

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.170
to be declared legally alive was turned down
by a judge.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.900
This one was not, however, a case of a typo,
but rather a case of a disappearance.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:33.910
In a nutshell, Miller disappeared from his
Ohio home sometime in 1994.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:38.220
After an investigation, Miller was declared
dead in absentia, his life insurance policy

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.260
was paid out and his Social Security number
retired.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:45.900
In 2005 Miller resurfaced and revealed that
he’d fled because he owed around $26,000

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.270
in child support to his ex-wife that he couldn’t
afford.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.820
Unaware he’d “died”, Miller tried to
have the decision overturned so that he could

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:57.210
get a driver’s license after having got
his life back together only to have the decision

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:58.510
challenged by his ex-wife.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:02.310
It would later turn out that Miller’s ex-wife
couldn’t afford to pay back the life insurance

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:06.220
settlement she’d received as a result of
his death and that him staying “dead”

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.030
would allow her to avoid doing so.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:12.150
When the case got to court, because of various
quirks of the law, a judge was forced to rule

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:16.750
that Miller had left it too long to challenge
the decision, despite his contention that

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.470
he didn’t know he’d died.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:23.050
So, yes, the judge in this case, knowing Miller
was who he claimed to be and was literally

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.700
standing in front of him, declared him legally
dead anyway.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:32.020
So yeah, in short, if you live anywhere and
are accidentally declared dead by your government,

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:36.060
expect the next month or two to be a bit of
a living hell, but as far as we can find,

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.450
this usually gets cleared up pretty quickly,
with exceptions.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.932
But if you live in the United States, just
because of some quirks about how the system

00:14:41.932 --> 00:14:46.810
works there, as one Liz Weston of the Denver
Post aptly noted, “If the Social Security

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:58.630
Administration thinks you’re dead, you might
wish you were.”
