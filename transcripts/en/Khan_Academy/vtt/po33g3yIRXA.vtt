00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.724
- [Voiceover] In our last video,

00:00:01.724 --> 00:00:03.930
we started looking at this speech by

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.577
Franklin Delano Roosevelt which he gave

00:00:06.577 --> 00:00:10.687
at his innaguration in March of 1933.

00:00:10.687 --> 00:00:13.520
We took some time to just identify what

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.052
was happening in this speech

00:00:15.052 --> 00:00:17.049
and also the context of this speech,

00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:19.371
coming at the height of
the Great Depression.

00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:23.017
- [Voiceover] Now we're gonna
dive deeper into our textual

00:00:23.017 --> 00:00:26.291
analysis and explore the soucre,

00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:28.172
figure out what is going on

00:00:28.172 --> 00:00:29.983
with Roosevelt's language
and what he's trying to say

00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:32.792
and what his biases are.

00:00:32.792 --> 00:00:35.997
- [Voiceover] Let's get a
little more into what else goes

00:00:35.997 --> 00:00:37.738
on in this speech, not just the very

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:40.176
famous opening paragraph.

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:44.170
We start here with
saying people are facing

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.446
the grim problem of existence,

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:49.580
and a foolish optimist can
deny the dark realities

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.065
of the moment, and

00:00:52.065 --> 00:00:53.342
then what comes next?

00:00:53.342 --> 00:00:55.084
- [Voiceover] Let's hear
all this in context.

00:00:55.084 --> 00:00:58.961
Yet our distress comes from
no failure of substance.

00:00:58.961 --> 00:01:01.121
We are stricken by no plague of locusts,

00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:04.209
compared with the perils which
our forefathers conquered,

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.533
because they believed and were not afraid,

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.274
we still have much to be thankful for.

00:01:07.274 --> 00:01:08.946
Nature still offers her bounty and human

00:01:08.946 --> 00:01:10.525
efforts have multiplied.

00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:11.616
Plenty is at our doorstep,

00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:13.451
but a generous use of it languishes

00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:15.285
in the very sight of the supply.

00:01:15.285 --> 00:01:16.980
Primarily this is because the rulers

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.186
of the exchange of
mankind's goods have failed

00:01:19.186 --> 00:01:21.949
through their own stubbornness
and their own incompetence.

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:23.059
Having admitted their failure

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:26.449
and abdicated, practices of
the unscrupulous money changers

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:28.608
stand indicted in the
court of public opinion,

00:01:28.608 --> 00:01:31.975
rejected by the hearts and minds of man.

00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:33.554
Restoration calls however,

00:01:33.554 --> 00:01:35.156
not for changes in ethics alone.

00:01:35.156 --> 00:01:38.036
This nation asks for
action and action now.

00:01:38.036 --> 00:01:40.729
What's interesting about this paragraph

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.516
is that there's a lot of Bible stuff going

00:01:43.516 --> 00:01:44.909
on in here.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.393
There's a lot of biblical references

00:01:47.393 --> 00:01:49.831
that serve to do I think a lot of work

00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:53.245
for Roosevelt in this inaugural address.

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:55.218
- [Voiceover] As you talked,
I just underlined the things

00:01:55.218 --> 00:01:57.564
that really stood out
to me as maybe kind of

00:01:57.564 --> 00:01:59.166
the heart of what he was saying,

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.697
and you're saying these are
like Biblical references.

00:02:01.697 --> 00:02:02.765
What do you mean by that?

00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:03.717
- [Voiceover] Some of them are.

00:02:03.717 --> 00:02:05.621
When we're talking about plague of locusts

00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:07.432
and money changers specifically,

00:02:07.432 --> 00:02:10.753
we're looking at old and
new testament references

00:02:10.753 --> 00:02:12.750
respectively, in fact,
later in this speech,

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.441
he refers to money changers
being chased out of our nation's

00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:20.110
temple which is a deliberate
reference to the New Testament.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.593
- [Voiceover] This is very grand.

00:02:23.593 --> 00:02:26.147
We love to hear this speech so much,

00:02:26.147 --> 00:02:28.168
because it has that kind of ringing

00:02:28.168 --> 00:02:30.164
of authenticity in a way that maybe

00:02:30.164 --> 00:02:32.324
a modern speech does not.

00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:34.019
- [Voiceover] Some of
that authenticity comes

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.804
through association with ethic literature

00:02:37.804 --> 00:02:39.197
and the Bible.

00:02:39.197 --> 00:02:41.844
He's making these illusions
to great Biblical events.

00:02:41.844 --> 00:02:44.793
Like the plague of locusts
being visited upon Egypt

00:02:44.793 --> 00:02:47.208
which was like a great
and terrible plague,

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:49.460
and he's using that as a counter point

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.384
to the misery of the present moment.

00:02:53.384 --> 00:02:54.522
He's saying, look,

00:02:54.522 --> 00:02:55.823
things could be worse.

00:02:55.823 --> 00:02:57.866
We could be ancient Egypt in the Bible,

00:02:57.866 --> 00:03:00.699
and locusts could be
eating all of our crops.

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.324
Things are bad, but it's not like

00:03:02.324 --> 00:03:05.714
God himself is willing
destruction upon us.

00:03:05.714 --> 00:03:07.502
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I think this is also

00:03:07.502 --> 00:03:09.360
another one of the
really interesting things

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.799
about the great depression.

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.586
It's true that there were farm failures

00:03:13.586 --> 00:03:17.464
during the dust bowl,
but on the whole it's

00:03:17.464 --> 00:03:19.739
not like people stopped producing food.

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.039
This wasn't a famine.

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:23.408
What it was was a crisis
of confidence where

00:03:23.408 --> 00:03:26.589
prices went down significantly,

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:30.026
and so farmers could not
make a living on their crops.

00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:31.721
It's not that they didn't have food.

00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:33.067
It's that they didn't have money,

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:35.552
and I also feel like there's a different

00:03:35.552 --> 00:03:39.197
aspect to the reason that
he uses this biblical

00:03:39.197 --> 00:03:40.660
language here, and I think that's because

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.518
it's very authoritative.

00:03:42.518 --> 00:03:45.606
When you stand up in
front of a group of people

00:03:45.606 --> 00:03:48.903
and Roosevelt has this powerful voice

00:03:48.903 --> 00:03:51.202
which really resonates with people,

00:03:51.202 --> 00:03:53.849
and you speak like a preacher would speak.

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.007
It says, this is a man of authority.

00:03:57.007 --> 00:03:59.956
This is a man who perhaps
is in touch with the moral

00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:02.928
authority associated
with the Christian Bible.

00:04:02.928 --> 00:04:05.273
- [Voiceover] Sure, for a very long time,

00:04:05.273 --> 00:04:08.222
authority was kind of
correlated with your ability

00:04:08.222 --> 00:04:09.592
to quote chapter and verse.

00:04:09.592 --> 00:04:11.032
I mean we're talking
about a man who is just

00:04:11.032 --> 00:04:12.959
put his hand on a Bible in order to

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.537
swear himself in.

00:04:15.537 --> 00:04:17.464
- [Voiceover] It really makes him seem

00:04:17.464 --> 00:04:19.670
not only like he knows
what he's talking about,

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.549
but also that he's got a
handle on the situation.

00:04:22.549 --> 00:04:25.196
- [Voiceover] What we're
saying that by harnessing

00:04:25.196 --> 00:04:27.402
the language, he's trying
to harness the authority

00:04:27.402 --> 00:04:29.167
that people have invested

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:31.837
in the church by using the
language of the church.

00:04:31.837 --> 00:04:32.905
- [Voiceover] What we're doing here,

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:37.224
I might call step three
which is to identify

00:04:37.224 --> 00:04:40.800
how an argument is made.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.800
We're looking at his rhetorical strategies

00:04:48.602 --> 00:04:52.410
and seeing how they're
effective or in perhaps

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.450
another case, not effective
in conveying his opinion,

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.402
and I say opinion.

00:04:57.402 --> 00:05:00.816
At this point, what would
we say that his opinion of

00:05:00.816 --> 00:05:02.812
the Great Depression is?

00:05:02.812 --> 00:05:05.297
- [Voiceover] That it's
specific people's fault,

00:05:05.297 --> 00:05:07.178
that it is at the fault of not just this

00:05:07.178 --> 00:05:11.566
wave of panic, but on a
count of some greedy people,

00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:12.960
the unscrupulous money changers

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.303
and the rulers of the exchanges.

00:05:16.303 --> 00:05:18.579
He's blaming bankers for
the great depression,

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:20.715
which I think is fair.

00:05:20.715 --> 00:05:23.130
There's very little
regulation in the 1920s

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.731
that would prevent the kind of fraud

00:05:25.731 --> 00:05:28.166
that could lead to a collapse of banking.

00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:31.370
For example, insider
trading is not illegal,

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.412
and most people bought stocks on margin

00:05:34.412 --> 00:05:35.735
which is a terrible idea

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:38.336
which means you only have
to put 10% of the value

00:05:38.336 --> 00:05:41.146
of a bond down before you buy it,

00:05:41.146 --> 00:05:42.910
which means that there's
a lot of theoretical

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.465
money floating around out
there that's not backed by

00:05:45.465 --> 00:05:46.695
much real money.

00:05:46.695 --> 00:05:48.414
- [Voiceover] That sounds
like a terrible idea.

00:05:48.414 --> 00:05:49.830
- [Voiceover] It was a terrible idea.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.872
- [Voiceover] It's like
buying stocks on credit.

00:05:52.872 --> 00:05:53.708
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:05:53.708 --> 00:05:55.054
- [Voiceover] Oh, man.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.717
- [Voiceover] His argument
is that first, things could

00:06:02.717 --> 00:06:03.297
be worse.

00:06:03.297 --> 00:06:04.575
Second of all, the reason things are bad

00:06:04.575 --> 00:06:05.968
is because of these people.

00:06:05.968 --> 00:06:07.918
Thing number three,
here's how we're going to

00:06:07.918 --> 00:06:09.544
get back on track.

00:06:09.544 --> 00:06:12.980
- [Voiceover] This is where
we get here at the end.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.720
The nation asks for action,

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.601
and action now, which it says not only

00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:22.431
a mention of how he's
going to get things done

00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:26.378
but a covert poke at Herbert Hoover for

00:06:26.378 --> 00:06:28.816
not doing much, and then he says,

00:06:28.816 --> 00:06:32.624
our greatest primary task
is to put people to work.

00:06:32.624 --> 00:06:35.504
Remember there's an
unemployment rate of 25%.

00:06:35.504 --> 00:06:36.479
- [Voiceover] That is so many people.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.127
- [Voiceover] Our current
unemployment rate is less

00:06:38.127 --> 00:06:40.751
than 5% to give you an idea.

00:06:40.751 --> 00:06:45.024
This is no unsolvable
problem if we face it wisely

00:06:45.024 --> 00:06:46.394
and courageously.

00:06:46.394 --> 00:06:48.344
it can be accomplished in part by direct

00:06:48.344 --> 00:06:50.898
recruiting by the government itself,

00:06:50.898 --> 00:06:53.522
treating the task as we
would treat the emergency

00:06:53.522 --> 00:06:56.634
of a war, but at the same time,

00:06:56.634 --> 00:06:58.979
through this employment,
accomplishing greatly

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:02.346
needed projects to stimulate
and reorganize the use

00:07:02.346 --> 00:07:04.134
of our natural resources.

00:07:04.134 --> 00:07:05.736
- [Voiceover] This is a radical idea.

00:07:05.736 --> 00:07:07.431
- [Voiceover] It is a really radical idea,

00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:10.403
and this is one reason why
historians love to study

00:07:10.403 --> 00:07:11.541
the great depression

00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:15.372
and the administration of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,

00:07:15.372 --> 00:07:19.157
because this is kind of
the decade where we threw

00:07:19.157 --> 00:07:21.433
out the rulebook, and
I think what Roosevelt

00:07:21.433 --> 00:07:24.637
is saying here is he was willing to try

00:07:24.637 --> 00:07:28.259
anything to conquer the great depression,

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:31.185
and one of the things he tries is

00:07:31.185 --> 00:07:33.252
bringing the government into the process

00:07:33.252 --> 00:07:35.156
of giving people work.

00:07:35.156 --> 00:07:38.337
We've got a sense of what he's arguing

00:07:38.337 --> 00:07:41.287
and how he's arguing it.

00:07:41.287 --> 00:07:44.629
Let's take a higher level look now.

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:47.741
Let's say step four is seeing

00:07:47.741 --> 00:07:50.063
if you can analyze

00:07:50.063 --> 00:07:53.917
the potential bias of a source,

00:07:53.917 --> 00:07:57.617
and I wanna be clear that

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:02.633
all sources are biased.

00:08:02.633 --> 00:08:05.837
I think a common misconception is that

00:08:05.837 --> 00:08:08.182
if you're looking at a source,

00:08:08.182 --> 00:08:09.900
it's either biased or it's not.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.849
It's written by someone who has an agenda

00:08:12.849 --> 00:08:16.031
or someone whose completely impartial,

00:08:16.031 --> 00:08:18.654
and that is never the case.

00:08:18.654 --> 00:08:19.606
- [Voiceover] What about a photograph?

00:08:19.606 --> 00:08:21.371
If I take a photograph
of something or someone,

00:08:21.371 --> 00:08:23.879
isn't that then objective rendering

00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:25.899
of that person or object?

00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:28.291
- [Voiceover] It certainly
shows what was there

00:08:28.291 --> 00:08:29.986
at that moment in time,

00:08:29.986 --> 00:08:32.447
but even photographers are making choices.

00:08:32.447 --> 00:08:34.839
When you pick up a camera
and you take a picture

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:36.952
of a thing, you are taking a picture

00:08:36.952 --> 00:08:39.692
of that thing and not something else,

00:08:39.692 --> 00:08:42.037
which in itself a form of bias

00:08:42.037 --> 00:08:45.009
to say I think this is
important or this is what I want

00:08:45.009 --> 00:08:46.147
you to see.

00:08:46.147 --> 00:08:49.630
- [Voiceover] Where we
put the frame is a choice.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:54.483
The question is what is Roosevelt
not saying in this speech?

00:08:54.483 --> 00:08:56.433
What is he not taking a photograph of?

00:08:56.433 --> 00:08:59.220
What's just outside
the view of his camera?

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.238
- [Voiceover] And why is
he taking this photograph

00:09:02.238 --> 00:09:03.051
of a speech?

00:09:03.051 --> 00:09:05.164
When he sat down to write this, what was

00:09:05.164 --> 00:09:07.602
motivating him?

00:09:07.602 --> 00:09:09.460
And what are some of the perhaps even

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.523
less obvious factors
about why he makes the

00:09:13.523 --> 00:09:15.497
argument that he does.

00:09:15.497 --> 00:09:17.194
- [Voiceover] Obviously,
the man has a bias

00:09:17.194 --> 00:09:19.781
in favor of his own politics.

00:09:19.781 --> 00:09:22.289
These are his administrations, ideas.

00:09:22.289 --> 00:09:27.289
He's going to be coming out in
favor of those very strongly.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.259
- [Voiceover] FDR is a democrat.

00:09:33.237 --> 00:09:35.680
There really haven't been many democrats

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.181
in office since before
the Lincoln administration

00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:41.155
since the 1860s.

00:09:41.155 --> 00:09:42.943
That's a new thing.

00:09:42.943 --> 00:09:46.913
This is the popular base rejecting
Hoover and the Republican

00:09:46.913 --> 00:09:48.794
party because of the Great Depression.

00:09:48.794 --> 00:09:50.280
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.929
- [Voiceover] He's bringing democratic

00:09:51.929 --> 00:09:54.460
political ideas to the table here.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.016
- [Voiceover] He's trying to make a case

00:09:56.016 --> 00:09:58.593
for those political ideas in this speech.

00:09:58.593 --> 00:10:00.822
He was elected by the majority
of American voters, but now

00:10:00.822 --> 00:10:03.446
he has to make the case to
the rest of the United States.

00:10:03.446 --> 00:10:04.489
He has to make a case to the people

00:10:04.489 --> 00:10:06.439
that didn't elect him.

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:09.806
- [Voiceover] He's saying
that direct recruiting by

00:10:09.806 --> 00:10:12.616
the government itself, government jobs,

00:10:12.616 --> 00:10:16.563
having the powers as if
the depression were war,

00:10:16.563 --> 00:10:20.278
that is a case for really
strong government intervention

00:10:20.278 --> 00:10:22.949
which is a key stone
of the democratic party

00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:24.853
compared to Republicans who generally

00:10:24.853 --> 00:10:27.175
advocate for a smaller government.

00:10:27.175 --> 00:10:29.334
He's saying this is what's gonna work.

00:10:29.334 --> 00:10:31.888
The democratic platform
of using the government

00:10:31.888 --> 00:10:34.512
in the economy and in social programs

00:10:34.512 --> 00:10:36.254
is what's going to work to get us out

00:10:36.254 --> 00:10:37.090
of this depression.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.110
- [Voiceover] He's making
a big strong case for

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.248
federalism.

00:10:40.248 --> 00:10:42.477
- [Voiceover] Exactly, what
I think is interesting though

00:10:42.477 --> 00:10:45.333
here is that there's a lot he doesn't say,

00:10:45.333 --> 00:10:46.912
and I think that's also important

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:49.692
to look at when you're
analyzing a primary source.

00:10:49.692 --> 00:10:52.014
There's a lot that you could talk about,

00:10:52.014 --> 00:10:54.058
but you make choices
about what to talk about

00:10:54.058 --> 00:10:55.613
and what not to mention.

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:57.680
What could you say he
doesn't mention here?

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.909
- [Voiceover] He doesn't mention how

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.743
any of this is going to work.

00:11:01.743 --> 00:11:04.182
- [Voiceover] Yeah, I think
that's maybe the biggest

00:11:04.182 --> 00:11:06.109
missing piece here.

00:11:06.109 --> 00:11:08.593
This is broad strokes.

00:11:08.593 --> 00:11:10.265
This is getting people on board,

00:11:10.265 --> 00:11:12.239
but no where does he say, okay

00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:13.911
here's exactly what I'm going to do.

00:11:13.911 --> 00:11:15.931
Let me tell you how many dollars

00:11:15.931 --> 00:11:16.697
I'm going to spend, how many people

00:11:16.697 --> 00:11:18.996
I'm going to hire, what sort of cabinets

00:11:18.996 --> 00:11:20.389
I'm going to create.

00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:23.129
This is not a time for specifics he says.

00:11:23.129 --> 00:11:26.032
This is almost more of an
inspirational speech to say

00:11:26.032 --> 00:11:27.796
okay, I gotcha.

00:11:27.796 --> 00:11:31.511
We've looked at the source.

00:11:31.511 --> 00:11:34.227
We've analyzed it's rhetorical strategies,

00:11:34.227 --> 00:11:35.970
and it's potential bias.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:37.572
The last thing we might wanna do with this

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:41.008
is now think about how we
could use it as a source.

00:11:41.008 --> 00:11:44.166
- [Voiceover] We're taking
this primary source,

00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:46.117
and we're turning it
into a secondary source.

00:11:46.117 --> 00:11:47.580
- [Voiceover] Right, so

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.598
say that you are sitting down to

00:11:50.598 --> 00:11:53.478
write an essay about the Great Depression,

00:11:53.478 --> 00:11:56.798
and you've gotta say, now can I use

00:11:56.798 --> 00:11:58.772
Franklin Delano Roosevelt's inaugural

00:11:58.772 --> 00:12:01.837
address to make my point in my essay?

00:12:01.837 --> 00:12:04.571
Step five

00:12:07.247 --> 00:12:10.005
let's say synthesize perhaps.

00:12:10.962 --> 00:12:12.071
Using my big words,

00:12:13.147 --> 00:12:17.162
as a tool for your own argument.

00:12:17.162 --> 00:12:21.852
- [Voiceover] I would say
that this speech is the frame

00:12:21.852 --> 00:12:25.219
that Roosevelt is putting
on the depression.

00:12:25.219 --> 00:12:27.634
This is how he is creating the narrative

00:12:27.634 --> 00:12:29.886
that he wants Americans to adopt

00:12:29.886 --> 00:12:32.371
or he is identifying the
crisis and this is how

00:12:32.371 --> 00:12:34.182
he wants people to see it.

00:12:34.182 --> 00:12:38.013
- [Voiceover] Yeah, so this
might be a great primary source

00:12:38.013 --> 00:12:42.634
to tell you about
Roosevelt's strategy or his

00:12:42.634 --> 00:12:44.887
communication strategy.

00:12:44.887 --> 00:12:47.394
What might it not be a
very good primary source

00:12:47.394 --> 00:12:49.531
to help you make an agrument for?

00:12:49.531 --> 00:12:52.712
- [Voiceover] It probably
wouldn't be a very good primary

00:12:52.712 --> 00:12:55.846
source for the Republican legislative

00:12:55.846 --> 00:12:57.286
response.

00:12:57.286 --> 00:13:01.048
You might wanna go with
Senator Reid Smoot of Utah

00:13:01.048 --> 00:13:02.510
for something like that.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.551
- [Voiceover] Right, and it's
probably not a great source

00:13:06.551 --> 00:13:10.614
for really diving into the
specifics of the new deal.

00:13:10.614 --> 00:13:13.099
He doesn't say anything about the civilian

00:13:13.099 --> 00:13:14.446
conservation corp.

00:13:14.446 --> 00:13:17.255
He doesn't say anything
about the national recovery

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:18.695
administration.

00:13:18.695 --> 00:13:21.388
This is not the nuts and
bolts of the new deal.

00:13:21.388 --> 00:13:23.282
It's the grand idea behind it.

00:13:23.282 --> 00:13:25.975
- [Voiceover] Right, he's
trying to sell the new deal.

00:13:25.975 --> 00:13:28.622
- [Voiceover] It's I think,
a really powerful primary

00:13:28.622 --> 00:13:32.175
source for understanding
the emphasis behind

00:13:32.175 --> 00:13:35.008
the new deal, but not the programs.

00:13:35.008 --> 00:13:37.051
- [Voiceover] Sweet.

00:13:37.051 --> 00:13:38.096
- [Voiceover] Alright, well
thank you for bringing your

00:13:38.096 --> 00:13:40.488
sweet grammarian skills to the table

00:13:40.488 --> 00:13:42.949
as we look at Roosevelt's speech.

00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:44.064
- [Voiceover] My pleasure,
thank you for bringing

00:13:44.064 --> 00:13:46.246
your sweet historian skills to the table.

00:13:46.246 --> 00:13:47.616
- [Voiceover] Kim and David out.

00:13:47.616 --> 00:13:48.697
- [Voiceover] Scholarly high five!
