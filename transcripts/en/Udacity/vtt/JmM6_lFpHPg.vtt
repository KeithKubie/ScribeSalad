00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.510
Imagine that you have the code for
the messenger app.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.880
Where would we look to find a swift
statement that presents the image picker

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.970
view on top of the composer view.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.830
We would find such a statement in
the View Controller that's currently

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.780
on screen.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.690
The compose message view controller.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.610
The invocation looks like this.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.250
Now let's have a closer look
at these three arguments.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.370
The third one is often set to nil.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.470
It's a closure,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.000
which is a block of code that can be
invoked once the view is presented.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.380
This second argument indicates
how the view appears.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.479
When animated is set to false, the view
flashes onto the screen immediately,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.200
without the upward slide.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.640
For this first argument,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.870
we'll need a reference to the view
controller that's being presented.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.380
Let's figure out how
to get that reference.
