00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:09.140
My name is Dr. Mitchell Blass and I am the hospital epidemiologist for Saint Joseph's of Emory University.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.960
Influenza and cold viruses are two different viruses.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.780
One doesn't mutate to become the other. The influenza illness is caused generally by

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:26.420
influenza A virus or influenza B virus, whereas most colds are caused by a rhinovirus.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.500
The symptoms of a cold are much less severe

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.360
than the symptoms of influenza and less likely to result in hospitalization or death.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.160
The symptoms of the flu generally lasts for

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.640
between 3 and 5 days, sometimes as long as 7 or 9.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.280
Some of the first symptoms of influenza the person may be fever, may be muscle aches,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.480
but that's usually followed by a  cough, congestion, followed by the development of phlegm and mucus

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.500
and can be complicated by acute bacterial pneumonia,  which can result in death.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.020
Influenza deaths are highly unusual in people between the ages of 18 and 50.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.600
It is the young and the old, the individuals  with poor immune systems or undeveloped immune systems,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.100
and the infirm patients that have other co-morbidities, so the very young and the very old

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.680
are at the highest risk for influenza-related death.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.460
Individuals that have fever in excess of a 100.5, that have muscle aches

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.660
-- we call them myalgias in medicine -- arthralgias, or joint aches, cough, congestion

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.720
and those sort of symptoms,  should seek medical attention.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.220
After that it's important that the individual begin on Tamiflu or other medications to treat influenza,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.380
maintain good hydration,

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.540
maintain good personal hygiene so as not to spread throughout their house

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.420
and generally stay home from from work and other activities that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.240
involve other people for the until until you're feeling better.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.720
Tamiflu is one of the few antiviral agents we have to treat

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.700
influenza A and influenza B virus infection.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.200
In general it's taken twice a day starting as soon as you're diagnosed with influenza.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.100
The sooner one begins Tamiflu, the sooner it’s effectiveness can begin.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.540
A person is contagious while they're still having fever and probably for a day thereafter.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.239
As far as the what we call fomites, solid things in a person's environment, something someone might have touched,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.940
the influenza virus can live for up to 24 hours off of the human body.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.420
Let's say on the handle, a doorknob, and things like that, so it's very important to remember personal hygiene

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.220
is important. Wash your hands and wipe down areas

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.370
that may have been touched by individuals who have been sick with influenza-like illness.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.740
Presently we have two available forms of vaccinations. One is an injectable vaccination,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.500
which can be either trivalent, having three strains or quadrivalent, having four strains,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.580
or there is also an intranasal live influenza vaccination that's available as well.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.900
Those generally cover three to four strains.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.419
The nasal vaccination for influenza is a live vaccination

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:17.010
and therefore should not be given to individuals that have immune deficits

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.060
or individuals that live in homes and are in close contact with people with immune deficiencies.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.769
Flu vaccination is recommended for all individuals

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:31.109
and have the ability to diminish the number, decrease the number of influenza-related deaths.

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.419
They may not stop any and all influenza-related illness, but

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.660
it clearly decreases influenza related deaths.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.260
This year's influenza vaccinations effectiveness is less than it has been in years previously,

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.820
but it's the best means of prevention that we do have. If you could drop the risk of influenza related death

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.400
by ten or thirty percent, I think that's still a reasonable vaccination to be taking.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.560
Individuals that are allergic to eggs,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.440
particularly that have anaphylactic reaction to eggs,

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.620
should probably speak to their doctor and may not want to be taking the vaccine.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.519
Additionally there are very rare cases of what's called Guillain-Barre,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.930
Syndrome, which is a neurologic condition that can occur and is associated with

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.560
influenza vaccinations periodically, though infrequently.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.680
Equally important to influenza vaccination is personal hygiene and looking after personal

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.700
close contacts with other individuals.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.700
If a person was to walk up to you and introduce themselves [SNEEZES INTO HAND], “Hi nice to meet you…”

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.440
it's probably not a good idea to be reaching out shaking their hand.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.100
Cough etiquette is important — remember your sleeve is important for you.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.280
[SNEEZES INTO ARM.] would be a much better way of coughing.
