00:00:00.923 --> 00:00:02.507
Voiceover: A cyclist starts pedaling

00:00:02.507 --> 00:00:04.858
and accelerates for 12 seconds.

00:00:04.858 --> 00:00:07.338
The velocity v of t of the cyclist at

00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:09.794
two second intervals in feet per

00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:12.345
second is given by the table.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:13.953
So they tell us at different times.

00:00:13.953 --> 00:00:16.114
After four seconds the velocity

00:00:16.114 --> 00:00:18.032
is 7.5 feet per second.

00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:20.824
After eight seconds the velocity

00:00:20.824 --> 00:00:22.423
is nine feet per second.

00:00:22.423 --> 00:00:25.905
Consider the graph of
velocity versus time.

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:28.385
Velocity versus time.

00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:31.233
Let capital r of six be
the sum of the areas of

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:36.784
six right hand rectangles
with equal sub-divisions.

00:00:36.784 --> 00:00:39.089
It follows that capital r of six is

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:41.153
an approximation for the total distance

00:00:41.153 --> 00:00:43.778
traveled in feet during the 12 seconds.

00:00:43.778 --> 00:00:46.681
What is the value of capital r of six?

00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:48.281
I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:50.009
and try to think about it on your own

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:51.448
and then I'll work through it and at any

00:00:51.448 --> 00:00:52.824
time while I'm working through it, if you

00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:54.072
get inspired, feel free to pause again

00:00:54.072 --> 00:00:56.905
and try to take it all the way.

00:00:56.905 --> 00:00:58.665
Let's think about what they're saying.

00:00:58.665 --> 00:00:59.865
They say "consider the graph

00:00:59.865 --> 00:01:01.161
of velocity versus time."

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.161
We might as well try to plot that.

00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:06.361
I've got some graph paper here and we can

00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:07.896
focus on the first quadrant because all of

00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:09.689
our time values and all of our

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.384
velocity values are positive.

00:01:11.384 --> 00:01:16.249
Let's see this is time, this is velocity

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:19.361
as a function of time axis, time goes

00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:21.297
between zero and 12 and they're giving

00:01:21.297 --> 00:01:23.077
it to us in every two seconds.

00:01:23.077 --> 00:01:29.937
So, this is zero, two, four, six, eight,

00:01:29.937 --> 00:01:34.913
ten and 12 seconds, and then our velocity

00:01:34.913 --> 00:01:36.977
goes between zero and ten feet per second.

00:01:36.977 --> 00:01:41.281
So, this is one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:42.977
I'll just mark off some of them.

00:01:42.977 --> 00:01:46.448
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:01:46.448 --> 00:01:50.889
Now, this is in feet per second

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:52.329
and this over here is in seconds.

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.409
Let's plot these points at time zero,

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.921
velocity is zero.

00:01:56.921 --> 00:02:00.329
Time two velocity is six feet per second.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.008
Time four at 7.5 gets us right there.

00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:08.730
Time six it's 8.5, that 8, 8.5.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.121
Time eight at eight seconds

00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:13.929
it's nine feet per second.

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:17.544
At ten seconds it's 9.5 feet per second,

00:02:17.544 --> 00:02:20.570
and at 12 seconds it's ten feet,

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.608
it's ten feet per second.

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:25.201
What I've done here is I've just plotted

00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:28.641
the data that they've
given us, considering

00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:31.313
the graph of velocity
versus time, at least

00:02:31.313 --> 00:02:32.801
the data they've given us.

00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:36.448
We can imagine fitting a curve

00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:37.696
that looks something like this.

00:02:37.696 --> 00:02:40.065
If we were to, these
points are just sampled

00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:42.977
from a curve, they might
look something like,

00:02:42.977 --> 00:02:47.025
something like this, over there.

00:02:47.025 --> 00:02:49.905
We are now considering the graph

00:02:49.905 --> 00:02:51.377
of velocity versus time.

00:02:51.377 --> 00:02:52.976
Now let's think about the sum of the areas

00:02:52.976 --> 00:02:55.369
of six right handed rectangles

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:56.920
with equal sub-divisions.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.215
When they're talking
about equal sub-divisions,

00:02:58.215 --> 00:03:00.023
they're talking about equal sub-divisions

00:03:00.023 --> 00:03:03.150
along the independent
axis or the time axis

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.374
in this case and we're
talking about the first

00:03:05.374 --> 00:03:07.662
12 seconds, so if we
were to divide the first

00:03:07.662 --> 00:03:11.119
12 seconds into six equal
sections, they would

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:13.375
each be 2 seconds wide.

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:14.769
This would be one of them.

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.527
Let me do this in a new color.

00:03:16.527 --> 00:03:19.518
They would each be 2 seconds.

00:03:19.518 --> 00:03:20.831
That's not a new color, oh it is, blue.

00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:22.734
They're each going to be two seconds.

00:03:22.734 --> 00:03:26.127
Let me do one that
contrasts with green better.

00:03:26.127 --> 00:03:28.527
Each of our rectangles are going to be two

00:03:28.527 --> 00:03:30.599
seconds wide and I'm just kind of starting

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.591
them off at the bottom because we have

00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:34.662
to think about how tall to make them.

00:03:34.662 --> 00:03:36.881
Then they say to do
right handed rectangles.

00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:38.934
What's a right handed rectangle?

00:03:38.934 --> 00:03:41.174
That means we define the height of

00:03:41.174 --> 00:03:43.206
the rectangle by the value of

00:03:43.206 --> 00:03:45.015
the function on the right hand side.

00:03:45.015 --> 00:03:46.615
So, for example this first rectangle,

00:03:46.615 --> 00:03:48.983
to make it a right handed
rectangle, we look at

00:03:48.983 --> 00:03:51.179
the right side, we're
at two seconds, velocity

00:03:51.302 --> 00:03:53.982
at two seconds is six feet per second

00:03:53.982 --> 00:03:55.318
and so that's going to be

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.862
the height of our rectangle.

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.990
This next one is going to look like this.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.238
Now you might say "Well, what's a left

00:04:01.238 --> 00:04:02.230
handed rectangle then?"

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.671
Well, a left handed
rectangle would be doing

00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:06.831
something like, would be
doing something like...

00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:08.512
Okay, for this first rectangle on the left

00:04:08.512 --> 00:04:11.614
hand side of it, my function is zero.

00:04:11.614 --> 00:04:12.830
So, it's just zero.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.534
Now the next rectangle,
the left hand side,

00:04:15.534 --> 00:04:18.478
my function at two seconds,

00:04:18.478 --> 00:04:19.934
the function is six seconds.

00:04:19.934 --> 00:04:23.769
So, the left hand rectangles would look

00:04:23.769 --> 00:04:28.017
like this, would look something like that.

00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:29.406
But anyway they're telling us to do right

00:04:29.406 --> 00:04:30.286
handed rectangles so let's do

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:31.790
right handed rectangles.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.790
Let me clear this a little bit.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.719
This is our first right handed rectangle.

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:41.095
This is our second one.

00:04:41.095 --> 00:04:42.007
Let me just draw the tops.

00:04:42.007 --> 00:04:46.534
Third, fourth, fifth and sixth that was

00:04:46.534 --> 00:04:48.406
the tops of them.

00:04:48.406 --> 00:04:50.326
It's just going to look
something like this.

00:04:50.326 --> 00:04:52.968
It's going to look like this.

00:04:52.968 --> 00:04:54.614
This is my third one.

00:04:54.614 --> 00:04:57.415
That's my fourth one.

00:04:57.415 --> 00:05:01.352
That's my fifth one.

00:05:01.352 --> 00:05:04.504
Then, that's my sixth one.

00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:06.886
They're tell us let capital r of six

00:05:06.886 --> 00:05:09.420
be the sum of the areas of these things

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.460
and they tell us that it follows that

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.341
capital r of six is an approximation for

00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:17.149
the total distance traveled

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:18.845
in feet during the 12 seconds.

00:05:18.845 --> 00:05:19.821
Now why is that?

00:05:19.821 --> 00:05:21.853
Why is the sum of these
areas an approximation

00:05:21.853 --> 00:05:24.492
for the total distance traveled?

00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:26.820
Well before calculus, you learned,

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.084
that if you have a constant rate,

00:05:32.084 --> 00:05:35.461
that distance is equal to rate times time.

00:05:35.461 --> 00:05:37.330
Once again, this is assuming,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.309
that assumes a constant rate.

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:43.652
Our rate in this example
is clearly changing.

00:05:43.652 --> 00:05:46.054
We are clearly accelerating
right over here

00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:48.246
but maybe we can approximate the distance

00:05:48.246 --> 00:05:50.534
traveled if we assume a constant rate over

00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:53.213
an interval, say over
two second intervals.

00:05:53.213 --> 00:05:55.053
Then we just, we try to roughly, when

00:05:55.053 --> 00:05:57.741
we assume some velocity
over that interval.

00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:00.336
When we take these
right handed rectangles,

00:06:00.336 --> 00:06:02.411
let's just focus on this first rectangle.

00:06:02.411 --> 00:06:03.899
If I'm taking the area of this

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:06.043
first rectangle, what am I doing?

00:06:06.043 --> 00:06:08.804
I'm multiplying it's
height times it's width.

00:06:08.804 --> 00:06:11.396
It's height is going to be the velocity

00:06:11.396 --> 00:06:14.749
at the end of two seconds and
it's width is the two seconds.

00:06:15.544 --> 00:06:17.432
If I were to multiply six feet

00:06:17.432 --> 00:06:19.320
per second times two seconds.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.536
That will get me 12 feet,
let me make that very clear.

00:06:22.536 --> 00:06:25.417
The area for that one area is equal to six

00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:28.506
feet per second, my
velocity, it's actually

00:06:28.506 --> 00:06:30.472
the speed but we're not going to get

00:06:30.472 --> 00:06:31.800
particular about whether we're

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.336
getting the direction as well.

00:06:33.336 --> 00:06:36.968
Six feet per second times two seconds.

00:06:36.968 --> 00:06:41.848
That's going to get me 12 feet.

00:06:41.848 --> 00:06:44.760
That we can say is an
approximation because

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.344
we're saying "Okay, you
trialed at two seconds

00:06:46.344 --> 00:06:50.203
"at some velocity" but is that going

00:06:50.203 --> 00:06:53.056
to be an overestimate or an underestimate?

00:06:53.056 --> 00:06:54.928
It's going to be an overestimate because

00:06:54.928 --> 00:06:56.448
you're taking the fastest velocity

00:06:56.448 --> 00:06:57.313
over the interval.

00:06:57.313 --> 00:06:58.736
The interval started with the cyclist

00:06:58.736 --> 00:07:00.321
going zero feet per second.

00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:02.816
It's clearly overestimating
and if you think

00:07:02.816 --> 00:07:04.225
about it and I encourage you to pause

00:07:04.225 --> 00:07:05.632
the video and think about it on your own.

00:07:05.632 --> 00:07:08.016
If we did a left handed rectangle it would

00:07:08.016 --> 00:07:09.968
be underestimating it because we would

00:07:09.968 --> 00:07:12.943
be taking the slowest
velocity over the interval

00:07:12.943 --> 00:07:14.666
and multiplying it by the interval.

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:16.669
This is an approximation.

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:19.626
Let's just calculate what r of six is.

00:07:19.781 --> 00:07:23.828
R of six is going to be the area of

00:07:23.828 --> 00:07:27.150
this rectangle which, as we just said,

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.596
it's six feet per second times two seconds

00:07:30.596 --> 00:07:34.260
so it's going to be 12
feet and then we have

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:41.783
this rectangle which
is going to be 7.5 feet

00:07:41.783 --> 00:07:45.108
per second times two
seconds which is going

00:07:45.108 --> 00:07:49.084
to be 15 feet, 15 feet
and you can even see

00:07:49.084 --> 00:07:50.428
it in the area right over here.

00:07:50.428 --> 00:07:51.980
It's going to be three feet more.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.238
One, two and then half of two of these to

00:07:54.238 --> 00:07:56.461
it's going to be three feet more and then

00:07:56.461 --> 00:07:59.884
the area of this one which is going to be

00:07:59.884 --> 00:08:03.003
8.5, so our velocity at the end of

00:08:03.003 --> 00:08:04.587
the interval is going to be 8.5 feet per

00:08:04.587 --> 00:08:11.107
seconds times two seconds which is 17 feet

00:08:11.107 --> 00:08:16.387
and then plus this area
which is our velocity

00:08:16.387 --> 00:08:20.707
at the end of the interval which is nine

00:08:20.707 --> 00:08:23.779
feet per second times two seconds so plus

00:08:23.779 --> 00:08:28.947
18 and then we get the
velocity of this area

00:08:28.947 --> 00:08:31.555
which is going to be this height.

00:08:31.555 --> 00:08:33.091
The velocity at the end of the interval

00:08:33.091 --> 00:08:35.108
which is 9.5 feet per second

00:08:35.108 --> 00:08:39.363
times two seconds so, plus 19.

00:08:39.363 --> 00:08:42.060
Then finally this area
which is the velocity

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.475
at the end of the
interval which is ten feet

00:08:44.475 --> 00:08:48.395
per second times two seconds so, plus 20.

00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:50.043
What does this give us?

00:08:50.043 --> 00:08:51.947
This is the point of which I'm most likely

00:08:51.947 --> 00:08:53.180
going to make an error.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:09:02.445
12 plus 15 is 27 and then 27 plus 10 is 37

00:09:02.445 --> 00:09:07.546
plus another seven is
44, so that gives us 44.

00:09:07.546 --> 00:09:12.298
44 plus 18 is going to give me, let's see,

00:09:12.298 --> 00:09:16.955
I can get to 52 and then
62, so this is going

00:09:16.955 --> 00:09:25.338
to be 62 plus 19 is 81, plus 20 is 101,

00:09:25.338 --> 00:09:27.195
that's going to be in feet.

00:09:27.195 --> 00:09:31.530
Capital r of six, 101 feet, it is an

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.018
approximation for the total distance

00:09:33.018 --> 00:09:35.411
traveled during the 12 seconds but

00:09:35.411 --> 00:09:38.466
it's really an over approximation because

00:09:38.466 --> 00:09:40.322
for every interval, we're taking

00:09:40.322 --> 00:09:42.310
the fastest velocity of the interval.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.873
If we took the slowest
velocity of the interval

00:09:43.873 --> 00:09:44.929
in would be an underestimate.

00:09:44.929 --> 00:09:47.201
If we did left handed
rectangles and we might

00:09:47.201 --> 00:09:48.865
have gotten something in between if we say

00:09:48.865 --> 00:09:50.738
maybe took the average of these too.

00:09:50.738 --> 00:09:52.498
If we made the height of the rectangle

00:09:52.498 --> 00:09:55.394
three for this first one
or something like that.

00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:59.144
We'll do that in the
future, in future videos.
