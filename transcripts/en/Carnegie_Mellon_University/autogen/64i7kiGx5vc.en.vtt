you know they gave us a facility tour

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
you know they gave us a facility tour
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.259
you know they gave us a facility tour
the Steelers game as a facility tour was

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269
the Steelers game as a facility tour was
 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:58.880
the Steelers game as a facility tour was
so cool for the students to see all this

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890
so cool for the students to see all this
 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.319
so cool for the students to see all this
behind the scenes technology that was

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
behind the scenes technology that was
 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.119
behind the scenes technology that was
the best part we saw that there were a

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
the best part we saw that there were a
 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.880
the best part we saw that there were a
lot of times when researchers were

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890
lot of times when researchers were
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.340
lot of times when researchers were
putting accelerometers on two different

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350
putting accelerometers on two different
 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.560
putting accelerometers on two different
sports people and trying to find out how

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570
sports people and trying to find out how
 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.840
sports people and trying to find out how
things moved and what the way the people

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850
things moved and what the way the people
 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.219
things moved and what the way the people
moved and what you could learn from that

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
moved and what you could learn from that
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.319
moved and what you could learn from that
so what we decided to do was make one

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329
so what we decided to do was make one
 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.600
so what we decided to do was make one
platform that you could do all of those

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
platform that you could do all of those
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.480
platform that you could do all of those
things you could analyze any sport that

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490
things you could analyze any sport that
 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.800
things you could analyze any sport that
you wanted with at a very high frequency

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810
you wanted with at a very high frequency
 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.020
you wanted with at a very high frequency
very lightweight very cheap so you could

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
very lightweight very cheap so you could
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.819
very lightweight very cheap so you could
throw it anywhere you wanted and analyze

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829
throw it anywhere you wanted and analyze
 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.219
throw it anywhere you wanted and analyze
that way so this is the basically our

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
that way so this is the basically our
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.679
that way so this is the basically our
example that we made we basically have

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689
example that we made we basically have
 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.050
example that we made we basically have
our hockey stick and our sensor platform

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
our hockey stick and our sensor platform
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.120
our hockey stick and our sensor platform
this is just our prototype right now our

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
this is just our prototype right now our
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.550
this is just our prototype right now our
our eventual goal is to get it to about

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
our eventual goal is to get it to about
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.560
our eventual goal is to get it to about
a little less than a quarter of this

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570
a little less than a quarter of this
 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.800
a little less than a quarter of this
size and obviously without the giant

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
size and obviously without the giant
 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.219
size and obviously without the giant
batteries but we can we go and take a

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
batteries but we can we go and take a
 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.990
batteries but we can we go and take a
microSD card the same type that goes

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
microSD card the same type that goes
 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.389
microSD card the same type that goes
into your cell phone we plug that in

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
into your cell phone we plug that in
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.819
into your cell phone we plug that in

10 hours of data we actually were able

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579
10 hours of data we actually were able
 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.750
10 hours of data we actually were able
to get some better

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760
to get some better
 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.380
to get some better
information about if you shoot with a

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390
information about if you shoot with a
 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.870
information about if you shoot with a
hockey stick you see a really big spike

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880
hockey stick you see a really big spike
 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.240
hockey stick you see a really big spike
right when it hits the puck you can see

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250
right when it hits the puck you can see
 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.520
right when it hits the puck you can see
it the the rotation and how the player

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530
it the the rotation and how the player
 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.470
it the the rotation and how the player
moves the stick in their hand so it was

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480
moves the stick in their hand so it was
 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.300
moves the stick in their hand so it was
really interesting he said what we call

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310
really interesting he said what we call
 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.060
really interesting he said what we call
adaptive music player that music player

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070
adaptive music player that music player
 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.940
adaptive music player that music player
adapts according to you the tempo of the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950
adapts according to you the tempo of the
 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.920
adapts according to you the tempo of the
speed that you're running at and the

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930
speed that you're running at and the
 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.870
speed that you're running at and the
reason that we set up this project

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880
reason that we set up this project
 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.700
reason that we set up this project
because it's because that we observe

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710
because it's because that we observe
 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.160
because it's because that we observe
that many people right now are putting

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170
that many people right now are putting
 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.560
that many people right now are putting
out their iPhone as a music player

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570
out their iPhone as a music player
 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.350
out their iPhone as a music player
during their jogging experience so we

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360
during their jogging experience so we
 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.540
during their jogging experience so we
thought that could be better if we can

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550
thought that could be better if we can
 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.210
thought that could be better if we can
create a more adaptive music player that

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220
create a more adaptive music player that
 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.300
create a more adaptive music player that
really adapts according to the context

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310
really adapts according to the context
 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.840
really adapts according to the context
of the jogger so that's basically the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850
of the jogger so that's basically the
 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.940
of the jogger so that's basically the
idea the run is going to want to listen

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950
idea the run is going to want to listen
 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.520
idea the run is going to want to listen
to more like pop music sound the runner

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530
to more like pop music sound the runner
 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.790
to more like pop music sound the runner
got to run fast actually created impetus

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800
got to run fast actually created impetus
 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.430
got to run fast actually created impetus
for the runner to exercise so what we

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440
for the runner to exercise so what we
 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.190
for the runner to exercise so what we
have is a smart tennis racket and the

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200
have is a smart tennis racket and the
 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.610
have is a smart tennis racket and the
aim is for the racket to tell you by our

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620
aim is for the racket to tell you by our
 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.460
aim is for the racket to tell you by our
program whether you are getting the

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470
program whether you are getting the
 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.840
program whether you are getting the
racket properly or not

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850
racket properly or not
 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.729
racket properly or not
if hitting it in the sweet spot the

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739
if hitting it in the sweet spot the
 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.350
if hitting it in the sweet spot the
lasalle you hitting it and like matter

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360
lasalle you hitting it and like matter
 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.910
lasalle you hitting it and like matter
sweet spot is going to tell you it's

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920
sweet spot is going to tell you it's
 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.949
sweet spot is going to tell you it's
mainly for like beginners people who

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959
mainly for like beginners people who
 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.750
mainly for like beginners people who
haven't like you know play tennis before

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760
haven't like you know play tennis before
 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.120
haven't like you know play tennis before
just to get a feel like where they

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130
just to get a feel like where they
 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.710
just to get a feel like where they
should be hitting the racket and we hit

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720
