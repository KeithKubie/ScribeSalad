ATISSA BANUAZIZI: So when
you're teaching students

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.330
to communicate
orally effectively,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.770
giving them a real
living large audience

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.630
ups their game considerably.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.020
Obviously like nobody
wants to do a bad job

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.030
in front of their peers,
in front of a group.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.840
And obviously, that's
important because it replicates

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.910
the kind of talks that
they're likely to be

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.670
giving say at conferences.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.480
However, it may not be wise
to throw them in the deep end

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.780
right away.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.320
And a lot of times
in classes that do

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.320
have an oral communication
component, that's what happens.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.300
You know somebody
isn't necessarily

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.400
an experienced speaker.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.610
And their first experience of
it is an end of the semester

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.970
presentation, and that's
very, very difficult

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.900
for a lot of students.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.940
So what I think has worked
really well in this class

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.050
is giving them that
practice over and over again

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.510
in a slightly
safer setting where

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.020
it's just a couple of people.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.340
When they give the original
practice oral presentation

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.100
it's not even graded
so it's safe to fail.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.860
And that sense of
safety and that sense

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.910
of really building up
stage by stage your skills

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.250
is what gives them
the confidence

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.880
to be skilled communicators
by the end of the semester.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.840
You know by the time
they finish 8.13,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.580
there is nobody in
the class who doesn't

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.350
understand what they need to
do to make their presentation

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.490
work.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.190
And that makes it
you know the moment

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.230
of going into the conference
room or the classroom

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.200
and standing up in
front of their peers,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.910
that makes it possible.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.780
That makes it maybe even fun.
