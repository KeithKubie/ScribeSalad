00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.300
Let's see if we can
write 21/60 as a decimal.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.630
And I'll give you a little hint.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.830
See if you can rewrite
this as a fraction with 100

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.780
as the denominator.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.690
Or another way to say it is
see if you can rewrite this

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.250
so it's a certain
number of hundredths,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.010
and then you can represent
that as a decimal.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.340
So we've done this before.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.730
We can rewrite a fraction.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.320
We can get an
equivalent fraction

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.440
if we either multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.206
by the same quantity
or we divide

00:00:31.206 --> 00:00:32.580
the numerator and
the denominator

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.140
by the same quantity.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.089
And this numerator and
this denominator, it

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:36.880
looks pretty clear.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.760
21 is divisible by 3
and 7 and 1 and 21.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.510
And 60 is clearly
divisible by 3 as well.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.589
It's not divisible by 7 or 21.

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:47.130
Well, of course,
it's divisible by 1,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.750
but that doesn't
really help you much.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.499
So let's see if we can
rewrite this, maybe

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:52.285
with lower numbers,
where we divide both

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:53.660
the numerator and
the denominator

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.380
by that common factor of 3.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.615
So we're dividing by 3.

00:00:58.615 --> 00:01:00.990
So I'm just rewriting this as
an equivalent fraction that

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.030
might make it a little
bit easier for our heads

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.330
to get around it.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.990
So 21 divided by
3 is equal to 7.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.570
And 60 divided by
3 is equal to 20.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.690
So we've rewritten
21/60 as 7/20.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.130
So you might be saying, Sal,
why did you even do this?

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.330
Aren't we trying to get
it in terms of hundredths?

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.570
Well, this one helps simplify
it in my brain a little bit.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.040
And what's extra good
about writing it as 7/20

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.720
it is that it's easier
to go from 20 to 100.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.970
To go from 20 to 100 we
just have to multiply by 5.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.490
Well, if each section is going
to be five times as many then

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.570
these seven sections are going
to be five times as many.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.560
So, once again, we're
multiplying the numerator

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.690
and the denominator
by the same thing.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:56.330
And so this is going to be
equal to 35 over 100, or 35/100.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.591
35-- let me write it
a little bit-- 35/100,

00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:01.840
which is what we wanted to do.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.890
We wanted to rewrite this
in terms of hundredths.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.760
And what is 35/100?

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.600
Well, let's just
remind ourselves

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.300
when we're writing a decimal,
that's the ones place.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.900
This right over here, this next
place, is the tenths place.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.560
And the next place is
the hundredths place.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.740
And so 35/100, well, you
could write that like this.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.000
You could write that
as 35 hundredths.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.290
So you could literally
write this as 0.35.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.020
And you might say, wait, you
put a 3 in the tenths place.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.420
Why is this 35 hundredths?

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.690
I get that this is 5 hundredths,
but why is this 35 hundredths?

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.730
Well, 3/10 is 30/100.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.180
So this is 35/100.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.680
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.140
you could rewrite
this right over here.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:14.210
You could rewrite this as being
equal to 30/100 plus 5/100.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.150
And what is 30 over
100 if you wanted

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.009
to rewrite it in
terms of tenths?

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.550
Well, you could just divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:35.150
by 10, and you would
get 3/10 plus 5/100.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.900
And we see that right
over here, 3/10,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.110
that's the tenths place, plus
5/100, that's hundredths place.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.540
Or this is sometimes
referred to as 35/100.
