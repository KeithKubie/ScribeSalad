we've got a number which is apparently
 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.560
we've got a number which is apparently
so famous that it's up there on the

I've never heard of until recently and

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990
I've never heard of until recently and
 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.540
I've never heard of until recently and
apparently well they're pretty sure it's

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550
apparently well they're pretty sure it's
 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.830
apparently well they're pretty sure it's
irrational so I'm just going to give you

which models population growth X so it's

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640
which models population growth X so it's
 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.650
which models population growth X so it's
traditional and this is going to be like

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
traditional and this is going to be like
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.870
traditional and this is going to be like
a population level and it's a word

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880
a population level and it's a word
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.310

may be rabbits or frogs let's go with

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
may be rabbits or frogs let's go with
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.610
may be rabbits or frogs let's go with
rabbits because they breed like care

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
rabbits because they breed like care
 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.799
rabbits because they breed like care
yeah rabbits it's going to have some

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809
yeah rabbits it's going to have some
 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.600
yeah rabbits it's going to have some
other variables in it this is what they

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610
other variables in it this is what they
 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.209
other variables in it this is what they
call the logistic map math is Oscar posh

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219
call the logistic map math is Oscar posh
 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.920
call the logistic map math is Oscar posh
word for a function you get an input and

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930
word for a function you get an input and
 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.330
word for a function you get an input and
output and it's mapping one value to

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
output and it's mapping one value to
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.010
output and it's mapping one value to
another one but what this does is it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
another one but what this does is it
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.660
another one but what this does is it
predicts what the next year's population

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
predicts what the next year's population
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.760
predicts what the next year's population
is going to be for a community of

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770
is going to be for a community of
 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.410
is going to be for a community of
animals the first component here is the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420
animals the first component here is the
 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.770
animals the first component here is the
next year population that means this one

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
next year population that means this one
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.170
next year population that means this one
here is the previous and so we're just

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180
here is the previous and so we're just
 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.939
here is the previous and so we're just
we're kind of counting populations

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949
we're kind of counting populations
 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.529
we're kind of counting populations
they're going to be between 0 &amp; 1 like

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
they're going to be between 0 &amp; 1 like
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.630
they're going to be between 0 &amp; 1 like
empty dead population and a full

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
empty dead population and a full
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.580
empty dead population and a full
population and that's what this number

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590
population and that's what this number
 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.350
population and that's what this number
is as well so we've got like what we're

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
is as well so we've got like what we're
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.460
is as well so we've got like what we're
going to iterate this we're going to get

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
going to iterate this we're going to get
 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.020
going to iterate this we're going to get
an answer and put it back in together

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030
an answer and put it back in together
 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.730
an answer and put it back in together
next year's thing and then the important

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740
next year's thing and then the important
 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.950
next year's thing and then the important
number here is this lambda it's like the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960
number here is this lambda it's like the
 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.710
number here is this lambda it's like the
fertility so if this is high these

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720
fertility so if this is high these
 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.510
fertility so if this is high these
things are going to breed like like like

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
things are going to breed like like like
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.580
things are going to breed like like like
rabbits and if it's zero they're not

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590
rabbits and if it's zero they're not
 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.260
rabbits and if it's zero they're not
going to bring a tool and changing this

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
going to bring a tool and changing this
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.730
going to bring a tool and changing this
number is what the biologists were using

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
number is what the biologists were using
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.080
number is what the biologists were using
to sort of multiple different

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
to sort of multiple different
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.609
to sort of multiple different
populations if the previous population

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
populations if the previous population
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.499
populations if the previous population
is high you'd expect the neck want to be

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509
is high you'd expect the neck want to be
 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.550
is high you'd expect the neck want to be
I see you kind of multiplying by the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
I see you kind of multiplying by the
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.410
I see you kind of multiplying by the
previous year's population but also if

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420
previous year's population but also if
 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.880
previous year's population but also if
it's too high they're going to run out

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
it's too high they're going to run out
 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.590
it's too high they're going to run out
food so that's what you do one minus the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600
food so that's what you do one minus the
 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.630
food so that's what you do one minus the
previous population so this is like the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
previous population so this is like the
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.310
previous population so this is like the
breeding and this is like starvation

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
breeding and this is like starvation
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.960
breeding and this is like starvation
what's interesting is he you can just

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970
what's interesting is he you can just
 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.160
what's interesting is he you can just
put numbers into this so I'm going to

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
put numbers into this so I'm going to
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.219
put numbers into this so I'm going to
start with a population x1 of 1/2 so

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229
start with a population x1 of 1/2 so
 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.840
start with a population x1 of 1/2 so
remember this is going to use between 0

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850
remember this is going to use between 0
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.730
remember this is going to use between 0
&amp; 1 the population is heartful to start

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
&amp; 1 the population is heartful to start
 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.620
&amp; 1 the population is heartful to start
with in fact you can start with anything

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630
with in fact you can start with anything
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.510
with in fact you can start with anything
what's interesting is what happens over

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520
what's interesting is what happens over
 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.889
what's interesting is what happens over
a long time so we need to choose a

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899
a long time so we need to choose a
 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.840
a long time so we need to choose a
fertility I'm going to choose for this

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
fertility I'm going to choose for this
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.300
fertility I'm going to choose for this
particular example lambda the fertility

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
particular example lambda the fertility
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.340
particular example lambda the fertility
to be unknown it turns out you need to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350
to be unknown it turns out you need to
 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.469
to be unknown it turns out you need to
be between 0 &amp; 4 there are complicated

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
be between 0 &amp; 4 there are complicated
 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.550
be between 0 &amp; 4 there are complicated
reasons for that which I'm not going to

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
reasons for that which I'm not going to
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.109
reasons for that which I'm not going to
go into right now so I'm going to choose

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119
go into right now so I'm going to choose
 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.479
go into right now so I'm going to choose
2.3 so they're about middle in our range

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489
2.3 so they're about middle in our range
 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.520
2.3 so they're about middle in our range
of fertility so this characterization

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530
of fertility so this characterization
 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.110
of fertility so this characterization
tells me the next year's population has

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120
tells me the next year's population has
 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.420
tells me the next year's population has
gone up I've got zero point five seven

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430
gone up I've got zero point five seven
 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.320
gone up I've got zero point five seven
five

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330
five
 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.580
five
so my populations increase they've got

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590
so my populations increase they've got
 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.559
so my populations increase they've got
enough fertility that the breeding is

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569
enough fertility that the breeding is
 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.910
enough fertility that the breeding is
happening well what's interesting though

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920
happening well what's interesting though
 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.949
happening well what's interesting though
is what happens over a long time but

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959
is what happens over a long time but
 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.830
is what happens over a long time but
yessiree we get 0.56

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840
yessiree we get 0.56
 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.339
yessiree we get 0.56
- oh yeah the populations drop so we've

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349
- oh yeah the populations drop so we've
 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.449
- oh yeah the populations drop so we've
clearly gone high enough that the

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459
clearly gone high enough that the
 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.130
clearly gone high enough that the
competition started kicking in and maybe

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
competition started kicking in and maybe
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.839
competition started kicking in and maybe
they can't sustain that high population

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849
they can't sustain that high population
 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.750
they can't sustain that high population
what's interesting though is if you you

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760
what's interesting though is if you you
 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.800
what's interesting though is if you you
if you wonder how is this going to

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810
if you wonder how is this going to
 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.369
if you wonder how is this going to
bounce

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379
bounce
 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.320
bounce
lots of times and actually typing this

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330
lots of times and actually typing this
 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.390
lots of times and actually typing this
in every time is extraordinarily tedious

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400
in every time is extraordinarily tedious
 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.309
in every time is extraordinarily tedious
although I know you're watching this for

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319
although I know you're watching this for

this is going to be the lambda axis so
 

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.840
this is going to be the lambda axis so
I'm going to capture with different

you chose point six something and it was
 

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.220
you chose point six something and it was
in the desert so this is kind of your

six five when we do it so it's kind of
 

00:09:51.069 --> 00:09:52.769
six five when we do it so it's kind of
just over hot so there's a mark on our

just over hot so there's a mark on our
 

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:54.540
just over hot so there's a mark on our

graph here and if you do this and you
 

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.740

could plot this on a spreadsheet if you

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:55.750
could plot this on a spreadsheet if you
 

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.540
could plot this on a spreadsheet if you

changes in this sort of pattern and the
 

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.439
changes in this sort of pattern and the
different values that fertility give you

00:10:01.439 --> 00:10:01.449
different values that fertility give you
 

00:10:01.449 --> 00:10:03.480

different stable populations interesting

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:03.490
different stable populations interesting
 

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:04.949
different stable populations interesting
ly it sort of levels off at about

00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959
ly it sort of levels off at about

ly it sort of levels off at about
two-thirds it looks like you can't have

00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:06.519
two-thirds it looks like you can't have
 

00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:07.829
two-thirds it looks like you can't have
a stable population that's fuller than

00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839
a stable population that's fuller than
 

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:09.809
a stable population that's fuller than
that according to this model but you've

00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:09.819
that according to this model but you've
 

00:10:09.819 --> 00:10:11.460
that according to this model but you've
already seen that something interesting

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:11.470
already seen that something interesting
 

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.540
already seen that something interesting
happens we tried three point two I think

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:15.550
happens we tried three point two I think
 

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.819
happens we tried three point two I think
earlier so three point two gave us a two

00:10:17.819 --> 00:10:17.829
earlier so three point two gave us a two
 

00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:19.470
earlier so three point two gave us a two
cycle which means over a long time we're

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:19.480
cycle which means over a long time we're
 

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.090
cycle which means over a long time we're
going to have two marks on this graph

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:21.100
going to have two marks on this graph
 

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.650
going to have two marks on this graph
and so I'm just going to sort of

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:22.660
and so I'm just going to sort of
 

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.540
and so I'm just going to sort of
estimate then about here and here and

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:24.550
estimate then about here and here and
 

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.460
estimate then about here and here and
the graph if you plot it bifurcates

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:26.470
the graph if you plot it bifurcates
 

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.860
the graph if you plot it bifurcates
which is a posh way of saying is Forks

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:28.870
which is a posh way of saying is Forks
 

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:29.699
which is a posh way of saying is Forks
like they call it a pitchfork

00:10:29.699 --> 00:10:29.709
like they call it a pitchfork
 

00:10:29.709 --> 00:10:32.429
like they call it a pitchfork
bifurcation so this is we've got dead

00:10:32.429 --> 00:10:32.439
bifurcation so this is we've got dead
 

00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:36.150
bifurcation so this is we've got dead
we've got stable and then from about

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160
we've got stable and then from about
 

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.509
we've got stable and then from about
three we get two cycle but we will have

00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519
three we get two cycle but we will have
 

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:41.280
three we get two cycle but we will have
also seen that at three point five is

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:41.290
also seen that at three point five is
 

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.369
also seen that at three point five is
settled into a four cycle so then you

00:10:44.369 --> 00:10:44.379
settled into a four cycle so then you
 

00:10:44.379 --> 00:10:45.809
settled into a four cycle so then you
can kind of guess what's going to happen

00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:45.819
can kind of guess what's going to happen
 

00:10:45.819 --> 00:10:47.309
can kind of guess what's going to happen
if I put the four and they happen to be

00:10:47.309 --> 00:10:47.319
if I put the four and they happen to be
 

00:10:47.319 --> 00:10:49.410
if I put the four and they happen to be
around here you can see that somewhere

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:49.420
around here you can see that somewhere
 

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:53.069
around here you can see that somewhere
is blitz and it by four case again with

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:53.079
is blitz and it by four case again with
 

00:10:53.079 --> 00:10:55.180
is blitz and it by four case again with
Forks again but the posh word

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:55.190
Forks again but the posh word
 

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.060
Forks again but the posh word
this is the period of these cycles this

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:58.070
this is the period of these cycles this
 

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.770
this is the period of these cycles this
is a one cycle because it's got one

00:10:59.770 --> 00:10:59.780
is a one cycle because it's got one
 

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.570
is a one cycle because it's got one
value this is a two cycle experience too

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:01.580
value this is a two cycle experience too
 

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.760
value this is a two cycle experience too
and then it goes to four and the call

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:03.770
and then it goes to four and the call
 

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.470
and then it goes to four and the call
that's a period doubling thing what's

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480
that's a period doubling thing what's
 

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.780
that's a period doubling thing what's
intriguing is that by picking certain

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:07.790
intriguing is that by picking certain
 

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.300
intriguing is that by picking certain
values of lungo you can get any periods

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:10.310
values of lungo you can get any periods

values of lungo you can get any periods
you want as long if it's a power of two

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:12.470
you want as long if it's a power of two
 

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.410
you want as long if it's a power of two
because it doubles every time so if you

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:14.420
because it doubles every time so if you
 

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.840
because it doubles every time so if you
want a sixteen cycle there is a value of

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:16.850
want a sixteen cycle there is a value of
 

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:18.820

three point five because coming out and

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:22.100
three point five because coming out and
 

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.530
three point five because coming out and
look at this graph again the graph

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:23.540
look at this graph again the graph
 

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.920
look at this graph again the graph
doubles again and again and again and

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:26.930
doubles again and again and again and
 

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.740
doubles again and again and again and
again and quicker and quicker and

again and quicker and quicker and
 

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.740
again and quicker and quicker and
quicker so a tiny change in this lambda

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:32.750
quicker so a tiny change in this lambda
 

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.810
quicker so a tiny change in this lambda

Michell Feigenbaum got involved in this
 

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.500
Michell Feigenbaum got involved in this
at this point in the 70s and he was

at this point in the 70s and he was
 

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:18.780
at this point in the 70s and he was
looking at this thinking this is

an interesting thing like this and he
 

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.400
an interesting thing like this and he
starts to study how quickly this

doubling happened so that that took a
 

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.230
doubling happened so that that took a
little gap and this took a shorter gap

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240
little gap and this took a shorter gap
 

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.210
little gap and this took a shorter gap
and this takes a shorter gap again

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:31.220
and this takes a shorter gap again

and this takes a shorter gap again
because it's going quicker and quicker

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:32.690

regions so like if you divide that width

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:43.190
regions so like if you divide that width
 

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.680

a nice regular behavior what it's saying
 

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.730
a nice regular behavior what it's saying
is that this gap is about 4 0.6 times

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:57.740
is that this gap is about 4 0.6 times
 

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.410
is that this gap is about 4 0.6 times
smaller than the previous gap

so the period doubling is getting

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.010
so the period doubling is getting
 

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:02.470

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.940
very very very quickly but actually at a
point which is about three point five

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:52.950
point which is about three point five
 

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:56.420
point which is about three point five
nine it's not very far away you can

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:56.430
nine it's not very far away you can
 

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.460
nine it's not very far away you can
prove the period doubling must stop at

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:58.470
prove the period doubling must stop at
 

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:00.500
prove the period doubling must stop at
that point because that will be likely

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:00.510
that point because that will be likely
 

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.810
that point because that will be likely
is the if you add a geometric series up

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:02.820
is the if you add a geometric series up
 

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.220
is the if you add a geometric series up
to infinity there's there's a limit and

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:04.230
to infinity there's there's a limit and
 

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:06.740
to infinity there's there's a limit and
so the prediction doesn't tell you what

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:06.750
so the prediction doesn't tell you what
 

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.260
so the prediction doesn't tell you what
happens after that point but you can see

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:09.270
happens after that point but you can see
 

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.460
happens after that point but you can see
it we can go beyond infinity right now

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:11.470
it we can go beyond infinity right now
 

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.410
it we can go beyond infinity right now
so at 3.6 the period doubling is going

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:13.420
so at 3.6 the period doubling is going
 

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:14.550
so at 3.6 the period doubling is going
to stop and something else is going to

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560
to stop and something else is going to
 

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:20.310
to stop and something else is going to
take over and just a little watchlist so

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320
take over and just a little watchlist so
 

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.380
take over and just a little watchlist so
there's no strange behaviors it's nice

doubling bit you can see more period

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:03.070
doubling bit you can see more period

doubling it is self-similar but then the
 

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:06.840
doubling it is self-similar but then the
self-similarity thinks this will go a

bit crazy actually this is the
 

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.310
bit crazy actually this is the
Mandelbrot set so you're only seeing one

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:11.320
Mandelbrot set so you're only seeing one
 

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.290

numbers we need two dimensional numbers

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:16.810
numbers we need two dimensional numbers
 

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.720
numbers we need two dimensional numbers
if you just looked at the central line

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:18.730
if you just looked at the central line
 

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.910
if you just looked at the central line
of the Mandelbrot set and plotted what

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:20.920

the point to do when you do the

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:22.030
the point to do when you do the
 

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.060
the point to do when you do the
iteration this is what you see and

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:24.070
iteration this is what you see and
 

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.500
iteration this is what you see and
actually this was happening the same

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:25.510
actually this was happening the same
 

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:26.910
actually this was happening the same

even in chaos you get order turning up
so this here is a three cycle it's going

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:36.400
so this here is a three cycle it's going
 

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.890
so this here is a three cycle it's going
crazy over here and then suddenly it

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:37.900
crazy over here and then suddenly it
 

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.300
crazy over here and then suddenly it
settles down to stable behaviour three

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:39.310
settles down to stable behaviour three
 

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.630

and then you get well but then it goes

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:44.680
and then you get well but then it goes
 

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.250
and then you get well but then it goes
back to chaos again and nobody expected

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:47.260
back to chaos again and nobody expected
 

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.930
