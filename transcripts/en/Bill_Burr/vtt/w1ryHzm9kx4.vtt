1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.153
Okay.

2
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.820
<v 1>Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon.</v>

3
00:00:04.821 --> 00:00:07.720
Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and yeah. Yeah. Good.

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.770
I'm just checking out on you. Uh, I fucked up today. I, uh,

5
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.990
I forgot it was Thursday and I really wasn't doing shit today.

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.150
It's just one of those, uh, you know, you never had one of those days.

7
00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:25.250
You didn't know it was Thursday. You always hit Thursday.

8
00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:26.960
I thought it was Wednesday. Yeah,

9
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:30.860
I have one of those days and I was just fucking driving around no matter buddy.

10
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.341
Uh,

11
00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:36.341
I was on my way out to a fucking Santa Monica to go smoke a cigar my first one

12
00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:41.690
in like a month and a Andrew's like, you're gonna record today.

13
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.690
And I was like, record? And he's like, yeah, it's Thursday. I was like,

14
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:49.640
oh Jesus, there. So a, my apologies. My apologies.

15
00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:54.230
I, I didn't check in on you. Yeah, I almost didn't, did you feel not loved?

16
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.360
You know, this is when you really think about it.

17
00:00:56.361 --> 00:01:00.350
This is like the end of one of those feel good like Christmas movies or after

18
00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:04.310
school specials. And like, we didn't think you were coming and then you're dead.

19
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.830
But I guess I didn't for most of you,

20
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.420
cause it's 10 26 La time as I'm recording this. So most of you guys back east,

21
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.461
it's central time.

22
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:18.461
I just fucked over half the people in this country as far as not checking in on

23
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.660
them as far as people that listen to this podcast.

24
00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:24.140
So I'm basically saying that if this was a presidential campaign,

25
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.270
this would be the end of my campaign. I would have to a,

26
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.810
I'd have to try and fight it off. You know, Mr Bar, uh,

27
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.260
you, you tell the people

28
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.070
<v 2>hello America,</v>

29
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.070
you gotta to do a podcast every Thursday as last Thursday may even go to bought

30
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:44.840
it for the last year or so.

31
00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:49.841
But last Thursday you actually did not check in on the east coast or the central

32
00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:54.380
coast or the central part of the country, whatever it's called.

33
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.030
That's half the country.

34
00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:59.480
Is this what the American people can look forward to if you are elected

35
00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:01.600
president? Right, Debbie? I, you know what? Yeah, that's what

36
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.340
<v 1>they can look forward to. You know, I didn't think I was going to get this far.</v>

37
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.300
You know, I thought I was doing pretty good reading the shit off their, I'm,

38
00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:11.860
excuse me reading this, the, uh,

39
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.250
the stuff off of the teleprompter and now I guess it's over.

40
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.820
So, uh, yeah, sorry to the east coast and the central areas.

41
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.040
Uh, my, no, it's our food supply and where a lot of, uh, I don't know,

42
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:29.590
a lot of the comedy and the cold weather comes from right.

43
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.240
So I apologize.

44
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.830
<v 2>Jesus. Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.660
I had my first cigar garden like fucking month and a was delish.

46
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.290
It was delicious. It was bad. It was bad. I fucking went to a, the cigar shop.

47
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.440
The guy was like, where you been? I was like, Hey, you know,

48
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:47.670
I'm down to two a month. He goes, ah, it's great. It's great.

49
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.650
A fucker went in there and it was just, I just missed it. I missed the smell.

50
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.850
I sound like fucking champ kind. I missed the way you smell.

51
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.030
And I went in there was hilarious.

52
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.980
<v 1>We went to this place, Hollywood smoke out in, um,</v>

53
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.740
out in Santa Monica and as I was driving down main street, great,

54
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.410
great fucking street out here in La, you know,

55
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:14.000
it's Saint Patty's day and it was just getting geared up.

56
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.340
It was like right around six 30,

57
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:20.341
like just the absolute fucking shit show that is Saint Patrick's day out here

58
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.940
and I should say in the United States,

59
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:29.140
absolute shit show the fucking light green plastic hats.

60
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.270
Those fuckheads are out, you know? And then you had the, the girls, you know,

61
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:37.180
of course horror ended up, you got to love that.

62
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.060
I still used to smoking hot fucking chicks was like,

63
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.200
let the same colored like is those green plastic hats,

64
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:48.070
like mini skirts with like thigh highs on. So I'm like, all right,

65
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:52.840
they're obviously slinging drinks. Maybe they're not, you know,

66
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.460
maybe they really, our attention horse, because I swear to God,

67
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.340
I don't know what the fuck you'd go out in public wearing something like that.

68
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.870
Four on a night when people who usually don't drink are going to get even more

69
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:07.690
hammered or I guess it's just amateur night.

70
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.660
And you're going to fuck and walk around with something like that. Well,

71
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:13.180
what's wrong with you? Jesus Christ.

72
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:16.810
Didn't your mother ever talk to you and sit you down and be like, listen,

73
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.310
there's nothing wrong with dressing like a who just do not do it on the

74
00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:24.490
following holidays. St Patrick's Day,

75
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.620
New Year's and the 4th of July. Okay. Every other time. Thanksgiving. Okay.

76
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:32.590
You want to let the girls down a little bit? I don't have a problem.

77
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:36.640
Just don't say sit across to me at the dinner table cause you're still my little

78
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:37.361
girl. All right.

79
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:40.550
Unless they have some big like floral arrangement and you can know you can,

80
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.630
you can blow your boyfriend at that point. I'm not going to know,

81
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:46.510
but don't do it because you give your father a heart attack. Right.

82
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.160
Then they ever sit you down and tell you that shit. Well,

83
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.520
if they did, they didn't say it to these two. They were walking down the street.

84
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:55.750
I mean it's fucking unreal.

85
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.210
Like literally like hookers didn't dress like that when I was a kid. Um,

86
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.460
and it got me thinking like what the,

87
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:07.330
I always forget what the Fuck St Patrick's Day is.

88
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.610
So I'm going to Google that right now. Saint Patrick's Day. Here we go.

89
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.940
All right. We all know it's on March 17th.

90
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.480
Is this the thing where the guy chased the snakes out of the fucking town,

91
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.540
which just completely seems like a bullshit story to me.

92
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.410
Or was that some other guy was a flute odor.

93
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:28.810
That guy knows the Pied Piper and he got rid of the rats.

94
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.850
That was their problems back then.

95
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:33.610
It wasn't my phone died and my fucking Internet's too slow.

96
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.250
They literally had fucking reptiles and rodents

97
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.710
fucking spreading disease. That was aids back then. You know,

98
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.270
just a bunch of fucking rats would come to town and they'd bite one fucking

99
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:49.570
dude. They rats no to right that they fucking, they would,

100
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.980
they'd fucking bite this studly as guy there and he keasy cause fucking tag in

101
00:05:53.981 --> 00:05:56.650
every winch in town. And next thing you know, right.

102
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.550
They're all coughing on their fucking husbands and that it was over. And then,

103
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:05.150
thank God some guy would come by, some guy who's probably, you know,

104
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.080
never got picked to go on the rape and pillage tours. You know,

105
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.080
that was like getting picked last in gym class back then. Right.

106
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:14.190
And all of a sudden he just finds his hidden talent.

107
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.470
He picks up for flute and he fucking dances around and everybody follows him out

108
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:20.780
of town. All the rats do. Right.

109
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.260
You know what's funny about that story is they never say,

110
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.340
once he gets out of town with the rats, like then what did he do?

111
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.140
You know, fucking throw the flute at them and then run back,

112
00:06:34.141 --> 00:06:37.380
double back to town and hope that their little rat brains can't figure it out.

113
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.980
I mean they found it once, right? I don't know. All right.

114
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:47.780
Let's get case. St Patrick's Day is the day of the festival of Patrick.

115
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.670
Oh, thank you all though. That's sums it up.

116
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.920
It's a cultural and religious celebration held on the 17th of March.

117
00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:00.200
The to the traditional death date of Saint Patrick who lived from three 85 to

118
00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:06.500
four 61 that's a fucking good run for back then, Huh? He really was a saint,

119
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.910
not smoking, not drinking,

120
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.640
not messing with the who is what set. That's 70 let's see,

121
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:17.390
15 in 61 oh shit. We all know that. 76 years.

122
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.210
It's like living to 110 now and evidently he was the foremost patron saint of

123
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:26.750
Ireland. This guy was a fucking five-star general here.

124
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.230
St Patrick's Day was made in official Christian feast day in the early said,

125
00:07:30.231 --> 00:07:34.240
well, what the fuck did St Patty do? Saint Patrick,

126
00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:35.410
let's get back to this fucker.

127
00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:40.330
Let's see why he became a Saint Patrick of violin redirects here. Oh Jesus,

128
00:07:40.331 --> 00:07:44.050
doesn't he look miserable? Does anybody look happy in a stained glass window?

129
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.290
They always look like they got the fucking weight of the world on them.

130
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:49.810
What is wrong with my religion?

131
00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:54.880
Jesus can as is that one picture of Jesus smiling, like cracking up,

132
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.930
hanging out with the apostles and somebody farted or something and they just

133
00:07:58.931 --> 00:08:01.510
decided to paint them in that moment. They just never do it.

134
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.730
He must have had some fun. Right. Well, speaking of who is, didn't he fucking,

135
00:08:06.731 --> 00:08:10.810
he laid down with the, what the fuck was her name?

136
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:16.210
That's a good whore name from back then, Huh? Ethel. Alright.

137
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:24.070
All right. Saint Patrick or this was a fifth century Romo.

138
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.540
Romano Brow. Oh No. Come on. Romano.

139
00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:32.860
British Christian missionary and Bishop in Ireland known as the apostle of

140
00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:36.100
Ireland. He's the primary patron saint of Ireland.

141
00:08:36.101 --> 00:08:37.870
This all sounds like filibustering right now.

142
00:08:37.871 --> 00:08:41.560
Like they're trying to kill a bill along with St Thou who gives a fuck.

143
00:08:41.561 --> 00:08:45.400
He's also said that the dare, something the equal to apostles,

144
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.480
the date of Patrick's life cannot be fixed with certainty,

145
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.990
but on a widespread interpretation. He was an active,

146
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.250
he was active as a missionary in Ireland. Oh, we spread

147
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.600
<v 2>the disease there. They celebrate this guy.</v>

148
00:08:59.601 --> 00:09:02.210
He brought that fucking horrific religion to them. And now look at him.

149
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.900
There's still drinking because of this guy's mission. Uh,

150
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.040
during the second half of the fifth century,

151
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:14.070
early medieval tradition credits in with being the first bishop of a something

152
00:09:14.171 --> 00:09:18.430
primate of Ireland. Now he's hanging with an ape. All right.

153
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.870
I didn't know those gorillas and fucking, it's probably a chimp right now.

154
00:09:22.871 --> 00:09:25.330
It couldn't be a chimp that fair skin. Well,

155
00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:27.190
actually they all got fair skin there. Maybe that's where you go.

156
00:09:27.191 --> 00:09:31.360
If you get a sunburn, the grill is like, yeah, fuck that. I need the heat, man.

157
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:36.390
You know stupid fucking chimps going up there with that fucking white face like

158
00:09:36.581 --> 00:09:39.220
me. All right. According to the confederacy of Patrick,

159
00:09:39.221 --> 00:09:42.250
when he was about 16 he was captured by Irish pirates.

160
00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:47.230
You mean drunks from his home in Great Britain. Always from Britain. Now,

161
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:48.461
fuck is what?

162
00:09:48.461 --> 00:09:52.570
This guy's guy was all over the place and taken as a slave to Ireland,

163
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.680
looking after animals where he lived for working on a farm.

164
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.450
They're really ramping this guy up where he lived for six years before escaping

165
00:10:01.451 --> 00:10:05.350
and returning to his family. That's pretty amazing. How the fuck did he do that?

166
00:10:05.351 --> 00:10:10.300
He needed a boat. People are incredible shaped. Any, probably swam it. Right.

167
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.010
<v 0>Okay.</v>

168
00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.360
<v 2>Yeah. It's probably why he lived so fucking long.</v>

169
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:21.000
You do that one time. If you swim from Ireland back to fucking London,

170
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.750
wherever the fuck he was from. I mean, yes.

171
00:10:22.751 --> 00:10:27.750
Basically you've gotten all the cardio that you need to do in your life out of

172
00:10:27.751 --> 00:10:28.170
the way.

173
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.370
The guy was probably fucking shredded till he was like 66 then the last 10 years

174
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.820
were brutal. All right. After becoming a cleric, whatever the fuck that is,

175
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.260
that's either an accountant or something religious he returned to no,

176
00:10:40.261 --> 00:10:43.680
I would click on it, but it's not highlighted, which makes me feel dumb.

177
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.870
I'm supposed to like automatically know what that means.

178
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:50.820
You returned to northern and western Ireland. Well that's a smart move.

179
00:10:50.821 --> 00:10:54.390
You fucking leave the country, the dead enslaved you and then you come back

180
00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:00.090
fucking Ian McShane. In later life he served as a bishop,

181
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:04.330
but little teddy bash, Mr Blackmagic. Um,

182
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.820
but little is known about the places where he worked by the seventh century.

183
00:11:08.821 --> 00:11:10.730
He had already come to [inaudible].

184
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.460
Nobody knows anything about this fucking guy. He served as a bishop,

185
00:11:15.461 --> 00:11:18.520
but little is known about the places where he was a fucking bishop.

186
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.290
It was kind of a bishop somewhere over there. Let me get to see.

187
00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:27.440
Seem like he like he was a cobbler, a by the seventh century,

188
00:11:27.441 --> 00:11:32.120
had already come out to be revered as the patron saint of Ireland.

189
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

190
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.640
<v 2>All right. I don't want to be a cunt on St Patrick's Day,</v>

191
00:11:36.641 --> 00:11:39.250
but don't you think there's a little gap in the information there?

192
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.490
This is like the story of Jesus where it's like, Yay.

193
00:11:42.491 --> 00:11:44.220
He was a little baby and a,

194
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:48.310
they brought some gifts over and then he was 33 on a cross.

195
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.360
Some point he did some carpentry and he banged a horse. The other than that,

196
00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.800
right. There's, there's nothing there.

197
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:59.100
This fucking guy was a bishop somewhere in western northern and western Ireland.

198
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.870
Little's known about that and then by the seventh century he was a patron saint

199
00:12:03.871 --> 00:12:07.290
of Ireland. What did he do?

200
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.390
Name dating to Patrick's theories. Life. All right, let's get to his life.

201
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.850
At the age of 16 he was captured by hours. I already read this shit.

202
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.140
Did six years of captivity. He heard a voice story. Yeah.

203
00:12:24.141 --> 00:12:26.960
He went crazy telling him that he would soon go home.

204
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.240
Sounds like it was malnourished to me and then that his ship was ready fleeing

205
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.560
his master. Oof. Kind of sounds like a Batman Robin relationship,

206
00:12:36.561 --> 00:12:39.790
if you know what I mean. I think he was the gimp. He traveled to a pool.

207
00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.660
He traveled to a port 200 miles away.

208
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.350
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

209
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.430
<v 2>Traveled. Travel. How he took the subway. He made you walked where?</v>

210
00:12:50.431 --> 00:12:54.720
He found his ship and was difficult and with difficulty persuaded the captain to

211
00:12:54.721 --> 00:12:59.310
take him in. Yay. Fucking blow him. That's about it. That's it.

212
00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:03.050
The most difficult persuasion. Right. Unless, you know,

213
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.260
he was happy to be with his master earlier. I don't know. This all sounds like,

214
00:13:06.261 --> 00:13:09.980
I don't know, some sort of gay love triangle to me, after three days sailing,

215
00:13:09.981 --> 00:13:12.620
they landed presumably in Britain. You know what?

216
00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.470
I'm glad we drink on this fucking day. You know,

217
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.790
if you're going to be that fucking vague,

218
00:13:16.791 --> 00:13:20.390
this is like why you feel the next day you have to get went and what'd you do

219
00:13:20.391 --> 00:13:25.260
last night? I don't know. I was kind of a drunk in a western La and that, uh,

220
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:30.320
the cops came and I fucking heard this voice in my head saying that there was a,

221
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:35.300
uh, a ship waiting for me, you know? Yeah. What do you mean you called Uber?

222
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:40.220
Yeah, basically. All right. I apologize for all of that. Happy St Patrick's Day.

223
00:13:40.221 --> 00:13:42.800
Everybody. A lot of you probably still up drinking,

224
00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.250
getting shit faced and all that. Um, why not?

225
00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:47.150
<v 0>Okay.</v>

226
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.983
<v 2>Why not?</v>

227
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.250
<v 0>Okay.</v>

228
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:53.900
<v 2>I missed all the march madness. Um, I don't watch the first fucking rounds.</v>

229
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:58.010
You know what I mean? Every once in a while this upset there's an upset. Right?

230
00:13:58.011 --> 00:14:01.610
You should just watch holy cross. They fucking disappoint somebody every year.

231
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:06.620
Send everybody going home crying. I'm going to try to watch on say a but a,

232
00:14:06.621 --> 00:14:08.930
I'm busy over the next couple of days, but, um,

233
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.200
I had been watching my Bruins again and after that big fucking hot streak,

234
00:14:12.201 --> 00:14:16.160
I start watching them and then they start losing. So, uh,

235
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:20.710
they're playing the kings this Saturday and uh,

236
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.930
I'm going to tape the game cause I feel like if I don't watch it live,

237
00:14:23.931 --> 00:14:26.600
they gonna win and then I could watch it and I can enjoy it. But, uh,

238
00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:28.770
I'm starting to, you know, ramp back up with the hockeys.

239
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:33.230
The playoffs are coming and I watched the kings versus the Dallas fucking ah,

240
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.350
um, get ready for a bond.

241
00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.350
Verner and the king's just came out and gave him the old right there.

242
00:14:39.351 --> 00:14:42.950
Fred gave him two fucking quick ones. Then, um, you know,

243
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.760
and I was sitting at home, you know, mocking, announces go out there,

244
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.310
right elbow. The next goal as well. Support and goal is gay.

245
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:54.320
Obviously KCC go up three, nothing or that's the stars. Cut It in half.

246
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.690
We can do the fucking math when the numbers are that low.

247
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.940
So what you got to love about hockey, you know,

248
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:02.120
the numbers are always nice and love. It's very rare to see it go over.

249
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.070
You never really have to count over five.

250
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.980
I think that's why it appeals to me that in the fighting, right?

251
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.510
So the stars score next and it's two to one and then they dead. You thinking,

252
00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:16.250
okay, here we go. We got a game and then Bam, fucking they score again. Three,

253
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:19.010
two, one after one. The next thing you know,

254
00:15:19.011 --> 00:15:20.920
I go out and make myself a grilled cheese sandwich.

255
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.690
I come back and it's fucking five to one. However,

256
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.870
that doesn't mean that's how it's going to go in the playoffs.

257
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.480
And those are two of my favorite teams out in the West.

258
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.580
Of course the Bruins are always my favorite, but are the kings.

259
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.150
The stars are really fun to watch. So I'm getting psyched for the, uh,

260
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.310
for the hockey playoffs. Speaking of which, um,

261
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.120
I have an open invite to do the great Joe Barton x puck off podcast and uh,

262
00:15:43.121 --> 00:15:47.900
I'm going to try to do that sooner rather than later. But, um,

263
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.230
I'm excited about that and I got to get into the whole march madness thing.

264
00:15:51.231 --> 00:15:55.100
So that's basically, that's basically my life. Right. And, um,

265
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.750
so you're probably thinking like, well bill, you know,

266
00:15:56.751 --> 00:16:00.740
I know you tell jokes at night, you have to know when you fucking spots are,

267
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.560
how did you forget it was Thursday? Well,

268
00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:08.450
all freckles here at a really fucking busy day because a, they started a,

269
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:11.240
they started making my, my little baby gym,

270
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.250
my little get and shape gym, get in shape, girl gym at the back of my, uh,

271
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:19.730
garage. And uh, so I had to clear everything out.

272
00:16:19.731 --> 00:16:23.150
And unfortunately I had to put my truck in storage for the next couple of weeks.

273
00:16:23.151 --> 00:16:24.710
I was only going to take them like two, three weeks,

274
00:16:24.711 --> 00:16:29.060
which means six months in construction talk, um, for them to, uh,

275
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.770
to complete this project. And uh, I,

276
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.170
I can't tell you how fucking sad I was dropping that truck off.

277
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.750
It's unreal. Every time I look at that truck or I start driving it,

278
00:16:41.751 --> 00:16:44.630
I have this big goofy fucking grin on my face. Like, yeah, be here.

279
00:16:44.631 --> 00:16:47.870
Like when people drown, you know,

280
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:52.040
after you go through the horror of drowning, right as you go to pass out,

281
00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:54.020
like all this dopamine is released.

282
00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.960
And I guess when they find you underwater and your cement shoes,

283
00:16:56.961 --> 00:17:01.460
you have this goofy smile on your face provided they didn't drop in like a

284
00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.910
thousand feet of water on your head didn't fucking explode. Um, you always,

285
00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:08.840
I guess have this fucking like when they find scuba divers and underwater caves,

286
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.350
um, you know, cause they get lost. I mean, Jesus Christ,

287
00:17:14.351 --> 00:17:19.090
talk about that most fucking horrifying thing ever. Fucking going in there.

288
00:17:19.091 --> 00:17:21.680
I mean, Jesus Christ, what do I mean, what do you do when you're underwater?

289
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.500
You can't drop breadcrumbs. How'd he get back?

290
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.010
There is no fucking,

291
00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:33.780
that is the most fucking insane thing you could ever do.

292
00:17:33.781 --> 00:17:36.780
Let's go explore some underwater caves.

293
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.410
Can you imagine that shit and then you fucking get lost.

294
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.030
Wow. Dude, this gotta be stories of people that survived.

295
00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:50.880
I want to hear that mind. Fuck. How the fuck do you keep yourself calm?

296
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.880
Cause you know you're going to panic and then you're going to start breathing

297
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:56.250
faster and that fucking Shit, you know?

298
00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:59.780
Oh my God, I don't know what I would do.

299
00:17:59.781 --> 00:18:03.230
I would just get my flippers going as fast as I could and try to knock myself

300
00:18:03.231 --> 00:18:04.460
out against the fucking wall.

301
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:06.650
<v 0>Okay.</v>

302
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.120
<v 2>You know, and you couldn't because you're under water.</v>

303
00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:13.250
You can't even fucking knock yourself out. What do you do then?

304
00:18:13.251 --> 00:18:15.920
I think you just swim up to a big fish and give it the finger and hope it

305
00:18:15.921 --> 00:18:19.850
fucking puts you out of them, out of your misery. Um,

306
00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:24.550
the fuck was I talking about? Fuck did I get onto that?

307
00:18:24.551 --> 00:18:27.290
I was talking about dropping, dropping the truck off. Yes. So, um,

308
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.640
I gotta be honest with you man. Like I like no new cars do it for me.

309
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.360
They're all the fucking same. Pisses me off. You know,

310
00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.330
cause my car is getting old man. My car was like eight years old.

311
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.970
Granted seven or eight years old. Yeah.

312
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:48.670
It's going to be eight years old since I've had it October this year. And um,

313
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:53.570
I've maintained that thing, you know, I take it back to the dealership.

314
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:57.860
I have them do the whole thing. I pay through the fucking nose and uh,

315
00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:01.040
it runs like a God damn top. It runs like a fucking top to the point.

316
00:19:01.041 --> 00:19:05.090
I'm not even nervous about saying it, but the interior's going to shit, right.

317
00:19:05.091 --> 00:19:08.300
The steering is all fucking worn out and um,

318
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.690
but I love the car because I can park it anywhere and I don't give a fuck if

319
00:19:11.691 --> 00:19:14.660
anybody drives into the thing. Um,

320
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:17.600
but my buddy who I smoked cigars with,

321
00:19:17.601 --> 00:19:21.440
he's got this fucking Cadillac and I really like it, you know,

322
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.570
and I like them more than the fucking,

323
00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.960
I dunno everybody out here is Lisa's a fucking

324
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.920
<v 0>okay.</v>

325
00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.360
<v 1>The BMWs, the fucking every other day</v>

326
00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:35.040
<v 2>Douche has one of those out here, so I don't want to get one of those. And uh</v>

327
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.953
<v 0>hm.</v>

328
00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.750
<v 1>Audi's a cool, you know why they got Audis?</v>

329
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:41.630
Audis is like the fucking bill Bellacheck draft pick.

330
00:19:41.631 --> 00:19:45.440
That's the second round guy or the guy who gets picked in the third round and

331
00:19:45.441 --> 00:19:48.710
has something to fucking prove. Like, I feel like Audi has something to prove.

332
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.150
You get more bang for your buck.

333
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.470
We're fucking BMW and a fucking, you know.

334
00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:55.490
<v 0>Okay.</v>

335
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:56.323
<v 1>Mercedes,</v>

336
00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:00.230
they like the first round draft pick holding out for a fucking bigger contract.

337
00:20:00.231 --> 00:20:01.610
Fuck those cars. Right.

338
00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:03.460
<v 0>Okay.</v>

339
00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.220
<v 2>Well I'm German too, man. I'm mostly German. I should be fucking,</v>

340
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.390
I guess Audi's German too, right? I Dunno. But, um,

341
00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.340
I like buying American shit though,

342
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.630
even though it's probably built in fucking Mexico or Turks and Caicos,

343
00:20:16.631 --> 00:20:18.520
whatever the fuck they build them now. Um,

344
00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:19.740
<v 0>okay.</v>

345
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.900
<v 1>So I'm thinking like, all right, well my buddy's got a Cadillac.</v>

346
00:20:21.901 --> 00:20:24.000
I can't go out and get a fucking caddy pull up next to him.

347
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.210
He looked like single white female freckles over here. Right. So I go,

348
00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:29.670
what about the fucking Lincoln mark five or whatever.

349
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:33.780
Don't they still make that car? So I go to the fucking Lincoln website.

350
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:38.430
When the fuck did they dibble that car or did it just not keep up?

351
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.420
That thing used to be the answer to Cadillac and that you can get one for like

352
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.680
35 grand,

353
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.620
<v 2>which is not, it's still 35 grand. But I thought would they would,</v>

354
00:20:47.621 --> 00:20:51.720
it would be like up there like with the caddies,

355
00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.230
like the caddies or like, you know, they,

356
00:20:54.231 --> 00:20:58.860
they kind of end where all the high end BMW's and Mercedes fucking end. Right.

357
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.710
So I figured the Lincoln was going to be up. Like I thought I was going to,

358
00:21:01.711 --> 00:21:01.970
you know,

359
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:05.670
be like some luxury car and this is a thing nobody drives one of those,

360
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.210
which should be great. So I got something a little different. It's got nice,

361
00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:14.310
you know. Nice fuck. That's a great old man car. A fucking Lincoln, you know,

362
00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:17.760
you drive around in it. People look at you, they gotta look at that guy.

363
00:21:17.761 --> 00:21:20.310
He's probably a member of the NRA. I don't want to fuck with that guy.

364
00:21:20.311 --> 00:21:24.090
It's a fucking, it's a classic old man car.

365
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.780
And uh, I don't know if I'm looking at the wrong model,

366
00:21:27.781 --> 00:21:30.660
but every they have like, all they have is fucking SUV now.

367
00:21:30.661 --> 00:21:33.240
And then they have like the, uh, I don't know.

368
00:21:33.241 --> 00:21:34.410
I looked at the car and it was like,

369
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.440
you ever see somebody used to go to the gym every day and then they don't

370
00:21:37.441 --> 00:21:39.510
anymore. And you can see, you can kind of see,

371
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.690
<v 0>yeah.</v>

372
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.310
<v 2>Like, Oh, yeah, that guy used to work out and now we, uh,</v>

373
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.510
now he gets like three appetizers before he dies into the fucking,

374
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.570
I'll speak to that dude. I, when I dropped the car off,

375
00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:56.420
I had to wake my lovely wife up and she, you know, followed me over and uh,

376
00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.010
it was early in the morning. She's not a morning person. Right. And uh,

377
00:22:00.011 --> 00:22:03.640
so I told her I'd take around, go to breakfast. She of course eats healthy.

378
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:05.830
<v 0>Um, okay.</v>

379
00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.970
<v 2>You know, still looking gorgeous. And I,</v>

380
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.980
first thing I see on the menu was a eggs benedict with fucking pulled pork and

381
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.490
you know, came with potatoes and like an asshole.

382
00:22:18.491 --> 00:22:21.130
I ordered it and I have been paying for it the whole day.

383
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:26.020
I barely been able to keep my eyes open all day for all you youngsters out

384
00:22:26.021 --> 00:22:29.590
there. That's what fucking happens to you when you get older young dude, you,

385
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:34.150
you know, you got a low miles on your digestive track,

386
00:22:34.151 --> 00:22:37.390
you can go eat something fucked up and then go play Frisbee football,

387
00:22:37.391 --> 00:22:40.300
whatever the fuck it is. You kids do go fly a drone around an airport.

388
00:22:40.301 --> 00:22:42.610
And freak out some pilots, whatever it is that you guys do,

389
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:48.160
whatever you wacky kids do, put on a virtual reality fucking helmet and a,

390
00:22:48.161 --> 00:22:48.994
I dunno,

391
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.210
take video of you fucking next door neighbor and then you're fucking bagging

392
00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.550
them. And then you feel weird when you see and when you go to get the mail,

393
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.750
whatever it is you kids do. Um, yeah,

394
00:22:58.751 --> 00:23:01.630
you can do that after eating fucking McDonald's. I, I cannot,

395
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.353
I can't.

396
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.260
We actually postmate at McDonald's the other day and like fucking 1230 at night

397
00:23:08.261 --> 00:23:12.400
and I gotta tell you it was fucking delicious. And the next day I woke up,

398
00:23:12.401 --> 00:23:12.851
I was like,

399
00:23:12.851 --> 00:23:17.851
did I get into a bar fight last night and lose horrifically like was I the guy

400
00:23:18.281 --> 00:23:19.600
like laying, you know,

401
00:23:19.601 --> 00:23:22.390
those old school bars where they didn't even have stools and they just had that

402
00:23:22.391 --> 00:23:24.130
brass rail for you to put your foot up on.

403
00:23:24.131 --> 00:23:27.580
You ever see a guy who ends up like in between the bar and that thing while

404
00:23:27.581 --> 00:23:29.320
there's like three people kicking him, you know,

405
00:23:29.321 --> 00:23:33.340
that that classic guy in every other bar in fucking Boston.

406
00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:40.360
I felt like that happened to me and they just kicked me right in the stomach,

407
00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:44.680
the entire fucking beat down. I'm, what did I order? You didn't ask.

408
00:23:44.681 --> 00:23:46.460
I got double cheeseburgers

409
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.460
<v 1>and the fucking large fry and I enjoyed every second of it and I distinctly</v>

410
00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:56.330
remember at least three times Nia looking over at me telling me to slow down.

411
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:58.790
I fucking ate like an I, you know,

412
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:03.740
I ate like a guy that fucking ordered out for McDonald's. So as you can tell,

413
00:24:03.741 --> 00:24:06.830
my gym can't get here soon enough. Um,

414
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:11.390
I ordered, I ordered all of my shit from rogue fitness.

415
00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.900
Thanks a lot for not fucking hooking me up and recognizing my h level celebrity

416
00:24:17.451 --> 00:24:20.330
status. She could at least giving me a fucking one kettlebell.

417
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.540
He couldn't even do that. Well I gotta Beg you guys,

418
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:28.640
you know I love about it is I don't owe you anything and if you're fucking

419
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:33.320
weight sharp and they're too heavy, I'm going to trash it. Um,

420
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.860
I ordered the weights and I wanted the colorful ones and Nia tease me out of it.

421
00:24:36.861 --> 00:24:41.861
She actually used like some sort of like Jedi mind trick with a little bit of

422
00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:44.120
fucking homophobia. She's like,

423
00:24:44.121 --> 00:24:47.720
those are the ones you're going to get that rainbow color. She goes,

424
00:24:47.721 --> 00:24:49.940
they look a little corny. I go, I like them. They're different.

425
00:24:49.941 --> 00:24:54.941
Like the 40 fives a blow and then the m 30 fives or a night,

426
00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:00.740
a nice lime green. And then the 20 fives a yellow.

427
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.120
I didn't think it seemed more, it didn't seem a feminine to me.

428
00:25:05.121 --> 00:25:08.150
It seemed more like a Fisher prices first. Uh,

429
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.540
I know your first fucking dumbbells. I don't know.

430
00:25:11.541 --> 00:25:14.300
So she teased me into getting the fucking Manley wants, you know,

431
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.770
like the Clint Eastwood once the old school fucking once.

432
00:25:18.771 --> 00:25:23.771
So I got those in a weight bench and I get a little fucking retractable rack

433
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:29.780
with my pull up bar and a, I dunno, we'll see what happens.

434
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.370
And you know, it's funny,

435
00:25:31.371 --> 00:25:35.960
as I have the ability to do squats with this thing if I want to.

436
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:41.000
And uh, like most guys, I hate to in legs, I don't know what it is, it's just,

437
00:25:41.001 --> 00:25:44.780
it's not sexy. You know what I mean? You fucking do anything in the upper body.

438
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.480
You know, all you do is you do like one set,

439
00:25:47.481 --> 00:25:50.060
you spend the next 20 minutes flexing in the mirror,

440
00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:55.490
but with your legs you just like, oh fucking hurts. You know, and you just,

441
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.420
you really don't get anything out. You know, there's no ego boost to legs,

442
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.590
right? If you fucking never miss leg day, like your, your,

443
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.950
the level of discipline that you have. I have to respect that.

444
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.980
I put you right underneath people that have the balls to explore an underwater

445
00:26:12.921 --> 00:26:16.010
cave in. Um, all right. And with that, let's uh,

446
00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:21.140
let's read a little bit of advertising. God knows I won't be rogue fitness.

447
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:26.240
Some mother fuckers. Where did they get off blowing off and nobody liked me.

448
00:26:26.241 --> 00:26:30.230
Can you fucking believe that every God Damn Day you're on TV and they show

449
00:26:30.231 --> 00:26:31.190
somebody, right?

450
00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.810
Somebody used to be on Charles in charge is getting a new fucking deck.

451
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.360
You know, he's getting his dream deck and he's go, oh my God,

452
00:26:38.361 --> 00:26:43.361
I can't believe you guys did my wife set this up all they asked for a couple of

453
00:26:43.681 --> 00:26:44.040
fucking,

454
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.860
<v 2>you know, barbells, let me get back to me.</v>

455
00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:49.770
<v 3>Okay.</v>

456
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:54.600
<v 2>It's coming off real cold, rogue fitness. Um, anyways,</v>

457
00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:57.970
by the way, rogue fitness. According to them, all of this shit is made in,

458
00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:02.160
made in America. Now, granted they might be using illegal immigrants,

459
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.270
you know, with welding masks or whatever the, however the fuck you make weight,

460
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:07.891
you know, you know,

461
00:27:07.891 --> 00:27:10.830
they're doing that and making horseshoes and like fucking 20 other things.

462
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:15.600
Pull bastards. Um, you don't what Donald Trump wants him out of the country?

463
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:20.580
I'll tell you. Um, all right. Mian D's.

464
00:27:20.581 --> 00:27:25.230
Everybody. Oh. [inaudible] I'm a fucking fat shit.

465
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:30.450
Booboo do do, if I keep eating McDonald's, I won't even get to wear underwears.

466
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:31.770
Uh, but if I do,

467
00:27:31.771 --> 00:27:36.771
I could dry off my balls and fucking flush them down the toilet in a bathroom

468
00:27:36.781 --> 00:27:38.400
stall. I always say bathroom stall now. Okay.

469
00:27:38.401 --> 00:27:40.470
Whether you're wearing a suit or sweats,

470
00:27:40.471 --> 00:27:42.810
you spend almost 24 hours a day in your underwear.

471
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:46.050
Unless you're like a fucking filthy animal and known. Understood.

472
00:27:46.051 --> 00:27:48.570
Guys that don't wear underwear cause I swear to God,

473
00:27:48.571 --> 00:27:51.750
no matter how much you shake your Dick after you take a Piss,

474
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.530
no matter how much you fucking YPN, stick a whole box of cleanups up there,

475
00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.990
there's always going to be a little tinkle. You know what I mean?

476
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.300
You never realize it to that day. You go fucking,

477
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.800
you know you go commando and then you're walking out of the bathroom.

478
00:28:04.801 --> 00:28:09.330
You're like, why is one of my calves sweating? Oh that's right.

479
00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:13.290
Right. You need it that Oh boat boat. Biondi sorry ladies.

480
00:28:13.291 --> 00:28:15.480
But that's the way it works. All right. Okay.

481
00:28:15.481 --> 00:28:19.650
But instead of making a statement like Superman's tight under his clothes,

482
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:24.840
under his everyday clothes, your,

483
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.950
your underwear is probably boring me undies is here to change that.

484
00:28:28.951 --> 00:28:32.280
I think there was a joke in there and I blew it. Um, all right.

485
00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:37.970
Every pair pair of me undies is made from sustainable source to modal model,

486
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.820
a fabric that's twice as soft as cotton.

487
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:47.310
Nothing can describe the fit and the feel of money on this yet.

488
00:28:47.311 --> 00:28:48.780
We're still going to have more copy.

489
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.730
I love how you can't fucking describe it yet.

490
00:28:50.731 --> 00:28:53.250
I still have to read 20 more fucking paragraphs for this shit,

491
00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:54.780
but why don't you try them on?

492
00:28:54.781 --> 00:28:57.750
You'll understand while they're called the world's most comfortable underwear,

493
00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.540
and if you don't love the first pair of me undies, they're free.

494
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.620
No questions asked. Hey, did you not like that thing? Keep it.

495
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.790
I never understood the line of that copy. Me Only said,

496
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:13.050
why can I send it back to you? The soiled underwear. You know,

497
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.020
you guys should take it back for your failure. All right.

498
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.290
Mandy says dozens of styles and limited edition prints.

499
00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.200
That's so stupid to help you make a statement like there.

500
00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.860

554
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:55.160
So all Billy fucking drum stick. I got these, uh,

555
00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:58.160
these new Zildjian cymbals, right? Um,

556
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:04.270
the fuck do you spelled Zildjian where are they?

557
00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:08.340
Oh, they got these new fucking symbols, right?

558
00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:10.710
That they actually made. They almost look like,

559
00:33:10.711 --> 00:33:14.190
you remember those Mesh shirts that people wore in the eighties? Um,

560
00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.190
they look like that, right? And uh,

561
00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:20.640
they thought it'd be this cool new sound and it barely made a sound.

562
00:33:20.641 --> 00:33:21.500
So they thought it was a,

563
00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:26.280
they were a failure until somebody figured out that they're actually great for

564
00:33:26.281 --> 00:33:28.950
practicing. And if you can't, you know, play loudly.

565
00:33:28.951 --> 00:33:31.440
So I obviously didn't make a drum room,

566
00:33:31.441 --> 00:33:34.920
so I had my little practice pad kit and now I've got symbols on them and they're

567
00:33:34.921 --> 00:33:38.160
fun. They're the fucking shit. They're still loud as hell.

568
00:33:38.161 --> 00:33:42.060
I can't play with my wife is home, but you know, she's always working.

569
00:33:42.061 --> 00:33:44.970
So when she leaves, I sit down and play and I've got to admit, man,

570
00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.450
they're fucking awesome. And you know, a couple hundred bucks,

571
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:51.390
it's not that bad. Nice and fucking cheap. You get to play along.

572
00:33:51.391 --> 00:33:53.220
And even though they got all the fucking holes in them,

573
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.250
you could still bounce to sticks. Work on you. A little technique there,

574
00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:00.780
you know, be a little fucking maniac. Whatever the hell it is you want to do.

575
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.070
Where the hell are they? Oh, then I called sound off. What the fuck are they?

576
00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.000
God dammit.

577
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.450
I got to get the names of these things cause they're fucking awesome.

578
00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.420
Look at this shit. I should have fucking said I do. Yeah, they,

579
00:34:13.421 --> 00:34:17.380
they wouldn't give any free shit where they, I want free shit man.

580
00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.890
I've come to that point. I want some free fucking shit. God dammit.

581
00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:25.300
I'm gonna stop talking about Apple. So I'm gonna Start Small. All right.

Look at this right here. You can order them right here online for 200 bucks.

584
00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:39.430
I got fucked. I didn't know that.

585
00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.600
God Damn it. I spent like 70 extra bucks. What a dope.

586
00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.490
Ah, Jesus cried looking at it.

587
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:50.650
I had to fucking wait like a month from to come in. What is wrong?

588
00:34:50.651 --> 00:34:52.370
I just don't like computer. I should try.

589
00:34:52.371 --> 00:34:55.840
I should try to like computers more every once in awhile. Oh Shit.

590
00:34:55.841 --> 00:34:57.950
It's already 34 fucking minutes, isn't it? Um,

591
00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:01.320
and it's late at night and I got an early day tomorrow. So, uh,

592
00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.830
was there anything else that I wanted to talk about? You know,

593
00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:10.870
I'm so sick of people talking about their fucking brackets. I don't give a fuck.

594
00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:15.880
I'll do it. By the way, I was a, he's an La story for you.

595
00:35:15.881 --> 00:35:18.220
I was out in my car the other day, right? And all of a sudden,

596
00:35:18.221 --> 00:35:22.510
like four fucking police cars just went flying by me.

597
00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:25.300
And then this and right above me there was like,

598
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:29.020
I swear it seemed like another four fucking helicopters.

599
00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.740
And I was like, what the fuck? The fuck is that? Right?

600
00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:37.120
So I go home later and I watched the goddamn news and some fucking

601
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.220
had stole up, stolen a police car.

602
00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.980
So the first fucking one that went by,

603
00:35:43.981 --> 00:35:48.210
I never saw the guy was actually the fucking dude they would chase.

604
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:50.640
And I thought it was a bunch of them going and they who, I swear to God,

605
00:35:50.641 --> 00:35:54.540
if they had been doing like fucking 90 miles an hour down this road,

606
00:35:54.541 --> 00:35:58.680
that was like a 30 mile an hour zone, right. So, uh,

607
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.460
you know, they fucking follow the guy, Yada, Yada, Yada and all that.

608
00:36:02.461 --> 00:36:04.560
He won't stop. They spin him out, they won't stop.

609
00:36:04.561 --> 00:36:09.360
And then finally this fucking cop in like the police SUV just fucking gives them

610
00:36:09.361 --> 00:36:13.050
the old right there, Fred to the fucking driver's side door,

611
00:36:13.051 --> 00:36:16.920
just totally just cave this thing in. And I was just like,

612
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:21.720
oh Jesus Christ, that's at least a separated shoulder full life.

613
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.560
And uh, I guess they ended up shooting the guy. I mean, you know,

614
00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:29.460
I mean at some point you, you know, you have to use deadly force.

615
00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:33.300
Somebody driving 90 miles an hour around just regular people, you know,

616
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.060
if he was around irregular people, that's understandable.

617
00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:38.280
You can go up on the sidewalk. Nobody cares. But he was around,

618
00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:42.750
he was around regular people. They spun him out. He wouldn't do they, you know,

619
00:36:42.751 --> 00:36:45.960
they fucking removed his shoulder with an SUV.

620
00:36:45.961 --> 00:36:49.200
And this motherfucker's still going at it and I just sigh, you know,

621
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:53.730
we get what you're communicating. You don't want to be here anymore.

622
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:58.650
And then that was it. Fucking unreal man gave me the creeps.

623
00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:03.540
Seeing somebody drive by knowing like this was the last like fucking 30 minutes

624
00:37:03.541 --> 00:37:08.100
of their life. Unbelievable. But having said that,

625
00:37:08.101 --> 00:37:13.101
I would rather go out like that than get lost in an underwater fucking cave.

626
00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:14.933
God Damn it.

627
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:19.170
If there were like a documentary on this gotta be something I got lost in an

628
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.270
undo, you know, and you know the deal,

629
00:37:21.271 --> 00:37:25.820
like it's always like they tell those stories and the guys like they're playing

630
00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:28.230
the creepy music and it was like, yeah,

631
00:37:28.231 --> 00:37:31.770
me and a buddy of mine decided that we were going to go explore some underwater

632
00:37:31.771 --> 00:37:33.050
caves and they just keep, you know,

633
00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.890
they start doing the reenactment and they just keep cutting the of,

634
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:40.350
they show two divers, but they just keep cutting back to the same guy.

635
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:43.440
And after like the third time they go back to and be like, all right, oh,

636
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:46.770
obviously the other dude fucking died or a,

637
00:37:46.771 --> 00:37:48.780
he got some serious fucking brain damage.

638
00:37:48.781 --> 00:37:51.120
Something happened because he's not in the documentary.

639
00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.040
What the fuck is going on? And sure enough, you know,

640
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:56.460
then there's always that creepy thing of like, well,

641
00:37:56.461 --> 00:37:59.010
how come you lived in your friend? Didn't I know what happened?

642
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:02.190
You fucking panicked and you grabbed his fucking regulator,

643
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:04.410
whatever the fuck you called it, right?

644
00:38:04.411 --> 00:38:07.320
And then you had all the air and he didn't have any and you got to go to bed

645
00:38:07.321 --> 00:38:10.530
with that every night, you know? I don't know.

646
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.810
I don't what the fuck I'm talking about. All right. Listen, I have to go to bed.

647
00:38:12.811 --> 00:38:15.810
I got some shit to do. I apologize. Happy Saint Patrick State. Everybody.

648
00:38:15.811 --> 00:38:18.170
I hope you guys had a great one. A,

649
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:21.030
I hope you guys have a wonderful fucking weekend and I know there was something

650
00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:22.500
else I wanted to talk to you about.

651
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.990
Something that happened to me early in my week.

652
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.410
Maybe on Monday, maybe I'll remember it Monday. I'll write it down. Okay,

653
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.380
that's it. Have a wonderful weekend. Your cuts and I'll talk to you on Monday.

654
00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.590
<v 4>[inaudible] is</v>

655
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.343
[inaudible].

656
00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.980
<v 5>Let's get down to the, uh, the podcast question of the week. As I said,</v>

657
00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:50.120
<v 6>well, send these things into me and I never have them in front of me,</v>

658
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:54.970
which causes long awkward pauses. Alright. Uh,

659
00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:58.070
okay. Here's the podcast question number one, Bill,

660
00:39:58.071 --> 00:40:01.430
what does an east coast transplant do on St Patrick's Day?

661
00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:05.390
You're already know what it's like in Boston and in New York City.

662
00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.950
Is it the same or does no one in La really care? Um,

663
00:40:09.951 --> 00:40:11.990
I might've mentioned this on my other podcast.

664
00:40:11.991 --> 00:40:16.010
I do not participate on St Patrick's Day. Actually went out last night,

665
00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.630
you know, I went out,

666
00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:22.070
I got myself a couple of Jameson's and I had a corn beef sandwich and that's it.

667
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:27.110
I do not go out on Saint Patrick's day is a sandwich or night.

668
00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:32.030
Same Way New Year's eve is a bunch of people who, uh, don't know how to drink,

669
00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.060
drink way too much. They wear green plastic hats.

670
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:40.340
They sing the fucking net green alligator and along nick goose all these stupid

671
00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:45.380
ass fucking songs. And uh, I dunno, it's, it's,

672
00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:49.720
it makes me sad. St Patrick's Day. It makes me sad because, uh,

673
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:53.330
when I look at what the Irish culture has chosen to focus on,

674
00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.230
it's no wonder we're all a bunch of angry psychopaths

675
00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:02.810
that uh, even when we go to therapy, evidently it doesn't affect us.

676
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:07.280
I don't know if anybody else Irish out there like you have to go to a wedding

677
00:41:07.281 --> 00:41:08.450
that's not an Irish wedding.

678
00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:12.050
I went to a Jewish wedding and I went to a wedding a long time ago.

679
00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:16.100
This girl who was a Pakistanian and the weddings, they were beautiful.

680
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.770
It was really a nice environment.

681
00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:23.000
It was all about the union of two people who were going to spend their lives

682
00:41:23.001 --> 00:41:28.001
together and a celebration of that and you go to an Irish wedding and this is

683
00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:33.380
the main focus is, is like when you get the advise like dog is it see it open.

684
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:40.090
Really, I'm fucking there. That's what it is.

685
00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:45.120
That's all people give a shit about is can I go there and get fucked up for,

686
00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:49.420
for no money. That's the big question.

687
00:41:49.421 --> 00:41:53.770
And then people get hammered and then resentments come out and then inevitably

688
00:41:53.771 --> 00:41:54.760
there's going to be a fight.

689
00:41:56.290 --> 00:42:00.610
Maybe that's why I like hockey reminds me of the weddings I went to when I grew

690
00:42:00.611 --> 00:42:03.310
up. So getting back to your question now,

691
00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:06.460
people do celebrate Saint Patrick's day out here. There's a,

692
00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.640
I go to this place out,

693
00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:13.180
Tom Bergen's down on a Fairfax just south of Wilshire because it's a,

694
00:42:13.181 --> 00:42:16.870
it's a mellow place. They got a jukebox in the corner that play in music,

695
00:42:16.871 --> 00:42:20.530
but it's like background. It's not like you're going to listen to this,

696
00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:22.240
whether you want to or not,

697
00:42:22.241 --> 00:42:27.040
sort of martial law sound system that they have and all these other bars where

698
00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:30.640
you got to sit there and scream at the person next to you how much you like they

699
00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:34.120
scream on ESPN, look at me just tying everything together that's fucking weak.

700
00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:36.310
So yeah, no, they definitely celebrate it.

701
00:42:36.311 --> 00:42:40.750
Obviously it's not the way it is back east. There's not a bunch of,

702
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:44.380
uh, there's not as many Irish people out here, but they're definitely out here.

703
00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:48.490
They definitely do drink and they wear the green hats and all that type of shit.

704
00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:53.500
But, uh, there's no parade. There's no bagpipes. There's just the booths.

705
00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:54.390
We did this just,

706
00:42:54.391 --> 00:42:58.660
just basically bare bones to the couple of corn viz sandwich just in the corner

707
00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:02.800
<v 4>and it's 12,000 kegs and a bunch of plastic crap.</v>

708
00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:51.433
[inaudible] [inaudible]

709
00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:57.850
<v 2>such right now. I did a show in Dublin, Ireland.</v>

710
00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:01.400
All the crowds were great,

711
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:06.170
but I gotta tell you those fucking people in Ireland are the funniest.

712
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:11.320
I can't even explain. I sweat it. Well,

713
00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:14.300
there's something about like when I go through Great Britain and Ireland,

714
00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:16.580
it's like Scotland and Ireland.

715
00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:21.350
They like the knuckleheads that I grew up with and when I go to London,

716
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:22.820
London is like,

717
00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:28.120
it was kind of like all the people that I met when I went to New York that were

718
00:44:28.121 --> 00:44:31.590
from Boston. So they, they did move away from where were from,

719
00:44:31.591 --> 00:44:35.160
but they still brought that thing with them because people in London are

720
00:44:35.161 --> 00:44:35.701
hilarious.

721
00:44:35.701 --> 00:44:40.701
But I was doing a show Dublin on Monday night at the,

722
00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:43.140
the, the vicar Ficker street theater or something.

723
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:47.270
Just this awesome venue and a, anyway, so it was,

724
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:51.600
it was on a Monday night and it's a really hard night to try and sell tickets

725
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:57.200
and these people showed up in force and I can't even tell you how it

726
00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:00.650
there, they were fucking hilarious.

727
00:45:00.651 --> 00:45:05.651
Like I was on stage and there was this thing I was talking about about people

728
00:45:06.591 --> 00:45:10.550
hugging their kids and now they could, pet is a good thing,

729
00:45:10.551 --> 00:45:13.760
but if you do it too much, you could potentially make a week or so. I mentioned,

730
00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:14.690
and I'll,

731
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:19.690
I haven't tell him this story for like six to eight months and I've been saying

732
00:45:19.701 --> 00:45:22.010
how that, you know, my mother wasn't a hug,

733
00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:26.030
hug her and didn't hug us when we were kids and people just listen.

734
00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:29.810
It's just a small detail that leads to this other part that I want to talk

735
00:45:29.811 --> 00:45:34.010
about. So I've said that line

736
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:38.730
uneventfully that's even a fucking word with no,

737
00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:42.870
no issue whatsoever for like six months.

738
00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:47.400
Now I'm in fucking Ireland and I just throw that laden out there like I'm not

739
00:45:47.401 --> 00:45:48.930
even thinking about it and say, yeah. He said, you know,

740
00:45:48.931 --> 00:45:52.290
my mother didn't hug me when I was a kid and I'm getting ready to see the next

741
00:45:52.291 --> 00:45:56.040
sentence. And like 15% of the crowd goes, ah,

742
00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.010
I'm not even doing it the way they did.

743
00:46:02.011 --> 00:46:05.730
It just collectively broke my body.

744
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.970
It was just such the classic fucking,

745
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:13.470
it was like that Boston Irish thing that I grew up with distilled to its purest

746
00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:18.210
form with actually real Irish people were I,

747
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:21.660
you'd almost have to be there to fucking understand what was behind it.

748
00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.470
It was like I opened the emotional door,

749
00:46:25.471 --> 00:46:29.970
just a crack in automatically. It's just,

750
00:46:29.971 --> 00:46:33.090
they just bust your balls about it. Like, yeah, you fucking, you know what?

751
00:46:33.091 --> 00:46:34.920
Like you think they, I think we got hugs.

752
00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:39.450
Your freckled can't shut the fuck up and tell the judge I can't even, it just,

753
00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:43.140
I, I've been trying to, I've tried to explain it to Nia. She laughed,

754
00:46:43.141 --> 00:46:46.890
but it still, yeah, you kinda had to be there and then,

755
00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:51.340
you know, so I laughed like when my fucking trying to get your sympathy,

756
00:46:51.341 --> 00:46:53.260
I'm trying to get through this mess. Next part you assholes.

757
00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:56.790
And the whole crowd fucking laughs. And then like a half hour later,

758
00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:02.490
what I had done when I was over there was I bought a bunch of DVDs with me. Um,

759
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:04.230
like just the, uh,

760
00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.830
basically the DVD itself with this little paper thing.

761
00:47:07.831 --> 00:47:10.440
And I was just handing them out to people cause I'm trying to get them to show

762
00:47:10.441 --> 00:47:12.600
other people, you know,

763
00:47:12.601 --> 00:47:16.830
when I'm out there so I can keep coming back. Basically trying to get them to,

764
00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.350
uh, spread the word on my comedy. And then someone's just like,

765
00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:22.200
well why don't you just put it on Spotify? You're dumb. Fuck. And I'm like, Eh,

766
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.170
cause I'm old. Alright. I feel like I have to bring the hard copy.

767
00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:27.120
So I tell these assholes

768
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.180
that I'm given them free DVDs at the end of the show

769
00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:34.510
and I'm halfway through that Spiel,

770
00:47:34.511 --> 00:47:38.280
telling them that they're getting a free DVD. All right.

771
00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.160
And I'm in the middle of it and I hate this guy in the back of the crack goes,

772
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:43.810
oh fuck off.

773
00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:53.010
I don't even think I even explained what I was doing.

774
00:47:53.011 --> 00:47:55.380
I don't know if I had gotten to the part where they were free.

775
00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.420
I don't know what the fuck.

776
00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:01.230
Oh it was the fact that I was trying to once again go to a nice place where hey,

777
00:48:01.231 --> 00:48:03.240
you know, I really appreciate you guys coming out.

778
00:48:03.241 --> 00:48:06.960
This really means a lot to me and I want to keep coming back here cause I think

779
00:48:06.961 --> 00:48:09.360
you've got a great comp country or whatever. And I just,

780
00:48:09.361 --> 00:48:13.200
just opening the door that much. Oh fuck off.

781
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:16.950
So I finally just looked at, I went, Jesus Christ,

782
00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.010
they were already left and I was like, you know what, I've played in 20,

783
00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:21.840
almost 22 years as a comedian.

784
00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:27.080
I've played in front of some miserable motherfuckers but you guys,

785
00:48:27.991 --> 00:48:29.040
and they were already laughing,

786
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:32.880
are the most miserable fucking cops I've ever been in. And they loved it,

787
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:36.570
absolutely loved it. And um,

788
00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.070
it killed me that I couldn't go out drinking with the crowd.

789
00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:43.470
<v 4>Cause I had a fucking go a had an early flight before. So</v>

790
00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:24.793
[inaudible]

791
00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:34.840
<v 2>guy and a fan who was never has never has any problems downloading your podcast.</v>

792
00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.370
Oh Jesus Christ.

793
00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:41.880
I'd send you a free fucking DVD if you gave me a fucking address money.

794
00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.660
You can't, you just can't.

795
00:49:43.661 --> 00:49:48.580
I what's with the podcast download downloaded what is with you? It's not me.

796
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:51.760
My website is fine. It's never crashed.

797
00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:55.670
<v 4>Okay.</v>

798
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:56.301
<v 2>Anyways, he say,</v>

799
00:49:56.301 --> 00:49:59.720
I mentioned that because in the comments every week your listeners seem to think

800
00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:03.530
there is some correlation between not being able to download it and being

801
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:08.360
affected. Um, first this Eaton, they're actually quoting one of my jokes.

802
00:50:08.361 --> 00:50:09.680
If you haven't seen the joke, okay,

803
00:50:09.681 --> 00:50:13.430
if you think I have a bunch of homophobes I did this bit called what do you

804
00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:17.630
effect? And it had to do with, uh, it was actually anti homophobia,

805
00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.750
although some gay people, the second they hear fag,

806
00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:25.120
they stand up and yell homophobe and what run out of the room. Um,

807
00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:29.660
I call that a story Seattle. Um, anyways. First.

808
00:50:29.661 --> 00:50:33.980
This email isn't meant at all to get you to sensor or to be PC.

809
00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:35.150
I like your stuff a lot.

810
00:50:35.151 --> 00:50:38.780
Your point of view is hilariously balls out and usually different from the same

811
00:50:38.781 --> 00:50:39.800
old comedy cliches,

812
00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:44.830
but I'm curious with all the hundreds of things you and your listeners identify

813
00:50:44.991 --> 00:50:45.824
as gay,

814
00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:51.080
do you really still think most gay guys are the old stereotypes on most sitcoms

815
00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:55.490
and in Leno's monologue jokes out? Jesus, you're going to talk down to me, sir.

816
00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:59.390
Is that what it is? Is that what you're going to do here? Yeah, I think that,

817
00:50:59.391 --> 00:51:02.510
I think you all go like the phone is hair.

818
00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:07.370
Don't you guys sing everything? He's really rarely. Of course.

819
00:51:07.371 --> 00:51:12.350
I don't think that. It's just funny and not to mention when we say stuff is gay,

820
00:51:12.351 --> 00:51:16.290
it has nothing to do with homosexuality. Okay. When you said, you know,

821
00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:20.540
you like this lamp, now it's fucking gay. Why is it gay? Look at it. It's just,

822
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:25.520
it's gay. All right. It just means it's lame staying. You know what it is.

823
00:51:25.521 --> 00:51:29.660
It just gives you that, you know, anything that gives you that feeling of, um,

824
00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:34.540
it's not love. I don't know what it is.

825
00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:39.050
Uh, what I, you know, I don't even know what the word is.

826
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.980
What does that fucking word when you're just,

827
00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.770
you know, when you just sit there, your girl like you,

828
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:51.220
you take a night off from work and you're sitting there with your girl and she,

829
00:51:51.221 --> 00:51:54.010
you know, and she, you know, if you rent a, a video,

830
00:51:54.011 --> 00:51:58.400
whatever the fuck you do now, snap your fingers and an appears in your TV.

831
00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:00.820
I'm so fucking far behind. I can even use an iPad. I don't know.

832
00:52:00.821 --> 00:52:03.670
I don't know what you kids do nowadays. Back in the door, you went to a day,

833
00:52:03.671 --> 00:52:06.310
you went to a fucking video store, all right?

834
00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:10.780
And pretended to want to watch a fucking romantic comedy when you really want to

835
00:52:10.781 --> 00:52:13.840
walk through those saloon doors and look at the poor enough, right.

836
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:16.000
That fucking feeling when you come home,

837
00:52:16.001 --> 00:52:20.170
when you're sitting there and you've made some food and your girl gets all

838
00:52:20.171 --> 00:52:23.800
excited and it's like any nice, you know, he's just dies. You know,

839
00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:27.790
it does just enjoying each other. Whatever that fucking feeling is that's gay.

840
00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:32.290
Okay. But I don't know what to call that fucking feel. And to me that's gay.

841
00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:33.700
Alright?

842
00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:37.150
Now every once in a while I'll look like a fucking chair or a lamp or somebody

843
00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:39.820
asked me to do something and I get that same feeling like, that's fucking gay.

844
00:52:39.821 --> 00:52:44.200
I don't want to do it. It has nothing to do with gay people. All right?

845
00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:46.570
So don't get sensitive on me, sir. I know you're not.

846
00:52:46.571 --> 00:52:49.420
I know this person's not being a dick. So anyways, he says, uh,

847
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:50.670
do you guys think we're all, uh,

848
00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:55.000
the gay guys and the old stereotypes of Sitcoms, uh, or in Leno's monologues?

849
00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:56.440
Um,

850
00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:00.790
is it because the ladies make you watch dope era and the view,

851
00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:06.520
the view hags who just love having gay guy girlfriends because they love

852
00:53:06.521 --> 00:53:11.290
emasculating men any frigging way they can. Oh, I get this guy.

853
00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.580
This guy's a bear. He's one of those gay guys.

854
00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:18.290
You know the kind of guy you're hanging out with on the construction site and

855
00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:21.340
somebody picks on you, right? And this guy comes to your rescue,

856
00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:25.620
fucking turns them all into a pretzel, you know, you're like, Jesus Christ,

857
00:53:25.621 --> 00:53:26.454
that's a fucking

858
00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:27.330
<v 1>guy's guy.</v>

859
00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:30.240
And then all of a sudden he just sits down and there's just something about the

860
00:53:30.241 --> 00:53:32.670
way he's crossing his legs. You're like, what the fuck is with this dude?

861
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:35.250
All right. And then one day he just says, listen,

862
00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:36.840
I've got something to tell you.

863
00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.850
I see what you're saying. I get it.

864
00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:46.060
That's like me being a German Irish guy and I'm like,

865
00:53:46.061 --> 00:53:48.490
we're not all Nazis and drunks, but you know,

866
00:53:48.491 --> 00:53:51.670
if you put on the history channel or if you go on and say, Patrick, Patty's day,

867
00:53:51.671 --> 00:53:56.500
you know, you sir, you're defined by the worst of your group.

868
00:53:56.530 --> 00:54:00.760
Unfortunately, this kind of how it works. Um, but no, I don't,

869
00:54:00.761 --> 00:54:04.690
I don't obviously don't think people like that I saw will and grace than they

870
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:08.530
are both ends of the spectrum. Will was sort of like, you know,

871
00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:13.910
just a regular guy. And then the other guy was just like,

872
00:54:13.911 --> 00:54:16.150
oh my God. Right.

873
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:22.350
<v 2>Singing my lines. No, I didn't. I thought that that guy was actually good.</v>

874
00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.990
Right? Oh, why do I answer these fucking questions? You know,

875
00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:30.220

876
00:54:30.221 --> 00:54:34.120
so do you still think after seeing the gay soldiers in the news and the boring

877
00:54:34.121 --> 00:54:38.230
normal gay marriage activist? Dude, I don't think that nobody thinks that.

878
00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.780
I actually, some people think that. No, I don't think that. All right.

879
00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:44.050
I'm just breaking balls there. Twinkle toes, um,

880
00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:46.660
are the only gay guys y just gonna keep reading the rest of this for whatever

881
00:54:46.661 --> 00:54:50.470
fucking reason. Or the only gay guys who have been out to your, uh,

882
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:54.400
out to you. Really just hairdressers in interior decorate. Sir,

883
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:56.440
how many examples are you going to give me?

884
00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:03.010
<v 1>All right. Papa. Papa. Okay. I'm done with that. No,</v>

885
00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:06.160
I don't think they're all like that. All right. So this is what I tell you.

886
00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:07.180
Yeah, I understand that,

887
00:55:07.181 --> 00:55:12.181
that some of you guys look like Mike Ditka add a act like Mike Decca yet,

888
00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:16.290
you know, don't like Mike Dick go for the same reasons I do.

889
00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:25.450
<v 2>I understand that. So I think a lot more people do understand that. Um,</v>

890
00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:28.270
you know, yeah. There's all kinds of stereotypes out there. All right.

891
00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:32.590
Look for the red headed male. You know, you think, I don't want to be a fucking,

892
00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:34.030
you know,

893
00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:37.990
start an action movie and be the guy who knows every type of karate and kick the

894
00:55:37.991 --> 00:55:39.340
shit out of people and shoot the gun.

895
00:55:39.341 --> 00:55:43.480
Do you think that ever going to give that role to a fucking freckled faced

896
00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:46.780
pasty, redheaded jackass like me than not?

897
00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:48.423
<v 1>All right.</v>

898
00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:53.020
<v 2>Who am I going to be? I'm going to be the guy who needs to be rescued,</v>

899
00:55:53.021 --> 00:55:54.520
or the guy who's good with computers.

900
00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:59.800
<v 1>All right. We all got a fucking extra grind, sir. All right,</v>

901
00:55:59.801 --> 00:56:03.490
so maybe you were just checking in, maybe you just making sure, um,

902
00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:08.220
<v 2>you know, I didn't even get his joke, a really gay question. Like,</v>

903
00:56:08.221 --> 00:56:10.420
I'm going to say that question was getting, you see what he's doing.

904
00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:13.620
He was like mocking me and showing a sense of humor at the same time.

905
00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:18.450
You see that he was testing my intelligence while flirting. Um,

906
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:21.420
I had a gay question last week. I said, what do you call a group of gay men?

907
00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:23.770
This gay guy says, evidently they're called a giggle.

908
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:28.970
<v 1>A group of gay men are called a giggle. No, they're not.</v>

909
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:33.230
There's no fucking way. All Gay guys call a group of gay men giggles.

910
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:36.200
You know who called it douchebags who happen to be gay?

911
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:40.170
I'm sure that they say that. A giggle.

912
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:43.680
F Go fucking blow someone.

913
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:45.463
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

914
00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:56.170
<v 1>Oh, I swear to God. If I was ever to have the charisma of a mass murderer,</v>

915
00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.610
that's who I would kill.

916
00:56:57.611 --> 00:57:01.900
Douchebags all groups would be allowed to stay around,

917
00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:05.590
but you would have to prove to me that you weren't a douchebag.

918
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.730
And if you then who would you make fun of?

919
00:57:45.090 --> 00:57:45.923
<v 4>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

920
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:15.430
[inaudible].
