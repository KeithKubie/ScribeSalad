TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.873
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:03.873 --> 00:00:05.890
from Google in the last week.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.470
We recently launched
the Poly API

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.720
to allow your application
to dynamically search

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.617
and download 3D assets at
both edit and run time.

00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:15.450
Check out the post
linked in the description

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.930
below for screenshots and
getting started instructions.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.690
The AIY team just announced
their next project,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.280
the AIY Vision
Kit, an affordable,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.370
hackable intelligent camera.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.090
Much like the Voice Kit, our
Vision Kit is easy to assemble

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.610
and connects to a
Raspberry Pi computer.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.300
You can get started
with the post.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.190
Apps for the Google Assistant
are the gateway for your users

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.010
to engage with your services
through Google Home, Android

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.931
phones, iPhones,
and in the future

00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:45.180
through every experience
where the Google Assistant is

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.140
available.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.450
To help you learn the best
practices for this platform,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.660
we launched a new
YouTube series.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.700
And links to the
playlist is on the post.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.130
The next release of Android
Things Developer Preview 6

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.740
is here, with a new
IOT launcher graphics

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.580
acceleration defaults, a command
line flashing tool, and more.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.709
Details on the post.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.990
If you know the basics
of building Android apps

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.090
and want to delve
deeper, take a look

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.490
at our new advanced
Android development

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.047
course built by the Google
Developers training team.

00:01:15.047 --> 00:01:17.130
Starting today, we're
rolling out the final update

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.530
to the Android 8.1
developer preview

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.160
before the official launch
to consumers in December.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.530
Android 8.1 adds
targeted enhancements

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.520
to the Oreo platform, including
optimizations for Android Go

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.290
and a neural networks API to
accelerate on device machine

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.430
intelligence.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.780
Check out the post for how to
test your app with this update.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.270
We recently eliminated
the cluster management fee

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.740
for Google Kubernetes Engine,
our managed Kubernetes service.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.650
This makes Kubernetes
engines cluster management

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.100
available at no charge
for any sized cluster

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.290
effective immediately.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.240
Folders in Cloud
Resource Manager

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.990
is a powerful tool to organize
and administer cloud resources.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.090
It gives you the
flexibility to map resources

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.620
to your organizational structure
and enable more granular access

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.710
control and configuration
for those resources.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.110
And it's now
generally available.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.920
Take a look at the post for
more details and a video.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.950
The 31st annual conference on
Neural Information Processing

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.940
Systems happened this week.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.430
But don't worry
if you missed it.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.790
This post has links to all
the papers, workshops, demos,

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.655
and more that we
presented there.

00:02:29.655 --> 00:02:34.250
We're rolling out HTML5 playable
ads in Universal App campaigns.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.320
So your users can quickly
spin a wheel, score a point,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.320
or jump into level
two right from the ad.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.230
