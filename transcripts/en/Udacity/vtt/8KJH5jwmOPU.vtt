00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.695
In the Android Fundamentals course,
you learned all about the Android

00:00:03.695 --> 00:00:07.390
manifest.xml file and how this is
used to add permissions to your app.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.430
But before you can access
location on Google Services,

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.790
you have to add the ability to use
different location sensitivities.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.070
You can specify that
you want fine location.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.470
Or you can specify that
you want coarse location.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.060
Now what are these?

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.340
Fine location updates involve
using the device's GPS,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.890
cell signal, or WiFi to get the most
accurate possible position,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.970
but possibly costing
you extra battery life.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.120
So alternatively,
you can use the coarse location, and

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.970
this gets your location using
only the cell signal or WiFi.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.640
It won't be as accurate as fine, but
it'll cost a lot less battery power.
