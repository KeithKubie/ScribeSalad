MATT GAUNT: Another Android
Office Hours from the somewhat

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.150
snowy London.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.250
My name is Matt Gaunt
I'm joined with--

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.285
CHRIS BANES: Chris Banes.

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:12.600
MATT GAUNT: Yep.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.520
And we're going to be discussing
all things Android.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.070
Here's your disclaimer, we
don't talk about future

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.850
releases, or future
announcements, or anything

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.390
that we might be doing.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.130
We are literally here to talk
about the APIs that we've got

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.840
and to try and help
you guys out.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.720
CHRIS BANES: Sorry we're
a bit late today.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.810
We ran into a couple of
technical difficulties.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.760
MATT GAUNT: One after
the other.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.570
CHRIS BANES: Yep.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.049
MATT GAUNT: But we're here.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.595
It's all good.

00:00:33.595 --> 00:00:35.240
CHRIS BANES:We got
Rich cc Giuseppe

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.983
as well in the hangout.

00:00:36.983 --> 00:00:37.350
Hey, [? Giuseppe, ?]

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.660
how are you doing?

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.592
GIUSEPPE: Thanks, good.

00:00:41.592 --> 00:00:42.842
WIEBE ELSINGA:Hi guys.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.940
MALE SPEAKER: I just joined in
case I could help with the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.840
technical difficulties.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.400
But I'm actually in Mountain
View at the moment.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.490
So it's six o'clock
in the morning.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.520
So I'm going to drop out and
leave these guys to it.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.430
I was useless anyways.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.910
I'll catch you guys later.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.170
Cheers everyone.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.420
WIEBE ELSINGA: Beware
of the jet lag.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.350
CHRIS BANES: How's
things for you?

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.550
Wiebe?

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.830
WIEBE ELSINGA:Who me?

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.980
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, Wiebe.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.220
WIEBE ELSINGA: Great,
a little bit tired.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.606
But it's the flu season so
everybody's a little bit sick.

00:01:16.606 --> 00:01:18.510
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, not good.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.225
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, I just about
managed to stave away from

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:23.450
that from CES.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.960
CHRIS BANES: Anything
interesting at

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.150
CES when you went?

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.120
MATT GAUNT: Yes, lots of new
Google TV devices were in

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.120
there, which I'm sure people
were keen to see.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.480
CHRIS BANES: [LAUGHTER]

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.560
MATT GAUNT: We announced
partnerships with ASUS,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.160
Netgear, TCO.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.850
LG announced a new set of
TVs, as did Hisense.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.880
So it was amazing.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.650
No hand involved.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.270
Hisense had massive billboards
and has snap films up

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.080
everywhere.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.630
It's a really good event,
really, really

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.540
fun place to start.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.210
Lots of Miracast devices
as well.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.460
Start to lay out
the wood work.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.730
CHRIS BANES: That's good.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.009
Cool.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.050
Any questions in the room?

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.300
GIUSEPPE: [SPEAKING
FOREIGN LANGUAGE.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.820
CHRIS BANES: Say that
again, Giuseppe.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.890
MATT GAUNT: Everyone's having
technical issues as well.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.970
CHRIS BANES: Wiebe, I know you
have a question, because it

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.010
was in the moderator.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.840
Do you want to ask it live?

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.710
WIEBE ELSINGA: Yeah.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.280
Now what we see, we see
more televisions.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.730
We see Android's
smart watches.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.320
We see Google glasses.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.496
So I was wondering if there's a
good technique to do pair to

00:02:49.496 --> 00:02:52.515
pair with different devices.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.590
CHRIS BANES: Wi-Fi direct is
the way we would prescribe

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.640
doing it from now on, really.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.810
Network discovery, I
don't really know

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:06.670
what the acronym is.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.850
MATT GAUNT: NDS, was it?

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.100
CHRIS BANES: NDS.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.415
There is a big training sample
on developer.android.com which

00:03:14.415 --> 00:03:16.990
is actually really good.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.724
That's the way I'd point you to,
mainly because it's going

00:03:18.724 --> 00:03:22.380
to be bundled through
Android from now on.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.020
And you have quicker P2P
access [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.080
So that's the way [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.150
MATT GAUNT: I think for me--

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.550
I don't think we've got to the
point where we've got a

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.480
unified API, one
size fits all.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.310
I think, obviously, Google
TV we have any mode.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.000
But that's very much the case if
you fling it off to the TV,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.900
you can discover it.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.540
But you can't then start
going backwards.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.330
Then when you start talking
about smartwatches, obviously

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.240
all of them are using Bluetooth
as their way

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.010
communication that have Wi-Fi.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.850
So I don't think there is just
a one solution fix all.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.130
Obviously if there is a service
that you can use that

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.190
does all of this for you,
then look into it.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.920
But obviously you'd start buying
into something that

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.120
they suddenly decide stop
supporting it, or they change

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.810
it, or suddenly there is a new
devices they don't want to

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.730
support, you are kind of
tied in to that point.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.480
So I think NDS stuff
is probably quite

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.600
a safe way to go.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.064
Just try and do whatever you
think is best and it fits in

00:04:18.064 --> 00:04:19.660
right with your solution.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.730
Just try to bear in mind, in the
future down the line, that

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.020
you may need to swap it out.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.780
WIEBE ELSINGA: I will follow
the tutorial online, then.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.400
CHRIS BANES: Yeah it's
a nice tutorial, nice

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.830
code and that stuff.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.730
WIEBE ELSINGA:Cool, thank you.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.130
MATT GAUNT: Cheers, Wiebe.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.390
CHRIS BANES: Hey, it's looks
like we've got more guys.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.810
We've got Yossi.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.680
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Hi, guys.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.430
CHRIS BANES: Hey,
how do you do?

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.910
YOSSI ELKRIEF: I'm fine.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.560
I have a little question
if I can ask.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.540
Or is there someone
else on the line?

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.230
CHRIS BANES:There is,
but go for it.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.500
Ask the question.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.075
YOSSI ELKRIEF: OK.

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:53.480
I'm trying to see--

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.660
to do some POC about
VideoView.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.180
And what I was trying to do is
basically have a full screen

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.030
VideoView inside a view pager.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.970
And on the video view I want to
show some custom buttons.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:23.380
But every time I try to load the
video to the VideoView, I

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.710
get an error that the video
view cannot play the file,

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.960
even though when commenting all
the buttons or all of the

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.730
draw bars on top of
the video view,

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.310
the file plays correctly.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.680
Any known issue about this,
or something like that?

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.450
MATT GAUNT: That's very weird.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.690
You're definitely just using
a plain old video viewer.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.070
You're not using the YouTube
player API are you?

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.370
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No, no, Video
View from the Android.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.860
MATT GAUNT: That shouldn't
cause an issue.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.870
CHRIS BANES: Have you tried with
the buttons, but not in a

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.870
view pager?

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.660
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, also
the same results.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.740
CHRIS BANES: It worked?

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.810
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No,
it doesn't work.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.610
WIEBE ELSINGA: Where is your
video source coming from?

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.560
YOSSI ELKRIEF: From
the SD card that I

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.220
have it on an SD card.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.455
I also tried to do it
on raw data files.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.390
WIEBE ELSINGA: And the
permissions is set correctly?

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.860
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Sorry,
didn't hear you.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.880
WIEBE ELSINGA: The permission
is set correctly?

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.800
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yes,
yes of course.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.820
I can--

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.660
if I just do a simple view
with VideoView on it, and

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.920
attach the media file, and
I just click on it.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.280
And it plays correctly.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.100
And the only problem is when I'm
starting to add the image

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:55.900
buttons, or any other text
views, or overlays on it

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.490
inside the relative layout, or
linear layout, whatever you

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:06.660
want, and the view doesn't
play the video.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.415
CHRIS BANES: Video View is
basically a glorified

00:07:08.415 --> 00:07:12.110
SurfaceView with lock integrated
media player from

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.070
[? chassis. ?]

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.510
And SurfaceView draws
differently to other views.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.350
It sort of punches right
for the window.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.000
So Android doesn't solve
optimization stuff to get it

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.365
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:25.410
And have a look at the
SurfaceView documentation,

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.770
because I remember there being
flag on there where you can

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.835
set a compatibility mode to make
it draw things on top.

00:07:31.835 --> 00:07:33.080
But I can't remember off
the top of my head.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.770
It's been a while since
I've used it.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.620
But have a look at SurfaceView
and that class of

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.530
documentation, because
I'm pretty sure

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.620
there's a flag on there.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.230
YOSSI ELKRIEF: OK I'll
try to see it.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.500
And another question, I
didn't encounter it.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.500
But we have a view pager with
a SurfaceView on it.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.580
And basically when you do the
scrolling, scroll from side to

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:00.700
side, you see a black surface.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.600
And the view doesn't render
from one view

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.120
page switch to another.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.700
You know, like on the camera
when you switch from live

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.100
video to the gallery?

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:23.645
You see the gallery has
a black overlay?

00:08:23.645 --> 00:08:25.400
CHRIS BANES: The reason for
that is because the way

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.030
SurfaceView works in that it
punches for all the windows.

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.260
So imagine your surface view is
right at the back of your

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.039
views, and it sort of
punches through.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.124
So what your actually seeing it
the very back window, the

00:08:35.124 --> 00:08:36.950
black, that's what
the black is.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.400
And it's just because
the way it draws is

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.490
different to other views.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:44.560
There's no real way around it,
unfortunately, other than not

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.940
using the SurfaceView.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.470
Obviously don't use it if you
don't really have to.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.950
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Yeah, I didn't
see it until now.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:54.620
We tried to do something with
the camera preview, and just

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.970
do a view pager scrolling
left to right.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.970
And we saw that basically
the view

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.130
doesn't completely render.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:07.970
Because on the Galaxy Nexus with
the Jelly Bean, it works

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:08.540
flawlessly.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.380
You don't see the
black rendering.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.090
On different devices, like on
the Samsung S2 or S3, you see

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:23.520
the black window stays until
the full window has been

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.530
switched in.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.320
CHRIS BANES: This is probably
fixed in Jelly Bean then.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.350
But it's just the
way SurfaceView

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.120
works, from what I know.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.710
YOSSI ELKRIEF: OK.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:36.960
Thanks guys, I'll try.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.870
MALE SPEAKER 2: Hi, can
I ask a question?

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.120
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, go for it.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.610
MALE SPEAKER 2: I have
two questions please.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.330
The first one is how to change
the Stack Overflow icon

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.760
programmatically.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:03.880
Like when switching when I have
action bar overflow, it

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.350
switches programmatically.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:06.360
Any idea?

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.290
CHRIS BANES: You want
to switch the icon?

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:09.560
MALE SPEAKER 2: The
icon, yeah.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.680
The scenario is that
I have several--

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.580
I have a split action bar, the
action bar, and then the

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.190
action mode as well, which is
the contextual action bar,

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.710
another term for it.

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:26.210
And I have two different
backgrounds for the action bar

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.360
and the split action bar.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.770
They are both in contrast
to one another.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:37.900
So the overflow looks hidden
on the dark if

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:38.620
it's light and light.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.275
And it looks hidden
in vice versa.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.200
CHRIS BANES: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.800
is to use the [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.460
and not use the [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.230
action bar.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.620
Just use action [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.160
We access [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.050
there's no way.

00:11:07.526 --> 00:11:09.892
If you get access to the source
from the drawables,

00:11:09.892 --> 00:11:11.142
then you can change it.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.660
MALE SPEAKER 2:OK.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.340
Thank you.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.610
And then my second question
is, I want to play--

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.960
Alexander, hi.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.330
Can you please turn off
the microphone?

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.316
I think we have background
noises.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.940
The microphone, not
the earphones.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.610
CHRIS BANES: It's all right,
it'll be just me anyways.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.670
Don't worry.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.100
MALE SPEAKER 2: So my
second question is

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.450
regarding HLS mime type.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:50.920
I understand that Android as
of 3.0 supports HLS plane.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:56.670
And I have problems with it
before they got fixed.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:03.140
But there isn't any HLS mime
type that triggers the

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:04.840
activity of the player.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:12.440
I gave the wrong mime type to
play the HLS just for default

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:18.800
player activity to pop up.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:24.220
But what's the mime type?

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.600
What's the formal mime type
that the default player

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.150
supports for HLS?

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.240
MATT GAUNT: I think HLS,
you want to package it

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.770
up as MP4, I think.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:42.026
And there is something in that
file which will then--

00:12:42.026 --> 00:12:43.520
where is that coming from?

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.580
MALE SPEAKER 2: So that's
what I did.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.460
I ran--

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.770
I got the MP4 mime type.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:53.350
And it runs, but there
may be players that

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.480
supports MP4 but not HLS.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.540
So--

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.780
MATT GAUNT: Well, it will be the
Android page platform that

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.430
will be supporting HLS.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.030
The way you want to do it, if
you wanted to ensure the

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:08.070
players that didn't support HLS
weren't getting played in

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.270
that way, using that file,
then you'd want to be

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.980
basically [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.040
MALE SPEAKER 2: Sorry,
I didn't get it.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.290
MATT GAUNT: You want to be using
the Android version code

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.680
if you only want it to
play the HLS stream

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.700
on Android and above.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.380
MALE SPEAKER 2: So how do I
run only the activity of--

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:31.560
I need to run, specifically, the
built-in players activity.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.810
Right?

00:13:34.969 --> 00:13:37.120
I invoke intent to
run the activity.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.080
I'm not using the player
as part of the app.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:41.790
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.690
Yeah so all you want to do
invoke the activity.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.980
You want to invoke the activity
depending on which

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.130
version of Android
you're running.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:50.930
Is that right?

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:51.900
MALE SPEAKER 2: But--

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.670
MATT GAUNT: Or HLS?

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.710
MALE SPEAKER 2: Yeah, but--

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:58.240
for example, a Samsung is
perhaps Samsung implement

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:04.880
their own activity, and
it's a different

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.560
package name or something.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.060
MATT GAUNT: So what you want to
be doing is basically using

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.110
the action underscore
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:15.610
intent, and run that way.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.990
Here's an MP4 file
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.790
is capable of playing it, or
then be given the chance to

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.040
basically [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:33.856
MALE SPEAKER 2: OK, so there
is a delay here, sorry.

00:14:33.856 --> 00:14:35.106
I'm listening.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.360
MATT GAUNT: The other thing I
was going to is, since all

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.050
versions of Android
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:44.970
play your HLS stream correctly,
you basically just

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.656
want to make sure that you
launch that intent on those

00:14:47.656 --> 00:14:48.906
versions of Android and above.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.130
MALE SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:15:01.040
But the problem is that if I run
the intent with MP4 mime

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:06.520
type, what will happened is that
players that support MP4

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:07.810
will catch this.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:12.310
But I saw some players that
support MP4, but do not

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:15.740
support HLS, which is
kind of a wrapper

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.120
around MP4, that's right.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.230
But they still don't
support it.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.690
MATT GAUNT: Could you post in
the chat which devices you're

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:27.200
referring to?

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.510
And maybe we can help
dig around.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.060
MALE SPEAKER 2: It's more like
what players are supported.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:41.490
Because if a user installs two
players that support MP4 but

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.150
from the Play store, they
install two players that

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:49.525
support MP4 but not HLS, they
won't play my video.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.208
MATT GAUNT:I guess it depends,
because if they're using a

00:15:54.208 --> 00:15:57.463
player which is implementing
their own media codex and

00:15:57.463 --> 00:16:01.550
their own encoding/decoding, and
they're not be relying on

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.470
the Android systems.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:07.330
At which point, I guess, a
difficult way would be trying

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.420
to get that across to a user.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.080
I mean, the obvious choice is
to, since you know you're

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.070
going to be able to run it on
certain devices of Android,

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.030
run it in video viewer.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.570
That way you kind of
get control of it.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.740
There's media controllers you
don't have to do any controls

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.380
or handling password, rewinding,
et cetera.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.630
So it should be relatively
trivial just to add in your

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:28.410
own video viewer, which
might be a good way

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.320
to get around this.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.320
MALE SPEAKER 2: So how do I skip
around implementing all

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:41.450
of the controllers, the fast
forward, the seek to bar, and

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:42.310
stuff like that?

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:45.520
MATT GAUNT: When you create a
video viewer you can just also

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.600
set a media controller.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.610
And then provided you set that
media controller, which,

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:52.384
again, is just a class that is
just handed to you, it'll just

00:16:52.384 --> 00:16:54.620
[INAUDIBLE] the VideoView
for you.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.870
MALE SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:04.760
So can we request to
add the HLS mime

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.180
type in future releases?

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.569
MATT GAUNT: That goes on to a
much larger issue of the way

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:14.900
HLS handles is itself.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.680
So it's not necessarily
mime type.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.510
I think that would be more to do
with a standard issue of an

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:23.170
Android just sitting there
saying here's a mime type, use

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:23.710
it for Android only.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.859
I think it would need to be a
slightly bigger discussion.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.320
I don't think that's something
we could necessarily do.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.853
Because like I said, I think
it's one of those things that

00:17:35.853 --> 00:17:38.070
Apple has obviously created
the standard--

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.620
made it so that MP4 is the
way of dealing with it.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.200
That's kind of the standard.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:49.530
Maybe it will change.

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:50.110
MALE SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:53.930
So it's kind of more of
just the activity

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:57.050
of the media player.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:00.850
It's just the activity, the
intents that the activity of

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:02.230
the media player can handle?

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:03.960
That's it, right?

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.800
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, exactly.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.480
MALE SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.730
OK, Thanks.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.800
CHRIS BANES: Anyone else
have a question?

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.070
MALE SPEAKER 3: Can
I ask a question?

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.745
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, sure.

00:18:17.745 --> 00:18:18.810
MALE SPEAKER 3: Thank you.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:23.710
So I have an app that's
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.160
that relies on [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.210
API.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:32.030
And I choose a random song
selected by genre.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.370
And then I play and the
user has to get us the

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.780
name and the artist.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.480
But I provide the registration
for these to have the

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.630
rankings and so on.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:46.550
But do I have to provide a
privacy policy inside the

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:51.100
output, or on the Google
Play store in

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.350
the appropriate section?

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.300
MATT GAUNT: So I think the
Play store changed its

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.490
regulations regarding the
privacy policies.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.890
You have one now, or--

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:04.740
CHRIS BANES: You either have to
have one, or you explicitly

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.590
say you're not going
to provide one.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.440
MATT GAUNT: OK.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.770
My recommendation would be
definitely to have one on the

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:11.770
Play store.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.470
And then if you've got a
convenient place where can

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.470
have in the app and it makes
sense for you to have it in

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.576
the app, in terms of you've got
a settings page, you can

00:19:19.576 --> 00:19:20.475
just put it into there.

00:19:20.475 --> 00:19:24.190
And you've got a nice easy way
of keeping the two in sync,

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:24.930
I'd go with that.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.890
I don't see any reason if you've
already gone through

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.780
the time to prepare it, and
you've got a spot where it can

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.770
live in the app without being in
the way, then I'd say just

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:33.350
include it.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.690
But I don't think
it's required.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:38.612
MALE SPEAKER 3: OK but it's not
a legal problem if I don't

00:19:38.612 --> 00:19:42.620
put it in there, put
it inside the app?

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.570
MATT GAUNT: It's not a legal
problem in terms of us.

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:47.440
It's more of a legal
problem, I guess,

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.530
between you and the user.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.376
I can't really comment because
I don't know that much about

00:19:52.376 --> 00:19:54.440
it, because I'm not in legal.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:59.320
MALE SPEAKER 3: No, it is
because I don't know if I must

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.080
provide a privacy policy.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.015
Because the user,
to me, is data.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:08.180
So I must protect this data.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:15.190
I have to say OK, this data
I've stored is protected.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:16.440
You are right.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.296
CHRIS BANES: I would always
bundle the privacy policy with

00:20:20.296 --> 00:20:22.680
the app, just in case
your app isn't

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.180
distributed with Play store.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.900
So if it goes into Amazon app
store or any other sort of

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.580
distribution channel, and they
don't allow you to show a

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.980
privacy policy, it's always
going to be with your app.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:33.900
MALE SPEAKER 3: OK.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:34.910
CHRIS BANES: So it's
a fail safe.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:36.340
So I would always do it.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:41.300
If you took the time to create
one, shoving it in your assets

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.660
folder and then create
a web view.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.870
It's not much work.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.160
MALE SPEAKER 3: OK, thank you.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.300
MATT GAUNT: I guess it kind of
leads on to a slightly wider

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.270
picture of [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.660
Then if the user goes through
the time to actually hunt that

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.880
out, then it probably means
that they're slightly

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.630
concerned about your app.

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.290
And it's probably good way of
putting their mind at ease.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.870
That's another way of looking
at it as well?

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.460
MALE SPEAKER 3: OK, thank you.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.270
CHRIS BANES: So have
we got any more

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:08.660
questions in the moderator?

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.750
Go ahead, Giuseppe.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:10.860
I knew you'd have one.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:11.580
GIUSEPPE: All right.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:19.140
I have a question about
the Google Drive SDK.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.240
Is this the right place to
ask for this question?

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.930
CHRIS BANES: We can try and
answer, we don't know--

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.460
MATT GAUNT: It's one where you
need Rich and Nick here.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.310
They can go around during
developer days on this.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:30.920
But go for it.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.280
GIUSEPPE: OK, that's good.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:38.680
I'm trying to get the token
[INAUDIBLE] orientation using

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.260
the new Google Play services.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.430
And I combined this with
the Google Drive SDK.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:54.590
Sometimes the Google Drive SDK,
they turn to me, and now

00:21:54.590 --> 00:22:01.780
object, no exception on the
upload of the file.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.690
But this happened very,
very randomly.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:09.390
So this is not a pack, but it
starts something concerning

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.950
the web server, or
I don't know, the

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.610
services from Driver.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.000
Anyone got some experience
about that?

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:22.750
CHRIS BANES: I'd probably guess
that it's the connection

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.430
issue, maybe?

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.980
Maybe the connection dropped out
for a millisecond while it

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.110
was uploading.

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:29.520
And it doesn't do any retrying
so you might need to do--

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.290
implement that yourself.

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:32.470
GIUSEPPE: No, I don't know.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:36.810
I already tried to clear the
cache and everything.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:41.920
I also found on Stack Overflow
a question like this without

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.860
any answers.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.110
If you want I can share
the questions.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:48.070
Because I believe that
there is some

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.460
problem with the service.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.120
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, share the
question for the Stack

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.170
Overflow link.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:55.970
And we'll try and to give it
to Rich and Nick, because

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.630
they've got far more experience
for the Drive SDK

00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.210
than we have.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:00.410
GIUSEPPE: OK.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:04.043
I will find it right now and
I will put in the chat.

00:23:04.043 --> 00:23:07.470
So you can go to another
question with someone else.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:10.210
CHRIS BANES: Thanks, Giuseppe.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:14.735
Are there any other questions
in the chat?

00:23:14.735 --> 00:23:16.526
Oh, we're going to get
some moderator.

00:23:16.526 --> 00:23:19.286
Let's get some moderator
questions on the go.

00:23:19.286 --> 00:23:20.536
Right.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:31.030
So here's a question from Jay
Dixon, who asked, as there's a

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:34.670
cache management in the Google
Play in that purchase sort of

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:38.080
flow in version for it, it's
asking how do you actually

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.780
clear the cache when you're
actually making changes to

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.740
prices, to items, to whatever
you need to, really?

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:46.730
Do you want to answer?

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.660
MATT GAUNT: No, you go for it.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.460
CHRIS BANES: OK.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:55.140
So from what I gather, when
you're making changes to your

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.730
in-app purchases, the Google
Play client will actually be

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.860
notified, and it all
invalidates cache.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.900
And so I'm pretty sure you can
just assume that any call that

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.694
you make, the cache is valid.

00:24:08.694 --> 00:24:11.260
I think that's a pretty
safe assumption.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.480
MATT GAUNT: I guess the only
time you might see issues is

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.310
it does take a long while for
updates in the Play store when

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.670
it comes to billing
to actually go

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:18.940
through to the app.

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.400
So you might have to
wait a little while

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.682
for that to go through.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.750
If you've got a more
solid example,

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:29.720
drop us another question.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.120
But yeah, I think, like
you said, Google Play

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.370
will sort it out.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.210
CHRIS BANES: Andrew Kelly has
asked, "can you please confirm

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:43.950
the current refund period on
the Google Play Store?

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.450
Is there any way
to [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.540
misses?"

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.540
MATT GAUNT: I'd like
answer to this.

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.060
No you can not do it.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.760
And the main reason I kind of
like that is [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.670
if you're trying to find that
out, I question what you're

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.300
trying to do with it.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:58.930
I like the idea.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:24:59.850
Well, I don't like the idea.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:03.110
I just can easily see how
people would take

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:05.750
advantage of that.

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.125
CHRIS BANES: It's ony
changed once.

00:25:07.125 --> 00:25:11.220
So I can't gather it's not going
to change for a while,

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.640
if it does.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.300
But we don't know.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.100
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.530
MATT GAUNT: If the Google Play
team decides they want to

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.290
change it, then it is probably
due to customer.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.550
They've obviously got a good
reason for doing it.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:25.150
Obviously that's when
we'll make a public

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:26.660
statement, et cetera.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.560
CHRIS BANES: But it's not
going to be a regular

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.130
occurrence.

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.990
It's not going to be something
that happens dynamically.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:32.590
MATT GAUNT: I think that's
point where changing it

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:34.860
regularly will confuse
developers as well as

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.630
consumers, which we
don't want to do.

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:48.243
CHRIS BANES: We've got
more questions on

00:25:48.243 --> 00:25:49.493
the monitor, actually.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:56.540
"How difficult is it to enable
printing from within Android?

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.605
How different are the APIs, the
version two and version

00:25:59.605 --> 00:26:02.400
four?" From Kevin.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.190
MATT GAUNT: I have no
experience with the

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.820
Google Print API.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.260
So I couldn't comment.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.757
Have you played with It?

00:26:10.757 --> 00:26:12.220
CHRIS BANES: I haven't
played with it.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:14.470
MATT GAUNT: I don't know,
to be brutally honest.

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.140
That might be a question
to try again next week.

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.190
We can probably copy it over
from the moderator.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:20.560
Perhaps Rich or Nick will
have a better idea.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.010
If not, we'll go away and
look at it and come

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:23.530
back with an answer.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.836
CHRIS BANES: Yeah all after
this, because these have come

00:26:25.836 --> 00:26:26.010
in recently.

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:29.930
MATT GAUNT: I might have a
chance to look at them.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.740
Have you got any
more questions?

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.630
So there's a question, "can
anyone tell me how to override

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:38.122
slash hide outgoing
calling screen in

00:26:38.122 --> 00:26:42.030
Android?" Nejandra, I think.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:43.740
I could have just destroyed
that name.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.690
I'm sorry if I have.

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.890
So yeah, Chris is kinda pointing
out that it's the

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:51.720
action new outgoing calls
broadcast which you can

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.670
essentially register
to be overridden.

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:56.520
I also recommend looking
at Sipdroid.

00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.750
It's an open source
voiceover IP app.

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.090
But generally, I'd say look at
the documentation, you'll get

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.180
a good idea of what's
going on.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.810
And then if you look at any
examples, then Sipdroid is a

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.400
quite nice way of then going
and digging around.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.680
CHRIS BANES: I'd worry
about what you're

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.470
trying to do with this.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:14.240
If you're trying to implement
calling yourself, like if your

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:14.800
trying create [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.190
[? clones ?] or something, then
yes, a valide use case.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:22.850
But if you're trying to sort
of hide someone's trying to

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:27.730
call their GSM, or whatever, I'd
worry about that, because

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:29.550
I'm not sure why you'd
need to do that.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:30.550
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, I think
it's just a bit

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:31.680
of a niche use case.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.390
I think the time I had to look
at it was a company that

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.220
wanted to tell whether you were
making an international

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.320
call or not.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.320
I'd say be very careful.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.860
Because like you say, you're
kind of just kind of

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.820
integrating really heavily
with the core purpose of

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.200
someone's phone.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.520
CHRIS BANES: Especially as
people know what the layout

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.590
is, how to sort of turn the
speaker on and off, mute, all

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:52.670
that kind of stuff.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:53.720
MATT GAUNT: I think it's the
prime candidate for just

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.620
giving a tutorial.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.081
It's like what's going to happen
when they've installed

00:27:57.081 --> 00:27:59.050
your app and enabled
certain things.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.350
CHRIS BANES: I agree.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:03.660
MATT GAUNT: So did you
want to look at some?

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:04.910
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:13.890
MATT GAUNT: If anyone has
questions live, feel

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.460
free to jump in.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.000
CHRIS BANES: So Andrew Kelly,
another question from Andy.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.600
"With the drawable note DPI
bucket, could you give an

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.480
explanation of why you would
want to use this?

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.500
And how would the image look on
an XHDPI device compared to

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.310
a MDPI device?

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:35.580
Why would I want this
to happen?"

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.510
MATT GAUNT: We just had a brief
discussion about this

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:38.760
before we came online.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.810
Basically if you think of MDPI
or DPI, et cetera, as being a

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:52.510
bucket, it's a range of pixel
density displays.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:55.340
And it kind of simplifies the
way the developers can think

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.585
about the UI in terms of just
roughly, if it's MDPI, then it

00:28:58.585 --> 00:28:59.670
will use [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.660
That's what I have to worry
about, as apposed to each

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:02.910
individual one.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.970
But it will still get some
level of scaling.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:11.010
Now say you probably don't
have that much use case

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.310
wanting to use no DPI.

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.290
Chris gave the example of where
you wanted to handle the

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.180
scaling yourself,
which is valid.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:21.430
I've used it in the past where
I've wanted to literally just

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:25.200
have a pixel perfect image for
one single device that was not

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.640
going to be distributed
anywhere.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.470
I'd argue if you were using it,
then you're probably using

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:34.160
in such a niche use case that
you're completely aware of

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.890
what the limitations
are going to be.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:39.575
But yeah, generally I'd
say most people

00:29:39.575 --> 00:29:40.460
wouldn't need to do this.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.900
Only if you need to get it out
unscaled or untouched, pixel

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:49.720
for pixel, exactly the same.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.440
I had a long answer
to that one.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:56.870
CHRIS BANES: Primary example
of when to use it is in

00:29:56.870 --> 00:30:00.570
documentation for widget
previews, as in version 3

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:04.360
onwards, you've gotten
at sort of the end.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.360
Widgets and ListView,
GridView, all

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.000
that kind of stuff.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.940
And the documentation says to
put your widget preview in the

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.150
DPI, just because the launcher
does all the scaling for you.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:18.295
As an example, it's just getting
rid of user if you

00:30:18.295 --> 00:30:19.545
want to scan yourself.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:34.900
Peter Brookes has asked, "are
there any suggestions for

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.550
respondents of apps affecting
your app, but not free, not

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:48.390
audio channels, given the
[INAUDIBLE]?" Not really.

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:55.050
There's no way you can really
control audio manager, how

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:56.580
that sort of just distributes
channels.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.930
So there is no way, really.

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:03.180
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, I think
generally it's the case of

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.040
kind of the honor system.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.310
If you're playing around with
that kind of stuff, I know

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.590
when you're told to kind of
show yourself how do it.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:16.200
I can't think of any situation
how you could overcome that,

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.230
beyond informing the user about
what's going on and

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.400
telling them we're trying to do
this but we can't, because

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.535
of other applications.

00:31:23.535 --> 00:31:25.670
Perhaps consider closing them.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:26.910
CHRIS BANES: It would be
interesting what scenarios

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.020
you've got for this,
or why apps are

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.590
using so many channels.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:33.270
It's got to be interesting how
they're trying to use so many

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:36.150
channels to sort of use
up your allowance.

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:37.530
MATT GAUNT: Yeah.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:39.040
CHRIS BANES: So if you can give
that in there, put that

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.290
in the response.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.080
MATT GAUNT: "I'm having a
persistent but sporadic

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.210
problem with my web view.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.420
It's consistent across
different handsets.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:05.370
And I have no clue on what to
do." Stack Overflow, from

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.010
Minnie Bell.

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:08.260
I like that name.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.530
So on 4.0.1, the web view
shows a blank page,

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.346
apparently.

00:32:19.346 --> 00:32:20.596
CHRIS BANES: OK.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.140
MATT GAUNT: So it looks like
they're just trying to display

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:30.120
some data just as a string,
uploading from a web service,

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.370
and doing a sort of encoding.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.880
Can't say I can give you
an answer to that one.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.355
CHRIS BANES: We'll do
that one offline, so

00:32:39.355 --> 00:32:41.200
there's not one candidate.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.970
MATT GAUNT: So it does
anyone else have any

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:46.728
questions in the hang out?

00:32:46.728 --> 00:32:48.418
Come on, someone
must have one.

00:32:48.418 --> 00:32:50.234
Oh, yeah, we haven't
looked at Hangout.

00:32:50.234 --> 00:32:51.484
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, we haven't
looked at Google+.

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.980
WIEBE ELSINGA: There's not much
questions, either, there.

00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.630
CHRIS BANES: No.

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:02.905
So we're not very
popular today.

00:33:02.905 --> 00:33:03.870
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Back to
my question about

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:05.810
the VideoView again?

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.390
CHRIS BANES: What's
that Yossi?

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:08.210
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Can
you hear me now?

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:09.610
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, I
can hear you now.

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:10.360
YOSSI ELKRIEF: OK, sorry.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.880
About the VideoView again.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:20.970
Basically what I did again, and
I just stripped all of the

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:24.130
image buttons and the drawables
and stuff from the

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:25.300
video view.

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:29.170
And put it on the view pager
and it's working.

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:30.270
On the view pager.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:32.380
CHRIS BANES: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.400
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Sorry?

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.060
CHRIS BANES: No buttons
and it's working?

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.320
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No, no buttons
and it's working.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.720
It's loading the video.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.690
I can click on it and play,
click again, and it pauses and

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:43.940
resumes, and so on.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:54.260
Any suggestions where to dig
up, or to see why when I'm

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:57.680
adding an image overlay
or something on top

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.960
of the video is--

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.086
CHRIS BANES: There's
a flag on surface

00:34:03.086 --> 00:34:04.240
view from what I remember.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:10.139
I'll have a quick dig now,
see if I can find it.

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:11.989
MATT GAUNT: I've seen people
overlay their own buttons on

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:12.880
video viewer.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.400
YOSSI ELKRIEF: I just posted
on the chat a simple app I

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.170
just stumbled upon.

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:22.170
It's called Video
Super Pop-up, or

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:23.650
something like that.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:25.120
I'm not sure.

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:33.699
And basically what it does, it
has some nice neat UI packing

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:37.710
to enable a pop-up of all the
video you will be playing,

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:40.775
basically as a drag window.

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:48.540
All over your home screen is a
widget resize-able, and inside

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:50.710
the other applications.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:55.480
And basically you have a window
with the video playing.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:59.440
And you can interact with the
entire screen with different

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.720
activities.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.665
I think it's using something
that it shouldn't

00:35:04.665 --> 00:35:06.030
use, but I'm not sure.

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:10.450
MATT GAUNT: I've seen examples
of it done a

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:11.190
very simplistic apps.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:14.990
I think my biggest concern is
the fact that because it's in

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:17.910
a view pager as well, whether
we're getting to a point where

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:20.350
something's just not
quite sitting.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:24.700
CHRIS BANES: Yossi, did you say
it's not working out of a

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.540
view pager?

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:27.460
So if you don't use a view
pager, it doesn't work either?

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.470
MATT GAUNT: You've got
the same problem.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:33.100
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No,
the same problem.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.350
I can't play video file.

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.480
Basically when I have the
VideoView inside of view

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.260
pager, it works.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.930
Outside of view pager,
it works.

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:47.510
If I add buttons on top of
it, it doesn't work.

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:50.390
CHRIS BANES: Did you say it's
not happening across--

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:54.310
is it happening across all
versions of Android?

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.510
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No.

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:57.350
I'm just testing on my Nexus
7 on my Galaxy Nexus.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:04.230
I didn't test on the Android
2.3 or Gingerbread.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:06.580
CHRIS BANES: There is a method
on surface view called "set Z

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:11.020
order on top," which will make
your SurfaceView try and draw

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:13.700
like a normal view.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:15.990
So if you can try and get access
to the SurfaceView from

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:21.110
VideoView and then call that
method, set it to true, it

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:22.360
might work.

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:28.430
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Peter Brookes
posted on the chat, "we

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:34.600
overlay buttons on video a lot
on our app." Which app?

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.300
ME code sample.

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.470
SurfaceView sets the
order on top--

00:36:46.470 --> 00:37:02.240
oh, it's a game, "Broken Sword."
"Set the order on

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.340
top."

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.480
CHRIS BANES: Yeah, can't
remember if you can get the

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.930
SurfaceView from VideoView.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.110
YOSSI ELKRIEF: No, I think I
need to override VideoView, Or

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:16.200
extend VideoView, and then
try to get some.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.300
CHRIS BANES: Extend
SurfaceView.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.460
So yeah, you can just
call "set Z order

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.160
on top" on the VideoView.

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.350
It should work.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:24.406
But it will call, I don't
know if it will work.

00:37:24.406 --> 00:37:27.382
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:35.220
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Basically it
says the order is just to

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:41.660
change the stacking of the
elements on the layers.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.370
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:45.790
I can't remember the exact
way SurfaceView works.

00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:48.400
But without it, It sort of
punches view from the back in

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.750
view window.

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:53.290
Whereas if you call true on "set
Z order on top," it does

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:56.820
some special stuff where it
kind of proxies the view.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:00.880
So it looks like it's
a normal view.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.940
I cant remember the
exact details.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:06.590
I've done this kind of thing
before, and doing that worked.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:09.133
But I don't know about
your scenario.

00:38:09.133 --> 00:38:10.430
YOSSI ELKRIEF: OK.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.660
CHRIS BANES: It would be quite
interesting if you can load up

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.930
a small sample that is doing
exactly the same thing.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:17.860
It would be interesting
to see.

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:18.150
YOSSI ELKRIEF: OK.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:25.895
I'll try to dig out only the
specific sample for the view

00:38:25.895 --> 00:38:27.313
pager and stuff.

00:38:27.313 --> 00:38:28.240
CHRIS BANES: That
would be good.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:35.170
YOSSI ELKRIEF: And maybe do
some GitHub or something.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.010
I'm not sure it will work
because basically I've tried

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:42.260
to do it in the last couple of
hours, and that's the first

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:45.960
time I saw something
like that.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:50.490
I did video views before and
never had the problem of doing

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:53.100
an image overlay on top of it.

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:54.350
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:38:56.849 --> 00:38:59.660
Yeah, I can't say I'm
familiar with it.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:01.940
MATT GAUNT: We've been joined
by someone else.

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:05.320
CHRIS BANES: That's, I
think, from earlier.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.350
Any other questions?

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:09.730
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Maybe Peter.

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:12.634
CHRIS BANES: We answered
one of Peter's.

00:39:12.634 --> 00:39:13.884
MATT GAUNT: Yeah, we answered
one of P. Brooke's.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:19.840
If not--

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.235
CHRIS BANES: Do we have
any on Google+?

00:39:22.235 --> 00:39:23.206
That one there.

00:39:23.206 --> 00:39:24.990
MATT GAUNT: Google+ was empty.

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:26.240
I think we've gone through.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.570
MALE SPEAKER 2: I'd like to
ask another question.

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:32.610
CHRIS BANES: Yeah go for it.

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:33.350
MALE SPEAKER 2: If
there's time.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:34.860
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:40.115
MALE SPEAKER 2: So how do I know
if an action is found on

00:39:40.115 --> 00:39:45.040
the split action bar instead
of the original action bar?

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.270
CHRIS BANES: You don't.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:48.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.190
MALE SPEAKER 2: With action
bar [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:51.440
perhaps?

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:53.680
CHRIS BANES: I don't know.

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:57.210
I'm sure you could somehow.

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:59.635
It's supposed to be transparent,
so you're not

00:39:59.635 --> 00:40:00.230
supposed to know.

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:02.930
You're supposed to set up the
app and then the split action

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:07.620
bar will show on certain
devices, mainly phones or

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.570
small devices.

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.680
MALE SPEAKER 2: What if I use
different backgrounds for one

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.290
light and the other one dark?

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.560
CHRIS BANES: So what was that?

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.370
You can use a light background
on the split?

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:27.300
MALE SPEAKER 2: Yeah, and dark
background on the original.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:32.690
And then I need to switch icons
to show the contrast.

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:33.940
CHRIS BANES: Oh, I
understand now.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.755
Don't think any of
the others do.

00:40:38.755 --> 00:40:39.900
MATT GAUNT: I think you
just want to give

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.150
them different IDs.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.432
MALE SPEAKER 2: I don't think
I control the IDs.

00:40:50.432 --> 00:40:54.250
I don't know what the IDs are.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:54.730
CHRIS BANES: Yeah.

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:57.340
I don't think there's any
way you can do it.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:58.590
There's no way of finding
out [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:13.460
MALE SPEAKER 2: I didn't
hear that while I

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.635
tried to record it.

00:41:15.635 --> 00:41:16.885
Thank you.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:20.920
CHRIS BANES: I don't know.

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.230
MATT GAUNT: Cool, well
I guess we don't

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:30.420
have any other questions.

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:31.940
CHRIS BANES: Looks
like we don't.

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:32.530
MATT GAUNT: Anyone else?

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:33.805
Last chance.

00:41:33.805 --> 00:41:35.410
Going once--

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:38.030
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Going twice,
sold to the guy

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:39.940
in the yellow shirt.

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.380
CHRIS BANES: OK, guys.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.170
MATT GAUNT: Thank
you very much.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.093
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Thanks, guys.

00:41:43.093 --> 00:41:43.566
Thanks.

00:41:43.566 --> 00:41:45.950
CHRIS BANES: Call next week.

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:46.850
YOSSI ELKRIEF: Bye.

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:48.100
Cheers, guys.
