Hi everybody. Welcome to Web Development. In this course, we're going to

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.730
learn how to build web applications together. Over the entire course,

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.675
we're going to be basically building a blog. A fully functional blog,

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:12.140
that'll have user registration, submitting

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.980
links, viewing, everything together, just like

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.820
a real blog. And it'll be online on the real internet,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.410
for you and anybody else to see. And by the end

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.070
of this class, in addition to that blog, I'll also get

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.630
you to build a wiki as your final exam. And I figure

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.890
if you can build a blog and a wiki and get those things online, you can build

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.920
just about anything. In this lesson, we're going to take

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.520
it from the very top. We'll start with the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.760
internet and browsers, and how these things fit together.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.610
We'll also talk about basic HTML. And we'll develop

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.190
a common vocabulary, so [INAUDIBLE] communicate through the rest

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.430
of this course. With that said, let's get started.
