00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.510
We don’t anymore nowadays much believe in
Luck – or what was, in earlier ages, known

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.570
as Fortune. We would think it extremely suspicious
if someone explained that they had been sacked,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.710
but added that this was simply the result
of ‘bad luck’. And we would think it equally

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:30.380
strange if someone said they had made a fortune,
but ascribed their triumph to mere ‘good

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:37.070
luck’. We resist the notion that luck can
play a significant role as much in our failures

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:44.859
as in our successes. Luck is a substantial
offence against modern ideals of control,

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:50.710
strategy and foresight. We understand ourselves
to be – for better and for worse – the

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:58.409
authors of our own destinies. Modern civilisation
itself could be viewed as a gigantic protest

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:05.100
against the role of chance in human affairs.
Science, insurance, medicine and public education

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.060
take up arms against luck, and have won enormous
battles against it, so many in fact, that

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.340
it has grown devilishly tempting to believe
that we may have vanquished it altogether.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:26.930
However, luck is a fearsome enemy; its territory
is fluid and its power unpredictable and tempestuous.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.300
Wisdom requires us to accept that it will
never be entirely tamed. Within every success,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.320
however ardent our efforts, there is sure
to be a substantial degree of luck. And, more

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.200
redemptively, within every failure, there
is sure to be much that cannot be ascribed

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.070
to our foolishness alone. We make small mistakes
all the time; it is only occasionally that

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.929
a modest error turns out to have devastating
consequences. There are some who already believe

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:06.770
too much in luck; who are excessively willing
to assign all the outcomes of their lives

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:14.920
to chance. They need to hear more about responsibility
and the capacity of individuals to transform

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.560
their circumstances. But, in many ways, these
passive actors are ever less common in the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.030
modern world. For the rest of us, those who
operate with a daunting feeling of personal

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.510
responsibility, who will constantly push themselves
to match their highest expectations and berate

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.460
themselves for failure, a reverential belief
in luck should be far more than a historical

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:52.160
curiosity. It remains a crucial concept to
take the edge off our arrogance and, when

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:59.040
fate has turned against us, to temper the
violence of our self-hatred.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.760
