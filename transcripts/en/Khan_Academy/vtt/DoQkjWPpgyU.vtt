00:00:02.858 --> 00:00:05.378
- Hi, this is Sal Khan,
founder of the Khan Academy.

00:00:05.378 --> 00:00:07.714
And I just wanted to let you
know about the Breakthrough

00:00:07.714 --> 00:00:11.371
Junior Challenge in
conjunction with Khan Academy.

00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:12.854
And for those of you who aren't familiar

00:00:12.854 --> 00:00:14.480
with the Breakthrough Prize,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.755
it's an incredibly prestigious
set of prizes awarded

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:20.717
every year to the world's
leading mathematicians,

00:00:20.717 --> 00:00:23.481
biologists, chemists, physicists.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:26.082
And the idea is to award
people who are literally

00:00:26.082 --> 00:00:28.479
moving humanity forward
through the sciences

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:30.165
and through mathematics.

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:31.851
And what we're going this year
is we're going to extend it

00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:35.082
even further where we're going
to have a Breakthrough Prize

00:00:35.082 --> 00:00:36.321
for high school students.

00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:39.023
That's what the Breakthrough
Junior Challenge is.

00:00:39.023 --> 00:00:43.554
And the idea is, is to award
people who can explain things

00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:45.444
in a new and innovative ways.

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:47.678
Ways that can open up all of our minds.

00:00:47.678 --> 00:00:49.445
Because the big breakthroughs,
the types of things

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:51.925
that the Breakthrough Prizes award,

00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:53.754
these all start with new insights,

00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:55.724
new ways of looking at the universe.

00:00:55.724 --> 00:00:58.994
And these new ways of looking
at the universe often happen

00:00:58.994 --> 00:01:01.332
with the people who are
just starting to look at it.

00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:02.712
It might happen with young people,

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:04.256
especially high school students.

00:01:04.256 --> 00:01:05.944
So we're going to give this prize,

00:01:05.944 --> 00:01:07.507
it's going to include a scholarship,

00:01:07.507 --> 00:01:09.336
it's going to include a
prize for your teacher,

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:11.753
and a possible lab for your school.

00:01:11.753 --> 00:01:14.233
And we're going to give this
for students who can explain

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:17.422
either and existing concept in a new way,

00:01:17.422 --> 00:01:18.986
in a way that opens our minds.

00:01:18.986 --> 00:01:22.075
Or a new idea that they came up with,

00:01:22.075 --> 00:01:24.492
or a new discovery that they came up with.

00:01:24.492 --> 00:01:26.910
So, it's a very exciting
thing to be part of.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.837
I really believe that we're
going to hopefully inspire

00:01:29.837 --> 00:01:32.661
another generation of potential
Breakthrough Prize winners.

00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:36.479
And I think even this competition

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.348
is going to open our minds.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:41.945
It's going to make us all
see the world in a new

00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:43.245
and exciting way.

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:47.898
And if you win, you will come
out here to Silicon Valley,

00:01:47.898 --> 00:01:51.068
and you will share the
stage with both people

00:01:51.068 --> 00:01:54.297
from Silicon Valley, leaders
in the tech community,

00:01:54.297 --> 00:01:55.333
leaders in science.

00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:58.381
You'll share a stage with the winners

00:01:58.381 --> 00:01:59.804
of the Breakthrough Prize.

00:01:59.804 --> 00:02:02.202
And there'll be a few
Hollywood celebrities out here.

00:02:02.202 --> 00:02:04.233
It's going to be televised
on national television.

00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:07.097
So, this is going to be a
really, really, really fun event.

00:02:07.097 --> 00:02:08.946
But most importantly, I
think we might be able

00:02:08.946 --> 00:02:10.591
to move society forward.

00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:11.857
Thank you.
