DANNY HERMES: I specialize in
the Shopping APIs, the Content

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.210
and Search APIs for Shopping.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.290
And today, like we do every
other week, we'll be talking

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.280
about the Content API
for Shopping.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.960
I have here with me one of
our more significant--

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.130
not more significant,
more vocal--

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.440
community members,
Andrew Lamonica.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.210
And we're going to be recapping
I/O, talking a bit

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.380
about some library changes,
and then reviewing a new

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.030
change to the API, a new feature
that was added since

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.850
our last Hangout.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.790
So first let's talk about I/O.
So I have some things I want

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.850
to show you.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.860
So if you go to
developers.google.com, we have

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.880
all the event data from every
talk that was at I/O, but in

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.350
particular the two
talks we gave.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.680
So we gave a talk--

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.090
myself and our product manager,
Mayuresh Saoji--

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.420
gave a talk on making Product
Search, or making Google

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.780
Shopping, work for you using
the Content API.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.825
And as you can see here, this
is at developers.googl

00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:21.640
e.com/events/io/
sessions/gooio2012/400.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.612
Our talk was title 400.

00:01:24.612 --> 00:01:27.200
Excuse me, it was number 400.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.770
And on this page, we
have a YouTube

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.640
video of the talk itself.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.960
So if you want to watch
the talk in its

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.320
entirety, you're free to.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.810
We have the abstract.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.730
We have some headshots, if
you miss seeing my mug.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.035
And we also have the slides.

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:51.040
Don't want to do that.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.480
So here you see my slide that
can actually be viewed.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.270
So I'll go over a few
highlights from that

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.570
talk in a short bit.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.190
But I also want to emphasize
the other talk we gave.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.460
We talked about empowering Local
Shopping through Google

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.680
Product Search or through
Google Shopping.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.710
This was not myself but
two of our wonderful

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.360
engineers from Zurich.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.590
The video, again, in this link--
the talk was number 401

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.060
rather than 400, but all the
rest of the link is the same.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.210
Their presentation can also
be retrieved as a PDF.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.610
My presentation was
an HTML5 deck.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.090
So you can actually see it the
same way it was presented.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.870
And of course, there's some
headshots and an abstract, as

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.540
well, before you get into it.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.690
So before I talk about my talk,
a bit about theirs.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.900
They talked about how you can
set up a Google Places account

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.350
to actually have local product
data associated with your

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.930
Google Merchant Center
account.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.800
And then from there, they used
the Content API to insert an

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.340
item with channel equals
local rather than

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.790
channel equals online.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.100
And then they used the inventory
feed, which is one

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.180
of our feeds other than the
products feeds, to actually

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.310
insert item data for particular
stores associated

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.180
with the Places account
they created.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.170
It's a pretty interesting
use case.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.920
For people who are interested in
setting up a Local Shopping

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.970
account, they have contact
information towards the end of

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.850
their video for who within
Google you can contact for

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.920
getting that set up.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.010
So for my talk, some of the
things I talked about that I

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.750
want to review.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.110
The first thing we talked about
was the Debug dashboard.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.540
And this was a dashboard that
allows you to review errors

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.460
with your products
after the fact.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.480
So if you have an insert that
fails or an update that fails

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.270
or a delete that fails using the
Content API, then you'll

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.590
get the response immediately.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.680
But if you don't log that, then
the response just goes

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.250
away when the process with the
RAM that's holding that

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.070
response dies.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.370
It just gives the memory back
to your machine, right?

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.070
So if for some reason you're not
saving that, persistently,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.350
locally, and you have a huge
spike in errors and you want

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.040
to find out what happened, you
can use the Debug dashboard to

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.700
actually determine
what happened.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.240
Another thing that
we discussed--

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.079
something which we hadn't really
had a whole lot of

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.240
fanfare on the launch-- was
the Data Quality API.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.830
And that API is another
service, just like the

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.730
Inventory service or the
Products service that I've

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.100
already discussed today, as
well as the Multi-Client

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.130
Account service that people
are familiar with.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.990
But the Data Quality service
within the API will actually

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.550
allow you to get the same data
quality report that you can

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.430
get in the Merchant
Center dashboard.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.610
And this is really great for
things like updating certain

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.830
information, if you have
price discrepancies or

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.950
other things like that.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.240
So I highly encourage either
checking out the deck or

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.260
watching the slides or both.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.970
So there are two other things
I want to discuss before I

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.150
open the floor for questions
from Andrew.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.300
From what I hear, he doesn't

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.820
necessarily have any questions.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.140
But two other things
I want to discuss--

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.150
oh, Caroline's here.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.440
ANDREW LAMONICA: Caroline's
here.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.590
DANNY HERMES: Wonderful.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.420
One of our .net library
users is here.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.050
And she'll be happy to
hear the next thing I

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.520
was going to announce.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.140
In the weeks leading up to I/O,
as well as the week after

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.490
I/O, I was able to write some
patches for the four services

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.720
that we were missing
that are offered

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.110
within the Content API.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.520
So we had implemented, prior
to Google I/O, the Products

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.130
service, which is the main one
you're using, as well as the

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.700
Manage Accounts service.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.600
And in addition, we
also implemented

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.680
the four other services.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.680
So there's the User Feed, which
allows you to determine

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.030
the users associated with a
particular Merchant Center

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.010
account, as well as to change
permissions, to add new users,

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.880
or to remove users from
a particular account.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.850
This is particularly
relevant for people

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.740
who use managed accounts.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.700
Because if they're creating a
new sub-account for one of

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.390
their clients, and maybe they
want their clients to be able

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.570
to see the data within that
sub-account, they can

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.990
programmatically add
those accounts--

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.180
or excuse me, they can add those
users to that account

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.600
using the user's API.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.710
So we've added that service.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.570
In addition, we've added
the Data Quality API.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.690
This is something Caroline
personally asked for in one of

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:29.790
our previous Hangouts.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.030
So we've implemented a
particular function within our

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.210
Content API service which
allows for this.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.220
In addition, we have
implemented--

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.480
what are the other services?

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.450
We've implemented the Inventory
service, which is

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.450
what you'll be using
for Local Shopping.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.120
And finally, we have
implemented--

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.390
it's just on the tip
of my tongue.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.640
What is the fourth service?

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.780
So I can't think of
it right now.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.500
Let me just go to our
documentation and just find

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.740
out what it's called.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.280
So I'm navigating to
our wonderful Docs,

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.020
developers.googl
e.com/shopping-content.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.210
So we have the inventory feed.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.560
We have the users feed.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.340
We have-- ah, of course.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.900
The data feeds feed.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.980
So this is a feed which has been
around a long time but

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.840
isn't necessarily used too
much by our developers.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.380
But it allows you to set up
scheduling for data feeds

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.080
files through the API.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.750
Now, this sort of contradicts
our best practices.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.540
But some people who are mixing
and matching data feeds with

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.210
the API can actually find
this feature useful.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.435
So we implemented those four
services in addition to the

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:51.420
two that were existing.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.480
Now, we didn't have anyone
request it, but we also

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.340
implemented these in the
Python client library.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.520
And I'm currently wrapping up
the additions to our PHP

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.150
client library.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.080
So people who are wanting to
access services other than the

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.450
Multi-Client Account service
and other than the Product

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.230
service will actually
be able to,

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.310
using our client libraries.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.870
So Caroline, do you have any
particular questions about

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:16.710
these implementations?

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.730
Have you had a chance to look
at them, before I move on to

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.300
the third and final talking
point I have?

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.040
CAROLINE: I have not had a
chance to look at them.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.440
So I'll have to do that.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:26.775
Sorry.

00:08:26.775 --> 00:08:27.460
DANNY HERMES: No, no.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.180
It's no worries.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.320
They were a single commit
for each service.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.340
So we had four commits.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.549
And I think they're all at the
head or the tip of the SVN

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:37.530
repository.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.159
And then I don't know if there's
been a release yet.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.400
I'm pretty sure there was a
release after the fourth

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.390
commit, because it was
so much new code.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:48.190
But I have a seat right next
to the maintainer of the

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.840
library now.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.200
I just moved my seat recently.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.140
And I was able to poke and prod
him after I/O, to say,

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.280
hey, here's my commits.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.420
Can you get them in?

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.810
And can you release
it quickly?

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:02.740
So like we discussed in early
June or maybe late May, you

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.040
wanted support for the
Data Quality API.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.880
Well, now we have it.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.600
So I hope you use it.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.660
I hope you find the API
within the service

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.290
object easy to use.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:17.630
If not, I greatly encourage
you to tell me what I did

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:18.890
wrong and how it
can be better.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.110
Because I'm happy to
make those changes.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.960
CAROLINE: Awesome.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.430
Thanks.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.970
DANNY HERMES: Yeah.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:26.730
And so the final thing I wanted
to talk about today is

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.010
some updates we made.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:31.620
I'll need a new tab for this.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.890
Some updates we made to the
Manage Accounts feed.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.750
And this is particularly
relevant given some of the

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:41.420
changes that were announced
recently around the move to

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.260
associating with AdWords product
listing ads campaigns.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:51.580
So within the Multi-Client
Accounts feed, which I will go

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:56.540
to in a second, we have added
the ability to associate an

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.760
account with an AdWords
account.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.830
So we've just added a
sub-attribute within the SC

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.350
namespace called
adwords_accounts.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:10.620
And using this, you can have
child elements, which are at

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.660
the attribute adwords_account--

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.620
not accounts, the singular
rather than the plural.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.510
Again, in the SC namespace.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.770
And you can say whether that
account is active or inactive.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.750
And then, of course, the value
of these XML attributes will

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.800
just be the AdWords
account ID.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:31.450
And an AdWords account ID is a
10-word ID with three digits

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.900
separated by a hyphen, and three
more digits separated by

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.100
a hyphen, and then the
final four digits.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.410
So a bit about using this.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:44.800
So this obviously needs to be
used with the MCA feed, the

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.050
Manage Accounts feed.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.240
So for someone who doesn't use
Multi-Client Accounts, they

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.380
won't be able to use the API
to associate a particular

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.760
sub-account with an
AdWords account--

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.180
a sub-account within
the Merchant Center

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.130
account, that is.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.150
And the logic behind this is,
if you're not using a

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:05.320
Multi-Client Account, then
chances are going through the

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.540
settings through the actual
Merchant Center probably is

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.060
not as difficult.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.420
But if you're managing thousands
or tens of thousands

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.180
or even just tens of accounts,
going through the Merchant

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.930
Center and doing these AdWords
accounts associations by hand,

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.380
for even 10 accounts, is
probably not going to

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.240
be worth it, right?

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.500
So a little bit about
how this works.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.460
If you currently don't have any
AdWords account associated

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.620
with your account, or if you
create a new account and you

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.300
don't send AdWords accounts,
what you'll get in the

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.870
response is just an empty
AdWords accounts link.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:45.770
And if you send in an insert
request or in an update

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.280
request, if you send an empty
AdWords Accounts link, it'll

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.960
actually delete any
association--

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.780
excuse me, not an AdWords
Accounts link.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.040
An AdWords Accounts
XML element.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.650
If you send an empty XML AdWords
Accounts element, then

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.110
it will actually delete any
associations you have.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:06.330
However, if you don't send any
AdWords Accounts element, it

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.400
won't make any changes to
your existing account.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.770
But it will return an element
that has the current list.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.020
So it will always be
in the response.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.970
But it's not required to
be in the request.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.780
And the reason is for backwards
compatibility,

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.600
people who have implementations
which aren't

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.440
sending the element, we don't
want them to leave it out and

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.790
then either A, cause an error
in their feed, or B,

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.640
accidentally delete
associations they

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.920
didn't mean to delete.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.890
So that kind of describes the
functionality of that.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.460
Do either of you have
any questions?

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.050
Andrew, we discussed
a little bit before

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:40.230
we started the Hangout.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.110
I figured you may have
some questions after

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:43.620
I demoed this feature.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.680
But I wasn't sure if
it was interesting

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.420
enough for you to care.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:52.172
Because I know you guys aren't
using Multi-Client Accounts.

00:12:52.172 --> 00:12:55.990
ANDREW LAMONICA: We don't really
have enough to do that.

00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:00.450
But I may use the GET portion
to provide some extra

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:03.160
functionality to our
internal tools.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.850
Because marketing is a different
department than

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.100
engineering.

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:13.780
I think the biggest problem
we have with

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.280
AdWords right now is--

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.670
or at least the biggest
questions we have are related

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:26.160
to how the URLs are going to be
handled post-migration to

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.550
Google Shopping.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:29.940
Because we're going to want to
make sure that our tracking is

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.490
online on day one.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.520
And right now, we send different
tracking codes

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.560
through the different URLs.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.190
There's One for Google Shopping,
one for AdWords.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.800
Is there any news on that yet?

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.375
DANNY HERMES: No news yet.

00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:45.566
I haven't heard a whole lot.

00:13:45.566 --> 00:13:50.090
The team is working every day,
obviously, to try to figure

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.770
out the best way to
do this migration.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.760
And when we know more,
we're certainly going

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.430
to write about it.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:56.640
We'll blog about it.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.220
We'll update our Docs,
et cetera.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.170
Your question, in particular,
I'm going to ask the team

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.030
about, ask what the plans
are, and see if

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.160
we can get an answer.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.360
If we can, I'll post
it to the forum.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.830
And maybe we can discuss it in
our next Hangout two weeks

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.100
from today.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:17.300
But if not, I'll try to give you
an update on the timeline

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.060
on when we will know.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.090
And by the way, our next Hangout
is going to be two

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:22.860
weeks from today.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:27.360
So that'll be July 33, or August
2 for those who are

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.050
using calendars like
normal people.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.430
Caroline, do you have any
questions, as well?

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.350
And also, Andrew, if you have
other questions that you want

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:39.470
to see answered about the
migration, beyond URLs and

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.560
things like that, feel free.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.560
I'll be able to use
this video.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.810
I'm not taking notes
right now.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:49.860
But I can take notes after the
fact and take those questions

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.870
back to the appropriate teams.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.125
So Caroline, do you have
any questions?

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:54.420
CAROLINE: I do not.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.480
I've actually been pushed
onto a different project

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:56.640
temporarily.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.940
So I'm just trying to
keep up with things

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.740
until we return back.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:01.300
So you know how it goes.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.232
DANNY HERMES: Sure, sure.

00:15:03.232 --> 00:15:04.310
ANDREW LAMONICA: I do have--

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:05.520
I will make my--

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.920
I think I've made this
in the past.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.000
But I'll make it
one more time.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.320
DANNY HERMES: Please do.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:08.860
Please do.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.050
ANDREW LAMONICA: My push
for a feature request.

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:16.370
It would be great if we could
get impressions data back on

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.480
the individual products.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.485
DANNY HERMES: Yes, yes.

00:15:19.485 --> 00:15:21.600
ANDREW LAMONICA: Because we're
trying to pick what products

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.030
we're going to want to really
feature in the new world.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.700
DANNY HERMES: So nothing
to announce right now.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.680
But keep your eyes peeled.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.200
Andrew and I actually discussed

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.870
this at I/O, in person.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.220
He was one of our guests.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:38.010
So it was actually great
to see him in person.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:44.610
And it is a feature that we've
seen asked for quite a bit.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.080
And it is something that we're
trying to figure out the best

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.010
way to implement.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:49.760
Like I said, nothing to
announce right now.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.890
But keep your eyes peeled on the
commerce blog and on the

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.060
forum and other places.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.530
By the way, Caroline, thanks
for coming to the Hangout,

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.700
given the fact that you're
not actively working on

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.560
implementation right now.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.740
It's great to have you as a part
of the community still.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.100
CAROLINE: And I only missed
the last two.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.460
Because one I was on vacation.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.517
And then one I forgot you
switched till Tuesday and I

00:16:08.517 --> 00:16:08.930
was like, oh no!

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:14.940
DANNY HERMES: So there wasn't
one since the Tuesday one,

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.870
because of I/O. We sort
of had a big hiatus.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:17.830
CAROLINE: Sweet.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.200
DANNY HERMES: So you've
only missed one.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.340
CAROLINE: That's exciting.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.650
I'm feeling good.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.760
DANNY HERMES: So Andrew, I think
I've taken sufficient

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.400
mental notes.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.700
I don't think I need to actually
go back and watch the

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.770
video after the fact.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:29.930
You want to know two things.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:30.940
How are we going to be handling

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.230
URLs for these campaigns?

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.600
And when--

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.410
or if-- are we going to get
impressions data with the SC

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:42.480
performance block that we get
back when we make GET requests

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.135
for particular items specifying
performance start

00:16:45.135 --> 00:16:47.740
and performance end, which is
a great feature if people

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.310
aren't using it, which maybe
we'll talk about in a Hangout

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:52.830
in the future.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:53.990
OK, guys.

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:55.990
If you don't have any other
questions, we'll wrap up and

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.150
we'll see you July 33.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:03.190
August 2, that is, for people
who want me to be correct.

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:04.020
ANDREW LAMONICA: All right.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:04.170
Thanks, Danny.

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:04.964
DANNY HERMES: All righty.

00:17:04.964 --> 00:17:05.640
CAROLINE: Sounds great.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:05.950
Thanks, Dan.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:06.730
DANNY HERMES: See you guys.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:07.980
CAROLINE: Bye.

00:17:13.674 --> 00:17:14.924
DANNY HERMES: Cool.
