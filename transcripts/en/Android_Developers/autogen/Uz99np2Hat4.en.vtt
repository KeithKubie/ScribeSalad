bit today so you can get the most out of

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320
bit today so you can get the most out of
 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.530
bit today so you can get the most out of
vectors too and realize these benefits

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540
vectors too and realize these benefits
 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.709

your app probably look something like

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680
your app probably look something like
 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.440

this they have some parts and they're

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450
this they have some parts and they're
 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.680

probably hard coding a color and

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690
probably hard coding a color and
 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.970
probably hard coding a color and
something like this fill or stroke here

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980
something like this fill or stroke here
 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.860
something like this fill or stroke here
maybe you're using a color resource like

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
maybe you're using a color resource like
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.510
maybe you're using a color resource like
this and but there's actually a lot more

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520
this and but there's actually a lot more
 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.770
this and but there's actually a lot more
you can do here which I want to talk

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
you can do here which I want to talk
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.350
you can do here which I want to talk
about and the first thing is using theme

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360
about and the first thing is using theme
 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.020
about and the first thing is using theme
colors so you can use team colors in two

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030
colors so you can use team colors in two
 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.240
colors so you can use team colors in two
ways really the first is by applying a

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
ways really the first is by applying a
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.610
ways really the first is by applying a
theme color as a tint and this will tint

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
theme color as a tint and this will tint
 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.349
theme color as a tint and this will tint
the entire drawable and based on the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
the entire drawable and based on the
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.179
the entire drawable and based on the
current theme so here I'm using the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189
current theme so here I'm using the
 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.890
current theme so here I'm using the
theme attribute color control normal

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
theme attribute color control normal
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.289
theme attribute color control normal
which is the normal color for icons and

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299
which is the normal color for icons and
 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.030
which is the normal color for icons and
as search you can have one single asset

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040
as search you can have one single asset
 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.429
as search you can have one single asset
which displays in different themes say a

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
which displays in different themes say a
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.080
which displays in different themes say a
like screen or a dark screen and it gets

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
like screen or a dark screen and it gets
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.730
like screen or a dark screen and it gets
tinted to be the right color you've no

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
tinted to be the right color you've no
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.230
tinted to be the right color you've no
longer have to worry what color asset

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
longer have to worry what color asset
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.640
longer have to worry what color asset
you got from your designers in the SVG

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
you got from your designers in the SVG
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.469
you got from your designers in the SVG
and that they got exactly the right

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
and that they got exactly the right
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.450
and that they got exactly the right
shade of gray that you need and it'll be

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
shade of gray that you need and it'll be
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.170
shade of gray that you need and it'll be
tinted at runtime so is always correct

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180
tinted at runtime so is always correct
 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.429
tinted at runtime so is always correct
you can also use theme colors and

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439
you can also use theme colors and
 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.649
you can also use theme colors and
directly in the fill or stroke so in

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
directly in the fill or stroke so in
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.910
directly in the fill or stroke so in
this example here I'm going to use color

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920
this example here I'm going to use color
 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.649
this example here I'm going to use color
primary so say you have different

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659
primary so say you have different
 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.060
primary so say you have different
screens in your app like say a sports

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070
screens in your app like say a sports
 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.429
screens in your app like say a sports
app which uses a theme for a given team

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439
app which uses a theme for a given team
 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.560
app which uses a theme for a given team
you can reference that theme color so

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
you can reference that theme color so
 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.940
you can reference that theme color so
you can have a single drawable which

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950
you can have a single drawable which
 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.649
you can have a single drawable which
just parts of it get colored based on

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659
just parts of it get colored based on
 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.899
just parts of it get colored based on
the theme which can be useful cool

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909
the theme which can be useful cool
 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.219

lists so vector support and pressing

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180
lists so vector support and pressing
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.340

state we're changing color or perhaps

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
state we're changing color or perhaps
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.719

you have a list app and where when a row

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
you have a list app and where when a row
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.639
you have a list app and where when a row
item is selected you could have changed

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
item is selected you could have changed
 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.620
item is selected you could have changed
the rendering using and using that state

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630
the rendering using and using that state
 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.030
the rendering using and using that state
you could do this with a normal

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040
you could do this with a normal
 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.740
you could do this with a normal
stateless drawable and to drawables and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750
stateless drawable and to drawables and
 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.660

want to change like the stroke here this

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
want to change like the stroke here this
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.900
want to change like the stroke here this
saves some duplication and you define it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910
saves some duplication and you define it
 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.190
saves some duplication and you define it
like this like a regular color state

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
like this like a regular color state

you would like a color resource unless
my favorite feature is gradients and so

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180
my favorite feature is gradients and so
 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.699
my favorite feature is gradients and so
vectors support three different types of

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709
vectors support three different types of
 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.290
vectors support three different types of
gradients a linear radial and sweep

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300
gradients a linear radial and sweep
 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.690
gradients a linear radial and sweep
which you define like this so a linear

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700
which you define like this so a linear
 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.490
which you define like this so a linear
gradient has a start and end XY

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500

coordinates a radial has a center and a
 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.290
coordinates a radial has a center and a
radius and a sweep just has a center

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300
radius and a sweep just has a center
 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.600
radius and a sweep just has a center
point I've so far been using the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610
point I've so far been using the
 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.059
point I've so far been using the
shorthand of start and or even center

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069
shorthand of start and or even center
 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.800
shorthand of start and or even center
colors to define gradients you can

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810
colors to define gradients you can
 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.150
colors to define gradients you can
actually get much more fine-grained and

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160
actually get much more fine-grained and
 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.430
actually get much more fine-grained and
embed these item tags inside it to

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440
embed these item tags inside it to
 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.380
embed these item tags inside it to
define individual color stops so here

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390
define individual color stops so here
 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.780
define individual color stops so here
I'm going for a specific color at 72% of

I'm going for a specific color at 72% of
 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.570
I'm going for a specific color at 72% of
the way through like let's let lets you

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580
the way through like let's let lets you
 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.979
the way through like let's let lets you
define gradients in a color resource

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989
define gradients in a color resource
 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.870
define gradients in a color resource
directory or you can use the inline

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880
directory or you can use the inline
 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.600
directory or you can use the inline
resource syntax to embed it inside the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610
resource syntax to embed it inside the
 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.370
resource syntax to embed it inside the
vector definition itself and at Build

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380
vector definition itself and at Build
 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.170
vector definition itself and at Build
time a apt will actually extract that to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180
time a apt will actually extract that to
 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.820
time a apt will actually extract that to
a color resource and insert a reference

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830
a color resource and insert a reference
 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.490

beneath the jetpack Droid and so I did

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620
beneath the jetpack Droid and so I did
 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.440
beneath the jetpack Droid and so I did
this by just drawing a circle and with a

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450
this by just drawing a circle and with a
 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.240
this by just drawing a circle and with a
radial gradient and then using the scale

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250
radial gradient and then using the scale
 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.310
radial gradient and then using the scale
Y feature to transform it to produce the

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320
Y feature to transform it to produce the
 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.729
Y feature to transform it to produce the
effect that I was after if the gradient

mode to control how it fills the rest of

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900
mode to control how it fills the rest of
 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.539
mode to control how it fills the rest of
the area so in this example and the

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549
the area so in this example and the
 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.400
the area so in this example and the
default mode of clamp it just continues

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410

which don't go through different colors
 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.060
which don't go through different colors
so by using the same color between two

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070
so by using the same color between two
 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.400
so by using the same color between two
stops and having the next stop start at

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410
stops and having the next stop start at
 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.479
stops and having the next stop start at
the same point you'd have these solid

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489
the same point you'd have these solid
 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.039
the same point you'd have these solid
solid color blocks like why would you

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049
solid color blocks like why would you
 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.630
solid color blocks like why would you
want a gradient it doesn't do that well

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640
want a gradient it doesn't do that well
 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.950

to make some kind of pattern support so
 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.900
to make some kind of pattern support so
this is the gradient over this area and

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910
this is the gradient over this area and
 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.460
this is the gradient over this area and
the part of the tile mode repeats it to

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470
the part of the tile mode repeats it to
 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.810
