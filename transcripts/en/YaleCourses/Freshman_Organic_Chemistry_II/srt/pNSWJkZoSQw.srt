1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,940
Okay. We're still talking
about addition to alkenes

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,330
and we've looked at these various,
uh,

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,550
electro file come nuclear
files and into alkenes.

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,770
And now at the beginning of last time,

5
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:21,771
we introduced the idea of Osmium tetroxide
and we'll go on to per Megan aid as

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,050
reagents for Di hydroxylation of alkenes.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,950
Then we'll go onto things
involving transition metals,

8
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,810
catalytic hydrogenation, and
also metathesis and, and, uh,

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,460
catalyzed polymerization.

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,070
So last time we looked at the end that
Oso for which looked a little bit like oh

11
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:46,071
three and could do the same trick oh
three could do to give this Awesomei

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,140
Tester, which is like an asset towel. Uh,

13
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:54,141
so it's possible to add water and get
the osmium equivalent of a carpet eal

14
00:00:55,351 --> 00:01:00,330
group and the two a hydroxyl groups
added to the Termini of the alkene.

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,980
So, uh, the problem with this is always,

16
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,070
oh four is a very
efficient reagent for that,

17
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:11,310
but it's poisonous and
it's also very expensive.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,060
So you have to figure out some
way not to use so much of it.

19
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:20,430
And the way you could do it is to use
just a little bit of it as a catalyst and

20
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:23,460
put hydrogen peroxide in there,
uh,

21
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,380
in order to convert the osmium equivalent
of trioxide back to the tetroxide

22
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:32,880
again so it can cycle around and
keep doing, uh, the reaction.

23
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,820
In fact, it was improved in, uh,

24
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,980
in 1976 by using a different
oxidizing agent. This n oxide,

25
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:46,230
uh, uh, uh, uh, the morpholine oxide.

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,720
And in fact it's called
the Upjohn process,

27
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:52,680
which is relevant because the guy who's
picture is over here who a state gave

28
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:57,300
the money for redoing this room a while
back was the research director at Upjohn

29
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,010
laboratories. Uh, so anyhow, that
was a good way to do it. But then,

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,700
uh, we should notice something
about the stereo chemistry of this.

31
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,100
We showed here a trans to beauty.
And of course, if it's like ozone,

32
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:15,240
the two oxygens, we'll add at the same
time, therefore it at the same face.

33
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:20,570
So the configuration you get at the two
carbons where the Oah adds a Oeh is ad

34
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,280
are related to one another. They
could be ss as shown here. Of course,

35
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:31,020
the Osmium tetroxide could equally well
have come in from the bottom or that or

36
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:31,854
the,
uh,

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,180
to beauty and could have been turned
over and then you would have gotten rr.

38
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,990
So of course you don't get [inaudible]
without starting with [inaudible].

39
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,010
That is a single car rally a,

40
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,430
however you can start with it in
a ligand that attaches to the,

41
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,360
to the osmium.
So if you use a chiral amine ligand,

42
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,190
then you only get one of the two,
uh,

43
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,920
eat and teamers of the dihydroxy,
uh,

44
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,330
c Dye hydroxylated alkene.

45
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,410
And this you won't be surprised to hear
was also invented by professor Sharpless

46
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,740
when we talked about, uh, last semester
with respect to, to, uh, adding, uh,

47
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,560
oxygen. And so this is called the
Sharpless asymmetric die hydroxylation.

48
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:19,360
He invented it in 1988 and I think this
room was the first place he talked about

49
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:21,310
it in public. He, he, uh,

50
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,640
he was standing right there and in
fact he did a demonstration on the,

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,300
on this table as I'm going to do at the
end, but I'm going to do a different dis,

52
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,100
uh,

53
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,600
different demonstration because Osmium
tetroxide which he uses very dangerous

54
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:38,380
and poisonous and he went and he
actually spilled it on this table.

55
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:41,410
I think it's now long
gone since that was 1988,

56
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,190
but at least what I'm going to do just
use as vinegar so you don't have to worry

57
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,640
about that. Okay. So anyhow, this, here's,

58
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,690
here's a specific example of using
Sharpless, asymmetric dihydroxy colation.

59
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:57,490
With that dying,
it gives a 97% in anti more excess of the,

60
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,600
of the indicated configuration here.
Okay?

61
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,400
Now that per Manga,

62
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:08,401
Nate is much cheaper and looks very
much like osmium tetroxide so it won't

63
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:12,830
surprise you that it also
can do this trick. Uh,

64
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,830
and here you, you get a 85%
yield with cyclohexene and again,

65
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,700
it's a sin addition.
The two o h has come in on the same face,

66
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,990
but that's not one where
there's a catalyst that will
make it give only one and

67
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:30,880
a half timer. Okay. Now onto
catalytic hydrogenation.

68
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,140
So we looked before at
the idea of drawing, uh,

69
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,180
two curved arrows and making h two add
to an alkene and saw that the orbitals

70
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:44,340
weren't set up for that homo
would match Homo Lumo with Lumo.

71
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:47,740
So there's no profit in
that. However, we said,

72
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,140
even though that doesn't work,

73
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,920
that it does work if you have a metal
catalin [inaudible] like palladium or

74
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:56,860
platinum or many other transition metals.

75
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,970
So let's look a little bit at how it
is that palladium does this trick.

76
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,510
It does it by providing orbital variety
rather than just having the orbitals

77
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:11,641
that we showed before the sigma of sigma
and sigma star of the HH Bond and the

78
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,653
Pi and Pi Star of the alkene.

79
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,710
You have lots of different shapes of
orbitals on the metal. For example,

80
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,480
in ethylene we have the
Pi and the Pi Star, right?

81
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,920
But in the metal,

82
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:29,200
palladium has four d ten
five s zero and five p zero.

83
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,290
So, uh, the occupied orbitals of,

84
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,650
of palladium then are this Dz square.

85
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,160
Now is that set up to overlap?
Well with a Pi Star,

86
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,540
the homo below and the Lumo above.
What do you think?

87
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,160
Is that going to be a good reaction?
Who's gotten opinion? Carl?

88
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,883
To get

89
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:03,010
one side of the rent overlap and then
maybe on one side but not as shown there.

90
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,960
Right? That's what you're
saying that yeah, you're right.

91
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,710
They're orthogonal as drawn.
But there are other d orbitals.

92
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,940
There are five of these d orbitals so we
could check out others. How about the D,

93
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,800
Y, z? Is that going to do the trick?

94
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,840
Are you going to get overlap
if you bring that up?

95
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,490
Okay.
What do you say?

96
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,060
If you turn to, you could, but
it has shown it's orthogonal.

97
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,293
Right?

98
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,910
Okay.
How about that one?

99
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,430
That's going to do the trick.
Okay.

100
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,450
No, Chris is shaking his head right.
Won't do it. How about that one?

101
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,160
Well, it's still one of them
is symmetrical, right to left.

102
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:45,550
The other is anti symmetric, right
to left, so they'd have no overlap.

103
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,170
How about that one? Ah, just right. Okay.

104
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:54,550
So that one can come up and overlap and
stabilize the electrons that were on the

105
00:06:54,551 --> 00:06:59,410
metal. And that new orbital shown
there is in fact the homo minus four.

106
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:02,230
It's gotten quite stable. Right? In fact,

107
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:06,460
part of the reason it got stable is the
nature of the orbitals changes as Adams

108
00:07:06,461 --> 00:07:10,360
come up and meet the geometry changes.
So this is not all those two,

109
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,140
although it looks very much like those
two original orbitals and in a sense came

110
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:18,250
from them. By the time it gets
to this point, at the complex,

111
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:23,251
it's 40% of that DXY or but along the
bottom 47% actually on the top is Sigma

112
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,440
Chi has, but 13% is still
the Pi Star. So that is,

113
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,020
that's just to tell you the ugly truth,

114
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,340
but the fact is that the reaction began
and went through a transition state

115
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:39,760
because of the mixing of those orbitals.
So that's two electrons.

116
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,840
But how about the other way around?
How about if we use the homo on the top?

117
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:49,290
Now of course we have all these d orbitals
on the bottom and few of them would

118
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:50,830
overlap.
And even that one,

119
00:07:50,831 --> 00:07:54,970
which does overlap you don't care
about because it's homo with Homo.

120
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,900
Okay,
we want unoccupied orbitals on the bottom,

121
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,520
which means that five s and five p.
So there's the five p,

122
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,790
that's an unoccupied orbital.
That's gonna overlap well,

123
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,590
and there's the five s it'll overlap.
So you use some mixture of those two.

124
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:15,220
You'll use a hybrid orbital, an sp
hybrid of some sort on the palladium,

125
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,540
which will overlap with that homo and
stabilize another pair of electrons.

126
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:23,470
And there it is in the complex and you
see it's a hybrid orbital below and the

127
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:27,910
Pi orbital above forming that new bond,
stabilizing those electrons.

128
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,360
In fact, if you look at the
ugly truth of the on this one,

129
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:36,690
by the time you get to the complex has
changed the 67% of pie and it's uh,

130
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,360
11% of an sp hybrid,

131
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,220
but it's also 15% of that d orbital
that we showed at the beginning.

132
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:46,780
So things have gotten mixed up,

133
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:50,320
but that's the way it happened because
you had these vacant orbitals that could

134
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:55,030
overlap from below on the metal overlap
with pie, you had the filled orbital,

135
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,650
the particular one, the particular d
orbital, that can overlap with Pi Star.

136
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,560
So you stabilize two pairs of electrons.

137
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:05,520
That means you make two
new bonds to the alkene.

138
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,200
Okay?
So the palladium or platinum,

139
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:14,700
or many of these transition metals can do
this trick of adding, uh, at, at the two,

140
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:16,470
at the same time to the alkene.

141
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,640
Now you can also do it to sigma bonds.

142
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:26,100
So here's palladium reacting with h two.
It's just sigma and Sigma Star now,

143
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,330
right? But if that's the energy of the
starting material and a pretty crummy

144
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:33,510
calculation,
so don't hang your hat on this,

145
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,250
these are successive stages as
you go left to right. First you,

146
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,210
you begin to associate the age two
with the palladium and bond to it.

147
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,390
Then the h two gets even closer, and
as it gets closer and closer, the,

148
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,180
the hydrogen spread apart.

149
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,640
And the reason I've drawn them up
and down a little bit is to show, uh,

150
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,620
energy minima and transition states.

151
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,860
So first you get the h two associated
with the palladium without very close

152
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:03,330
contact, right? Then it gets closer,

153
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:08,220
it goes over a transition state and
becomes this one which is closer bonded.

154
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:10,150
And then you the h the,

155
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,610
the two hydrogens come apart and get
quite far apart, right? But notice,

156
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:17,610
at least in this calculation and
in some others, as you'll see,

157
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,210
it goes uphill a little bit.
So that would seem to be unfavorable.

158
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:24,600
You could do it, you could split the
hydrogen apart on the metal, right?

159
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,760
But in terms of of out kilocalories
per mole, it's up hill. However,

160
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,200
once it gets up there,

161
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:35,130
these hydrogens can move from one metal
to the next because we're talking a

162
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:39,180
solid metal in this
case. Okay? So in fact,

163
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,770
it dissociates on the palladium
surface and then the high drives move.

164
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,620
So you get into advantage from entropy,
from the hydrogens getting apart.

165
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,980
Even though it's uphill
a little bit in energy,

166
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,330
it's very favorable to move them apart
in entropy rather than having to have

167
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:55,560
them right next to one another.

168
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:00,090
So it's possible to dissociate
a hydrogen on palladium.

169
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,840
Now let's, and here's,
here's a a calculation,

170
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:05,610
certainly better than the previous one,

171
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,080
was published in the Journal of physical
chemistry in 2004 and it shows the same

172
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:14,910
thing. Palladium approaching hydrogen
above Palladian approaching methane below.

173
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,450
And again, I don't think that
these are great numbers probably,

174
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:21,720
but it gives you the idea of what I
showed on the previous slide and some

175
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:24,990
specific geometries. Okay. Now,

176
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,760
catalytic hydrogenation puts these two
reactions together that we just looked at.

177
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,340
You have what you call ox,

178
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,000
what inorganic chemists
call oxidative edition.

179
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,970
That's where we do this,

180
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,600
which we just saw as possible
to electronics can get
stabilized because of the

181
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:46,500
orbitals that are available to form
something like a three member during here.

182
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,590
Right?
And that's called oxidative addition.

183
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:54,250
The reason it's called oxidative is
the way in organic chemists, electrons,

184
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:56,890
they say that the,
if you have a bond to metal,

185
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,450
those electrons belonged to the,
to the league and not to the metal.

186
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,260
So electrons formally had been
taken away from the metal.

187
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,300
We'll talk more about oxidation and
reduction before too long, but anyhow,

188
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,630
that's called oxidative edition. But of
course you could do the reverse as well.

189
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:18,010
You could do reductive elimination and
Paul, the owl keyed back off again.

190
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,780
Okay, now you'd do the same thing
with hydrogen as we just saw.

191
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:26,620
So you could have oxidative addition.
Those two arrows move like that.

192
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:30,370
And then the to give that
and then the blue reverse,

193
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,400
the reductive elimination and
you're back where you started.

194
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,360
But now suppose you do
both of these things. Okay?

195
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,380
Let's suppose that we first
do the oxidative addition,

196
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:45,550
the insertion of palladium into
the HH Bond, and one of the H's,

197
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:50,260
let's say moves away and now we have room
on the surface of the palladium there

198
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:52,720
to bring in the alkene and do its trick.

199
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,373
Okay,

200
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,810
so now we have this form.
Now,

201
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:03,590
of course you could do reductive
elimination again. Now, incidentally,

202
00:13:03,591 --> 00:13:08,270
in that form, the experts discuss just
how much the different bonds are formed.

203
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:12,890
Sometimes they draw it this way and
just say the alkene is complex, but the,

204
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,850
but that begs the question of what is
it that's holding the arche in there?

205
00:13:16,851 --> 00:13:19,190
And it's those orbital
interactions that we looked at.

206
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,370
The electrons going one way,
the electrons go in the other,

207
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,320
so we'll abbreviate will,
uh,

208
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,760
for our purposes of our lecture today
will will say that the bonds are

209
00:13:28,761 --> 00:13:32,630
completely formed even
though they may not be okay.

210
00:13:32,631 --> 00:13:35,480
So you could do a reductive
elimination that could come off again,

211
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,380
but suppose you did the
other reductive elimination.

212
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,530
Suppose you did that one.
Okay,

213
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,690
now you're over here and
you've put hydrogen on one
carbon and palladium on the

214
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:51,280
other.
Right.

215
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,910
Now suppose we that hydrogen that's
wandering around the surface.

216
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,990
Suppose we bring it back.
Can you see what I'm going to do now,

217
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,900
Chris,
do you have an idea of what's that next?

218
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,720
What about the title of the slide?

219
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,160
We want to put a hydrogen on each of the
carbons. How are we going to do that?

220
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,820
We've got a hydrogen on
the right carbon already.

221
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,850
How do we get a hydrogen on the left card,

222
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,380
Lydia? Yeah, and the carbon is bonded.

223
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,870
The palladium and what will we
call the process that gets that?

224
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,280
He gets the hydrogen bond with the carbon
instead of the carbon and the hydrogen

225
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:44,580
bomb at the palladium substitution.
Nope,

226
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,633
it's that.

227
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,370
Anybody got a name for that?
That's the reduction elimination.

228
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:58,280
The blue thing we've been talking
about. All these, right? They come on,

229
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,110
they come off, they
come on, they come off.

230
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,530
But if you put them on one way
and take them off a different way,

231
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,610
you've done the trick. Got It. Okay.

232
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,560
Now notice that that addition
of the palladium to the, the,

233
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:17,210
the oxidative addition of Alkene to
palladium happened too at the same time.

234
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:19,010
So they come in on the same face.

235
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:24,020
It's a sin edition and then
when the hydrogens replaced,

236
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,820
replaced palladium,

237
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,680
they come in on the front side
is not a backside attack. Okay.

238
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,370
When we curve those two errors,
it's not attacking backside.

239
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,520
So they come in from
the same side as well.

240
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:42,380
So the overall product is sin edition.
The H's came in on the same here,

241
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,240
the bottom face of the double bond.

242
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,110
And of course if you put methyl groups
on there and it were to beauty and then

243
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:52,970
you'd expect to get that particular
isomer of the beauty and where the two

244
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:55,880
hydrogens operated added on the same side.

245
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,990
Of course you couldn't tell it because
the other two things would be hydrogens

246
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:01,790
as well.
How could you tell,

247
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,140
how could you tell that the
two came in on the same side?

248
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:14,150
You wouldn't use hydrogen. What would
you use? You use deuterium as you say.

249
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,210
Yeah. So then you can
tell this. There'd be,

250
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,950
and here's an example from the book
where they use Deuterium and, and uh, uh,

251
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,950
platinum oxide in this case.
And the two ds came in on the same side.

252
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,630
Okay.

253
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,630
That was not necessary in this case to
tell because you also had the cyclohexane

254
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,430
ring there. So it's a, it says here,

255
00:16:34,431 --> 00:16:37,910
the Deuterium is added in a sin fashion.
It's a sin edition.

256
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,690
And here's a typical passage
from another textbook.

257
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:45,470
The loud and textbook that we use several
years ago about stereochemistry of

258
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,560
this addition reaction,
catalytic hydrogenation,

259
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,040
and it says Stereo specific
sin addition happens.

260
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:56,120
It says for most alkenes
and it gives us example,

261
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,373
but this I'm,

262
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm actually doing this little bit to
show you how to read textbooks, right?

263
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,280
So it says most alkenes do this and give
stereo specific second edition and it

264
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:11,270
gives an example, but notice it
doesn't say what the yield is.

265
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,320
It could be one of these things.

266
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,240
Remember last time we said
there was a 55 45 right?

267
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:21,440
That was said to be specific
or to favor one over the other.

268
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,180
So it doesn't say what the yield is and
it doesn't give any reference to the

269
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:29,750
literature where you could look up and
see what the yield was or how they did it

270
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,320
or how much of the other isomer
there might've been there.

271
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,980
Now this is very typical for textbooks
and I have no doubt that this happens

272
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:41,150
with, with high specificity in
this case, but on the other hand,

273
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,340
you shouldn't be satisfied with that.

274
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,820
So you would look in another book like
this book from 1972 by house modern

275
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,690
chemistry.
Now this is a graduate level text.

276
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:56,250
So it shows an example here using
palladium on carbon is the catalyst.

277
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,040
Palladium on carbon means
you have palladium metal,

278
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,340
but you don't want to have a big chunk of
metal because there's not much surface.

279
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,670
So you want it to be very finely divided,
but you want to be able to handle it.

280
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:08,460
You don't have very much.
So you put it on charcoal,

281
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,410
it's absorbed on the
surface of the charcoal.

282
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,450
So that's what palladium on carbon is.

283
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:17,580
So it's done in a Siddique
acid with hydrogen gas at
one atmosphere and you have

284
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:18,900
that a double bond.

285
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:22,020
And what do you notice about the
stereo chemistry of the product?

286
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,520
Is it ascend edition,

287
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:29,070
which is the product of
sin addition Sebastian,

288
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,010
the one on the left or the right,
the one on the left,

289
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:35,100
the two came in on the same side on
the right. One came in at the top,

290
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:39,540
one on the bottom,
and 90% of the product is the wrong one.

291
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,430
The one the book tells you, or almost any
book will tell you, it's us in addition.

292
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:49,320
And it often is, okay. Now, uh,

293
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,950
look at this example from 1948
what's going on here? This is a,

294
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,250
this is Barton in 1948.
Anybody else?

295
00:18:56,251 --> 00:19:01,251
Remember what Martin was talking about
in 1948 or 49 from last semester?

296
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,690
He,

297
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:11,190
that was the first confirmational analysis
and it was molecules very like this.

298
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,880
So this is what he was working
on these steroids, okay.

299
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:18,420
But notice these two compounds
are Al Lilly isomers.

300
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,450
They only differ in the
position to that double bond.

301
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:26,040
There are three carbons in a row and a
double bond between two of them, right?

302
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,600
That's an how lily system.

303
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:32,640
So these are isomers where you move a
hydrogen from the top to the bottom,

304
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,430
and now you have a double bond
here in a single bond here.

305
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,040
So those are Al Lily Chi Summers,
right?

306
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,060
And now if you look at the details
of this primary literature,

307
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:46,290
it says that there's a rearrangement
of one of these compounds to the other,

308
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,700
right?
And it says that it happens in 80% yield,

309
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,000
80% of the product has
gone from here to here.

310
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,870
This is what you would use
for catalytic hydrogenation.

311
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,670
But instead of hydrogenating at
first went by Alec Rearrangement.

312
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,740
Now how did that happen?

313
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,970
So let's look back again at the mechanism
of the catalytic hydrogenation. First,

314
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:11,910
you have the oxidative addition
to that of the double bond.

315
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,450
And then you have the reductive
elimination on the right to put the first

316
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:16,830
hydrogen on,
okay?

317
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:22,140
And then you put the other hydrogen on
the left and continue. But of course,

318
00:20:22,141 --> 00:20:25,620
that reaction would be reversible.
You could have not only put this,

319
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,070
you could have, uh, you could, uh,

320
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,130
have taken this back off
again in the wrong way, right?

321
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:37,650
And instead of going there apartment,
you could, you could go there,

322
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:39,960
but the other thing you could have done

323
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,380
is if there's an Al Lily hydrogen in the
compound you're talking about. So dot.

324
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,290
Only the allocate, but the next door
carbon has a hydrogen on it. You're here,

325
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:54,430
you're here, you're here, you're
here, you get to there, okay.

326
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,930
And now one possibility
is to reverse that way.

327
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,960
That's the reductive elimination,
uh,

328
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,950
are probably oxidative addition that
takes you back here that undoes those blue

329
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:09,940
arrows and would take you back.
But what other option is there?

330
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,500
Can anybody see another option?

331
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,480
Leon?
Aha.

332
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:25,310
That compound is symmetric if
you have an Lla hydrogen, right?

333
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,830
So it could unzip that way too.

334
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,853
Okay.

335
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,940
And now instead of going back to this,
you go back to this,

336
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,670
right? And if that, uh, uh,
does the reduction elimination,

337
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:42,661
right?

338
00:21:42,661 --> 00:21:47,661
You come back here and now you'll notice
that's has I saw him rise the Alkene,

339
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,000
right?
The double bond moved next door.

340
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,573
Okay.

341
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,500
So it's all these oxidative addition,
reductive eliminations. But if,

342
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:59,870
but if you go through that
symmetric intermediate,

343
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:03,350
then you can take the wrong one off. I
should go back towards starting material.

344
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:07,370
Uh, so they started material is
actually, I saw him rise product.

345
00:22:07,371 --> 00:22:09,110
So that's presumably how it happens.

346
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,640
So catalytic hydrogenation can
lead the aloe rearrangement.

347
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,870
And now let's go back and
look at that paper, right?

348
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,130
And we see that if,
if we had that rearrangement,

349
00:22:22,131 --> 00:22:25,310
this could go to this. In fact, it
could go to four different eyes.

350
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,060
It could be the double bond here
or here, or here or here, right?

351
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,920
So we could come back to this. And now
once you're here, if you add hydrogen,

352
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:37,280
even if you added from the same side,
those two hydrogens,

353
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:41,990
they could be the opposite side from
where the first hydrogen was, right?

354
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,040
So now you could expect to get this
and you'd expect more of this than this

355
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,880
because that form is more
stable. It's, it's uh,

356
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:54,440
conformationally a better,
uh, a better structure. Okay,

357
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:55,640
so 90% there.

358
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:59,490
Now the nice thing is you don't have to
even look at the secondary literature

359
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:03,050
going back to the primary literature
because it gives a reference here.

360
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,850
So we could look at that reference and
see here where they give the table about

361
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:11,810
studying these things.
And down here in row seven,

362
00:23:11,811 --> 00:23:16,520
you see they're talking about compounds
seven Delta nine, 10, [inaudible]. So the,

363
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,380
the ring is numbered in a certain way,

364
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:22,130
and the double bond is
between nine and 10. Okay?

365
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,620
Now if they started with that material,

366
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:29,510
you see they got 90% of the Trans Product.
That's this one.

367
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:34,580
That's what show near 90% 10% okay.
But if they,

368
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,840
if they did only partial hydrogenation,
they still got 90% of this,

369
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:44,590
but they had a 100% after
doing 80% of the hydrogenation.

370
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:48,320
It says here they did at 80%
after doing that, they have,

371
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:52,340
they don't have any of this
stuff. It's all this stuff, right?

372
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:56,620
So if these things could
go back and forth, right?

373
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,860
It must be that the equilibrium
lies in this direction.

374
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:05,490
And occasionally when you get over
here, you go onto the product, right?

375
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,020
And that's the explanation of it.

376
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,910
But it's interesting to look even a
little closer to look at what happened if

377
00:24:11,911 --> 00:24:16,020
they started with eight.
So suppose they start with eight.

378
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,220
If you start,

379
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,170
if it started at seven and you can
go through eight to get down here,

380
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,200
you get 90% of the product.
That's their explanation.

381
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,040
Suppose you start with pure eight,
what should you get?

382
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,703
Okay.

383
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,650
In terms of the product. If you didn't
have seven, if you start with eight,

384
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,230
Debbie,
you've got an idea,

385
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,090
you should get at least this
much, maybe more, right?

386
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,740
If the way you get here,

387
00:24:47,741 --> 00:24:52,690
if some of it goes this way and some of
it goes this way and you start here and

388
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,690
get 10 to 90 if you start here,

389
00:24:55,691 --> 00:24:59,170
you should get even more
than 90 to 10 right?

390
00:24:59,171 --> 00:25:04,090
Because you don't have the chance of
going here initially. Got It. Okay.

391
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,490
What does it say?
You get 80%

392
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,880
so there's something rotten here,
but no one's ever talked about it.

393
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,260
It could be just that the experiments
weren't done really carefully or maybe the

394
00:25:18,261 --> 00:25:21,350
catalyst was a different little bit
different in one pace than the other.

395
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:22,790
I don't know what the answer is,

396
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,740
but it's when you go back to look at
the dig in to where the real results are

397
00:25:27,741 --> 00:25:29,480
that you find things that are interesting.

398
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,830
So evidently this isn't a
hundred percent understood,

399
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:38,120
but I have no doubt that this aloe
lake arrangement rearrangement is a big

400
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,390
source of getting what appears
to be the wrong edition.

401
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:46,180
That it really is an addition, but it
happens after you've rearranged things.

402
00:25:46,181 --> 00:25:50,900
So the product isn't what you
would have expected naively. Okay.

403
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:55,901
Now the a process called
metathesis of an alkene.

404
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,970
This was reported,
uh,

405
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,980
when I first came here to Yale the first
year I was here and it was amazing.

406
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,780
People were amazed by this reaction
and the mechanism was quite on,

407
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,760
uh, uh, speculative. Nobody had any
idea what happened at the beginning.

408
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,630
But in the subsequent, uh,
whatever number of years, 45 years,

409
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:18,680
it's been figured out.

410
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:24,190
And what is involved is a double
bond from the metal to carbon.

411
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,570
Of course there are,
there are two other things on the carbon,

412
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,470
but this is called an owl Kyla
deep and complex. And in fact,

413
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:31,940
this process was,

414
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:35,990
this was the basis for
the Nobel prize in 2005,

415
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,840
which went to grubs.
Okay.

416
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,990
So this is a metal al Kyla Dean complex.

417
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:47,860
We come in with an alkene and do the
oxidative addition to form that and a

418
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:54,150
reductive elimination. So it
gives a Metalla, cyclo butane,

419
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,180
a cycle of butane that has a metal in it,
right?

420
00:26:57,181 --> 00:27:00,390
Just by the same processes we
talked about on the previous slide.

421
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,080
Now those processes are reversible.

422
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:10,290
And what do you notice about reversing it?
Leon? What about the intermediate here?

423
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,270
It's symmetrical so you can
reverse the other direction,

424
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,730
right to go to there and
then that can come apart.

425
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,090
And you've put the central carbon,

426
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:27,930
the one that's here changed it from
being attached to this carbon to being

427
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:29,100
attached to this carbon.

428
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,990
So you can take effectively to
alkenes and mix up their carbons,

429
00:27:33,991 --> 00:27:38,370
which is double bonded
to which, okay, now,

430
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,380
uh, you, you've heard of Professor
Ziegler who teaches the other, uh,

431
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,060
Hu last semester taught the other
organic of course. Uh, he's,

432
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,330
I don't know if you've seen him around in
the lab. They, but he's unusually tall.

433
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:53,310
He's six,
six or something like that.

434
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:57,240
And I point out here that he's
not professor Karl Ziegler.

435
00:27:57,241 --> 00:28:00,150
We'll talk about Professor Karl
Ziegler a few slides later,

436
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:05,690
but he was visiting Japan in 1986
in this delegation of a junior high.

437
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,690
Girls thought he was so tall they
should get their picture taken with him,

438
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:14,190
which is here, but he wasn't the only
tall guy visiting Japan at that time.

439
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,240
Here he is touring together
with professor grubs.

440
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,840
The guy that got the Nobel prize in
2005 who is equally tall. In fact,

441
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:26,520
professor grubs is a daughter, played
basketball at Yale. She's quite tall.

442
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:29,870
I think she holds the rebounding
record for women's basketball. Yeah.

443
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,740
So this will help you remember
professor grubs, I hope. Okay. In fact,

444
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:39,660
they took another picture together with
their host at the professor more Ohashi.

445
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:44,640
So again, I underline that there
unusually tall people. Okay.

446
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:49,670
But grubs invented a process called
romp ring opening metathesis,

447
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,230
polymerization.

448
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:58,100
Now here's a double bond where both of
the carbons in the double bond are part

449
00:28:59,131 --> 00:29:01,980
of the same molecule,
the same framework.

450
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:07,230
So if you cleave that double bond and
exchange partners with something else,

451
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,690
right, you still have the two linked
together through this other ring, right?

452
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:17,700
So if you bring in this alkylating
compound and do the trick of metathesis,

453
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:22,190
you get that.
And now if you do you,

454
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:26,010
the product is still an alkylating,
a ruthenium here.

455
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,700
So you can do that with another
one of these molecules. In fact,

456
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:34,170
you can do it with n of the molecules
and they'll all link together in a chain

457
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:36,660
like this to give a polymer,
right?

458
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,050
So this ring opening metathesis was the,
uh,

459
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,350
was a very important part of this.
Uh,

460
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,300
Nobel prize work degenerate.
A polymer,

461
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,640
okay. Now a catalytic hydrogenation
we saw looked like this,

462
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,270
but Ziegler,
Nada polymerization.

463
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,950
This is the other Ziegler
Carl sealer. Uh, German, uh,

464
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,880
looks very similar,
so it has to Tanium with it,

465
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,370
with an r group on it.
Okay.

466
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:12,050
And now an alkene comes in oxidative
edition to give this reductive elimination

467
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:18,040
on the other side.
It was that,

468
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,710
but now that we could just
call a different art group,

469
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:28,270
it's not the original art group at CR
group with two carbons in between, right?

470
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:30,790
That we just brought in.
Now what can you do?

471
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,630
You could bring it back to
start over again, right?

472
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,890
And that'll be the r and then
you bring it in and that's the r.

473
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,990
And then you do it again
and again and again,

474
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:47,520
and you could make a very long chain
of ethylene molecules. For example.

475
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,770
Now Ziegler found this,
I,

476
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:54,790
I contacted grubs a yesterday in order
to get permission to show his picture on

477
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,010
to you, add more Ohashi as
well. And Ziegler incidentally.

478
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:04,230
But he told me an interesting story of
how Siegler uh, uh, discovered this.

479
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,071
He was trying,

480
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:09,600
it was during the Second World War and
in Germany they were short of lubricating

481
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:10,320
oil.

482
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,880
So he was trying to figure out how to
use triethyl aluminum to add to alkenes

483
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,010
and then Paul liberal rise on the basis
of that to get things that could be

484
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,250
lubricating oils.
And after the war he continued that work,

485
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,320
but sometimes they found different
products rather than these oils they were

486
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:33,321
trying to make and they traced it to
the presence of metals in the reactor.

487
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:38,610
So then they tried all different salts
and when they use titanium tetra chloride,

488
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:43,770
they found that they had made a
heterogeneous cutout catalyst for

489
00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:47,010
polymerization.
The thing that I show in here now,

490
00:31:47,011 --> 00:31:50,940
I underlined that this is heterogeneous.
You mix these things together,

491
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:55,380
it's a witch's brew and nobody knows
really exactly what's in there and it's,

492
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:59,100
it's not. And the reason you don't
know is because it's a solid,

493
00:31:59,101 --> 00:32:02,820
it's not a pure crystal and compound is
not something in solution that you can

494
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:05,550
do spectroscopy on to figure
out exactly what it is.

495
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:09,840
So it's very hard to study the mechanism
with these heterogeneous catalysts,

496
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:14,730
but that doesn't mean they're not useful.
For example, high density polyethylene,

497
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,810
the number two of your recycling thing,
uh,

498
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,380
with ends of from 800 to a
quarter million chain length,

499
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:27,790
it was made in 2004 to the tune
of 25 times 10 to the sixth tons,

500
00:32:27,811 --> 00:32:29,940
25 million tons,
right?

501
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:34,620
Or polypropylene with up to
10 to the five units in a,

502
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,750
in a chain.
Again,

503
00:32:36,751 --> 00:32:40,280
45 million tons in 2007.

504
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:45,281
So this Ziegler not a catalyst was a
really a revolutionary thing for making a

505
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:50,120
polymers, but it was hard
to do the mechanisms. Okay.

506
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,320
Now,

507
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,240
one thing that we'll see later that free
radicals also can pull them arise thing

508
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,530
can polymerize, uh, uh, alkenes.

509
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:05,330
But the difference here is that these
are ISO tactic that you get from,

510
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:08,580
from Siegler, not of polymerization. Uh,

511
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,370
so I should tell you what tactility is,
okay?

512
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:16,850
So if you have a polymer
chain and the alkenes had,

513
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,120
say methyl groups on it,
propylene instead of ethylene,

514
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,840
then you have a bunch of stereo centers.
Okay?

515
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:28,160
Now notice that every
alkene went in head to tail.

516
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:31,520
That is Cah two then ch, ch, ch, ch,

517
00:33:31,521 --> 00:33:36,260
ch three ch two ch ch
three ch two ch ch three.

518
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,400
Okay? So it's head to tail,
but it stereo regular,

519
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:44,720
all the methyls are coming out at
you and that's called ISO tactic.

520
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:48,680
Okay?
And alternative would be all had detail,

521
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,230
but Syndeo tactic out, back out, back out,

522
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,480
back every other one,
okay.

523
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,910
And of course it could
be random out and back.

524
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:06,530
So there are these three different,
uh, fundamental types of polymers.

525
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:10,130
Eissa tactic, sidio
tactic at a tactic, right?

526
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,120
And they have different properties and
we'll talk about polymer properties in

527
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:17,500
the next lecture and why they
should be different. So depends.

528
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:21,200
So for some purposes, you'd want
one for some another. Okay. Now,

529
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:23,420
there are two questions
that would address here.

530
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:27,020
One is how do you know which is which?
How do you know whether you have an ice,

531
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:29,300
a tactic, or a Cindy,
a tactic or a tactic?

532
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,320
And for that you got to wait until
we get to Nmr. It's coming very soon.

533
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,840
It's a really neat way to
figure out which is which.

534
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,670
But if more fundamental question is,
how do you control what you make?

535
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,050
Right? So there's, there
are these catalysts.

536
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,530
Instead of using titanium,
use these zirconium catalysts,

537
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,580
which are homogeneous,
that means they're dissolved there,

538
00:34:52,581 --> 00:34:54,500
not some solid that's in there.

539
00:34:54,501 --> 00:34:57,050
So it's possible to do
spectroscopy on these things.

540
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,570
And Kamensky the name associated with
this Catallo esis has to do with his

541
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,660
accidental discovery that adding
Mao makes these very reactive.

542
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,630
Mao is methyl aluminum taxane,

543
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:15,800
which is a sophisticated name for
something that nobody knows what it is,

544
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:20,660
that you mix stuff together and you
get that. And it's not always the same.

545
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:23,760
But if you add it to the, uh, to the,

546
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,540
these zirconium dichloride complexes,

547
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,110
you get a very active catalyst.
So this is there. There had been,

548
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:35,111
I think since this was discovered in
1980 I think there've been something like

549
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:39,810
7,000 papers written on it or
something like that and 2000 patents.

550
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,940
Okay.
Now,

551
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:46,620
one thing that's pretty much agreed on
is that what this methyl aluminum taxane

552
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,240
takes the chlorides off,

553
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:53,460
puts an art group like methyl on the
zirconium and leaves it as a cad. I am.

554
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,313
Okay.

555
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,040
Now what happens next?
The alkenes approach,

556
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:04,990
but they approached from alternate faces.
Let's see what that means.

557
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,730
So here we take propylene and bring
it into the front to make one of these

558
00:36:09,731 --> 00:36:14,350
complexes and then the r group
shifts across and you make a bond.

559
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,373
Okay.

560
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:21,450
Have you ever seen a reaction like that
where you have a metal with a group

561
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:22,241
attached to it?

562
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:25,420
Alkane comes up and you form a bond
here and this thing comes over?

563
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,143
Yeah,

564
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:34,760
right. The Bh Hydro duration is
exactly that same kind of thing.

565
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,590
Okay. Now, so we'll call
that new group our prime.

566
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,690
The original one was our,

567
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:46,130
but now the next alkene comes in and
associates with the Sercos Niamh.

568
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,460
But what's different from the first one?
I drew.

569
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,370
It's now in the back, right? The
first Al King came in in the front.

570
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:56,750
So it goes on the back.

571
00:36:56,751 --> 00:37:01,751
Now the our prime moves back there and
then the next al comes in in front and it

572
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:06,410
comes over there and so on and so on.
And you build a long chain.

573
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:12,080
But notice every, every other
one is reacting in front,
in, back, in front and back.

574
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,710
Now let's compare the
front and back of this,

575
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:20,570
of this zirconium complex.
Notice it has an axis of symmetry there.

576
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,950
If you rotate 180 degrees
about that access of symmetry,

577
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:29,150
you get the same thing again. So the
front and the back are super imposable.

578
00:37:29,151 --> 00:37:30,230
They look just the same.

579
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:35,450
So whatever happens in front with respect
to stereochemistry will happen the

580
00:37:35,451 --> 00:37:38,800
same way in back.
So that will give the,

581
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,740
the two faces fronted back or homo topic.
They're the same.

582
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:47,690
So you'll get the same chemistry,
the same stereochemistry at either one.

583
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:53,030
Now how is it different in this case that
instead of having an axis of symmetry

584
00:37:53,031 --> 00:37:56,870
has a mirror plane of symmetry, what does
that mean about the front? And the back.

585
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,790
Sebastian,
what do you say?

586
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:05,000
What's the relationship between the front
and the back? Are they super imposable?

587
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,360
So what would you call them?
Right? So those are in Antio topic.

588
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,810
So whatever one's face does,
the other one will do the opposite.

589
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,130
And as you bounced back and forth what
product or you're going to get now

590
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:22,310
it'll be Syndeo tactic,

591
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,793
right?

592
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,600
And now suppose you take this one,
which has a horizontal plane,

593
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:33,310
which means the top and the bottom are,
are both accessible on the front.

594
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,150
You can go either,
either the top or the bottom equally.

595
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:40,630
So there's no selection. So what do
you think you're going to get now

596
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,310
if it doesn't make any
difference which way you go

597
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,073
right

598
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,540
now the faces are a chiral and
you get an eight tactic product,

599
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:54,620
so you can control which one you
get by choosing the symmetry of the,

600
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:59,720
of the a league. And that's
attached to the zirconium. Okay.

601
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,430
Now, as I said is I promised you can
also do free radical polymerization.

602
00:39:04,431 --> 00:39:07,060
I said we'd discussed
that. So, uh, uh, fruit,

603
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:11,810
this was the earliest kind
of polymerization studied
in laboratories. Okay.

604
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:16,880
So Al comes in. Bingo, another one. Bingo.

605
00:39:16,881 --> 00:39:19,520
Bingo, Bingo. Bingo. So
we're growing along chain,

606
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:25,060
but the difference is that in this case
you can get rotation around this bond

607
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:32,240
to get that form. And when you do that
radical is close to this hydrogen.

608
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,940
And you can go from a primary
radical to a secondary radical.

609
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,890
Hey, that's downhill. Okay.

610
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,110
And now you can add an alkene to that.

611
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,773
Okay.

612
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:52,790
So if you do radical polymerization as
opposed to doing these metal catalyzed

613
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:56,190
polymerizations,
you can get branches,

614
00:39:56,191 --> 00:39:58,680
you get occasional butyl chains,

615
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,320
c four chains stuck on your long chain.

616
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,860
And that means that they don't
pack together as efficiently.

617
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,880
So it's not as crystal
on, right? So that gives,

618
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,760
since it doesn't pack as well,
it's not as dense.

619
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,610
So that gives low density polyethylene,

620
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,330
the kind of stuff that you
get in a dry cleaner bags,

621
00:40:18,331 --> 00:40:22,680
that flimsy stuff as opposed to what
you would get in a supermarket to carry

622
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:26,820
groceries in, which is tougher
and, and uh, and opaque.

623
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,430
Okay, now let's look at it again. And
we start polymerization going fine.

624
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:33,900
Free radical polymerization.

625
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,180
But we may not want it to keep going
because properties of the polymer,

626
00:40:39,181 --> 00:40:43,590
like its viscosity, it's melting point,
depends on how long the chain is.

627
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:45,990
We may want to control
how long the chain is.

628
00:40:45,991 --> 00:40:49,140
How can we control the
length of the chain, right?

629
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,160
One way to control the polymer chain
length is to add a molecule like carbon

630
00:40:55,381 --> 00:41:00,090
tetrachloride. There are
many such reagents, not just
carbon tetrachloride. Okay,

631
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:03,720
now the radical could attack
the chlorine like this,

632
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:06,663
right?

633
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:11,050
And now you have a try. Chloro methyl
radical in your chain is done right?

634
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,630
But you have the tri
chloro methyl radical.

635
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,390
So it can I add to another alkene

636
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,320
and then that one can grow a new chain.

637
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:27,580
So you see what you've done by this
is used what's called a chain transfer

638
00:41:28,581 --> 00:41:33,080
agent. It doesn't destroy
the, the kinetic chain, right?

639
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,890
The radical still keeps working,
but on a new molecule.

640
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,420
So you shorten the polymer molecules
without terminating the chain reaction.

641
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,680
So if you add more of the chain
transfer agent, you get shorter chains.

642
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:50,360
So if you measure the rate of the
transfer of the reaction with the carbon

643
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:55,070
tetrachloride versus the rate constant
for preliminary ization in the particular

644
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:59,180
case of styrene and carbon tetrachloride,
that ratio is 0.01,

645
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,630
right?
So if,

646
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,600
if you don't have to worry
about radicals finding radicals,

647
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:06,890
they're fee rather dilute,

648
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:12,370
then the molecular length will be how
likely it is to react with styrene

649
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,480
compared to how likely it is to react
with carbon tetrachloride and terminate

650
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:18,314
the chain.

651
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:21,950
But that depends on the concentration
of styrene and the concentration.

652
00:42:21,951 --> 00:42:26,930
So if you know these, do, uh, if you
have, you can, you can then work out,

653
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,570
uh, since the, the, uh,

654
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:33,280
the transfer reaction with this,

655
00:42:33,281 --> 00:42:37,040
this process here is only 1% as fast.

656
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:40,430
So if you had equal amounts of
styrene and carbon tetrachloride,

657
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:45,230
you'd tend to go about a hundred
molecules before you got a chain transfer.

658
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:48,320
So you'd get on average
about a hundred molecular,

659
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,910
hundred units in a chain.
If you had more carbon tetrachloride,

660
00:42:52,911 --> 00:42:55,590
you'd get shorter chains if you had less,
you get longer chain,

661
00:42:55,591 --> 00:42:58,940
so you can control it. But not
precisely. There's, uh, there's, uh,

662
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,680
a property called dispersity, which is,
they're not all exactly the same length.

663
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:07,550
They're average that, but some are longer,
some are shorter. And how wide is this,

664
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,650
uh, determined something about obviously
the properties of the material you get.

665
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:18,980
Okay. We won't go into that any further.
Now. Alkene and dying oligomenorrhea,

666
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:23,981
ization and polymerization using carbon
electrified as the active reagents.

667
00:43:24,921 --> 00:43:26,570
Now all ago means a few.

668
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,740
So Alla [inaudible] is putting
just a few such units together.

669
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:35,630
And so we're, we're going to
use either a sigma star of our,

670
00:43:35,631 --> 00:43:39,290
with the leaving group or, uh, or, uh,

671
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,950
our cad ions as the reagent
to do the polymerization.

672
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:48,080
So if you have a r plus as an electrified,

673
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:50,930
will you do a really interesting reaction?

674
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,300
Notice you can take ISO butane and
isobutylene react them with h two,

675
00:43:56,301 --> 00:44:00,800
so four,
and add the elements of the ISO butane.

676
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:05,420
And I've colored them because you can
do isotopic labeling to see what's what.

677
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,730
Notice that what added to the
owl Keane was this ch sigma bond.

678
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,370
What do you like?
How do you like that Noel?

679
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,030
He see any problem with
doing a reaction like that?

680
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:24,290
What's the homo at Lumo of the,
of the purple molecule here.

681
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:30,830
There's no functional group
there. How can you do it? Well,

682
00:44:30,831 --> 00:44:32,160
tell me what would happen first.

683
00:44:32,161 --> 00:44:36,990
If you have concentrated sulfuric acid
and react with this mixture. Where do you,

684
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,920
what do you think would happen

685
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:38,773
first?

686
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:48,060
Where is there a functional group?
The five on?

687
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:52,480
So, so the Proton would attack
the Pi electrons. And what,

688
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,740
at which end would it attack?

689
00:44:53,741 --> 00:44:57,340
Would you put the Proton here or would
you put the dot on the more substituted

690
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,253
carbon?

691
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:03,480
It'd be more cognitive of, you'd want
to get a t beautiful cat. Yeah. Okay.

692
00:45:03,481 --> 00:45:05,510
So we'll, so we'll do that. Incidentally,

693
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,140
this product was not irrelevant because
that's what they mean when they say

694
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:10,974
octane.

695
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:16,020
That compound is defined as 100
octane for the engine performance.

696
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:17,540
So this was,
uh,

697
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:21,810
we had worked on during the Second World
War to try to make high quality fuel

698
00:45:21,811 --> 00:45:25,650
for airplanes. Okay. So we put the,

699
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:29,190
we'll follow what Noel says and put
then make the tea butyl cad ion.

700
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:34,260
And now the t beautiful cat. Diane can
react with the Al keen to give this.

701
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:36,900
And now you'd say,
why don't we just keep going?

702
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,960
Well it depends on what the,

703
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:43,920
on what the situation is and
you'll see it can do that. But,

704
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:48,330
but another thing it can do is
react with this. Watch this, right?

705
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:52,830
This is a tertiary cad ion,
but it's rather hindered,

706
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:58,170
right? This one, if you transfer
this with its electrons,

707
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:02,700
curved Arrow there, right?
That's a hydride shift.

708
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,650
We've seen hydride shifts
before the differences.

709
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,740
This is happening between two molecules
rather than for one car over to the next

710
00:46:10,741 --> 00:46:11,910
to the same molecule.

711
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:16,560
But it was shown by Bartlett in
1944 that this process that happens,

712
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,720
use it isotopic labels,
right?

713
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:23,310
So it gives ISO octane and what's the
other product? What's the purple product?

714
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:29,460
The h one, the hydride, not Proton.
Hydride the h with its electrons.

715
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:34,290
What up here? What was left
behind the TV at OCAD iron.

716
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,580
But that's what you need here. So this
is a chain. It could go round and round.

717
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:43,820
So you add ISO butane to
isobutylene right now,

718
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:49,410
uh, if you, if you don't
have the ISO butane in there,

719
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:54,090
then it turns out that it could
do this polymerization. Right?

720
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,880
I had another one and another
one, et Cetera, et cetera.

721
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:01,590
And that gives poly isobutylene,
which is called butyl rubber.

722
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:04,110
And it's not a very strong material,

723
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:07,230
but it has the virtue of being air tight.

724
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:12,570
So that's what's made to seal a tires
when they made inner tubes and those days

725
00:47:12,571 --> 00:47:15,930
they were made out of butyl rubber,
right to hold the air in.

726
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,301
Okay.

727
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:23,040
So now these electro files in
terpene and steroid biogenesis.

728
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:28,020
Uh,
now I've got to get onto this next time,

729
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,550
but I want,
but since I brought stuff here,

730
00:47:30,551 --> 00:47:34,090
I'm going to entertain you
with a show and tell. It does,

731
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:39,040
it comes after this set of slides,
but uh, but since I got it here,

732
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:39,874
I'm going to do it.

733
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,590
So we'll turn on the light here.
And what I have

734
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:52,540
here is water and vinegar,

735
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,140
diluted Siddique acid and this stuff that
I bought down at the art supply store

736
00:47:58,211 --> 00:48:01,030
called mold builder.
But if I read here,

737
00:48:01,031 --> 00:48:03,280
it says it's ammonia,

738
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:06,130
a 100% natural latex.

739
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,770
That means that came right
out of the tree and water.

740
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,900
So all that's in here is tree,
SAP and water and ammonia,

741
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:17,560
right? So I want to pour
some into the water here.

742
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,120
I'm going to take my jacket off
and took my tie and actually

743
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,790
make that white fruit,

744
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,043
okay?

745
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:40,010
So we're going to open it up here
and I'll pour some in there.

746
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,220
Okay? Now the ammonia keeps, the
molecules will talk about this next time,

747
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:56,400
uh,
apart from one another of this light tax.

748
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:01,890
All
right?

749
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,490
But if we add some vinegar,
it'll get rid of the ammonia.

750
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:23,520
Obviously I didn't measure it very
carefully. Oh, there we, we're doing it.

751
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,690
So now the molecules are coming together,

752
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:29,993
okay?

753
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,660
So if I reach in here and grab it,

754
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:44,430
get rid of that water

755
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:02,550
drive a few times here.

756
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:23,710
So we've made a rubber ball.

757
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,570
Good. Okay. That anybody wants to make
a rubber ball, you can done and do it.

758
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,170
Thank you.
