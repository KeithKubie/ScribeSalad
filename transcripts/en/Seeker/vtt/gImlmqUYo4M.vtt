00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.299
If you were stranded on an desert island,
on an exoplanet, hundreds of years away from

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:12.360
Earth - how many people would you need with
you to survive?

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.420
Hey everyone, Emily here for DNews!

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.430
Elon Musk - founder of SpaceX - recently stated
that he wants to put 1 million people on Mars

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.580
within a century.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.720
He’d bring everyone there with about a thousand
spaceships, each making multiple trips between

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.980
Earth and Mars.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.230
If anything bad happened to threaten the existence
of this colony, we could quickly replenish

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.969
the population with a new batch of humans
sent from Earth.

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.800
This strategy works because it only takes
a few months to reach Mars.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.449
But what if we wanted to colonize a world
beyond our solar system, hundreds of years

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:44.519
away?

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.469
How big of a spaceship would we need, and
how many humans would we need to start with

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.699
to make colonization possible?

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.480
Take Proxima B as an example.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.059
It’s the closest planet we know about outside
of our solar system.

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.549
It’s rocky and similar in size to the Earth,
and has the potential to support liquid water

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:02.920
on its surface.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.770
The problem is, we can’t just hop over there.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.719
It’s 4 light-years away.

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:12.350
With current technology, it could take us
more than 20,000 years to get there.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.039
That’s about 800 generations of humans - making
this type of journey fairly impossible.

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:23.421
Luckily, there are programs like the 100 Year
Starship project and Stephen Hawking’s Project

00:01:23.421 --> 00:01:28.409
Starshot that are working to develop new propulsion
technologies that could get us there much

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.990
sooner - possibly within a few hundred years.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.759
Assuming they’re successful, how many people
would we need to start a colony?

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.840
A study published in Acta Astronautica suggests
that you would need a starship filled with

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.409
at least 14,000 carefully screened people
to end up with a stable population after a

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.200
multi-century interstellar journey.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.750
Even more people - up to 44,000 would ideal.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.259
You’d have to account for potential catastrophes
like plague, asteroid strikes, or even war.

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.649
A few hundred years is a long time to be in
one spaceship - a lot of things could happen!

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.429
In the study, the researchers used population
genetics theory - modeling how the genetics

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:13.130
of a population changes over generations - and
accounted for one catastrophe during a 5-generation

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.490
voyage.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.670
Populations over 14,000 maintain good health
during a trip of this length despite relatively

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.300
high inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity
over time.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.190
As a colony, we’d need to do everything
we could to keep genetic diversity high - it’s

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.550
something that plays an essential role in
the adaptability and survival of a species.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.500
Think about it - some humans would live out
their entire life on this interstellar spacecraft.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.470
As a child, you would grow up - have kids
of your own with other passengers on board

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.260
- and eventually grow old and die.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.940
But the only partners available to you would
be the limited number of members on board

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.950
the spacecraft.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.940
You’d have to be extremely careful when
choosing your partner because inbreeding can

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.500
lead to some serious problems.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.620
Just take a look at our early ancestors.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.300
For thousands of years, Neanderthals, our
ancient cousins, lived in small, isolated

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.180
populations, which lead to inbreeding.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.670
By studying their fossils, researchers have
discovered a range of deformities - many of

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.810
which are rare in modern humans.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.700
An even larger issue with small populations
may be the community’s ability to formulate

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.210
their own culture, acquire knowledge and develop
technology.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.090
The combination of these issues could lead
to the downfall of a species altogether.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.060
We could have the same problems in a starship.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.310
Maintaining a large population with sufficient
genetic diversity is key to a successful,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.090
sustainable colonization of a new world.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.700
Of course, a population of 14,000 is still
a lot of people, especially when you consider

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.160
the fact that the highest number of people
we’ve ever brought into space at once is

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.160
eight.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.140
In order to meet that 14,000-human minimum
requirement - we’re going to need a bigger

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.140
ship.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.730
Or.. many medium-sized ships.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.010
Distributing your population across multiple
ships would also distribute the risk of losing

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.320
that population entirely.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.290
And then maybe, you’d be able to distribute
the human species to another solar system.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.310
But of course, all of this assumes that humans
can invent a propulsion system that’s 100

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.060
to 1,000 times faster than anything we have
today.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.860
So perhaps, we should stick to the planets
in our own backyard for now.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.010

Check out this video here.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.780
What do you think?

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.780
Would you want to be part of that 14,000?
