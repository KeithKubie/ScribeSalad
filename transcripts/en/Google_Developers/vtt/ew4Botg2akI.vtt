TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.890
I'm Timothy Jordan for
The Developer Show.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.015
This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:07.630
news from Google.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.730
ARCore and Sceneform give
you simple yet powerful tools

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.790
for creating augmented
reality experiences.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.580
Version 1.7 of the
Google ARCore SDK

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.610
is now available and focuses
on creative elements,

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.670
like AR selfies and
animation, as well as

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.040
helping you improve the Core
user experience in your apps.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.370
Details, screenshots, and
a link to the download

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.290
are on the post.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.390
Model-based reinforcement
learning attempts

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.260
to have agents learn how the
world behaves in general.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.440
Instead of directly mapping
observations to actions,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.320
this allows an agent to
explicitly plan ahead

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.710
to more carefully select actions
by imagining their long term

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.060
outcomes.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.430
To spur progress on
this research challenge

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.500
and in collaboration
with DeepMind,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.040
we recently released the
Deep Planning Network Agent,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.280
which learns a world
model from image inputs

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.250
only and successfully
leverages it for planning.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.190
Take a look at the post
for a lot of detail

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.810
and a link to the source code.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.200
We've recently made enhancements
to the audience builder

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.480
experience in Google
Analytics for Firebase,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.510
with a few major updates to
help you identify relevant app

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.960
audiences more easily and
with greater precision.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.360
Audiences are now
dynamic by default,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.470
can be more precisely defined
by adding exclusion criteria,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.710
and can now include a
membership time frame.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.160
More details and a
screenshot are on the post.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.950
Jib is an open source tool
that containerizes your Java

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.110
applications with
minimal effort.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.090
Simply apply the
plugin to your Maven

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.460
or Gradle build
and run the build.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.770
Jib 1.0.0 is now
generally available,

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.930
making it stable
for production use.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.420
Take a look at the
post for some examples.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.750
Are you going to the RSA
Conference in San Francisco

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.500
next month?

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.230
Well, so are members of
the Google Cloud team.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.860
Check out this post for a link
to talks at the RSA Conference,

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.740
as well as a link to the
Google Cloud Security Talks,

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.430
a series of 20 talks over just
two days, five minutes away

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.230
from the Moscone Center.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.310

I'm Timothy Jordan for
The Developer Show.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.050
Thanks for watching, and
we'll see you next week.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.600
And we'll see you next week,
as well as in the next take.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.460
Because I will have
been reading this text

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.883
at least two times by then.
