Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday.

Speaker 1:          00:00:07       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       September 10th, 2018. How's it going? How I yeah. Oh, why? Yeah. Um, I am back from a whirlwind tour. I fucking crazy weekend. I'm actually sitting here a podcasting in front of the TV, which I know a lot of you don't like. Simply the fucking Steelers and browns had a tie. Wow. Jesus Christ one that, this exact reason why you don't like it. This is the exact fucking reason cause I get distracted. I haven't seen a fucking tie since like they've had over time. I don't really, I don't recall one, um, zero zero and one of the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cleveland browns. How about that? Um, anyways, yeah, I'm sitting here. I've got the Red Sox game on in the background. The Houston Astros are trying to become the second team this season to sweep the red sox while Boston is trying to go two for two today against the city of Houston. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:01:17       Now we already done kicked the shit at you fucking football team. Now we're trying with the baseball team. I'll be honest with you. Uh, I thought the Patriots, so it's good for the first two and a half quarters. Um, special teams is letting up more yards than I would like. Then you would like bill you as a what a football coach. You as a comedian and a shit joke telling fucking jackass who decided to fucking record a game and fast forward through the commercials yet. Bill, what did you see on your game film? Um, fair enough. Fair enough. You know, there's always room for criticism. Who am I to sit here and act like I'm above it? Um, yeah, I thought I was very impressed with our pass rush. I was very impressed with our ability to, uh, contain, uh, what's his name? Watson there.

Speaker 2:          00:02:09       I thought he was going to be a nightmare. I also thought he might've been a little gun shy about running because he is coming back from a knee injury. So I thought when he ran, when he had to, but I was impressed with him staying in the pocket. Um, I liked, uh, the new, uh, left guard. We got there. I left tackle, I should say taking over for Nate soldier, soldier, I'll be you say his name. He was only there for fucking 20 years. Now he's playing with the giants. Um, Brown, whoever that guy was just keeping all those beasts up front. Four of the Texas where they get clowny, they got JJ watts and then they got some other guy like maniac or something like that. Like his name is literally like, it's like psycho or maniac or something like that. I'm not a nickname. The name he was born with as a baby. Oh look at that little cute baby. What's its name? Clarence Maniac. You want to have a play date? Uh, no I don't. Why am I fucking head phones? Fucking God damn these fucking cheap ass fucking things. I swear to God, I just can't win.

Speaker 1:          00:03:13       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:03:13       CanNot fucking win. What is going on now? This is all brand new shit. I got all brand new shit. Hear people. Speaking of which, if you want to fucking, if you want to, a couple of things I'm selling. I just bought a new mixer. Uh, my old one works fine, but I'm getting back to doing these uninformed with Joe de Rosa, which is going to be up on my patrion page coming up here in November. We're going to take some episodes, get a little in the can and that type of shit and some other stuff. So I didn't get a mixture where I could actually have enough microphones for more than two people. So I have a mixer with the chords and all of that shit. Uh, if you want to start your own podcast, if you want to open up your little podcast shop across the street and compete with me, uh, let me know.

Speaker 2:          00:04:00       I'll figure it out. Cause I already started Dean del Ray cell and some shit. I got a drum kit that I'm selling. All right, I'll get all the information. I'll have it posted on my fucking Twitter site. Um, I'm selling this, uh, one of those sonar, like travel kits. You know, it's Kinda like the uh, Questlove one. The, the, what is it? Uh, whatever that one that he does with the little fucking 18 inch bass drum. It's the same thing, but just sona. Um, and fucking beautiful. I just don't have the room for it anymore. I got a, I made a little drum room in my, uh, garage so I don't have to have a studio space for my drum son. I brought the big boy kid home and I got that little one, which fucking sounds great by the way. And I also have the, uh, the, the fucking pads there where it's silent.

Speaker 2:          00:04:50       You know what I mean? Where it doesn't, it doesn't, uh, you know, the Mesh ones or the real ones. I got a tuned up. Nice. My buddy tuned it up, I should say, um, after I kind of fucked it up a little bit, but um, whatever, that's what it's come down to people. This is the new me. Okay. I'm getting rid of Shit and right now you know what my, my whole fucking day, my headphones out work at right now. I have no fucking idea if you can, all I'm doing is just looking at the fucking mixture. I know that you can hear me. I haven't been able to, I fucking came home. I went to watch the fucking patriots game. Uh, my wife Angel that she is taped the game for me and then I'm sitting there watching it and it, the thing just like, it starts fucking up. Then I got to hit pause. I gotta shut it off. I've got to turn it back on. It was doing like one of those fucking things and it started off. It was doing it every couple of minutes. Then once a minute I'll fuck you. You can't fall ball foul ball.

Speaker 2:          00:05:48       Is that fair or foul? Five. All right. Sorry. Um, it's two to one red socks by the way. Astros'

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       her up. You just hit one down by the Pesky Pole. It went foul. Um, anyways, so then it started doing it like every 30 seconds and it was like every eight fucking seconds. And I was loving watching the game. Tony Romo, I'm calling it right now. Tony Romo. If he fucking keeps doing this shit, he's going to be a hall of fame broadcaster. I have never learned more shit about football. I don't think. Maybe since I'm going back maybe to like John Madden, the way the guys breaking down all of this stuff and there's always been all these coaches and all this shit tried to do it somehow. The Way Tony Romo does it, it's like you get it and he does it in real time. Um, it's fucking amazing. So I was enjoying that. So you know how the world works out? What are you enjoying something? Well, let's fuck up the recording of it. So that's what ended up happening. And um, you know what it's funny about my fucking headphones is if I sit up and I'm uncomfortable, they work perfect. But if I lean back and I'm comfortable, I swear to God, dude, I don't know what the fuck I think I did. I kill Tesla and another fucking life. Is that what I did? And this is my fucking punishment.

Speaker 1:          00:07:14       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:07:15       This is literally all brand new shit. I swear to God. I don't know what the fuck I did. I kick Edison in the balls during a previous level. He's a fucking thief anyways. Right? I, I swear to God, unbelievable. And this is the shit, right? My wife never flips out about shit like this. You know why? Cause it never happens to her cause she buys new shit and it works. My wife will like lose her cell phone and grand central station and then I'll call it and they'll just be some guy. Yeah. Yes I have it. No, no. I'll bring it to you. Right? I lose my cell phone. That's fucking it. Over cold case file. No leads, no nothing. That fucker is gone. All right, so it's better over here. Little better over here. A little better.

Speaker 1:          00:08:08       Hmm.

Speaker 3:          00:08:10       Now this fucking thing is hanging off here. This whole fucking podcast is just gonna be me bitching about this fucking wire that I just bought. Now it's off. Now it's off. Now it's on. Oh, I see. What happens when there's a little bit of weight and it's hanging down or can't handle that can you can't fucking handle a little bit of fucking weight. Is that what it is? I just figured what out what it is. Oh, we got a quitter here. Everybody. We got a little fucking snowflake. Let's just move the whole fucking table for you buddy. Everybody gets a fucking ribbon on my mixer. Just fell off the fucking table. This whole thing, this is going off the rails here.

Speaker 1:          00:08:47       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:08:50       Why do I try to make my life easier? It doesn't work out. So I uh, can

Speaker 2:          00:08:56       I lean back in the old man, put his fucking back up against the couch. Hello, test. Oh, there we go. There we go. All right, so I'm back. Why don't you just dem, what'd you just saw? That was why my wife is sick of living with me. I know everything's a fucking conspiracy theory with me. I really wish when those sort of challenging moments and in the first world country as a blue eyed white male, that was actually a challenging moment for me as people are there are like literally swing war torn fucking countries haven't, God knows what Don to them, right? If there is a god and he's looking down right now and he hears all this screaming and yelling and shit about stuff that's going on and you find out what's this, what's this poor soul screaming about right after he slips at the horrors of war and he's going to just see some bald 50 year old fucking moron doing a podcast by himself yelling about a microphone cord. He's just going to look down and it is a he, by the way. All right. Fuck all this feminist shit where now they turn in everything around, you know, fuck this. You know, there's gotta be something that has to still be a guy, right? Why Not God,

Speaker 2:          00:10:20       Oh, why do I love being an asshole? I just, I enjoy it. I'm sorry. I do. All right. He's going to be looking down and be like, Oh, who is that? I made that. All right. Do me a favor when he passes yet to give them the, uh, tell him to take the down escalator.

Speaker 4:          00:10:39       MMM. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:10:40       I don't know where I'm going to go when I die. I can't even think about that shit. I watched that Mr. Rogers, uh, won't you be my neighbor? Did you fucking see that? You guys watch that thing? Whatever you call it, their documentary. I have never felt like such a piece of shit in my life after watching that. He's definitely fucking Weirdo man. He's so fucking weird, you know, says the guy by himself losing his shit. Talking into a microphone. I had the nerve to say that this guy's weird, but um, I I, yeah, fuck it. Take it easy. End of the getting gunned down. Um, sorry. Anyways, I a, I watched that documentary and uh, Fred Rogers.

Speaker 4:          00:11:38       Mmm Mike.

Speaker 2:          00:11:38       I said if this, if, if there is a god and Christians are right and God at his son without having sex with a virgin.

Speaker 4:          00:11:53       MMM Jesus.

Speaker 2:          00:11:53       I mean, just, how do you even say it out loud and still believe it, man. It's just clearly written by guys who don't want sloppy seconds, you know? So then they got to have to have like that. Like she's a virgin. No one ever banged her before, so she doesn't know what good sex is. She doesn't know what a big Dick is. Now I could feel comfortable to mount this person. I mean, is that, is that, was that the underlying theme of all of that? Huh? Hey, look at that. That's sort of a feminist look at it, isn't it? I Dunno what it is. [inaudible] right now. I'm sorry. My apologies to everybody. South of a fucking Washington DC Mason Dixon line there. Do you guys know the first, you know the Gettysburg address? Yeah, I had no fucking idea where that was in the first fucking battle of the civil war.

Speaker 2:          00:12:46       I thought it was like, you know, somewhere in the sec they were in big 10 country. They weren't fucking Pennsylvania. I had no idea. We never would get that far. We always start with those fucking three ships. The Nina, the Pinta, the Santa Maria, they came over. They somehow, they came over after a Columbus, right? Columbus came over to like, I dunno, like Cuba. Well The Bahamas, Haiti, he was down around there. Right. And then the Nina, the Pinta and Santa Maria, they all came over together. Right. Sort of the first carnival cruise. It's kind of like that without, you know, a workout, Roman scurvy and shit like that. Right. Big Dope buckles. They must send a credible neck muscles back then. Huh? Big fucking hat with that belt on there. Looking down at your soggy fucking boots, bringing your head back up. Um, anyways, they were all trapped easy. The coach used to come off slide right off their fucking nonexistent shoulders. So anyways, we would start with that shit and then we would maybe get to the war of 18, 12 never fucked with the civil war as far as where I went to school. We never fucked with it. It was just our country fighting each other. Why, why would that be of interest to anybody?

Speaker 5:          00:14:12       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:14:13       maybe that was just northern as being cool. You don't not talking shit after winning. Ah, we don't need to teach him that we won. Right. But down south they were always talking about it. Probably saying that we cheated, you know, like people hate the Patriots. Say we under inflated our fucking cannon balls at whatever the fuck they're going to say, you know. Um, anyways, let me a tell me, just sent me a text at Aaron Rodgers. Get hurt. Please tell me. I fucking hate when that happens. Roger is done. He grabbed that niece so fast. It's bad. Oh No.

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       Oh

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       Jesus Christ. I fucking hate you. It's just, there's nothing worse than that.

Speaker 6:          00:14:59       You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:15:02       And I gotta tell you something. If you're a vikings fan or a bears fan in your psych that that happened, you're a fucking asshole. You know, I never rooted for Derek Jeter to get hurt or any of that shit. You want a, you want to play in when the, when do you want to beat him with that best? Um, wow. Does that change the NFC? My buddy who actually knows something about football was, was picking them to go to the Superbowl. Well, you know what that reminds me, I remember that year when the jets were favored, was like the first game of the season Test Verde, you know, blew out as Achilles

Speaker 6:          00:15:39       and uh,

Speaker 2:          00:15:41       who cried? It wasn't Terrell Owens. It was uh, the guy from USC. Oh Jesus Christ. Just give me the damn ball. When did wide the wide receiver position become the diva position. He used to always be the quarterback. He was the guy always walking around with the big inflated fucking ego in somewhere in the last like 15, 20 years. Like all the emotional meltdowns come from the guys who like catch the balls, you know, that was my quarterback.

Speaker 6:          00:16:18       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:16:19       Um, just give me the Damn Paul. Oh Jesus Christ. Anyways, um, so I worked up in Thunder Valley learned or valley fucking California. Um, the, the farthest north. I have been in Sacramento. All right. I was a, I landed in Sacramento was a 30 minute drive and this guy, fortunately he took like the back roads, which is really cool. So we went by all these, these farms and uh, I actually for the first time saw an almond tree. I thought nuts came from the ground, you know, cause I always, you know, I was going to baseball whenever I go to baseball game, they give you the ones that they feed to the elephants. Those are like the fucking, you know, the Budweiser of peanuts. Almonds is sort of like the blue moon. You get a little more fucking crafty beer. Kind of snobby. Right? But they're those, those elephant ones, they always seem like they're dirty.

Speaker 2:          00:17:22       Take me out to the ball game. I didn't know that nuts came on trees. I'm probably making an ass of myself right now either. They all do. Well that's the one that does or whatever. But I know there's a lot of you right now just racing to look up this information so then you can tell me how dumb I am. Or maybe you fucking know that. You know, you don't know how to grow one. You don't know where to pick it. You just know where it comes from. Right. Um, so now all of a sudden I'm the biggest asshole ever is, is that what happened? No belt. You're the biggest asshole ever because you just had a meltdown about a fucking wire. Fair enough. Fair enough. Jesus Christ, the Buccaneers in saints 48 to 40.

Speaker 2:          00:18:10       I got to tell you before it's all said and done, I drew Brees is going to throw for more fucking everything that anybody, unless Tom Brady keeps playing. Cause I don't think drew Brees is doing that. Uh, drew versus time. Tom Brady versus time like that shit. Like today, they actually, they said he was the oldest quarterback to throw a touchdown in the first game of the year. Other than George Blanda. Who is the Gordy fucking how of of football as far as how long he played and, and Warren Moon. Who? I didn't know. I didn't know he played that late. I know he's spent most of at least half his career up in the CFL. Maybe that's why he didn't seem like he was at old because by the time he came in the league, it was already like eight years in the CFL. Um, anyways, uh, why do I have the fucking TV on? Why do I give a shit? Should I hit pause? Let me hit pause. You know, at the end of the day, I have a job here to do and it's God damn it is to make people laugh. Well, you know what, it's a new TV and I don't know how to do it. Is this, do it? Oh my God, it did it. I hit the pause button and it paused.

Speaker 6:          00:19:26       Fuck that. I'm hitting play.

Speaker 2:          00:19:28       I still have that thing. You remember the old days when you pause your flat screen and then it's just burned in there? Whatever the fuck you were looking at. Um, all right, let me look the other way. Okay. So I, I watched, uh, won't you be my neighbor? And then I also watched a Chappaquiddick you got to check both. Both those movies out were incredible and uh, any on me stay on track here. So we took the, uh, the back roads up to this casino, what their thunder bay, not to bay, sorry. Thunder Valley.

Speaker 6:          00:20:02       And uh,

Speaker 2:          00:20:04       you know, every once in awhile I'll actually watch the news and whenever I watched the news, it always puts me into a panic and makes me feel like I should live in the middle of nowhere next to a lake with a bunch of guns.

Speaker 6:          00:20:18       You know?

Speaker 2:          00:20:19       And I know there's a lot of people in the cities probably think that stuff. Okay, well, here's the deal. The only way to live in the middle of nowhere is if you grew up in the middle of nowhere. Cause then you know how to live out there. Right. You came from a family that, that taught you how to hunt and all of that shit. You know what I mean? I'm too fucking old for that. I gotta go this snake Pliska en route and try to stay in,

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       in a fucking city.

Speaker 5:          00:20:51       You know,

Speaker 3:          00:20:53       I think I'm going to join the people that live underground in the sewers cause it's going to be so fucking hot. You know the red heads, all us red heads, we're going to end up under ground and we're going to be coming up like a bunch of filthy Malakai's. So you guys better sharpen your fucking swords or whatever the hell you're going to have once you run out of bullets. That's going to be the thing when you run out of fucking bullets, then it'll be swords and just clubs and it's, it's going to be come fucking Braveheart, you know? But not if we were all like Fred Rogers.

Speaker 3:          00:21:31       He be just sitting there in the middle of it. It's such a good failing to know you're alive and when you crawl up Adda that manhole. I would appreciate it if you, what the fuck just happened? He got all of that one. How did it go from two other here? Three run fucking homer. I don't even know who did it. Very nice. That's right. Houston. How does it feel to be owned chain and people do that shit? Um, the big story here is that the Houston Astros are going to take two out of three, which this is a series. Now this is one of these wants that I pay attention to because we're going to run into these. Some bitches come October, so I want to see how we match up my, granted Chris sale's done in there. I don't know if price pitched, I don't even know what the fuck's going on.

Speaker 3:          00:22:36       So anyways, we get up there to thunder valley and it is literally a fucking casino just surrounded by farmland and the Gig. It's this giant stage just like out in the parking lot and ever. Nobody's covered. Right? If there was any sort of rain, I was joking like everybody would just fucking leave and I would be contractually obligated to do an hour in front of a bunch of plastic wet folding chairs. But I gotta tell you it's one of my favorite gigs I've had in a long time was amazing. The Sky was beautiful. The only thing that was weird was like when motorcycles would go by, I had to like stop doing my act. Like I was literally getting like heckled by those things that I was joking about. How those people up there, they probably don't wear helmets. You know what I mean? Anytime you have a problem you just drive off into a bunch of snow peas. Those things are probably nice and soft, slow you down. Um, and then after that I woke up the next morning at like something ridiculous. I want to say it was a 4:00 AM am and then I had to get on a 6:00 AM flight, something like that. I can't even fucking remember. Slide is salt lake city and from Salt Lake City go to Toronto for tiff. The Toronto International Film Festival is All freckles is in a movie called the front runner directed by, uh, Jason Reitman starring a Hugh Jackman. And I just,

Speaker 6:          00:24:12       uh Huh.

Speaker 3:          00:24:13       I saw it for the first time anyways, let me tell you the whole fucking story. So I, one of my favorite things I've seen in an airport standing in line, right, trying to find something healthy but you can't really do. And uh, this guy in front of me, he orders two bagels and he goes, can you put butter on it? Can you put, I just want to bagels with butter on it. And he's like already on his tip toes, like over the counter and he's tall enough to see over the counter. So I was like, what? He's one of these fucking guys, like when you prepare his food, he has all these fucking instructions and he's on his tip toes watching you do it. And immediately I'm just like, God bless the fucking woman or man romantically linked to this fucking lunatic,

Speaker 6:          00:25:02       right?

Speaker 3:          00:25:04       So he's on, he's on his tip toes at Yankee. He's on his fucking tip toes watching this lady. She sticks it in the little fucking conveyor belt piece of shit, toaster and it comes out. She's putting into to gaze go. I could keep put cake with the butter on it, ma'am. Could you just put the punch? She goes, what? She goes, can can, can you put the butter on? She goes, yeah. She goes to butters over there and he goes, no. I was just hoping that you could put butter on it while it's still hot so to like melt. Can you do that? Can, can you just put butter on it while it's still hot and then close it up. Can you do that for me? She just looks at him. He goes, no, just handed on the bag. Now I know. I've always made fun of that. I hate those fucking places where all of a sudden you got to finish making the sandwich like you work there for free, but just the way she just told the guy no and he was already annoying me the way he was up on his fucking tip toes.

Speaker 6:          00:25:57       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:25:58       Like Gee, what? What the fuck you, you didn't order like a, I'm trying to think of something fancy. You wanted a fucking Bagel.

Speaker 6:          00:26:06       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:26:06       She's going to toast the thing. She's going to stick it in a bag. You're gonna pay for it. Then you're going to go over to the condiments. Try to find something that wasn't sneezed on. You know how it's going down. So I laughed and she looked at me and gave me like half a smile. She's like, what do you want? I'm just like, ah, I'll take one of those ham and cheese sandwiches. You know, you don't have to do anything to it.

Speaker 6:          00:26:27       MMM [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:26:29       Oh, it was great watching that guy gets shut down. I don't know why. It's like you have a see a little spoiled fucking Brat kid crying, you know, cause he wants something. Is there anything better watching a parent not cave and then the kid doesn't get it. I fee I live

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       for that moment when the kid cries and cries and cries and then the parents end up just giving it to them. I was mixed. We just want to like trip them. Isn't that stupid? I don't, obviously, I'm just saying, you know something I do think about, I'm not proud of it. We all have our flaws occasionally. Yes, I see. I see. I see a kid gets up to and after crying and uh, makes you want to triple and it's stupid because the kid doesn't have the emotional maturity to express himself.

Speaker 6:          00:27:22       Right? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:27:24       What else Fred Rogers would have handled that if he didn't want them to have it. Why are you crying? Well, you can't have all, my God, what a fucking moron. This, this, I've got blessed it. There's a woman there, she's wearing a Houston Astros fan. She's wearing like one of those, you know, they make the number ones finger out. She's got a giant orange Astros hat. Like to the point you're blocking people's view behind you. Those are the things. It's because of hats like that and people like that. That where I'm at games. That's one of the reasons why like things like flame throwers are not legal to the general public because that's the kind of thing when you sit there for nine fucking innings. All right. And that's self centered content. Won't take the fucking thing off. That's one of the things, if you had like a, a, a handheld, I'm not saying you'd burn her, but you'd like to hat on fire and God knows what that's made out of and it might, you know, touch somebody else's fucking hat and then they're on fire and you're like, but no, no, no. I just wanted to set her on fire. I'm sorry sir. My Bet. My Bet. Would you like me to drive you to the burn unit? No. Most of your ear is still attached.

Speaker 6:          00:28:43       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:28:45       Anyways, so then I flew up to Canada and I checked like 9 million times that I had my passport because that's one of the things I always, you know, the first half of my career, you could just go to Canada, like you're going to your friend's house. He didn't need a passport, you know, and then after nine, 11,

Speaker 7:          00:29:03       shit,

Speaker 2:          00:29:07       don't even say nine 11 but horrific event. And, uh, ever since then you've hit, you've got to have your fucking passport to go everywhere. So, uh, I checked like fucking 900 times, make sure I have my passport. Um, and I went through the customs and everything and I think I got there at like four o'clock. And then like the pickup was like at five 15. So by the time I got through customs and all of that shit ordered room service and everything, like I had time to iron my stupid shirt and then I went over there and I did the whole, uh, you know, the whole red carpet got asked great questions. Nobody tried to corner me, you know, it was a couple of, how would you relate this movie to what's going on today in the current political climate? You know, it was fine. There was no way. What do you think about this guy going back on stage already knew what I was going to say. Well what do you think about it?

Speaker 2:          00:30:12       That's all I am ever do. You asked me one of those and your career questions, I just throw it right back at you. What do you think about it? No, I'm asking you. Well I didn't ask the question. You're the one who has the question. You're the one thinking about it. What do you think about it? I want to hear why, why you put a quote on it. What do you think about it there? They have fucking, uh, Jimmy Olsen. So then we, uh, I went into the, uh, this beautiful theater and sat down and watched the movie and I gotta tell you, man, it's pretty fucking incredible. Uh, Jason Reitman killed it. Uh, it's called the front runner and I would not be, I don't want to Jinx Eddie a, I'm not going to jinx nothing, but I would not be surprised. I'll go real. I'm going to really go low here if it performs very well, that's, that's as much shit as I'm going to talk.

Speaker 2:          00:31:08       Um, but it's a phenomenal, phenomenal movie. And the way the whole thing was cut together, the way they told the story. And uh, it's really, really fascinating. It's about the, uh, the Gary Hart story, which a, for you youngsters out there. He was a guy running for president in 1988. And yes, he was the front runner. Great Looking Guy. Guys like them ladies loved them. Full head of hair, you know, that's the kind of shit that gets you elected. Right? Play the saxophone on our Sineal hall. Two terms, not one, two terms. Ah, Shit. Did they just hit a fucking home run guy? That was a monster shot. Five to two. The Astros'. No, quint numb. You know why? Cause they're champions. Um, oh man, that's that fucking guy.

Speaker 2:          00:32:06       What is his name? That's the guy last year, the world series. That was incredible. You know the dude that I was out today, right? That guy, that guy's worst. Every time you pay him, you know, outside, like I liked that guy in the infield for the Texas Rangers. Total winner. The guy who punched that dude in the face. Um, credible ballplayer, man, that's going to be ashamed watching the red sox and Yankees by him away from the Rangers. Although back in the day, the range of spent all money on a Rod, right? 220 million bucks. So they got money. That's Texas, man. You sit in on all that fucking oil. Why don't you take some of that money, put it on your team. Um, anyways, so I got there went thank God every like the, uh, I got there on time and I got to see movies. Phenomenal.

Speaker 2:          00:33:02       Everybody in it is so fucking good. I'm not gonna lie to you. I had my head down whenever he, my boys put my head down. But uh, you know, I watched, I actually watched most of my scenes and I wasn't cringing too badly. So I think, uh, I think I did all right in it. Uh, but I want to thank everybody for uh, everyone I worked with and giving me the opportunity to be in it. But I think it's going to be a great one. So guys, could you do me a favor? I know you're all stream and shit. I know you got your fucking virtual reality glasses with your laser disc players. Whatever the fuck he kids are doing nowadays.

And what happens was all those fucking baseball cards in the 1950s, all the Mickey male rookie cards and all of that shit blew up and we're with all that money. So by the time I became an adult, so many adults were collecting cards. Kids didn't give a shit about it. And then I try collecting football cards again and they, they would like deliberately make some of them rare. You couldn't just go out and go buy a whole set cause that's what people were doing. And then they weren't fucking worth anything. Let me see tops. Let me see. They still have these things. Football card, Duh. Uh, 2018, 2018. What do you got here buddy? Will my internet work? You know what? I don't even care if it does. It does or it doesn't. I'm not going to flip out about it. How about that? Just relax bill. Just count to 10 slowly one. You know, I got a master, I got a master going for a walk the other day. I got into with my wife, right. And, and I, I started to walk away but I didn't leave,

Speaker 5:          00:44:41       you know.

Speaker 3:          00:44:44       All right. Sharp tops, football cards, 2018 football cards, release dates. All right, let's see what they got here. It's such a good feeling. I used to just sit there and like, I wouldn't study in school and I would just look at football cards and I would read, I would look at the picture and I would just read them over and over and over again. It didn't realize it was like flashcards. And by the end of it, I knew everybody in the league. I knew where they went to cook and I would watch it every year. I get the cards every year and there was all these guys that I, I already knew shit about and there was only so many new rookies. And uh, I remember he's still blow my dad's mind. I was like, and he went to college and be, can't stay

Speaker 3:          00:45:29       Louie couches. See as a size 16, quadruple ees clique. You like Jesus Christ. How do you know all of this stuff bill, while dad, cause I'm not studying all that effort that I should have put in to my studies so I could've gone to a big time college, you know, and joined a Frat, walked around, you know, maybe join the glee club or whatever. I've had an acapella group, you know, met some women, get me two fucking years later. I just missed out on it. Um, when the fuck is this thing gonna load. All right. You know, I'm just, I'm just going to start read some questions. Maybe at some point I don't, I know for the life of me, I don't know how much money I have to pay these Internet guys to get something that works. You know, I was three, I started to talk about this where a buddy of mine had a, you know, he solved his internet prom but they got these things called like mesh or something like that where it ties the Internet signal from one party house to another.

We've all talked on a cell phone long enough that like the side of your fucking one side of your head starts feeling weird. You know what I mean? They still a bit about that.

You've played at a, all right. Why isn't Jay on Netflix? Well, or CSO went out of business. What else is there? Hulu, Amazon and all that. Well, eventually it happens for everybody.

Speaker 3:          00:48:48       Everybody, you know, takes people different amount of time. You know, look, I started in 1992 and it took me until either 2005 or 2006 to get on Letterman. And I went through a couple of bookers, a couple that it was just like, yeah, I don't like you or you get a weird, we get a weird look as one that I got. Well I don't think that was some the and people, but um, yeah, you know, it was hilarious. I remember years later seeing this other generations of comedians and they were like bitching about the book booking process and they were like seven years in. It's just like, well wait fucking buck up buddy. It's going to take you another A. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:49:30       I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:49:31       But that's not how it works. It's not how it works nowadays. Cause now there's social media cause now you fucking complaint and then everybody's afraid to get in trouble and nobody know. He just goes like, hey, you don't have, fuck you. Oh Shit.

Speaker 5:          00:49:41       Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:49:44       Ah, it's a run. Scored two run score two runs, go. Oh my God, these fucking Houston Astros are relentless looking at them. They're all up there top of the day. This is impressive. This is what we've been doing, the teams all year and now they're coming in giving us the old right there, Fred.

Speaker 5:          00:50:09       Fuck.

Speaker 3:          00:50:11       I already know what they're saying with the sound on that ball got up there in the zone. I mean that thing you want that much lower. This is like that's right in his wheelhouse and he jumped all over it. His eyes, they opened up like a kid on Christmas. Ah, fuck me. Um, anyways, I love that you guys know that the result of this Houston chance. So I was talking all that shit like we're gonna whip y'all fucking cities as today.

Speaker 4:          00:50:39       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:50:40       If there is a sportscar just because that woman is wearing that giant stupid fucking hat in a, in a visitor's stadium, you know? I mean just how many times can you just ask to get your fucking ass kicked before it happens?

Speaker 4:          00:50:54       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:50:56       Anyways, yeah, so people like, yeah. Then started whining about, I dunno how long it takes or whatever. Then I guess it's shortened up. It's so fucking stupid. [inaudible] it's particularly hard for me. It's like, what are you, what are you seeing out there? Like, here's the deal. It might be more difficult for you, but nobody has it easy fucking sitting there acting like God damn fucking Spielberg sends me a fucking sandwich every day.

Speaker 4:          00:51:30       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:51:32       Which would be nice if he's listening every once in a while.

Speaker 4:          00:51:37       Uh,

Speaker 3:          00:51:37       alright. Outdoor venues. Yes. Um, where's the weirdest venues that I've played, outdoor venues that I played at. I used to open up for Wynonna Judd way back in the day and we, uh, we did a lot of outdoor venues. Um, you know, when you're selling that level of tickets, she basically was selling so many tickets that they, they didn't have an indoor venue big enough so that you have, you have to go outside at some point. So I opened it up up for her at the, I believe it's the del Mar race track. I thought I told this story. So I go down there and it's one of these deals with it, like, hey, you know, work clean. This is a country crowd. These people, uh, they don't like Carsick, which, you know, you have to respect. It's not my crowd. I'm opening for this person. This is what they've created, you know, all you young comics out there to then go up there and, and, and curse anyways is a, that's not a Lenny Bruce moment that, that you're, you're acting like a jerk off. Cause they, they probably told you before they even got the Gig, you got to work clean. So if you're not going to work clean, don't take the Gig, but don't say you're going to work clean and then go up there and start talking about your nuts or far more accurately these days, you're fucking Twat. Cause female comics are that fucking Dick joke comics of today.

Speaker 3:          00:53:07       Some of the fucking filth that I, I mean some of the bits it's just like, I remember this bit except there were Dick and balls and I was standing in a bar trying to figure out how the fuck am I going to follow this shit.

Speaker 4:          00:53:21       MMM.

Speaker 3:          00:53:23       Anyways, so, uh, I had to clean

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       it was during the day, which actually didn't bug me because I was psyched because I was making money. I always loved like those gigs, like a lot of times the newness and shit sucked. But what was awesome was when it was over, you had your check and you already make money and you could maybe double up and do another Gig or you were like done at like a normal hours. So, um, but that never happened. You know, you always went out and did more fucking time. Are we going to do sit at home, be alone with your thoughts? So I went down there and Wynona was always like really nice to me. Um, and I went down to open up and I got to work clean. It's outside, I'm in the sun, I'm a redhead. I still had my hair back then, so I didn't need a hat and a, I'm up there and I'm doing my shit.

Speaker 2:          00:54:17       And all of a sudden this lady in the crowd who I'm going to go out on a limb and say was a lesbian, you know, she had that haircut, the whole fucking thing. I know you're not, you're not supposed to do all you need. At least you're not supposed to do that with lesbians. You know, you can do that with other groups of people. You know. Don't be a Brad, don't be a Chad. You can, you can fucking do that. But if you go the other way, all of a sudden you're an asshole. Uh, but yeah, I mean if I had to put my life savings on it and the same people that were criticizing me, if it was a life or death situation, if you had to put money on it, you would say this was a lesbian. Right. Why is it pertinent to the story?

Speaker 2:          00:54:56       Because I'm painting a picture. All right? And all you liberal cons out there acting like you don't have a fucking idea in your head when I say that, that she was a lesbian. You have no fucking idea what I'm saying. What if I said it was a frat boy, you got your boom, you got to get that picture in your head. Right. Um, anyways, so she sit there and I'm on stage and she shit the whole, like I maybe get three minutes into my act, we'll fucking outside. It's brewed and she's just staying that she starts going, wow. Wow. And she's trying to get the rest of the crowd to do it with her, which they're not thankfully, but she's fucking relentless. And I don't know if I did a joke that she didn't like, or maybe it was that I had a deck. I have no fucking idea. Or maybe I was just an pasty you maybe she thought I was weird looking. Well, maybe she was just a comment. I have no idea what she's doing that. And I'm sitting there and I want to go off on her, but I got to work clean. So I actually just stopped and I gathered myself and I said, Hey lady. I was like, what is the problem? Why are you chanting wine? Wynonna is, why no, not, she's going to come out here

Speaker 9:          00:56:19       at eight 30

Speaker 2:          00:56:21       no matter what she's coming out at eight 30. Okay. Do you think I thought all you guys came out here to see me. I know why I'm here. I'm dancing monkey boy, but blah blah blah blah blah. And uh, I got the crowd on my side and then I made fun of her haircut. I had to, I had to do it cause I had to make sure I got all the Trump supporters on my side. I was flailing and then I got him and I started having getting laughs and that lady was pissed and she was still chant. Why? No, no, but now it's drowning or out with laughs and I was winning. Oh, redhead in the sun with this pasty freckled back up against the nonexistent wall was turning it around and then out of nowhere the crowd went from laughing on and know where they just went,

Speaker 10:         00:57:13       Woo.

Speaker 2:          00:57:14       All at the same time. And I couldn't figure what the fuck happened. I thought my fly came down. I had no idea. And I turned around and behind me was a way off in the distance was a carnival and there's some ride where they just shoot you up in the fucking air, like, like superman. So I'm standing there fucking finally getting the crowd and right as this starting to pay attention to me in the way in the background. Some guy got shot up in the fucking air on this ride and then I kind of made fun of that. Oh, not another hit. Ah, another had another run scores and we got ourselves a tie game five to five, just like that, uh, coaches coming out to the mound. Um, Jesus Christ. Wow. And with deep into our fucking bullpen already. This is not looking good guys.

Speaker 6:          00:58:10       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:58:12       Anyways, uh, so yeah, that was a weird one. I've done also, I've done college gigs in a, uh, sort of that area. You know, the Walker's shame area between dorms. I've done that. And it was also like sort of a carnival thing set up. There's always a fucking car. It was always rides some sort of popcorn machine.

Speaker 6:          00:58:37       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:58:40       I remember a long time ago, this one was actually inside.

Speaker 6:          00:58:45       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:58:47       It was me, Patrice, O'Neil, Robert Kelly, Dane Cook, and Al Del Benny. We all do in this gig. And it was some, some sort of Jewish thing. I don't remember what was a function hall and the crowd was, was predominantly Jewish. I don't know. It couldn't have been fucking, they don't go to church. Where do they go to temple? I couldn't have been related to that or they wouldn't have hired us. I don't know what it was, but all I know is we were up there

Speaker 6:          00:59:23       and

Speaker 2:          00:59:25       none of us were in the business long enough to recognize like we will go, why is this microphone so small? Like you could hold it with just your two fingers. I remember our went up there first go, and this is the smallest microphone I've ever seen. Then he put it in his mouth and started humming or whatever, and people laughed and I was like, oh my God, I got to hold that thing. Now I've got to go up after him. Right. So we did the whole, we did the whole fucking show. I remember when Patrice got up there, he was holding it with his big fucking fat fingers. Just holding this little thing is three things. Like he was holding a teacup and a, it wasn't until years later when I did my first TV Gig that I realized it was a lapel Mike and none of us knew.

Speaker 2:          01:00:06       Just clip it on your shirt and then just walk around like you're doing the one man show, you know, with both hands. So we all, we would like finish our act and there was a mic stand and we would like drape it over and then the next guy would come up and just pick it up with his index finger and his thumb. Um, yeah, I don't know. I gotta be honest with you. All of those hell gigs, they all just kind of, they kind of fade away after a while. I can't, I don't remember. I just know I've had a bunch of shit thrown at me. I think I just, after a while you just, you don't want to remember him.

Speaker 6:          01:00:38       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:00:40       Yeah. I don't know. I, I've, I've done some, I've definitely done some weird, I know I've done, I did one outside up on the fucking west side highway. There was like boats and shit and all these fucking flies and stuff. Yeah. These are all starting to come back to and was hottest shit too. And I was up there and I had like a long sleeve button down cause I just worked like a comedy club so they had like the air conditioning cranking and then I went over and did that Gig and I was like sweating my ass off. Yeah, I've done it. I've done a lot of those. That's kind of par for the course that happens. Um, that was a fun one though. I opened for Wynona outside in a, in a, uh, in a parking lot, parking lot, race track, the occasional theater.

Speaker 2:          01:01:32       I opened up for an a parking lot in Laughlin, Nevada. Jesus do. Why are you bringing back all of these memories? All right. A smoothie, dear bill, years and years back you said Kevin, James told you the benefits of having liquid first in the morning to get your engine going. Kevin James. I don't know if you get the name right. I've only met him like once a smoothie, water, et cetera. Then a few years ago you basically said, fuck that because you thought it was too much. It might have read it was bad for you. Now you're doing smoothies. Do you think it'll stick this time? No Pun intended. Go blend yourself. Uh, well, I didn't know how to make one healthy back then. You know what I mean? There's a lot of them. It's just like you do all this stuff and there's a bunch of sugar and shit that you're putting in there. Um, now that I've been using like, um, unsweetened almond milk, almond milk, I used to hate it. Now I'm kind of used to it. Uh, I got a good one for you. Uh, one cup of almond milk. I little am miming doing this, putting this shit in.

Speaker 4:          01:02:38       Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:02:38       then it's like a teaspoon of cinnamon, a frozen banana, two tablespoons of almond, peanut butter.

Speaker 4:          01:02:49       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:02:52       A tablespoon of Maca powder. Some ice, a little bit of ice. You blend that fucker together. It's delicious. Tastes like a goddamn chocolate shake and you drink it and you have energy for hours.

Speaker 4:          01:03:06       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:03:08       I gotta be, I gotta be honest with you. If I actually knew enough about nutrition and all I could do, if all I could do was just that

Speaker 4:          01:03:18       mmm.

Speaker 2:          01:03:18       And just do a liquid diet, I would love to do that. I would absolutely love to do that.

Speaker 4:          01:03:25       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:03:27       There's another one I have that's like Kale. It says apple juice. That's the only thing I don't like. It's apple juice and just apple juice has a bunch of sugar in it. So I went to the like, this is fucking hilarious. It's is health food store. But like, they don't like gays. Funniest fucking thing. I was like, how did those things go together? It's usually like, hey man, here's some vitamins. And everybody's like, everybody, man, uh, who the fuck would it? Whoever saw that comment. Um, um, so yeah, I would love to do that. Like, uh, two, she saw some of the shit that I'm fucking eating. They'll look at this fucking, I Miss Boston. Just saw a guy, he had a red sox like knitted cap on with the Tom Brady Jersey in a glove sitting right along the third base line. Fucking hilarious. Um, I would love to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:04:19       Um, I like vegetarian and Vegan meals, but I also still like steak, but I know if I combined like all of that shit, I can still eat a little bit like John Wayne and not have a problem. Um, all right. You disrespected miles Davis. You can't. All right. What is this? Hey Bill, in season two, episode four of F is for family. There is an album cover parroting the miles Davis kind of blue. In the background of one scene in the corner of the cover, there appears to be a label of blue note records in this case, black note records. Uh, these two instances of factuality are factually incorrect. Dude, how much you fucking jazz guys, you know, back in the fucking day, I used to host this show called the jazz oasis on, on, uh, the fuck was it? 88.9 wers at Emerson College. And I used to find, I didn't know fucking anything about jazz and I'd asked You fucking assholes to call in requests and none of you motherfuckers would call in. All you would do is wait for me to play a record and then all you fucking cunts would get on the phone and call me and be like, fuck you play in that four, man. It ain't jazz. The fuck is that dude. Ain't Jay's mother fucker. All you fucking guys can go fuck yourself. Go sit on your fucking horn. All right. First of all,

Speaker 2:          01:05:48       did you enjoy the show? Did you enjoy the episode? Listen to this ass. Those are factually incorrect. Kind of blue was released, released on Columbia records. Nobody likes labels, record labels more than these fucking jazz people and Miles Davis at the time had not recorded for blue note in a number of years you might want to get your facts straight. You believe this shit. If you want to reference the greatest jazz record of all time, it may behoove you to risk respect, possibly the greatest musician of the 20th century by simply getting some simple factual information correct on your show. You're dumb cunt. Tony Williams is probably ashamed of you. Let's be honest. All right, sir. I'm going to walk you back through all your bullshit. Okay? First of all, the reason why it didn't say Bluenote or Columbia records is because we would've had, we would've had to get permission to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:06:51       That's also the reason why the song kind of sounded like kind of blue but wasn't because we don't have the fucking budget to use that music. All right? That's why, that's why it looked like that. Okay, and then secondly, Tony Williams didn't play on that record. You dumb. Fuck I then for the record, I thought it was Philly, Joe Jones. I looked it up. It was like some Guy Jimmy carb or something. I hope I got his fucking name wrong. Does he can blow another gasket? Fuck all you jazz guys. You stupid cunt. You're not, you're not making an animated show. You have no fucking idea how much money music costs. That's why we did that. Okay. We weren't disrespecting miles Davis. Okay, so why don't you take all your words like behoove stick him in your clarinet and shove it up your ass. You pretentious fucking cunt. Ah, did that feel good? He didn't even, you can get the right drummer after giving me shit. He didn't even get the right fucking drummer. Tony Williams was part of the second grade quintet. I do know that, but I don't, I don't know shit about jazz. But I do know that the reason why we did that was because it would, we,

Speaker 1:          01:08:08       okay.

Speaker 2:          01:08:08       Columbia records and balloon up probably wouldn't have given us permission. And if they did, it would have cost us more money than it costs to fucking make the whole, we would've been screwed. That's why sir. Okay. So we didn't disrespect them. We tipped our fucking capital. Um, by the way, do you play any instrument? Are you in a band? All right. Anger issues. This could not come at a better time. Anger issues. Uh, I'm gonna have anger issues if we don't get out of this fucking any. Oh, we did. We finally got out of the gate. Um, dear Billy red top dear bill. Bill red top. Okay. I had anger issues when I was younger. Oh my God. Is this going to be a ray of light? I had a good family but I grew up in a neighborhood that exposed me to shit I shouldn't have seen. Uh, as a defense I started reacting to everything with anger and it carried on into my adult life. Did I write this in a drunken state and I forgot, cause this sounds like me. I've read lots of books and even wrote a few unpublished ones on the topic myself. See you actually worked on it. I commend you for that.

Speaker 8:          01:09:14       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:09:15       I just like try for a few days and then I just go back to

Speaker 2:          01:09:19       what I know anyways. It kept me from being the happiest I could be. It didn't ruin my life, but it's kept me from enjoying things. I had a bad habit of looking at people who are happy and finding reasons not to like them. Oh, I don't do that. I think I did that in my twenties, but I, I'm not like that. Uh, even people I was close to, which may sound strange. Nope, I did that a long time ago. And then I've also had that done to me. Um, I remember when I bought my old truck, 68 f 100 short bed. This guy was like, what'd you get? A truck? Huh? Okay. You going to put stuff back there? Just like annoyed because everybody was looking at my truck going do that thing is so fucking Badass. Nobody has that out here. This thing's the shit, you know. Anyways, I've been catching up on your podcasts over the last year and I've heard you go from being much very angry to still pretty being pretty Angalee but certainly less angry than before. I'm glad you've made strides. Well, not on this podcast because I can tell you the most important thing I gained from reprogramming, my immediate reaction to everything from anger to observance is time.

Speaker 2:          01:10:32       Uh, I'm not smart enough to only read that sentence once I got to do this again. Uh, I can tell you the most important thing I gained from Ray crow reprogramming, my immediate reaction to everything from anger to observance is time. What does that mean? You got time back or something or you, you're enjoying your life more because you don't have to spend so much of it apologizing for what you did an hour ago. Anyways. It's sneaky though. Being angry can waste a whole day and you can do things while still being agitated, but you don't feel like you're completely unaccomplished. Yeah, I don't, I don't stay angry for a whole day. Uh, I just do like in spurts. Then it goes all the way up to the top. Then it come back down away because what the Hell is wrong with you? I've got your right.

Speaker 2:          01:11:19       Sorry. You know, I'm just trying to, that's fucking doing my work. Uh, you still ran your, your errands and did your jobs and fed your kid, is Cetera, but you probably ignoring things you could be doing to advance yourself. Uh, you're likely not appreciating those. Who are we talking about here? Is this me? My goodness. I've stern talking to um, or you just a hypothetical you, but you're probably ignoring things you could be doing to advance yourself. You're likely not appreciating those around you who make your life good because you are focused on people who make your life terrible or projecting things on people that aren't there. Um, I don't do any of that with anybody in my life. I do that with the people that are in power. I do that a lot. You know, like I was all ready to fucking talk about everybody at best buy this is like two podcasts in a row and they've done nothing wrong.

Speaker 2:          01:12:14       It's just been me needing to make a couple adjustments anyways. My biggest regret in all my anger years was snapping at people who are genuinely good people who didn't have that angry gene. It's like being six foot one, two 15 kicking the hell out of a small kid. They can't defend themselves because if they do, they become the mania, Qr, Hor, horrible position to put someone in. Hope you crossed the finish line to zen? Um, yeah. I mean, I think I'm, I'm somewhere in the middle of angry in Zen, believe it or not, as much as I flip out, like I was, I was a lot worse, but, uh, I don't wish bad shit on people and, um, I don't resent anybody. I don't, I just don't want things. Things make me freak up.

Speaker 2:          01:13:08       Anything tech technology related makes me flip up or, you know what's funny is if I get something old, I have all the patients in the world, you know, like if my old truck won't start, I actually, you know, I mean, I'm not going to say I enjoy it, but I, I find that the process of figuring out what's wrong with it, enjoyable and then learning, you know, as the truck gets fixed, what that was, why that happened, how to prevent it in the future. Uh, I, uh, I tell you this, you know what, playing drums really helped me getting back into playing drums and,

Speaker 4:          01:13:45       uh,

Speaker 2:          01:13:47       you know, meet and Nia, having a kid just shit that made me happy,

Speaker 4:          01:13:53       uh,

Speaker 2:          01:13:54       has kinda gotten me to that. But my big thing is if I could just stop snapping, that's kind of what I, I don't walk like, you know what's funny is people actually think I am like an angry guy, like a walk around angry. I don't, I just snap.

Speaker 4:          01:14:06       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:14:08       I'm definitely loud and I'm definitely fucking crazy. But, uh, I dunno, you, I'll let you guys be the, I don't classify myself as an angry guy. Um, I signed, I'm talking about my drinking. Like I don't think I'm an alcoholic. I don't think I'm an angry guy. And I also think that I can admit when I'm wrong, I'll fucking mess. All right. Dilemmas, dilemmas, clarification number one. Uh, Bill, last week you read my dilemma wrong. Oh, sorry. Geez. Everybody coming at me. Uh, you have to either score perfectly on the sats with up to a year of studying or in one sitting when a game of monopoly. Oh, all in one city. That means bankrupting all the other players. Which one to save your life.

Speaker 2:          01:15:01       MMM. Oh, the fucking sats. Absolutely. Those things are, are, are pretty hard, but fucking went in monopoly in one sitting. I mean, that's just, I'd rather like sit down and like this time around really pay attention in math class and find out what, um, what this math is she is applied to as opposed to just being regurgitated at me. Then sitting down and rolling dice like I'm in a fucking casino, you know, I mean, Jesus Christ. Can you imagine, you know, your life's on the line and you're moving a little dog or a shoe around a board. I think I would much rather leave it up to my brain. Sort of a damned if you do, damned if you don't come on. Get underneath that. All right. You ain't got a challenge his arm. Okay. Okay Man on second top of the seventh one out. Okay. Dear Bill, dear, dear bill to thought I have a dilemma for you, would you rather have to fight an alligator in a water tank with a 12 inch blade or fight an alligator in a room with a 30 inch aluminum baseball bat? All right, well we haven't talked about the size of the alligator. I'm assuming it's big enough to kill me obviously. Well I remember a long time ago, I'm a cop told me if you're not going to get a gun to get a bet because you want to have distance between you and the intruder. So considering the intruder is a fucking reptile pass ball, he goes to third.

Speaker 1:          01:16:44       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:16:45       Fuck. Um, I would uh, yeah, I take the the baseball bat and the weird thing about an alligator is you got to come at them straight on. Right? Or from behind.

Speaker 1:          01:17:04       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:17:04       Those fucking things. You don't want to be on the side. They, they, they bite from the side. If you're right in front of him, you're all good. That's why all those, those fucking morons that go up and they stick their, their, their, their arm and the guy's mouth. The guy.

Speaker 2:          01:17:22       No fucking way. Holy Shit. What a fucking play that was, dude. Lay down a bunt. That l to bay guy came in. Who the fuck was that? Zander Bogart too. Through that fucking ball. Who? True that ball. Oh, wasn't who he swung actually. Actually it wasn't a good throw. He got him throw was high. He slid wide. Oh No, they're going to reverse that ladies and gentlemen. Ah, you mother fucker. That's going to be that. He's safe anyways. Yeah, I would, I would 30 inch aluminum bat. Wait. Yeah. Wait a minute. That's not that big. It's only three feet.

Speaker 4:          01:18:13       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:18:16       All right. This is just is so weird. I would attack the top of his head from behind, but I'd start with this feat. All right. You know that would actually fucking kill me to do that to a living thing like that. I'd have to fucking slowly chop it down. I had attacked the fuck things fee, although I did see that one with that fuck on. Rogan showed that with that alligator bit, the other ones leg and just did the death row, rip the fucking things leg off and the other one wasn't going like, so it was just going like, let's, it just fucking down a barely bled. So yeah, I think, I think you just got to a, I mean what I really love to do is just sort of somehow getting on its back, rub its belly. Oh, I know when I would do, I'd take my shirt off and I'd cover its eyes. I've seen those guys do that. And then I would take that fucking bat and I would just, why am right down on his fucking, you know, I, I, you know, that would be it. I would want to kill an alligator. I am terrified of those things, but I don't live in the same world. It does. But if it was me or him, I mean that thing has to go.

Speaker 4:          01:19:34       MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:19:36       I've eaten alligator though. Night alligator. When I was in Florida, it was fucking gross. Just too Goddamn Gamey. People like guy, you know, it tastes like chicken. It doesn't, it doesn't. Chicken is fucking delicious. Steers are delicious. Those are the in pigs are delicious. Those are the three fucking best tasting things. Turkeys are good. They dry out though. You know,

Speaker 3:          01:20:06       that's what I think. Like if you get to the upper level of, you know, if you have a smoker, if you actually know how to smoke Turkey, how to fuck did I do an hour and 20 minutes? I'm all right. That's the podcast. I really appreciate people that tried to help me with my temper because I would like, I mean, I, I need to learn to like how to stop fucking snapping. Um, that's the big thing. You know, I'm not going to lie to you. I do ramp it up a little bit when I'm on the podcast just to entertain you guys. But, uh, that is, that was pretty legit earlier in this show. All right, that's the podcast here. I'll check in on you on, um, on Thursday. Go fuck yourselves at a, I have a wonderful couple of days.
