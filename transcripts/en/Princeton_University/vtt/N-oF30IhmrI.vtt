DEVIN LIVI: The greenhouse
actually started in 1935.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.820
It was located on main campus
between Roberts Stadium

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.660
and Faculty Road.


00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.960
So we've had a greenhouse
for quite some time,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.170
and we've been utilizing it.


00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.260
We've expanded and grown.


00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.390
We have a number of houses
where it started as one,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.570
but in 1935, the original
one was established.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.350 position:97%
 


00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.880
Anything that you see on
main campus in the gardens

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.740
originates here.


00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.290
Most of the smaller
plant material

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.300
will originate
here in some form.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.260
We buy different things--
shrubs, small woody plants.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.170
But primarily, all the annuals
and all of the smaller plants

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.560
that you see
originate from here.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.480 position:97%

JOHN WISNIEWSKI:
Every year, we try

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.510
a few different
varieties of plants, just

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.710
to see what does
well in Princeton.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.580
We used to try to stick
with orange colors

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.910
because they're the Princeton
colors, as more of a highlight.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.920
But some plants
don't come in orange,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.220
so you're forced to use
whatever the plants-- whatever

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.040
you can get that way.


00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.860
But we try a few
things every year.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.360
No one dictates
what we need to use,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.780
so it's a really
great environment

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.250
to be able to try
different things.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.780
We have groups that come from
all over during the summer

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.350
to tour the gardens,
horticulturalists.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.230
And they'll make comments on
how we use the different plants.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.840 position:97%
 


00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.290
DEVIN LIVI: So I think it's a
great environment for people

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.910
who are coming
into the university

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.290
to learn about
plants in general,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.480
plant material itself-- annuals,
perennials, woody plants.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.030
We also have a group
of people, volunteers

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.530
that come down certain
times throughout the year.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.640
And they prune-- they learn
how to prune the right way, how

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.630
to plant the right way.


00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.480
Most of the men and women
know how to do these things.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.520
But it's always a good
refresher because it's not

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.900
something they do every day.


00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.450
So it's a great way
to learn new things,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.670
to find out from
people that they

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.980
don't work with every day, that
work at the grounds department,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.740
and to learn from one another.


00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.210
And so that's what we
do a lot down here.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.030
We try to use native
plants whenever possible.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.450
So that's some
large trees-- we're

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.030
using native trees and
shrubs when possible.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.070
And we've changed
Prospect Garden a bit

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.790
throughout history, where it
was a lot more annual plantings.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.250
Now, there's a lot
more perennials.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.800
There's some woody
plants, so it's

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.760
more sustainable in the
act of that we're not

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.150
having to water as often.


00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.260
We're not having to
maintain as much.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.920
So really, the
history of the garden

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.160
has kind of come along
with the history of campus,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.370
where we're trying to do things
more sustainably than we once

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.920
did.
