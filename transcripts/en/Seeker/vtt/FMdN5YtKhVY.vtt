00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.439
“The sea, once it casts its spell, holds
one in its net of wonder forever.”

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:11.180
That’s a quote from the legendary deep sea
explorer Jacques Cousteau.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.020
And it’s a quote that truly sums up man’s
obsession with the ocean’s depths, an environment

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.480
we still know so little about.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:29.590
The past, present, and future of ocean exploration
kind of comes down to one thing: human bodies

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.380
have no business being underwater.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.679
But that hasn’t stopped inventors and explorers
from finding ways to conquer the ocean frontier.

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:42.609
What we think of as modern ocean exploration
began in 1942 when Jacques Cousteau, alongside

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:47.269
engineer Emile Gagnan, who invented a system
that would supply divers with compressed air

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.260
when they breathed underwater.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.329
They called it the Aqua-Lung, but it later
became know as a “self-contained underwater

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.219
breathing apparatus” or "SCUBA" for short.

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.780
The invention was a giant leap forward for
underwater explorers, especially when compared

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.519
to older technologies.

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.300
From the 1600s to the 1800s, diving equipment
of various iterations was developed and tested.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.740
There were diving bells that provided divers
with a limited supply of air underwater, bathyspheres

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.610
which were rudimentary submersibles, and primitive
diving suits.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.180
However, none of these were really ideal for
exploring, largely because they were incredibly

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.680
dangerous...many people died using all these
devices.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.660
SCUBA diving allowed explorers to go deeper
than ever before...though “deep” is still

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.830
a pretty relative term.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.990
Most scuba divers can reach depths of 130
ft, but when you consider the deepest part

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.700
of the ocean is approximately 36,000 feet,
scuba divers are really only skimming the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.700
surface.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.320
So what’s holding divers back?

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.840
The answer is pressure.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.850
For every 33 feet we descend underwater, the
pressure exerted on our bodies increases by

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.730
14.5 pounds per square inch.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.729
At the very deepest part of the ocean, the
pressure would be equivalent to one person

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.940
bearing the weight of 50 jumbo jets.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.450
But that’s not the only problem divers contend
with.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.060
During deep ocean dives, inert gasses like
nitrogen dissolve in human tissue from the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.339
diver's air tank.

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:17.499
As he or she ascends to the surface, this
nitrogen is released from the tissues as bubbles,

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.499
which can block blood flow around the body.

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:24.019
This condition, known as decompression sickness,
can be deadly.

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.540
Divers can reduce these risks by not diving
too deep, not ascending too quickly, and not

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.640
spending too much time underwater.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.549
However, some divers have to spend a long
time underwater, like those who fix deep sea

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.569
equipment, and aquanauts, who collect scientific
data in underwater laboratories.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.159
To reduce the risk of decompression sickness,
their only option is to stay in an underwater

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.099
hyperbaric chamber for a month so they can
do back to back dives.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.580
This small vestibule can replicate air pressures
at various depths, so users’ bodies are

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.810
primed for long dives.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.370
But there may be a way around that cumbersome
process.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.299
Spurred by the desire for greater control
and freedom underwater, a Canadian company

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.299
invented this.

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.769
It’s an Exosuit.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.279
It’s essentially a one-man submarine with
articulated joints for flexibility and thrusters

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:13.370
to propell the diver through the water.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.529
Most importantly, the suit enables the wearer
to maintain surface pressure for up to 1,000

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:19.529
ft.

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:23.840
That means no hyperbaric chambers and no decompression
sickness.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.139
Scientists are excited to use the Exosuit
to discover new marine species, uncover lost

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:33.749
shipwrecks and more broadly, to bring man
one step closer to finally mastering the ocean

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:54.799
frontier.

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:59.140
Even though we learn more about the ocean
each day there is still an awful lot we don’t

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.140
know.
