00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.340
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Thank you for coming.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.990
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb, Chief of the
African and Middle Eastern Division

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.500
and I'm delighted to welcome you in
our reading room for what promises

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.180
to be a very exciting film.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.270
We're going into children's
books today.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.520
But before we go any further, and
I do this for all our programs,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.750
I say something about our division.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.570
We're a division that's made up
of three sections: the African,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.670
the Near East, and
the Hebraic sections.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.870
We cover -- We're responsible
for the collections

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.840
from 78 different countries
in their vernacular that is

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.790 position:56%
in the languages of those countries.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.160
We collect in all fields
except for clinical medicine

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.680
because there is a national
library of medicine.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.220
We don't collect also in the
technical aspects of agriculture

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.010
because we have a library
of agriculture.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.270
But with few exceptions,
we collect in every field,

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.830
from every direction, every way.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:48.040
And our reading rooms are places
where readers come to be served.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.720 position:56%
They sit and we bring them the books

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.170
that they can use to
do their research.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.100
But this division, like the others
and like the Library of Congress

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.570
in general, is not just a place
where books are put on shelves,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.350
where we just buy them and
hoard them, so to speak.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.780
We want to share them and to
share more than simply the books.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.030
We want to share also the knowledge
of the cultures, the societies,

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.260
and the people who produce those
books, to share their ideas,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.400
to share their culture,
their values, their art,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.060
and their contribution
to world civilization.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.230
And so we invite speakers, we
invite filmmakers, we invite poets,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.160
we invite historians, social
scientists who have done research,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.460
some of whom have used
our collections,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.240
some who have used other
collections, to come and talk

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:01.360
about the books, the research,
the people of these societies.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.200
We do exhibits as well.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.900
And relevant to these exhibits
is the Persian Book Exhibit

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.030
that we had a couple of years ago.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.830
And that was a remarkable
exhibit, the first of its kind.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.360
It was called A Thousand
Years of the Persian Book.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.670
And we had the Persian book
specialist here, Hirad Dinavari,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.090
who contributed in the
selection of the books.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.700
We have Fatemeh Keshavarz from the
University of Maryland who brought

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.480
in her knowledge and
her knowhow to help

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.590
with putting this exhibit together.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.570
We had many parts of the
library that came together

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.990
from the digital part of the
library, to preservation,

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.870
to the exhibit part,
all came together.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.270
Over ten divisions in
this library contributed

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.460
to putting together this
exhibit on the Persian book.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.010
But the exhibit is also part
of the type of thing that we do

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.380
that is sharing with the
world the civilization,

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.750
the culture of the
societies that we represent.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.480
So the exhibit was then
followed by a lecture series,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.600 position:56%
a series with experts who came and
in collaboration with the University

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.210
of Maryland under Fatemeh
Keshavarz's guidance,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:36.420
we brought in a number of speakers
and had, well it went up to what,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.550
14 presentations over
the period of six months

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.370
that talked about the Persian book.

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.870
So we had the exhibit and then
we also had the series of talks.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.810
And it was so successful that we
decided we really should continue

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:01.180
with this series of books and with
the series on Persian civilization,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.220
culture, history, and
the production of books.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.750
And so we did.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.500
So last year we had a
number of speakers who spoke

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.760
about Persian philosophy.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.450
And this year we're also
doing arts, literature, films.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:27.070 position:56%
So the program you're going to be
seeing today is part of that series.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.790
I will not go into it
because we have Fatemeh here

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:38.150 position:56%
who will describe this program, but
it is a continuation of what started

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.560
with the Persian Book
Exhibit and in partnership

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.290
with the University of Maryland.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.590
So I'm really excited.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.020
I haven't seen the film.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:55.870
We have the son of the children's
books writer Mr. Yamini Sharif

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.050
who is here with his family.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.460
I would like to recognize
them all here

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.810
because it's exciting [applause]
to have not only a film,

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.360
the producer of the film, and the
family and the descendents of those

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.910
of that family who has worked
on those children's books.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.820
And now without further ado,

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.450
I'd like to introduce
Professor Fatemeh Keshavarz

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.700
who will be addressing and
talking about the program.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.500
Thank you.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.960
[ Applause ]

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.010
&gt;&gt; Fatemeh Keshavarz: Thank
you so much, Mary-Jane.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.310
It's been a pleasure and
honor really with working

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.530
with friends here at the Library
of Congress, Hirad, Mary-Jane,

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.890
and others who have been giving
us this wonderful opportunity

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:50.870
to bring moments from the
Persian culture and literature

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.980
and art to a much bigger public.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.500
I remember we were taking
numbers down and saw

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.660
that in the first series we had
over 700 people coming to this room

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.320
to listen to those things.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.250
So that's just wonderful.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.570
And we are going on with this
and we're going to have the focus

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:17.880
on film and performance, so we will
have this year many other experts

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.740
to be talking about literature,
Persian literature as it comes

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:28.760
to life either on stage or through
illustrations and visual beauty

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.910
that represents the
art and the culture.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.630
Again, I'm not going to say
a whole lot about the film

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.970
because you're going to see it.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.580
Let me just say we've been
trying to do this for over a year

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.650
and I'm absolutely delighted that
we finally are able to do this.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.340
And let me just tell you
that as I grew up in Iran,

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.000
just seeing even before I
could really read properly,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.440
when I saw the name Yamini Sharif,
I knew that a beautiful poem,

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.180
a beautiful song was coming because
my parents would read it to me.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.940
Later on, of course,
in school, we had it.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.240
We had it all.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:12.340 position:56%
So for me, he was the representation
of a kind of art and beauty

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.200
that was accessible to me,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.980
but at the same time was
really at the highest level.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:23.620
So he had this ability to bring
this complicated and complex art

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:29.320
of poetry writing to
children which is tremendous.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.620
He did a lot more.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.050
The film is going to talk
about establishing a school,

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:38.870
doing his own childhood education,
establishing the first magazine,

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.840
but I'm not going to
duplicate that information.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:47.560
But it's tremendously
happy occasion for us

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.430
to have Mr. Homan Yamini
Sharif and family here with us.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.730
And what a wonderful
thing that he produced,

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.240
even though his own training, I
shouldn't maybe say "even though,"

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.730
his own training is in engineering,
but like many other people coming

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.370
from engineering or
medical backgrounds,

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.070
he has a tremendous
interest in Persian art.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.210
And obviously he grew
up in a household

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.630 position:56%
in which this poetry was celebrated.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:17.480
So what a wonderful thing that he
produced children's songwriter,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.550
this documentary that we are going
to see and we are going to also

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.850
from now on make it available
to our Persian classes,

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.440
to be able to actually
learn about him.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.380
So Mr. Yamini Sharif,
Homan Yamini Sharif,

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:39.320 position:56%
established a children's book, I'm
sorry, the Yamini Sharif Foundation,

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.120
which works with the
Children's Book Council of Iran,

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.180
so it's a very interconnected,
interdisciplinary enterprise

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.320
in which still the interest in
education of the children is

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.320
at the forefront of their ideas.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.310
So without further ado,
I'm going to welcome them.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:10:01.200
And I don't know if you're saying
anything about the film beforehand,

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.030
but I know you're discussing
it afterwards,

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:08.510
but it's really entirely up to you.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:13.940
[ Inaudible Audience Comment ]

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:18.030
Okay, so Mr. Homan Yamini Sharif,
please welcome him to the podium.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.830
Thank you.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.760
[ Applause ]

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.210
&gt;&gt; Homan Yamini Sharif: Thank you
very much for coming here today

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.610
to watch this documentary together.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.960
I'd like to thank the people that
made this possible, this event,

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.580
which is really an honor for us to
be here in the Library of Congress.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.430
Dr. Keshavarz from Roshan
Institute, University of Maryland,

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.080
and Dr. [inaudible] who
from last year followed up

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.830
and supported us in
making this possible.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:53.090
I'd like to thank the Library
of Congress, Mrs. Mary-Jane

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:59.080
and Mr. Hirad Dinavari
that very warmly supported

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.950
and received the suggestion
so that we can have this.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.350
I will very briefly talk a
little bit about how we came

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.650
out to make this documentary.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:11.750
The documentary itself goes
through the history and how this,

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:16.010 position:56%
my father was interested and how the
children literature was developed

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:21.390
in Iran, which my father played
a very major role in that.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.790
But to make it short, I, as a
child, was very fond of my father.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.740 position:56%
So I used to listen to him a lot and
he would tell me about his childhood

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.530
and his interests and very
difficult childhood that he had

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.220
and you'll see in the film.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:40.330
And I learned a lot about his life
and his education and how he came

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.060
to become interested in children's
literature and got involved

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.850
in writing and magazines and so on.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:55.850
At the same time I was also a
subject of what he was doing.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.050
I was audience as well
because I was right

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.540
at the age that he was writing for.

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:04.740
So when the Kayhan Bacheha,
which everybody knows here,

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:09.610
when it came out, started, my
father started with another

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:13.610
of his colleagues, I
started reading that.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:18.550
I read the first textbook
that was written by my father

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.490
as a national textbook
for the first graders.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:26.170
So I read that and so
on until I read it --

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:30.360
So I became very familiar
with the poetry in his works

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:35.830
and how he developed and all
the chronology of it as well.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:40.770
Then as I grew up and I went
to high school and I realized

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:45.710
that his fame is just growing
in Iran and everybody knew him,

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:51.350 position:56%
which was kind of natural to me, but
then after I came to United States

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.910
as a student, went
back, worked there,

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.150
and I saw that this has
become a more than normal.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:01.530
He had -- Because of generation
that read the textbooks and went

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:05.930
to school that he established
with my mother and all the books

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:10.050
and different things and magazines,
so and that became very interesting

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:15.350
for me because that there
was somebody that started

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:21.080
from even not zero, negative,
as you will see in this film,

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:24.940
with no support, not only no
support but all the hurdles

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.670
that you can think of
in front of somebody,

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.280
going back about 80
years ago in Iran

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.000
when children were really not
even counted as human beings.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.350 position:56%
They were just in a transition
period, a waiting period to grow up.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.360
That's all it was, to grow up

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.730
and just take some burden off
the shoulders of the parents.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:49.530
So it was very interesting that
that person, without any support,

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:54.160
could come and become somebody who
could really play this major role

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.920
in the children's literature
and became very famous.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.490
So that by itself was
very interesting.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.400
And Iran is a difficult
environment for the people

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.490
that they don't have any support.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:08.140 position:56%
So you have somebody that can come
up with this very interesting story,

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.630
that's why I thought I would
like to make that documentary

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.780
and then we thought about it.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.790
The environment in Iran
at that time was not --

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.140
But recently, because
documentaries are very popular,

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:21.070
it became easier to make it.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:26.390
So and at the same time,
Children's Book Council

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:30.810
of Iran a few years ago
had a tribute to my father

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.460
and that also was very interesting.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.690
From that tribute came
a major article

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:42.570
in Iranian newspaper [inaudible]
and the person who wrote

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:46.600
that article was the person who
later on became the director

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.640
of the film, Mr. Hooman Zarif.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.180
And he actually called me a few
years after we had that tribute

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.510
and now I'm thinking for years
to make this documentary.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.810
He called me and said, "I want

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:00.740
to make a documentary
about your father."

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.040
And I said.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.340
"That's pretty good."

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.640
And he wanted me to support.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.380
I said, "Well, you have full
support but what do you know

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.040
about documentary,
you're a journalist?"

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:13.550
He said he just made a documentary
about another person who was known

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:21.310
to Iran, Hossein Gol-e-Golab,
and who was a lyric and composer

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.170
and he has made that
famous national anthem

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.660
of Iran, the people, [inaudible].

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.570
So I went to Iran.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.490
We looked at it and he
said that was possible.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.200
The time was good to make it

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.010
and it was pretty much
the last window we had

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:39.060
because all the characters
that you see in this film,

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.130
the major characters in
the Book Council of Iran,

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.440
Children's Book Council,
they were at the age

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:51.040
that they probably
could not do it anymore.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.150
You will see [inaudible],
Parviz Kalantari,

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:59.650
which is a famous illustrator,
book illustrator in Iran.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:05.430
He is now in coma and still lives
for over a year, except a couple

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:09.210
of other characters,
they just passed away.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.180
My mother is not in
state to participate.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.580
So that's all.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:17.650
It was very opportune time and
we managed to make this film

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.510
and well we hope you enjoy it as
much as I did in producing it.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.310
Thanks so much.

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:27.890
[ Applause ]

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:31.980
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: A quick book
essentially notes for the end.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.130
We have little surveys
on your chairs.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.830
Feel free to fill them
out after the film.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:37.360
We would love to hear your opinion

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.650
and know what you think
about the movie.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.110
I'm about to start the film.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:45.570
After the movie, we will have a few
minutes for questions from Homan,

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:48.530
which I'm very grateful for him and
his family for coming all the way

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.490
from California for this.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.150
And at that point we
look forward answering

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.710
to any questions you
may have for him.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.010
Let's start the film.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.310
Thank you.

01:28:15.070 --> 01:28:18.000
I would like to everyone
for staying.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.800
I know it's a little --

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:23.860
[ Applause ]

01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:25.160
Thank you.

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:27.540
I realize it's a little over an
hour but the film was worth it.

01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:31.950
I am so grateful to Mr. Homan
Yamini Sharif for being here

01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:35.230
and their lovely family for coming
all the way from California.

01:28:35.230 --> 01:28:39.590
Our film crew has another
event to film at 2 o'clock.

01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:41.670
So we really don't
have that much time.

01:28:41.670 --> 01:28:46.070
But I would like to give a few
minutes for questions for Homan,

01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:49.660
if you would come up here,
and take a few questions.

01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:52.270
We really need to wrap it up
within three to four minutes.

01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:53.570
Thank you.

01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:55.970
Any questions, feel
free to get up and ask.

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.500
&gt;&gt; This question [inaudible].

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:10.540
It would seem to me that
the foundation has been laid

01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:17.930
for international children's
literature.

01:29:17.930 --> 01:29:19.230
I'm overwhelmed.

01:29:19.230 --> 01:29:36.120 position:56%
I'm so very, very moved by what I've
seen and learned, and yet I can feel

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:38.190
that it's this universal
[inaudible],

01:29:38.190 --> 01:29:40.480 position:56%
it's all of the children everywhere.

01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:41.780
&gt;&gt; Homan Yamini Sharif: Exactly.

01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:44.530
Well, I think there are two
probably periods in our life

01:29:44.530 --> 01:29:48.410 position:56%
that this [inaudible] really becomes
meaningful as a child and then

01:29:48.410 --> 01:29:51.900
at the end of life, that
wholeness comes back to us.

01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:55.860
So it is pretty much the same
concept and same stories here

01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:59.890
as probably has been in one way
or another has been repeated

01:29:59.890 --> 01:30:04.060 position:56%
in other nations and they came of
people from different period of time

01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:06.060
when children were not
really paid attention to

01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:11.780
and they started writing and
bringing a new world to children.

01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:13.080
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari:
Any other questions?

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:14.380
No? All right.

01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:21.000
&gt;&gt; Can you just tell us how long
it took to put the film together?

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.890
&gt;&gt; Homan Yamini Sharif:
Well, it took about two years

01:30:22.890 --> 01:30:27.880 position:56%
and the reason it took this long was
it had to be done during the trips

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:34.210 position:56%
to Iran and getting all these people
together and finding time for them,

01:30:34.210 --> 01:30:36.990
the different conditions they
were enduring took some time.

01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:45.080 position:56%
Also, it was difficult to edit and
I had to be present for the edition,

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:46.380
because for the chronology

01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:51.120
and all different relative
subjects had to be taken care of.

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:55.440 position:56%
We also we wanted to do more filming
but the conditions in Iran were

01:30:55.440 --> 01:31:00.090
in such a way that if you wanted to
film, you know, in public places,

01:31:00.090 --> 01:31:03.830
you had to go through certain
getting permission and all that

01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:08.740
and we did not really have the
time to do it and so we had to come

01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:11.390
with different creativity
to do this.

01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:12.790
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:14.090
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

01:31:14.090 --> 01:31:15.390
&gt;&gt; Just a brief one.

01:31:15.390 --> 01:31:16.850
When you are filming,
you are talking,

01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:21.260
you're in a beautiful
environment outside with the trees

01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:25.120
and then it rains, where
was it [inaudible]?

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:28.110
&gt;&gt; Homan Yamini Sharif:
It was a house that was --

01:31:28.110 --> 01:31:33.830 position:56%
Ironically, it was very interesting,
the [inaudible] in Iran,

01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:36.910
the television, radio
and television,

01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:40.930
approached us when they heard that
we are filming this and they wanted

01:31:40.930 --> 01:31:43.590 position:56%
to get the license to make the film.

01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:46.660
But because they would make it the
way they wanted, I said, "Well,

01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:51.220
let me make it and then if you like
it, then we'll, you can use that."

01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:55.660
But they helped us and
said, "How can we help you?"

01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:59.090
It was very interesting
to have that cooperation.

01:31:59.090 --> 01:32:02.590
And one of the things they did
is they have different contracts

01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:03.890
with different places.

01:32:03.890 --> 01:32:05.190
When they want to film,
they can go there.

01:32:05.190 --> 01:32:06.490
They said, "What do you need?"

01:32:06.490 --> 01:32:09.170
I said, "We'd like to be in
an environment which looks

01:32:09.170 --> 01:32:11.080
like my father's childhood."

01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:12.380
So they arranged this.

01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:16.590
This is a village north of
Tehran, in [inaudible] area.

01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:22.630
So we went there and
we did the film.

01:32:22.630 --> 01:32:25.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So my question is for the footage
for the film, all the photographs

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:28.450
and items, did you get
most of it from inside Iran

01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:34.620
or did you look elsewhere as well
and how much archives are there

01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:37.570
from people you interviewed
that they gave you

01:32:37.570 --> 01:32:40.470
or sharing their [inaudible]
with you?

01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:43.250
&gt;&gt; Homan Yamini Sharif: The
archives, all the documents

01:32:43.250 --> 01:32:46.050
and other film, pictures
and reviews and all

01:32:46.050 --> 01:32:48.190
that came from our own archives.

01:32:48.190 --> 01:32:52.510
My father had a very good archive
while he was alive collecting

01:32:52.510 --> 01:32:56.780
different books and magazine,
literature and his own books

01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:59.280 position:56%
and we preserved that and we kept it

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:01.060
and we collected as
much as we could.

01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:04.660
So we have archives in the
Foundation and we used this.

01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:05.960
&gt;&gt; That's wonderful.

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:09.720
&gt;&gt; And who is illustrator?

01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:12.450 position:56%
Did you father paint or your sister?

01:33:12.450 --> 01:33:14.010
&gt;&gt; Homan Yamini Sharif:
The illustrator that talked

01:33:14.010 --> 01:33:16.190
in the film was Parviz Kalantari.

01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:20.610
Parviz Kalantari is a well known
illustrator for children's books

01:33:20.610 --> 01:33:24.550
and he was also a close
friend of my father

01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:27.050
and illustrated several
books for him.

01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:30.250
He has won several
international awards for his work.

01:33:30.250 --> 01:33:35.010
And as I mentioned, it's one of the
unfortunate things that happened

01:33:35.010 --> 01:33:38.240
that he had a illness
that took him to coma

01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:41.460
and he's still in coma in Iran.

01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:43.160
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: Okay,
thank you very much, everyone.

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:44.460
Thanks --

01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:45.760
&gt;&gt; Homan Yamini Sharif: Thank
you very much for coming.

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.560
Thank you.
