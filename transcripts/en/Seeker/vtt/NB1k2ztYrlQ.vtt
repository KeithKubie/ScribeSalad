00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:11.050
Taste is an important sense, so why is it
that some animals have such a screwed up palate?

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.700
Hey there friends, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.949
Bacon is one of the great foods of the carnivorous
world, but whales can't taste it.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.249
Pie is another fantastic food and dolphins
can't taste it...

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:23.249
Oranges?

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:24.249
Nope.

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:25.249
ICE CREAM CAKE?!

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:26.249
NO!?!

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:27.249
I weep for their childhoods.

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.859
Firstly, pretty much every vertebrate has
the ABILITY -- genetically speaking -- to

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.360
taste things, and molecularly, they should
taste in the same way we taste.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.020
But not all organisms need to taste every
type of food, and thus they lose some tastes

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.200
as they evolved.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.230
Many invertebrates like insects and even microorganisms
have evolved cells which have a sense like

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.720
taste, for the same reasons as us, because
they want to make sure the food their ingesting

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.720
is good for them!

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.780
Smell and taste are the oldest senses because
they facilitate the testing of food and determine

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.000
if it's safe to eat.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Herbivores have the most taste buds, so they
don't eat toxic plants.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.110
Carnivores have the least, because unless
they're eating poison frogs, they don't really

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.540
need a lot of flavor in their uncooked meat
diet.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.740
Omnivores eat both, so we get a lot of taste
buds too.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.860
Whales however, USED to be able to taste things,
but not anymore says a new study in Genome

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.860
Biology and Evolution.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.850
So, what had happened was, 53 million years
ago, whales and dolphins split into two groups

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.280
-- cetaceans with teeth and those without.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.640
Turns out, if you just swallow food and don't
chew, you probably won't need taste buds.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.620
Therefore slowly over generations they lost
the molecular receptors to detect sweet, bitter,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.620
umami, and sour.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.490
Today, they only taste salty flavors!

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.030
The researchers tested the genomes of 15 species
of whale and dolphin and the taste genes were

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.200
present, but were heavily mutated.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.150
As the mutations increased the genes of these
species slowly become less and less expressed,

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.150
until they end up with pseudogenes.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.490
It's sort of like somewhere a gene USED to
be... they can still see in the genome, but

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.860
it doesn't develop in the fully grown organism.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.440
Remember, taste isn't purely about enjoyment,
it's also a way for us to determine nutritional

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.420
content in food and sense poisons or rot.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.360
So now that humans are in the mix, this lack
of flavor can be damaging to these ocean-bound

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.360
creatures.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.010
Without being able to sense flavors, whales
have unknowingly wandered into contaminated

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.010
waters.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.790
The researchers think the whales and dolphins
kept salty flavors due to a need to maintain

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.540
an intake of salt to maintain blood pressure
and sodium levels.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.069
But large swimming mammals aren't the only
ones to lose some taste.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.480
Lions, asian otters, hyenas, some seals, housecats
and other primarily carnivorous mammals lost

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.310
the sense of taste millions of years ago,
also due to genetic mutation.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.150
Because these animals are mainly carnivorous,
they don't care how many sweets and carbs

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.709
they ingest, and over time lost the ability
to taste them!

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.940
Fish have lots of taste buds, some are even
on the outside of their skin.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.430
REptiles pick up air molecules with their
tongue and runs it across the Jacobson's Organ

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.920
on the roof of their mouth to pick up tastes
and smells.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.860
Some birds, like parrots and cockatiels have
a ton of taste receptors with the cockatiel

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.590
being able to sense salt, sugar and acid -- but
in general birds only have a few... like chickens,

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.930
they've only got 30 buds.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:12.930
Poor chickens.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.930
Poor delicious chickens.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.930
What do you think?

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.220
Do you eat for the flavor?

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.220
The texture?

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.310
Are you one of those people who just eat for
fuel?
