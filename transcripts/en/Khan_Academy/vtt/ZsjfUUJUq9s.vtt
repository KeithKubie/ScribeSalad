00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.260
So, in this problem, they're telling us in
outer space, the distance

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.160
an object travels varies directly with the
amount of time that it travels.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.340
And, that's of course assuming that it's
not accelerating, and

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.010
there's no net force, and all of that on
it.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.030
So, I guess they're talking about a
specific object.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.560
So, some specific object, the amount, the
distance that it travels is directly,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.810
it varies directly, it varies directly
with the amount of time that it travels.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.178
So, if we think of in, in, in terms of

00:00:26.178 --> 00:00:30.991
constants of proportionality, and direct
variation, we could say that the

00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:34.249
distance, we could say that the distance
is equal to

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:38.670
some constant, times the time, times the
time that it travels.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.228
The distance varies directly with the
amount

00:00:42.228 --> 00:00:45.500
of time that travels for this particular
object.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.960
If an asteroid travels 3000 miles, in, if
the asteroid travels

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.060
3000 miles in 6 hours, what is the
constant of variation?

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.646
So the distance is 3000, so we have d is
equal to 3000 miles.

00:01:01.646 --> 00:01:05.730
We have 3,000 miles is the distance, and
that's

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.540
going to be equal to the constant of
variation.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.900
The constant of variation times the time,
times 6 hours.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.500
So, if we wanna solve for the constant of

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.720
variation, we can just divide both sides
by 6 hours.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.978
6 hours, and we divide the right-hand side
by 6 hours.

00:01:23.978 --> 00:01:31.070
And, so, 3,000 divided by 6 is 500, and 6
divided by 6 is 1.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.050
The hours also cancel out if you care
about the units.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.270
And, so, the concept of proportionality,
the left-hand side is just

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.440
500, 500, and then we have miles per hour,
miles per hour.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.760
Fired 500 miles per hour, and that is
equal to k.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.830
So, the constant proportionality is 500
miles per hour, or you

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.890
could say 500 if you're not too worried
about the units.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.650
Or, we should say, the constant of
variation, to

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.110
use the terminology that they actually use
in the question.
