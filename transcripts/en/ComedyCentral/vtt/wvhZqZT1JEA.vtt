00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.600
- [Moshe] So tell me,
what are the Pink Pistols?

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:07.674
- Pink Pistols is a national
LGBT self-defense organization,

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.143
we are heavily focused on
training the LGBT community

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.245
in armed and unarmed
self-defense.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:14.147
- Why did you first
purchase a gun?

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:18.318
- For a lot of people, Orlando
made individuals question,

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:23.523
do I need a firearm
for self-defense?

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:24.691
- People wouldn't have died

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.192
if someone was
there and had a gun.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:29.562
- There's no guarantee, but it
would have changed the odds.

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.798
- When seconds count,
the police are often

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.500
minutes or hours away.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.236
A 100 pound female has a chance

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:39.105
against four linebackers,
if she's carrying.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.941
- Seems like an oddly
specific situation,

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.010
four linebackers,
one 100 pound girl,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.945
and then she'll pick up a,

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.180
I don't know how guns work,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.348
so I guess it's
something like this?

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:49.315
- (laughing)
Something like that.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.150
- Kkrah-kkrah-kkrah-kkrah!

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.718
And then, the equalizer.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.586
Would you consider
yourselves politically

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.121
liberal, conservative,
or neither?

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:58.258
- My views are probably
some of the ones that

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:01.795
line up with the gays
from the 60s and 70s,

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.264
where it's like, hey man, look,
Mom and Dad kicked you out,

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:07.400
no one wants you, you're gonna
have to move to the city kid,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.935
and you're on your own, but--

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:11.137
- This is the opening scene
from Rent, is that right?

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:12.639
- Yes it is, that's right.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:14.174
- How does it go?

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:18.411
- [All] ♪ 525,600 minutes

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.980
- ♪ The cops will take
to get to your door

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.048
(laughing)

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:24.551
♪ That's why I own a gun

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:27.153
What do liberals not
understand about gun ownership?

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:30.857
- If someone is living
in an area that is safe,

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:33.059
or they perceive to be
relatively crime-free,

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:35.261
that's a very elitist attitude,

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:39.032
to define how someone
chooses to defend themselves.

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:41.835
- To be a gun owner is
not supporting violence.

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.236
It is an identity.

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.638
- So Second Amendment
in gun control issues

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:48.541
is really an issue
of identity politics.

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:49.776
- Strangely, yes.

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.811
- Was it harder to come
out as a gun owner,

00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.813
or as a queer person?

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:58.351
- I feel more accepted as a
gay guy in the gun community,

00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:01.554
than a gun owner in
the gay community.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:02.789
- Why don't we try it?

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.924
You come out to
me as gun owners.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:06.493
- All right, so,
something really important

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:07.427
I gotta tell you.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:09.696
- Cool, man, I'm your bro, dude!

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:11.131
- So I need you to understand,

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.298
I own 15 guns.

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:18.505
- Whatja say what, bro?

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:19.839
- I own 15 guns.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.176
(retching)

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:29.415
Get out of my house!

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:31.818
- I wish that wasn't as
accurate as it often is.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.186
(laughing)

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:35.121
- Okay, we've been
through some good times

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:37.490
and some bad times,
and some weird times,

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.327
- (laughing) Yeah, Amsterdam!

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.899
- There is a part of me

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.269
that I have been hiding
from you, and I--

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.173
- Chris, there is one
thing that you could say

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.674
that would make me
stop loving you,

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:58.344
and there's no way, there's
no way it's true of you.

00:02:58.344 --> 00:02:59.879
- I am a gun owner.
- Don't say you're a

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.448
gun owner, oh,
that was the thing!

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:03.583
- (bleep)

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:06.286
- It was the one thing!

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:07.387
All right Piper.

00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:08.555
- So Moshe, there's something

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:09.822
that I've been
wanting to tell you.

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.057
I'm a gun owner.

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:14.694
- (gasps) Oohh, Piper,
hell no, hell to the no,

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:18.431
to the no, Piper, to
the no, no no no no no,

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:20.300
no no no no no no
(laughter)

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.035
no no no no!

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:24.871
♪ 565,600 minutes

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:28.141
Hoo, Piper, hoo Piper, Piper!

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:33.780
I love you no matter what.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.215
- Thank you.
