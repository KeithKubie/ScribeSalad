00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.230
In general it's easy to use power divided by root rather than to expand the

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.130
factors of a variable. But not all powers are evenly divisible by a root. We

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.638
know 3 doesn't divide evenly into 14. We could rewrite x to the 14th as x to

00:00:14.638 --> 00:00:19.581
the 12th times x squared. We use our product tool to split this up into two

00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:24.200
separate cube roots. And since we know that cube root of x to the 12 is equal

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.858
to x to the 4th, this would be our final answer. An easier way to get to this

00:00:28.858 --> 00:00:33.564
more quickly is to use power divided by root and to look at the remainder. We

00:00:33.564 --> 00:00:38.686
know this radical can be written as x to the 14 divided by 3. So when I divide

00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:44.412
the power by the root, I get 14 divide 3, which equals 4 remainder 2. Notice

00:00:44.412 --> 00:00:48.700
that the 4 appears as the exponent of our factor outside of the radical,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.486
whereas the remainder 2, is the power inside of the radical. So, using this

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:58.610
ideal of the remainder, I want you to see if you can simplify this radical. Use

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.760
the idea of power divided by root to figure out what would be on the outside of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.552
the radical and what would stay on the inside. When you think you have it put

00:01:06.552 --> 00:01:08.730
your answer here.
