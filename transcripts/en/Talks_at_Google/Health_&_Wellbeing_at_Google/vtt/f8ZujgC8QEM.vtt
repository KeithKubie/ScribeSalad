SPEAKER 1: Today
we're excited to have

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.620
John Mackey, the founder
and CEO of Whole Foods

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.476
for the second time on
The Talks at Google Stage.

00:00:13.476 --> 00:00:15.100
Last time John was
here, he was talking

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.470
about his book, "Conscious
Capitalism," which

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.550
is about how businesses can
be profitable but also serve

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.260
a higher purpose.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.862
I think that's something we can
all relate to here at Google.

00:00:25.862 --> 00:00:28.320
Today, however, John is here
to talk about his latest book,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.300
"The Whole Foods Diet,"
but it's about how

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.290
a plant-based lifestyle can help
us live longer and live well.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.684
So can we have a big round
of applause for John Mackey.

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:41.486
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:46.750
JOHN MACKEY: I'm
excited about this book.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.090
I'm very proud of it.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.000
This kind of sums up my 39 years
of healthy living experiments

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.580
and kind of what I've learned.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.615
I wrote it with--

00:00:57.615 --> 00:01:00.360
how many of you saw the
film "Forks Over Knives?"

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.190
Anybody see those films?

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.129
And the two doctors that
were the two young doctors

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.520
in the film, Alona Pulde
and Matt Ledderman,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.870
they work for Whole Foods.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.420
And so they are my
co-authors in the book,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.030
because I'm a
grocer, not a doctor.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.910
So good when somebody asks me
those tough medical questions

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.010
to say, I'm not a
doctor, but this

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.320
is what Matt and Alona say.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.300
So this presentation I'm about
to make, I've got to tell you,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.250
I'm looking at a
very young audience.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.010
You're all bulletproof still.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.385
But it's kind of
depressing, the statistics

00:01:36.385 --> 00:01:37.420
I'm going to put forth.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.260
Also, I'm looking at a
very young but also looks

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.880
like a very healthy and
health-conscious audience.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.360
So some of this will--

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.940
well, the numbers are
true, even if they don't

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.560
apply to you or your friends.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.360
So we are an incredibly
unhealthy nation.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.740
And most people don't realize
how unhealthy America is.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.870
But by most world
health indicators,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.660
we do not score very highly.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.880
And you can see here that what's
the leading causes of death

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.589
in the United States,
heart disease is still

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:16.380
the leading killer.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.330
Cancer has just about caught it.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.646
But if you add stroke into
the cardiovascular category,

00:02:22.646 --> 00:02:24.270
along with heart
disease, heart disease

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.800
is still very far ahead.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.780
Interestingly
enough, medical care

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.410
itself is the third leading
cause of death in our country.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.760
And then the diseases that would
kill us about 100 years ago

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.350
in the early 1900s were
the infectious diseases.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.810
And those have largely
been wiped out.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.790
They're not the same kind
of killers they were.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.310
If you went back
100 years ago, they

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.676
were dying from tuberculosis,
and they were dying from--

00:02:53.676 --> 00:02:55.050
they didn't have
any antibiotics.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.900
So they'd get infections, and
they did get blood poisoning

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.170
and die off.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.500
So our problem now is that
the things that are killing us

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.340
are life-style diseases--
dietary lifestyle diseases

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.630
primarily.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.450
And medical care being the
third leading cause of death

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.180
is not something that
doctors want to tell people.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.500
But adverse drug
effects, far more people

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.960
die from prescription
drugs in America

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.300
than die from illegal drugs
by many factors every year.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.770
And primarily because
of the interactions

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.740
of these different drugs
that people are taking,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.960
combined with the type
of infections people

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.730
get when they go into hospitals.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.170
So those two together
are the lion share.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.410
And plus just stupid
mistakes that hospitals make.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.082
That's the third leading cause
of death for medical care.

00:03:42.082 --> 00:03:43.290
Here are the grim statistics.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.947
We're now up to
71% of all adults

00:03:45.947 --> 00:03:47.280
in this country are overweight--

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.860
71%.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.210
And 38% of adults are now obese.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.420
The thing is, the trend lines
are still not leveled off.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.150
They are continuing
to steadily climb.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.750
And obesity is now
estimated to cost our nation

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.990
about $190 billion a year.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.880
So it's gone from 15% obesity
in the US back in 1971

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.960
to now it's about 38%, the
statistic I gave before.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.070
So it's more than doubled
in the last 40 years.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.950
And it's not just a problem
in the United States,

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.330
it's a problem across the world.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.110
Again, this does not look like
it did before I turned it over

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.745
here.

00:04:29.745 --> 00:04:32.610
But you can see
the blue represents

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.740
where these countries were
in obesity back in 1980.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.644
And you can see what's
happened since 2008.

00:04:40.644 --> 00:04:42.060
And this is
primarily, we've begun

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.700
to export our dietary
patterns of eating

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.290
that we do in the United
States across the world.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.716
And the result is a
crisis in obesity.

00:04:50.716 --> 00:04:52.590
And the United States
is the fattest country,

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.730
but you will see that the
UK, Mexico, and South Africa

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.007
are close behind.

00:04:58.007 --> 00:05:00.090
And the trend lines show
that Mexico will probably

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.506
pass up the United
States sometime

00:05:01.506 --> 00:05:03.900
in the next decade or so
for the fattest country

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.010
in the world, a dubious honor.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.690
This is probably
the most disturbing

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.700
is what's happened to children.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.930
17% of the children alive today
between the ages of 2 and 19

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.880
are now already obese--

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.810
not just overweight,
they're obese.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.950
And 70% of children
under 12 years of age

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.230
already show signs of
heart disease at age 12.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:33.360
And already 19% are showing
dietary related chronic disease

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.560
conditions.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.295
How has it happened?

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.420
Oh, I know what's happened.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.130
We've eaten more.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.130
We have more calories.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.530
And this is the truth
that's not spoken.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.310
We eat, per capita,
25% more calories

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.600
than we did 40 years ago.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.960
So we're eating more
calorie-dense foods.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.360
And that's why we're fatter.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.340
It's not rocket science.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.160
We are simply eating the
wrong kinds of foods,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.860
and we're eating a
lot more calories.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.130
So if you look at the
different food groups

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.730
where we've increased,
so sugar is usually

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.757
held out as a scapegoat,
and I am certainly

00:06:12.757 --> 00:06:13.840
not going to defend sugar.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.040
Sugar is not a healthy food.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.123
But it's usually held out.

00:06:17.123 --> 00:06:20.420
You have books, the Gary Taubes
and all the low-carb people

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.920
are making sugar into
the villain nutrient.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.980
And sugar did increase per
capita in the last 40 years.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:33.170
It went up about 10% from
where it was 40 years ago

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.250
on a per capita basis.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.390
So sugar has increased.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.470
But by far, by far,
the biggest increases

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.830
have been in three
major categories.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.680
The first one, oils--

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.960
vegetable oils.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.120
We're now eating
about 67% more oil

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.460
that we ate 40 years ago
on a per capita basis.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:59.220
And I blame the
Mediterranean diet

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.300
for that, because people became
convinced that olive oil was

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.650
a health food.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.870
And if you look at the
history of the Mediterranean

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.210
diet in the
Mediterranean countries,

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.680
what they were doing when
they did the research,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.085
they discovered that, yes,
the Mediterranean people down

00:07:14.085 --> 00:07:19.500
in Crete and Sardinia and some
of the Mediterranean countries

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.539
that had these great
health outcomes,

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:23.330
they studied their
diet, and they found out

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.340
they're eating a lot more
fruits and vegetables.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.230
They were eating less meat.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.790
They were eating more beans.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:29.870
They were eating lots.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.060
They had their own gardens.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.600
They were eating lots
more whole grains.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.160
And they ate a little more fish.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.900
They didn't eat so much meat.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.440
And they used olive
oil instead of butter,

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.240
and they drank red wine.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.120
But what was the takeaway
that Americans got

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.728
about the Mediterranean diet?

00:07:46.728 --> 00:07:47.664
AUDIENCE: Olive oil.

00:07:47.664 --> 00:07:48.600
AUDIENCE: Red wine.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.750
JOHN MACKEY: Exactly.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.740
Olive oil and red wine.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.030
And arguably, the
people were healthy,

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.580
not because of those two foods,
but in spite of them, meaning

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.130
it was the fresh fruits and
vegetables and whole grains

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.500
and beans and
fewer animal foods.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.570
Not to mention, people
in Crete were walking

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.890
like nine miles every day.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.540
And so we drew the wrong
conclusions from it.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.890
So oil was a huge cause
of the weight gain.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:23.480
Also refined flours, the
number of donuts and bagels

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.420
and croissants and just
kind of white bread

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.680
that has been consumed has gone
way up in the last 40 years.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:37.870
And the final thing is dairy
fats, particularly cheese.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.340
In 1915, the per capita
consumption of cheese

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.730
was three pounds a
person a year in the US.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:49.830
Today, 100 years later, it's
34 and 1/2 pounds of cheese.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.570
Well, that's 1,000%-- more
than 1,000% increase--

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.940
10x.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.700
And I don't eat
any cheese at all.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.050
So somebody is probably eating
about 69 pounds of cheese

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.270
to make up the difference.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.840
And you probably
know who you are.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.380
So here's the thing.

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.230
Let's put this in a
big great context.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.450
Let's put it in
evolutionary context.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.750
Being fat was not a
problem that human beings

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.760
have had for most of our
evolutionary history.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.360
Quite the opposite.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.870
We were just trying to get
enough calories to stay alive.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.240
It was about survival.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.700
When we were
gatherers and hunters,

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.580
there wasn't very much
calorie-dense food available.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.010
People were foraging for
fruits and vegetables,

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.950
and maybe they can get
some starchy tubers.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.080
This was before
we had agriculture

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.230
that through hybridization
and selective breeding

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.360
we could increase the
sweetness of food,

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.860
increase the
carbohydrates that might

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.740
be in a root vegetable
like a sweet potato

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.940
or a squash or a potato.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.290
And so we just were
putting massive quantities

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.530
of food, very high
fiber content,

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:08.820
just to get enough calories.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.450
And when they could pull down
a wild animal, wild game--

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.780
then they'd get a rich source
of concentrated protein

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.140
and calories, although
nothing like the kind of meat

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.540
that people eat today,
where you have corn-fed beef

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.200
and we've basically fattened
up our livestock animals.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:32.970
So what this translates into
is our evolutionary program,

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:37.830
our evolutionary predisposition
to crave calorie-dense foods.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.600
We like things that have
a lot of calories in them.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.940
We like sugar.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.350
We like fat.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.480
We like white rice.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.900
We like ice cream,
particularly like things

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.691
that combine sugar and fat,
like a nice dark chocolate candy

00:10:52.691 --> 00:10:53.190
bar.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.689
Yum.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:56.970
We like oil.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.460
Oil is the most calorie-dense
food you can eat.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.430
One tablespoon of
oil has 120 calories.

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.300
So now that we've
become more affluent,

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.590
we can get calorie-dense
foods, not on a feast day,

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:11.430
not on a rare event.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.360
We can have it three
times a day or more.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.890
And so we do.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.890
And as the rest of the
world becomes more affluent,

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.520
that same craving for calorie
density stays in play.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.579
And so that's why the
whole world is getting fat,

00:11:25.579 --> 00:11:27.120
because we can eat
more animal foods.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.203
We can eat more ice cream.

00:11:28.203 --> 00:11:29.520
We can eat more oil.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.710
We can eat more
sugar, and we are.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.290
And we're basically
killing ourselves

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.140
with our craving for
calorie-dense foods.

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.842
And so that translates
into the thing

00:11:39.842 --> 00:11:41.550
most people aren't
really conscious of is

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.840
food addictions.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.570
Food addictions are a
really serious problem.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:50.850
And most people are addicts,
but they don't know it

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.950
until they try to quit.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:55.780
And then when you try
to change your diet,

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.640
you find that it's
quite difficult.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.280
You can change it for
a while, but then you

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.470
tend to drift back
to the old pattern

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.590
because it's deeply set.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:11.710
Type 2 diabetes is
almost towards pandemic,

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.880
because we're now
about 12% of people

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:21.580
are identified as diabetic, but
we have 35% of the population,

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.350
an estimated 86
million people are

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:27.700
already pre-diabetic and on
their way to being diabetic.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.380
So we're talking about--

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.140
gosh, I mean, almost half
of the adult population

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.610
is either diabetic
or pre-diabetic.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:38.931
And the complications of
diabetes down the road

00:12:38.931 --> 00:12:39.930
are absolutely horrible.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.190
Look at what happens to people.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.310
They can go blind.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.250
They have to
amputate their feet.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.170
They get hearing loss.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:48.920
They can get osteoporosis.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.170
They get Alzheimer's.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.190
It's a horrible disease.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:58.046
Type 2 diabetes is totally
a lifestyle disease.

00:12:58.046 --> 00:13:00.670
I'm going to talk about how you
can reverse that disease fairly

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.660
quickly by dietary changes.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.504
Heart disease.

00:13:04.504 --> 00:13:05.920
A million and a
half people a year

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.120
die from a heart
attack or stroke.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.000
And more than 2,200
will die each day,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.360
which is about how many
people we lost on 9/11.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.827
And that is also
a dietary disease.

00:13:15.827 --> 00:13:17.410
Heart disease is a
disease no one ever

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.850
should get unless you have
some kind of genetic defect.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.170
It's completely something
we do to ourselves

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.440
through what we eat.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.960
Cancer scares the
shit out of everybody.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.260
And there's nobody in this room
that hasn't either had cancer

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.680
or had somebody that they
know and love get cancer.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.220
And more people are going to
die from cancer in the next 27

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.130
months than everybody
that we've ever

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:46.130
had lost in a war since the
founding of the republic.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.480
And yeah, I'm going to argue
that cancer is primarily

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.652
also a dietary and
lifestyle disease.

00:13:52.652 --> 00:13:54.610
Here you can see, if you
look at the major risk

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:59.840
factors for cancer, there's
two overwhelming risk factors--

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.220
what you eat and whether
you smoke or not.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.960
The other ones-- pollution,
alcohol, radiation,

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.230
and medications.

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.150
They are risk factors.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.970
They are contributors, but
they're relatively small,

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:14.620
somewhere between 65%
and 90% of all cancers

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.160
go back to these
two primary causes--

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.530
tobacco use and diet.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:24.100
So this pie chart represents
what Americans currently eat.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:29.890
And the processed
foods on this pie chart

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:33.400
is equal to 54% of all
the calories we consume.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.730
54% of what Americans
eat is junk food,

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:41.526
highly processed foods,
sugar, oil, refined grains.

00:14:41.526 --> 00:14:45.870
We eat 32% of our calories
from animal foods.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.820
So that's now 86%.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:53.200
Vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans,
and whole grains, only 14%

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.992
of our diets are
from those foods.

00:14:54.992 --> 00:14:56.950
And I would argue, and
we do argue in our book,

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.400
that at least 90%
of your calories

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.380
should come from
whole plant foods.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:10.020
And the solution is
the Whole Foods Diet.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.330
There, you're going to
have your animal foods.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.100
We're not arguing
for 100% vegan diet,

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.670
but we're arguing for at
least 90% plant-based.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.740
And 90+%.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.380
But we're arguing for
100% real foods diet.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.420
If you really want to
transform your health,

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.670
you have to stop
eating all the crap.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:33.400
And I'm sorry, but
that's the facts.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.490
And if you do these
two things together,

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.280
because we say there's only
two rules in the diet--

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:42.540
eat only whole foods,
eat 90+% plant foods.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.650
Those are the two
rules in the diet.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.850
It's simple to understand
but hard to do.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.150
So what aren't whole foods?

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.120
All refined grains and flours,
all concentrated sugars

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.850
of all types, all artificial
flavors, sweeteners,

00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:59.215
colorings, and preservatives.

00:15:59.215 --> 00:16:04.090
All food oils and concentrated
fats like butter and lard.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.120
And almost all the
processed foods

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.925
that you find in the
center of a supermarket.

00:16:09.925 --> 00:16:12.930
Here are some of our
recognizable foods--

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.600
cokes and cakes and donuts
and chocolate chip cookies

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.760
and oil and white flour and
white bread and white pasta.

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.190
We are sugar junkies.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.780
We absolutely are.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.300
The typical American
consumes 23 teaspoons of

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.070
added sugar every single day.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:33.810
That's a three-pound bag
of sugar every 12 days.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:38.080
One 12-ounce soft drink is
equal to 10 teaspoons of sugar.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.570
Here you can see the annual
soft drink consumption.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:48.040
The good news is, is
it peaked around--

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.200
this didn't work out good
either on the slide--

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:56.917
but it peaked around about
2005 or something like that,

00:16:56.917 --> 00:16:58.750
we had a peak of our
soft drink consumption.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:02.260
It's slowly gone down a little
bit, but not because people

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.599
like drinking more water.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.130
It's been substituted
with things

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:10.990
like Red Bull and
Monster and energy drinks

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.634
and sort of new-age
beverages that also

00:17:13.634 --> 00:17:14.800
have a lot of sugar in them.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.720
Also here's a good boomer
joke for the millennials.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:26.224
When I was a kid,
they'd only had Cokes,

00:17:26.224 --> 00:17:28.140
and they were in these
little 6-ounce bottles,

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.850
which you might see
in a museum someplace.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.300
And my parents knew
what they were.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.210
They were just bottles of sugar.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:40.020
And so they wouldn't let
us have those things.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.640
For a kid, it was
like, oh, my god.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.330
It's so good.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:43.982
Please, mama, can I have a Coke?

00:17:43.982 --> 00:17:45.940
So there would be these
little 6-ounce bottles,

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.910
and my parents
would dole them out

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:53.526
if I was a good boy, which meant
I didn't get that many Cokes.

00:17:53.526 --> 00:17:56.290
But today, people
they walk around--

00:17:56.290 --> 00:18:00.960
I see them-- they walk around
with these 2-liter bottles

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.720
of either Diet Coke
or regular Coke.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.080
And I've met people that
say I just drink Coke.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.430
You don't drink any water?

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:09.510
No, I just drink Coke.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.688
It tastes a lot better.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.750
I already talked to
you about oil, but--

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.972
yeah, pass on this one.

00:18:20.972 --> 00:18:21.930
I already made my case.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:25.550
Let's talk about the low-carb,
high-animal-food diets,

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.071
and I'm going to make
a case against it.

00:18:28.071 --> 00:18:29.445
So what most people
don't realize

00:18:29.445 --> 00:18:32.790
is that the starch foods
have been the major calorie

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.760
source for humanity
since we went out

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.540
of the paleolithic age.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.680
We're starch eaters.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.530
We've evolved to
digest starches.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:43.080
We have enzymes
in our mouth that

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.330
are different than all the
other primates, because we

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.370
can break down starches
more effectively

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.200
than any other species.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.950
And you can see that
rice and rye and barley

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.970
and oats and wheat
and millet and sorghum

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:59.400
and sweet potatoes, legumes,
regular potatoes, and corn,

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.210
there's been no--

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:04.050
I challenge you to name
any major civilization

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:05.910
in the history of
this planet that

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:09.300
didn't base the predominant
amount of its calories

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.500
on starches.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.970
There are none.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:16.020
You might find some weird tribe
like the Massai or the Inuits

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.290
up in Greenland, but
that's not a civilization.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:24.570
Those are people faced in
a marginal life extreme

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:28.200
position that are making do with
what they find themselves at.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.450
But they don't have long life.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.290
And so it's kind of
a bogus argument,

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.360
but I hear it all the time.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.570
Starches have been the
major calorie source.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.830
We're evolved to eat
them, digest them,

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.180
and they're a major fuel source.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.000
Meat consumption
has increased 70%

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.490
since 1940 but what's
interesting, of course,

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.150
it was kind of flat.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.220
And then we had the
Depression, and it went down,

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:59.740
and then it started to rocket
up around the beginning of World

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:00.430
War II.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:04.060
And it just kept rocketing up
until we got to about the year

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.440
2000.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.500
And now you can see it's
actually declined almost 15%

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.710
to 20% from its peak.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:15.730
And that's despite the
paleo and low-carb movement.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:18.820
But still, by any
measurement, we're

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.120
eating 32% of our calories
from animal foods.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:27.490
And the per capita consumption
of it, the increase

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.476
is pretty phenomenal.

00:20:30.476 --> 00:20:33.920
Here's worldwide,
and it's exploding.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.105
What's very interesting, this
is based on tonnage, so actually

00:20:37.105 --> 00:20:38.810
pork--

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.356
anybody have an idea why
pork is the number one animal

00:20:42.356 --> 00:20:43.480
food consumed in the world?

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.572
AUDIENCE: China.

00:20:44.572 --> 00:20:45.280
SPEAKER 1: Bingo.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.240
China.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:46.740
Bacon.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.900
I can see that people
are thinking bacon.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.020
I like bacon.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:50.620
No.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.160
China.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.460
China, they eat so
much pork there.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.540
But poultry, of course,
is rapidly gaining.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.220
Poultry is the orange line,
and it's just shooting up.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.200
And it's no doubt going
to pass up pork sometime

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.840
in the next 10 or 15 years.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.840
Wild fish is there
now as number three.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.340
And it's leveled off, but if
you add farmed fish in, so

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.235
the wild fish, you get it
right up there at the very top.

00:21:15.235 --> 00:21:19.270
If you add all fish together,
farmed fish and wild fish,

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:20.770
but farmed fish you
can see has come

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:22.750
from nowhere to rapidly growing.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:26.142
And wild fish, because seafood
is not sustainable any longer

00:21:26.142 --> 00:21:27.170
in the oceans.

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.110
We're fishing out the oceans.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:31.270
And it's one of
the great tragedies

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.160
that people are not
very conscious about is

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.230
how we're emptying
the oceans out,

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.570
because we're so
good at fishing now.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.080
We have such amazing
technology that the fish,

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.320
they've got no chance.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.060
We hunt them down,
and we load them up.

00:21:46.199 --> 00:21:47.115
Oh, here's that chart.

00:21:47.115 --> 00:21:47.760
It came out.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.740
You can see, here it is.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.151
You can see the per capita
increase over the last 100

00:21:53.151 --> 00:21:53.650
years.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.257
So if we look at
the studies, I'm

00:21:58.257 --> 00:21:59.590
going to make a bold claim here.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.560
I'm going to say all major
studies show an increase

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.740
in all cause disease and death
from low-carbohydrate diets.

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.400
No studies, none, of
high-carbohydrate diet

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.120
shows the similar facts.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.620
So here's a study that--

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.580
17 studies.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:18.270
This is sort of a meta analysis
of several different studies--

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:19.590
observational studies.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.830
Over 700,000 people, and
low-carbohydrate diets

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.380
are associated with a
31% increase in deaths

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.606
from all causes.

00:22:27.606 --> 00:22:29.230
Here's a famous one,
the Harvard School

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.650
of Public Health
published in 2012.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:36.360
They followed 120,000 people
between 22 and 28 years.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.120
And there was a 13%
increase of dying for each 2

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.220
to 3-ounce serving per day
of unprocessed red meat.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.560
So 2 to 3 ounces
is not very much.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.410
So if you're eating like
a big steak every day,

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:53.070
your 13% increase is going to
get magnified to well over 50%

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.750
increase of risk for dying.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:23:00.630
And the processed red meats,
the World Health Organization

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:06.730
has classified processed red
meats as a class I carcinogen,

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.214
along with asbestos and tobacco.

00:23:09.214 --> 00:23:11.130
And, of course, this has
been heavily attacked

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:13.080
by the meat industry,
but they don't

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:17.176
have any power over the
World Health Organization.

00:23:17.176 --> 00:23:18.300
So it's pretty interesting.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.450
So particularly, if you're
consuming animal foods,

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.940
I recommend staying away
from the processed ones.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.190
By the way, bacon is one
of those processed ones.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.860
Here's one, colon cancer.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.830
Now, over 1,000 studies confirm
that red meat and processed

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.640
red meat increases the
risk of colon cancer.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.710
And plant-based diets consisting
of whole grains, fruits,

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:44.130
vegetables, and beans decreases
the risk of colon cancer.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.400
As a result, the
World Cancer Research

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.320
and the American Institute
for Cancer Research

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.770
recommend eating primarily
a plant-based diet.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.630
This study shows
that when people

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:04.120
are eating high amounts
of animal protein,

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.060
you can see their risk for
cancer mortality goes up

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:10.040
proportionately to how much
animal foods they're eating.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.900
So a little bit,
not too much risk.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:15.870
But as you eat more, the
risk begins to escalate.

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:17.875
Here's one about breast cancer.

00:24:17.875 --> 00:24:21.010
So women as they get
older begin to worry more

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:23.750
about breast cancer and men
worry about prostate cancer.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.416
This is pretty
interesting, because this

00:24:25.416 --> 00:24:28.690
was 87 countries
participated in this research

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:32.230
by the International Agency
for Research on Cancer.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:36.070
And they tracked animal
product consumption,

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:39.160
and it correlated very closely
with 12 types of cancer

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.440
but with a lag of
15 to 25 years.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.990
So cancer is not something
that shows up immediately.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.770
It takes a while for it
to grow in our bodies.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:51.430
And usually, in fact, you can't
even detect cancer in the body

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:55.030
until it's been
growing about 10 years.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.670
And when they say
somebody is cancer free,

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.170
it doesn't mean
they're cancer free.

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:02.470
It simply means the
instruments cannot detect it,

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.130
but it doesn't mean
it's not there.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.000
It just means we can't see it.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.005
And here you can see the
lag period on breast cancer.

00:25:10.005 --> 00:25:12.640
The more calories from animal
foods that were consumed,

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.400
the greater the incidence
of breast cancer,

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.100
with a lag period
of about 20 years.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.616
How many people here have
heard of the Blue Zones?

00:25:25.616 --> 00:25:26.870
A few of you.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:28.040
It's in our book.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:30.050
I think it's chapter
4 in the book.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.810
And the Blue Zones is
the work of a guy named

00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:37.570
Dan Buettner, who got very
interested about where

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:41.720
are the longest-lived
peoples on the planet?

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.240
And particularly ones
we have to document

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:49.410
with birth certificates that
we could actually measure.

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:52.130
So he did the research,
and he found five places

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:55.710
on the planet that have
extraordinarily long lives.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:59.480
And those five places
are Okinawa, Japan;

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:05.750
Sardinia, Italy; Ikaria,
Greece; Nicoya, Costa Rica;

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:10.160
and of, all places,
Loma Linda, California.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.050
Seventh Day Adventists
are concentrated

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:15.390
in Loma Linda, California,
which I'll get to in a minute.

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:19.760
So what's very interesting
is that if you look at what

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.940
these people eat, they
all without exception

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.690
eat a variation of
the Whole Foods Diet,

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:28.460
except for a small subset of the
Seventh Day Adventists in Loma

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.470
Linda, none of them are vegans.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:35.330
But they all eat real
foods, real whole foods,

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:40.487
about 90% plant
based, no exceptions.

00:26:40.487 --> 00:26:42.570
Here's the Okinawans are
particularly interesting.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:47.240
The Okinawa elder diet,
so 70% of their calories

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:52.940
came from sweet potatoes,
12% from rice, and 7%

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.420
from grains they were
eating, and then 6% from soy.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.540
So they were eating
approximately 85%

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.390
of their calories were coming
from complex carbohydrates

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:03.410
or starches.

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:04.340
Astounding.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:06.570
Almost 85%.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:08.130
And you can see
they weren't vegan.

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.390
They got some pork,
about 1% from pork.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:14.740
1% from eggs, 1% from
dairy, and 1% for fish.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:18.920
So they were a 96%
vegan diet and almost no

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.120
processed foods whatsoever.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.370
And very little oil, only
2% of the calories from oil.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.895
The Seventh Day Adventists,
again, the Seventh Day

00:27:28.895 --> 00:27:34.210
Adventists are a religious group
that is very focused on health.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:36.870
Their interpretation
of the Bible

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:40.560
is that God wants us
to eat extremely mostly

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.977
plant-based diets and wants
us to be very healthy.

00:27:43.977 --> 00:27:46.560
So what's so interesting about
that, these people don't smoke,

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.870
they don't drink.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:51.690
Their parts, they have people
of faith, they have religion,

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.620
they have community.

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:57.060
And so they're perfect
to do a study on diet,

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.680
because that's where they vary.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.150
So they had the--

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:01.890
you can see from
body mass index,

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.664
the vegans had the
lowest body mass index,

00:28:03.664 --> 00:28:05.580
followed by the vegetarians,
and the omnivores

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.990
were much higher-- the
omnivores at 28.8%.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.930
30.0 gets you to obesity levels.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:15.380
Anything above 24 is overweight.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:20.160
So only the vegans were actually
kind of at an ideal weight.

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.440
But the vegan Adventist who
ate nuts and seeds, exercised

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.810
and not smoked, they are the
longest-lived cohort we've ever

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.370
discovered in modern times.

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:33.420
And the men, on average,
lived 14 years longer

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.190
than the average
Caucasian American,

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:36.940
and the females lived
10 years longer.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.190
And look at those risk rates--

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:41.010
60% lower risk of
cancer, 76% lower risk

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:44.940
of heart disease,
and even women 98%

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:47.700
lower rates of heart disease
in the Adventist communities

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.750
that were the vegans.

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.000
Some phenomenal statistics.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.620
And I think one of my friends,
the Dr. Garth Davis said,

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:59.040
if everyone ate like an
Adventist, everyone would

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.440
have the same health outcomes.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.250
So Dean Ornish.

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:10.500
Dean Ornish proved the
cure for heart disease,

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.440
because he did a
study, and it was

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.900
eating a vegetarian diet,
very low in fat, very high

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.140
in starches--

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.240
70% to 75% from starches.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.580
And the outcomes
were extraordinary.

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.450
He was able to
reverse heart disease.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.130
So here's a guy who
reversed heart disease,

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:32.450
who cured heart disease
and nobody cares.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:35.450
The whole heart industry
is all about cracking

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:40.620
people's chest open and going in
and doing angioplasty or doing

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:43.440
stents, doing some kind
of heroic technological

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.410
intervention, when
they never needed

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:49.720
to have that kind of surgery,
that through diet, they

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.910
completely reversed
their heart disease.

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.340
And yet nobody cares.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.904
Nobody seems to know about it.

00:29:55.904 --> 00:29:58.320
That's been followed up by the
incredible work of Caldwell

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.490
Esselstyn, who did his own
work where he had people--

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:05.910
it was a much smaller cohort
than Ornish worked with,

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:08.490
but here's a diet,
a very pure diet--

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:09.660
100% plant-based.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:12.240
No oils, no sugars, no
refined carbohydrates, and it

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.940
was a starch-based
diet, very low in fat.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.380
And the statistics
are phenomenal.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.440
These are people that
already had advanced

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.280
cardiovascular disease.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.720
So 89% of his patients actually
adhered to the diet and 11% who

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.670
didn't.

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:30.810
Those who adhered to it,
only 0.6%, one person,

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:33.909
experienced a coronary
event in the three years

00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:34.700
that followed this.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.290
These were people that mostly
had already had heart attacks.

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:40.500
And 11% of the patients
were non-adherent.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:44.490
62% of them have some type of
coronary event in those three

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:45.990
years.

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:48.930
Phenomenal success.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:51.090
Nutrient density.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.760
Nutrient density.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.700
Our society is obsessed
with the macronutrients.

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.862
How much protein
should people eat?

00:30:58.862 --> 00:31:00.570
How many carbohydrates
should people eat?

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:01.920
And how much fat
should they eat?

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.503
Which is good?

00:31:02.503 --> 00:31:05.990
Carbs are bad, proteins good.

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:09.270
Fat we used to think was bad,
and now people think it's good.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:12.720
And that's what most of these
dietary debates are around.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.690
And they're kind
of stupid debates,

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:19.470
because if you're eating
whole foods, mostly plants,

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.270
you're going to get the
right mix of macronutrients.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.290
What's usually left
out of the discussion

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:26.670
are the micronutrients,
and these are obviously

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.880
the most important nutrients
from the longevity and health

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.200
standpoint.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.440
And so that's the
vitamins and minerals

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.860
and the phytochemicals,
the phytonutrients.

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:42.030
There's estimated that there's
over 10,000 phytonutrients

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:46.380
that we've now discovered
that have healthful effects

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.790
on our bodies.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:50.110
And the foods that are the
most nutrient-dense foods--

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.970
I hope this one came out.

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:55.517
Based on a nutrient
density per calorie--

00:31:55.517 --> 00:31:56.850
I don't know, can you read that?

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.070
Probably can't, but
at the very bottom,

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.860
the least nutrient-dense
foods you can eat

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.240
are oil and refined
sugars, followed

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.760
by refined grains
and then cheese

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.970
and then full-fat dairy,
then red meat, then eggs.

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:10.770
We'll move up to all
the different meat

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.350
products, with fish having
the most micronutrient density

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:14.700
per calorie.

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.520
And then the most nutrient-dense
foods you can eat,

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.780
not surprisingly, are
vegetables, particularly--

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:23.570
particularly-- leafy greens.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:27.990
Those are the superfoods,
things like kale and watercress

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:33.020
and collards, mustard
greens, these type of foods,

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:33.690
and spinach.

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:36.660
These are like super
nutritionally dense foods

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:37.640
on a per-calorie basis.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.480
And all the vegetables
and the fruits,

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.930
the beans, the whole
grains, nuts and seeds.

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:50.870
So what Dr. Joel Fuhrman
argues is that in his system,

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:54.640
the key to health is to maximize
your micronutrient density

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.320
per calorie consumed.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.130
Health is equal
to macronutrients

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:01.600
divided by calories.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.310
So he's arguing
that we should be

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:07.210
eating an intensely
micronutrient-dense diet, which

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:11.050
means lots of fruits
and vegetables.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:14.350
Let's talk a bit
about low-carb diets.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:19.570
I call the low-carb diets
the zombies of the food,

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:22.090
because they never die.

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.160
You kill them, and
then another generation

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.250
comes along and embraces it.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.320
So these have all
been best sellers.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.370
The Atkins program,
the South Beach diet,

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.720
which is the best-selling diet
book of all time, The Zone.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.240
Mark Hyman now is
popularizing the stuff.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.030
The paleo and the Primal diets.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.620
You can lose weight
on these diets

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:48.400
if you are also being conscious
of your portion control.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:53.560
And there's one great saving
grace of the low-carb diets.

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.410
You stop eating the
highly processed grains.

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:57.922
You stop eating the sugar.

00:33:57.922 --> 00:33:59.380
And by the way, if
you just cut out

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.290
sugar and highly
processed grains,

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:04.070
I guarantee you you're
going to feel better.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:06.640
The problem is that we
haven't evolved that way.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.650
We've evolved as plant eaters.

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:09.969
If you look at our nearest--

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:12.670
not only did we evolve that
was in our paleolithic times,

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:16.030
but if we go back even
evolutionary further back

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:20.889
to our closest primate
cousins, the gorillas, who

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:23.889
are 100% plant-based, we
share about 98% of the DNA.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:28.300
And the chimps and the
bonobos, we're closer to 99%.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.400
The gorilla is a
100% plant based,

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.909
and the bonobos and the chimps
are about 95% plant based.

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:35.830
And they're eating
high quantities

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:38.745
of nutrient-dense
foliage, lots of greens.

00:34:38.745 --> 00:34:39.620
That's what they eat.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:45.520
They eat tons of greens, tons
of fruits and tons of veggies.

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.739
So plant eaters, if
you're going to be a plant

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:50.100
eater, necessarily going
to be a high-carb eater,

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.000
because carbohydrates,
that's where they are.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.560
Carbs are in the plants.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.510
They're not in the animal foods.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.390
So when we talk about a low-carb
diet, let's translate that.

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:01.780
Low-carb diet means a low-plant
diet and a high-animal foods

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:02.920
diet.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.830
And eating high
quantities of animal foods

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:07.870
correlates very closely--

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:11.320
it's been shown in study after
study after study after study--

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.675
that it correlates very closely
with heart disease, stroke,

00:35:14.675 --> 00:35:15.175
and cancer.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:19.990
And all the low-carb
diets could inherently

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:26.300
be very high in calories and
very low in nutrient density.

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.050
So it's good to minimize
all the simple sugars,

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:31.060
but then they throw
out the healthy carbs,

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.470
the healthy starches.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:38.290
And starch foods such as yams,
whole grains, winter squashes,

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:41.050
they are super-healthy
foods for us.

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:44.470
All historical civilizations,
as I've already argued,

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:48.450
base their diet primarily
on eating starch foods.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.090
Paleo.

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:52.660
Paleo is the hottest trend
at Whole Foods Market.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.420
I will tell you this right now.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.940
You put paleo on something,
you can triple its sales.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.690
Everybody's out there.

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:02.380
Avoid carbs, eat protein.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.874
At the paleo diet.

00:36:03.874 --> 00:36:05.540
And there are some
good things about it.

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:08.081
It's similar to what we talked
about with the low-carb diets,

00:36:08.081 --> 00:36:11.080
which paleo is a type
of low-carb diet.

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.740
No processed carbs,
sugar, and white flour.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.720
Also, if you're truly a
paleo adherent, you're not

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.690
going to eat dairy products,
because the ideology believes

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:22.000
that, well, when we were
in the paleolithic times,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.430
nobody was drinking the
milk from another mammal.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:27.340
That came later
with agriculture.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:30.800
And eating lots of fresh
fruits and vegetables.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.106
Typical good paleo
diet is going to have

00:36:33.106 --> 00:36:34.480
a plate full of
veggies, and it's

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.730
going to have some
lean grass-fed beef

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:40.786
or some pasture-raised lamb or
chicken or something like that.

00:36:40.786 --> 00:36:42.160
However, the bad
part is, they've

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.540
cut out all the healthy carbs.

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.040
They've cut out the beans.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.120
They've cut out
the whole grains.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.800
A lot of times they cut out
the healthy starch foods,

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.660
starchy vegetables
like sweet potatoes.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:55.300
And that results in too much
animal foods and protein

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.270
and the ugly part of that
is, as I've already stated,

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:01.120
and I showed you some
studies, the long-term risk

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.230
for heart disease and
cancer are very high,

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:07.660
with a lag period of 20 to
30 years before the symptoms

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.090
really manifest.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:13.450
We'll talk a little bit about
what Whole Foods is doing.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:15.400
So our company
doesn't really believe

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.850
the government, the
medical establishment,

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.290
our universities,
or the food industry

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:23.150
are going to work toward
solving this problem.

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:25.690
The vested interest
of the food--

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:29.224
the consumer-packaged companies
that are selling all the junk

00:37:29.224 --> 00:37:30.640
packaged foods,
they're very high.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.920
They make massive
quantities of money.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:37.660
The dairy industry, the meat
industry, the egg industry,

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.600
these guys fund their
own kind of junk studies

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.220
that confuse everybody
by putting out data

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.440
so people think-- they read
about the contradictory

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.390
information, and
it's like, gosh.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:49.350
You know, it's all so confusing.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.600
I don't understand it.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.360
In fact, a survey
I read recently

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.270
showed that for the
average American,

00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:01.760
they'd rather do their
own taxes than figure

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.130
out how to try to eat
healthier, because taxes

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:05.450
are simpler to figure out.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.570
So what we decided
at Whole Foods

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:13.370
is that part of our mission
has got to be to help people,

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:15.590
to make people more conscious
about healthy eating.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.510
That's the real reason
I wrote the book.

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:19.980
And I'll talk more about
that in just a second.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.650
So we're very
focused as a company

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:24.620
in raising the consciousness of
our team members at Whole Foods

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:25.450
to eat healthier.

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:27.660
We've got about 90,000
people working for us,

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.340
and this is a big part
of what Whole Foods is

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:32.390
about at this point.

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:34.390
So one thing we do, if
you work for our company,

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:37.490
automatically get a 20%
discount for everything we sell.

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:39.650
However, we have
four different levels

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.960
that you can get to based
on how healthy you are.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:47.290
So you get a 22%, 25%,
27%, up to platinum at 30%.

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:50.510
And to make it simple
and not too expensive,

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:53.280
we just have four
criteria that we measure.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:57.850
If you smoke, you can't
get an extra discount.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:00.470
And then you blood pressure,
your total cholesterol

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:03.600
or your LDL, whichever
is the better of the two,

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.590
and then your body mass index
or, if you're a bodybuilder,

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:09.560
you can also use the
waist-to-height ratio.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.080
And then you see
how people score,

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.460
and then that determines
what your discount is.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.540
So we had 11,000 team members,
almost 12,000 participate

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:25.780
in '16, about 8,000 qualify
for higher-level discount card.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.220
And that saves our company.
it's a win-win-win strategy,

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.170
because not only
are team members

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:32.720
healthier as a result
of this incentive,

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.830
but they save us a lot.

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:35.657
We're self-insured.

00:39:35.657 --> 00:39:37.490
And probably Google is
self-insured as well.

00:39:42.381 --> 00:39:44.670
The company doesn't pay
anything for my health care.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:45.960
I never get sick.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:51.207
So if all of our team members
ate as healthy as I did,

00:39:51.207 --> 00:39:53.040
our health care-- we
spend over $200 million

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.289
a year in health care for
our team members-- arguably,

00:39:55.289 --> 00:39:58.410
if everybody are
really healthily, well,

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:00.640
it would plunge like 90%.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.640
So it's very much in the
company's best interest

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.560
to have our team members
be healthy as possible.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.351
Now, obviously, it's
in their best interest

00:40:06.351 --> 00:40:08.300
to be as healthy as possible.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.080
So what we do is--

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.540
I've heard criticism of
our discount program,

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:16.740
because it says like you're
favoring the healthy people

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.980
and you're punishing the
people who need it the most,

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:24.464
kind of that Marxist argument
of need should triumph.

00:40:24.464 --> 00:40:27.130
So we have an another program we
call the Total Health Immersion

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:27.750
Program.

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:30.690
This one is the one that
inspired me to write the book,

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:34.940
because we have now sent over
4,000 of our team members--

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.350
this says 3,400, but
it's not updated.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:40.530
We've now sent over 4,000 team
members through this program

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:43.050
since we launched it in 2009.

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:44.400
It's a one-week program.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.100
Costs about $4,000 a team
member to send somebody

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.910
through the program,
medically supervised.

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:52.069
For one week, we completely
control their food.

00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:53.985
We do intensive education
about healthy eating

00:40:53.985 --> 00:40:55.200
and healthy lifestyle.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.660
We put them on an
exercise program.

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:00.240
We take all their biometrics
when they walk in,

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.040
get their blood.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:06.450
We meet with a medical doctor,
and a week later, we do it

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:07.880
all over on their way out.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.750
And even in one week, people
can make astounding progress.

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:13.410
It's amazing.

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:15.680
These are the average
results where cholesterol

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:20.310
drops 24 points, triglycerides
24, BMI drops, blood pressure

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:23.850
drops, and people lose
weight in just a week.

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:25.545
Through this
program, our company

00:41:25.545 --> 00:41:28.710
has reversed type 2 diabetes
for hundreds of people.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:31.870
We have reversed heart
disease for many, many people.

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:35.520
And I've seen hundreds of people
lose over 100 pounds of weight

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.100
in less than a year or
a little over a year.

00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:42.086
Here's a typical guy.

00:41:42.086 --> 00:41:46.710
This is a store team leader
in the Sacramento area.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:48.180
He was type 2 diabetic.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.190
He reversed it very quickly.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:51.430
He lost over 90 pounds.

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:55.424
His blood pressure dropped from
156 over 96 to 115 over 75.

00:41:55.424 --> 00:41:57.090
And he was diabetic,
and his blood sugar

00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:59.465
is between 70 and 80, which
is an excellent score, better

00:41:59.465 --> 00:42:01.950
than mine.

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:03.027
Here's another guy.

00:42:03.027 --> 00:42:04.360
This guy lives in the Bay Area--

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.060
no, he lives in Colorado.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:10.830
And this guy, he's now lost
over 100 pounds in the last 12

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:11.580
months.

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.380
He's now dropped
all his medications.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:16.290
He actually wrote a book called
"The Change," because he was so

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:17.284
pumped up about this.

00:42:17.284 --> 00:42:18.700
And I think he's
left the company.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:22.230
I think he's now like a
permanent kind of a "Biggest

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:23.820
Loser" promoter.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.520
So let me conclude, and
then I'll take questions.

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:33.017
So our country is
overweight and unhealthy.

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:35.100
And here's the thing--
it's completely reversible.

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:39.360
We can reverse it through
diet and lifestyle.

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.090
We should-- each of
has the potential

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:43.442
to probably live to be 100.

00:42:43.442 --> 00:42:45.150
Now, I know Google is
going to figure out

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.280
some technological
innovations that

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.000
will help us to live past 100.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.250
The joke I say is that by
the time I get to be 100,

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:55.860
they're going to figure out
how to keep me alive forever

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:59.100
at the age of 100.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.710
But truthfully, the degenerative
diseases that are killing

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:05.660
everybody-- heart disease,
cancer, and diabetes--

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:08.310
are primarily dietary
and lifestyle diseases.

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:09.990
80% of what we
spend on health care

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:14.280
goes to treat these diseases
that we shouldn't even get.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.160
So my final message
is that each of us

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:20.820
is being called to embark on a
hero's journey here in health.

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.652
First, you have to wake up,
you have to become conscious,

00:43:23.652 --> 00:43:25.110
you have to change
the way you eat,

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:27.150
and you have to
change your lifestyle.

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:29.815
And then you're in a position
to go help other people.

00:43:29.815 --> 00:43:31.440
I actually wrote this
book because I've

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.420
seen my own health transformed.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.940
I've seen hundreds and
perhaps to this point

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.450
thousands of people in my own
company transform their health.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.700
And I felt an
ethical compunction

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.190
to try to share what I've
learned, hence why I'm with you

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:45.130
today.

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:47.190
And thank you very much.

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:49.148
I'll take a few questions.

00:43:49.148 --> 00:43:52.142
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:54.234 --> 00:43:55.900
AUDIENCE: Here at
Google, we're actually

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:57.970
very fortunate to
be able to take

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:00.910
advantage of pretty much any
dietary choice that we want to.

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:04.450
We're very fortunate to be given
great food and nutritious food

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:05.470
every day.

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:09.190
But for the average American,
the diet that you've described

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:11.860
would actually be
very cost prohibitive.

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.882
And so how can we address that?

00:44:13.882 --> 00:44:15.340
JOHN MACKEY: Because
it's not true.

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:18.097
That is a myth that's put
out there consistently.

00:44:18.097 --> 00:44:20.680
But if you're eating the kind
of diet we describe in The Whole

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.319
Foods Diet, which is primarily
a starch-based diet--

00:44:23.319 --> 00:44:25.360
so you're going to be
eating a lot of brown rice.

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.850
You're going to be eating beans.

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:28.760
You're going to
be eating quinoa.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:31.750
You're going to be eating
potatoes and sweet potatoes

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:33.580
and starchy vegetables.

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:35.420
Those are very
inexpensive foods.

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.320
But you have to
know how to cook.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.690
But if you know how to cook--

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:42.357
and it's not that hard to cook
brown rice, I will tell you--

00:44:42.357 --> 00:44:44.690
then you've gotten your major
calories from that source.

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:47.890
If you're just buying
vegetables that are in season

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:53.020
and a little bit of fruit that's
in season, I'm telling you,

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.525
you can live on
that type of diet

00:44:54.525 --> 00:44:56.650
for just-- one person can
live on that type of diet

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:58.880
for about $2 or $3 a day.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.750
The ironic thing is, I'm
a really wealthy guy.

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:04.420
But I spend almost
nothing on food.

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:05.210
I cook.

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:06.490
I eat a really healthy diet.

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:08.030
And I don't spend
very much money,

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:10.990
even though I do get a high
discount from Whole Foods.

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:13.930
So that's the
unspoken truth here

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:17.050
is that it looks like all
that crappy junk food is

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:20.530
inexpensive, you know, the
burgers and French fries

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:22.100
and stuff like that.

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.630
But [INAUDIBLE] would argue
that the diet I just described

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:28.630
is less expensive, but
I'll make two other points.

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:33.520
The first one is, it may be
less expensive on a per-calorie

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.160
basis, but on a
per-nutrient basis, that's

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.710
an incredibly expensive diet
that the average American eats,

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:40.210
because they're not
getting any nutrients.

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:42.240
They're not getting any
micronutrient density.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.490
They're just getting calories.

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:44.740
They're getting fat.

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:48.570
You're staying alive for a
while before these lifestyle

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:52.370
diseases take their
toll, and you get older.

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:54.580
But that diet that
seems inexpensive

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:55.727
is really very expensive.

00:45:55.727 --> 00:45:57.310
And then when you
add the health costs

00:45:57.310 --> 00:45:59.643
into it, what you're going
to be spending on health care

00:45:59.643 --> 00:46:02.050
as you try to deal with the
diseases you get from it,

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:04.060
it's prohibitively expensive.

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.940
The diet everybody thinks
is expensive is far more

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:08.607
expensive than our
society can afford

00:46:08.607 --> 00:46:10.690
to pay for, because health
care is well on the way

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:12.760
to bankrupting us.

00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:14.260
Next question.

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:19.450
AUDIENCE: It seems like there's
two sort of actionable items

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:22.180
or like action steps
that you're discussing.

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:24.340
One is just plain awareness.

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:28.930
Most Americans don't
know that the sort

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:33.470
of default food that you're
eating is just not good.

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:36.020
And in this room, as
you mentioned earlier,

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:38.549
we're not very
representative of that group.

00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:40.090
And then there's
the secondary action

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:42.970
of sort of once you're aware
that you should be eating

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:47.170
healthy or the default
food is not healthy,

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:49.210
you want to optimize for that.

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:51.340
So for people in
this room, we're

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:52.860
probably looking at number two.

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.490
But what are some
actionable items

00:46:54.490 --> 00:47:01.201
that we can take to get most
people like to step number one?

00:47:01.201 --> 00:47:03.200
JOHN MACKEY: The most
important thing we can do,

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.880
obviously, is we
lead by example.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:10.090
That's the most important
thing we can do.

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:13.510
And secondly, we influence
our friends and families.

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:20.260
And even today, I had some
meetings earlier on at Google,

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:21.430
and I had some lunch.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:23.590
And one of your
executives at Google

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:25.930
is on our Board of
Directors at Whole Foods.

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:28.540
And it's like, they
went to great trouble

00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:31.240
to just try to feed me,
because they were very awkward.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.790
What's this guy going to eat?

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:33.940
He doesn't eat oil.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:34.960
He doesn't want any--

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:35.671
he's vegan.

00:47:35.671 --> 00:47:37.670
And so it was very
difficult. But you know what?

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:41.250
The food was fantastic.

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:43.170
Whole Foods is doing some stuff.

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:45.010
But we've got a
program we call--

00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:48.370
we have three foundations,
and one foundation

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:49.670
is aimed towards [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:51.190
What is about ending poverty.

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:52.940
So we have a
microcredit loan program

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.967
in some like 70 countries now.

00:47:54.967 --> 00:47:56.300
But that's not relevant to here.

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.425
But we also have a foundation
called The Whole Kids

00:47:58.425 --> 00:48:03.250
Foundation, where we give free
salad bars and free gardens,

00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:06.250
school gardens, to any schools
in America that ask for one.

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.050
So we've given out
over 5,000 salad

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:11.850
bars and almost 4,000 gardens
in the school districts.

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:15.070
And so we're getting fresh
fruits and vegetables to kids.

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:18.380
And when kids grow vegetables,
kids that grow vegetables,

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:19.660
eat vegetables.

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.604
So we're doing that.

00:48:21.604 --> 00:48:23.020
And then we also
have a foundation

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.561
called Whole Cities
Foundation, where

00:48:24.561 --> 00:48:27.059
we're doing intensive
education in the inner cities.

00:48:27.059 --> 00:48:29.350
We've opened four stores in
the inner cities that don't

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:31.330
meet our normal prototype.

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:35.210
One in Detroit, one in Chicago,
one in Newark, New Jersey,

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:36.920
and one in New Orleans.

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.700
And three of those four
stores are actually

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.070
successful stores for us.

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:45.410
So there are many
things that we can do.

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:49.150
But it's partly raising
people's consciousness.

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:51.040
But the problem is,
is there are very

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.875
powerful economic interests
who don't want people

00:48:53.875 --> 00:48:56.430
to stop eating the
food that they-- we

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:58.710
have this predisposition
to be addicted

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:00.720
to calorie-dense foods.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.460
And that's the biggest problem.

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:04.140
We're a bunch of addicts.

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.910
And until we have
consciousness about--

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:09.270
you know, they say an
alcoholic or a drug addict

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:12.690
can't really begin to reform
until they hit bottom.

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:15.030
Well, many people, it's
unfortunately true,

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:16.410
it's the same way with food.

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:19.230
And hitting bottom oftentimes
means getting a disease.

00:49:21.949 --> 00:49:23.615
When I was on the
tour a week or so ago,

00:49:23.615 --> 00:49:28.560
and I spoke at Goldman Sachs, I
had a 23-year-old woman come up

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.810
and told me that Whole
Foods Market saved her life.

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:32.018
And I said, well, how's that?

00:49:32.018 --> 00:49:33.930
She says, I got this
really weird disease,

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:37.200
and I just started eating
nothing but vegan, plant-based,

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.500
organic, lots of
fruits and vegetables,

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:43.680
and I reversed the disease,
and I'm so grateful.

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.850
And I hear that when I
travel around to our stores,

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:47.850
because I have so many
team members come up that

00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:49.808
went through the Total
Health Immersion and say

00:49:49.808 --> 00:49:51.340
you saved my life.

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:51.840
Look at me.

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:53.298
They show me their
before pictures.

00:49:53.298 --> 00:49:54.870
They show me the after pictures.

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:57.160
And it's astounding.

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.610
So there's a lot of
things we can do.

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:04.140
But I can't figure it all out.

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:05.080
Here's the good news.

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.819
How old are you?

00:50:06.819 --> 00:50:07.360
AUDIENCE: 28.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.026
JOHN MACKEY: 28.

00:50:08.026 --> 00:50:09.000
I'm 63.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.230
OK?

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:11.790
I've done a lot of stuff.

00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:12.780
You're 28.

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.242
You figure it out.

00:50:14.242 --> 00:50:15.700
I'll put the
challenge back to you.

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:18.450
You guys are a highly
creative organization.

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:21.330
So get to work.

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:23.195
Next question.

00:50:23.195 --> 00:50:24.570
AUDIENCE: First
of all, thank you

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:27.390
for the large quantity
of plant-based foods

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:28.170
at Whole Foods.

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:31.650
That definitely made it very
easy for me to become vegan.

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:35.055
And it's definitely cheaper
than what I was eating before.

00:50:35.055 --> 00:50:36.180
And I feel a lot healthier.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:36.315
JOHN MACKEY: Good.

00:50:36.315 --> 00:50:38.817
So you're buying it doesn't
have to be expensive argument.

00:50:38.817 --> 00:50:39.400
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.020
It's definitely much,
much cheaper also.

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:42.887
Yeah.

00:50:42.887 --> 00:50:44.970
If you think about like 1
pound of sweet potatoes,

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:46.066
it's like $1--

00:50:46.066 --> 00:50:47.190
JOHN MACKEY: Yeah, exactly.

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:48.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:52.240
So when you talk about the
90%-plus calories coming from

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:57.120
plant-based foods, I guess
my question is I see that

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.850
in the book, but I don't really
see that in Whole Foods stores.

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:04.230
And I understand that if you're
having third-party suppliers,

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:06.652
for example, processed
foods and all

00:51:06.652 --> 00:51:08.550
of that might be really
hard to actually get

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:12.060
90% of your food in the
store should be plant based.

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.474
But then when you
have foods that

00:51:13.474 --> 00:51:15.390
are, for example, the
pastries at Whole Foods,

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:17.910
the different foods
that are catered there,

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:21.420
do you have a plan to move to
90% of it being plant based,

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:22.680
not only for the health--

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.900
JOHN MACKEY: Yeah, I
wrote a book about it.

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:27.450
Let me ask you a question.

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:28.590
I know your question.

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:33.930
So the very first store I
opened before Whole Foods Market

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:35.460
was called Safer Way.

00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:37.620
I opened that--

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:39.990
I opened that in 1978.

00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:41.880
And it was a vegetarian store.

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.445
It sold no meat.

00:51:43.445 --> 00:51:44.700
It sold no sugar.

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.160
It sold no white flour.

00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:48.800
It sold no at alcohol.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.610
It sold no coffee.

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:52.920
It was an incredibly
healthy store.

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.920
And it did almost no business.

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.920
It wasn't until we
relocated that store

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:01.350
and began to sell the
foods that people wanted

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:03.720
to buy that we had a business.

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:06.830
And it was still a
natural food, primarily

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:09.690
organic-oriented store.

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:13.020
But we did sell meat,
natural meat, organic meat.

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:16.374
We did begin to sell
beer and wine and coffee.

00:52:16.374 --> 00:52:18.165
And we sold some things
with sugar in them.

00:52:18.165 --> 00:52:19.740
We sold some white flour.

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:21.750
And the store was
a huge success.

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:23.730
So the ultimate answer
is, Whole Foods,

00:52:23.730 --> 00:52:25.650
like every other
business person,

00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:28.224
has to meet the market
where it finds it.

00:52:28.224 --> 00:52:29.640
And we have the
highest standards.

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.520
I challenge you to
find any other chain

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.380
of stores that has higher
nutritional standards

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.550
as Whole Foods has.

00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:36.760
Nobody does.

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:41.250
Yet it's not the ideal scenario
in terms of people's health,

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:44.250
because people keep
making bad choices.

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:46.700
And we have to serve
the customers that

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:49.320
are going to go down the street
to get what they want to get.

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:53.670
So I hear what you're
saying, but I'm not

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:56.460
sure what to do about it,
except try to convince people

00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:59.230
to vote those products
out of existence.

00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:02.160
I spoke last night in Palo
Alto at the Commonwealth Club,

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.350
and I had animal
rights activists

00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:07.110
that were disrupting the event.

00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:09.680
You know, accusing me of
killing all these animals,

00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.450
and it's like guys, I don't
want to kill any animals.

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:13.300
I don't eat them.

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.620
I encourage you not to eat them.

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:17.650
But we're in business.

00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:20.740
We have to serve the
market as we find it.

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:23.380
And that's true for all
the foods that we sell.

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:25.600
All I can try to do is
educate and persuade.

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.730
Ultimately, you
make the choices.

00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:30.100
And if you don't
choose the meat,

00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:33.740
and you don't choose the
sugar and refined products,

00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:35.460
then we'll stop selling them.

00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:36.720
AUDIENCE: So can I ask
a follow-up question?

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.720
JOHN MACKEY: Yeah, sure.

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so when are
you talking about standards,

00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:44.040
I guess like I'm actually
familiar with the disruption

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.755
that happened yesterday
because I have four of my--

00:53:46.755 --> 00:53:48.046
JOHN MACKEY: You look familiar.

00:53:48.046 --> 00:53:49.940
You know that guy that we
dragged out at about 7:30 too?

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:51.150
AUDIENCE: No, I was
not there yesterday.

00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:51.816
JOHN MACKEY: OK.

00:53:51.816 --> 00:53:53.650
AUDIENCE: I also like
don't directly support

00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:54.775
that disruption whatsoever.

00:53:54.775 --> 00:53:56.149
You know I just
understand what--

00:53:56.149 --> 00:53:57.410
JOHN MACKEY: OK, go ahead.

00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:58.090
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:58.090 --> 00:54:00.560
I have four housemates and
including my boyfriend,

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.170
I have done investigations
into Whole Foods farms

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:05.312
that claim should
be humane and--

00:54:05.312 --> 00:54:06.770
JOHN MACKEY: We
never claimed that.

00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:07.040
AUDIENCE: --cage free.

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:09.895
JOHN MACKEY: Never claim any
of our things to be humane.

00:54:09.895 --> 00:54:10.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.170
JOHN MACKEY: We just rate them
based on the animal welfare.

00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:15.640
It's a five-step program.

00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:17.390
We're not making a
claim that it's humane.

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:20.960
We're just saying there are
different gradations of the way

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.190
the animals are treated.

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:23.550
Here's the thing.

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:24.970
Is Whole Foods system perfect?

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:25.770
No, of course not.

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:30.650
We can't monitor
these farms 24/7.

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:32.965
They have to pass certain
inspections and tests.

00:54:32.965 --> 00:54:34.580
And we do flunk them out.

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:39.860
Really bad actors do get
investigated and tossed out.

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:45.710
So all I can say is we're
the ones being attacked,

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:47.630
and yet we're the
ones-- the only ones--

00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:49.730
that are trying to
do anything about it.

00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:50.420
Who else?

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:52.840
You think Safeway is
doing anything about it?

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:55.360
Do you think Trader
Joe's is doing--

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.481
Trader Joe's still has
caged eggs for God's sake.

00:54:58.481 --> 00:54:59.230
We don't have any.

00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:01.490
We haven't had any caged
eggs for almost 20 years.

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:04.640
We're the only ones that are
trying to make a difference.

00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:09.020
They're trying to get a higher
more ethical source of animal

00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:10.066
foods.

00:55:10.066 --> 00:55:11.690
And we're the only
ones being attacked.

00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:13.773
And we're being attacked
by the people that should

00:55:13.773 --> 00:55:15.110
be making common cause with us.

00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:16.996
They're not out there
picketing Safeway,

00:55:16.996 --> 00:55:19.370
and they're not out there
picketing Trader Joe's, they're

00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:21.470
picketing the only
company that's

00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:23.030
trying to make it better.

00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:24.910
I just think that's
incredibly weird.

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:28.340
AUDIENCE: So they actually have
just done protests for Sprouts,

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:29.440
Safeway, and Trader Joe's.

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:29.940
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:30.606
JOHN MACKEY: Oh!

00:55:30.606 --> 00:55:31.190
Go get them!

00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:32.595
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:32.595 --> 00:55:35.030
So do you believe that
there is an ethical way

00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:38.260
of killing animals or
like harvesting milk?

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:41.492
JOHN MACKEY: No, you need to
read chapter 13 of the book.

00:55:41.492 --> 00:55:42.950
You should read
that chapter first.

00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:44.960
I make the ethical argument.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.320
The book argues for
10% animal foods

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:49.220
from a-- based on
the science, we

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:51.500
don't see that eating
up to 10% you're

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:53.590
going to get any
worse health outcomes.

00:55:53.590 --> 00:55:57.350
In chapter 13, I make the
very impassioned ethical case

00:55:57.350 --> 00:55:58.900
for not eating any animal foods.

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:01.409
Read that chapter and
tell me if you don't see

00:56:01.409 --> 00:56:02.700
that I'm actually on your side.

00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:03.410
I'm not the enemy.

00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:03.760
I'm a pragmatist--

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:04.140
AUDIENCE: No, I agree.

00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:05.639
JOHN MACKEY: I'm a
pragmatist trying

00:56:05.639 --> 00:56:07.040
to make the world
a better place.

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.350
But you have to meet the
world where you find it.

00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:11.330
It's easy to be holy
and pure and not

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:12.952
make a difference in the world.

00:56:12.952 --> 00:56:13.910
AUDIENCE: Sounds great.

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:14.030
Cool.

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:14.570
Thank you.

00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:15.570
JOHN MACKEY: Chapter 13.

00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:15.860
Check it out.

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:16.730
Let me know what you think.

00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:16.970
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:17.470
Cool.

00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:18.260
Thank you.

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:20.510
AUDIENCE: My wife and I
recently have transferred over

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:22.890
to being fully
vegan, plant based,

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:25.970
and it's been somewhat of a
process kind of cutting out

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:27.382
red meat, becoming vegetarian.

00:56:27.382 --> 00:56:28.340
JOHN MACKEY: A journey.

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:28.839
I get it.

00:56:28.839 --> 00:56:30.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and as
the education builds,

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:32.460
you start to make
better choices.

00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:36.410
So I'm just kind of curious
how that path for you was.

00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:37.940
Was it gradual?

00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:39.030
Was there a wow moment?

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:40.910
JOHN MACKEY: Yeah,
several wow moments.

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:42.990
In my case, it followed
through certain stages.

00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:45.470
The first one was when
I was 23 years old,

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:49.420
and I moved into a vegetarian
co-op in Austin where I live.

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.470
I wasn't vegetarian,
but I just thought

00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:54.500
I'd meet some really cool
people that were vegetarians.

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:57.800
And that was a very
radical thing back in 1975

00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:59.330
to be a vegetarian.

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:00.860
And I went in.

00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:03.140
I became a vegetarian,
and my food consciousness

00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:04.370
was awakened.

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:06.600
When I went there,
it changed my life.

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.807
I found my higher
purpose in life,

00:57:09.807 --> 00:57:11.390
although I didn't
know it at the time.

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:14.000
I became a food
buyer for the co-op.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.490
I just read so many
books about it.

00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:17.198
I was totally in love
with the whole idea

00:57:17.198 --> 00:57:18.790
of natural and organic.

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:22.190
And pretty soon after
that, I started Safer Way

00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:26.630
and with my girlfriend
that I met at that co-op.

00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:29.960
So that was the first awakening.

00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:33.384
And then the second
awakening was back in 2003

00:57:33.384 --> 00:57:35.842
when Whole Foods was being--
we were at the annual meeting,

00:57:35.842 --> 00:57:40.371
and we were disrupted
by animal activists who

00:57:40.371 --> 00:57:42.620
were very upset about a duck
we were selling that they

00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:44.480
said was from a factory farm.

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:47.810
And to make a long story
short, I ended up in a dialogue

00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:51.200
with one of the activists,
and we swapped emails,

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.850
and we began a dialogue.

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:55.025
And after about
a month or so, we

00:57:55.025 --> 00:57:56.900
were both getting
frustrated with each other.

00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:58.520
And she sent me an
email and she said,

00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:00.980
you know, Mr. Mackey,
I can see that you're

00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:02.500
a very idealistic man.

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:05.150
You really want to make
the world a better place.

00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:06.890
But when it comes to
livestock animals,

00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:08.681
you have no idea what
you're talking about.

00:58:08.681 --> 00:58:11.480
You're grossly
not well-informed.

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:12.570
So I took that.

00:58:12.570 --> 00:58:15.290
I was taken aback, but I decided
you know, she's probably right.

00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:17.510
So then I read,
that summer of 2003,

00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:23.177
I read a dozen books on the
way we raise food in America,

00:58:23.177 --> 00:58:24.260
particularly animal foods.

00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:25.384
And I was like freaked out.

00:58:25.384 --> 00:58:26.227
It was terrible.

00:58:26.227 --> 00:58:26.810
I had no idea.

00:58:26.810 --> 00:58:27.770
It was so horrible.

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:29.060
It's a nightmare.

00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:32.004
And by the time that I had
read about four or five books,

00:58:32.004 --> 00:58:33.920
I decided I'm going to
have to become a vegan.

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.080
I can't in good
conscience eat this stuff.

00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:36.720
And so I did.

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.370
That was a huge
awakening for me,

00:58:38.370 --> 00:58:40.200
and I also vowed at
that point Whole Foods

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:43.140
would do what it could to
improve animal welfare.

00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:46.160
And that resulted in our
five-step animal welfare

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:52.330
process that he has friends
that are unhappy with it.

00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:54.530
And then my health got better.

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:56.360
But then the next
big breakthrough

00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:00.230
was like in 2006 when I
read "The China Study"

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:01.610
by Colin Campbell.

00:59:01.610 --> 00:59:05.000
And that was like such an
awakening, because I really

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.950
didn't stop eating
the processed foods.

00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:12.470
Even when I became a vegan,
I was like a junk food vegan.

00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:14.840
So when I got rid of
the processed foods,

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:17.730
my health became unbelievable.

00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:19.670
I weigh the same
right now as I weighed

00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:21.290
when I was 18 years old.

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:23.690
My cholesterol is like 135, 140.

00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:27.895
My blood pressure is 105
over 65, something like that.

00:59:27.895 --> 00:59:28.895
I almost never get sick.

00:59:28.895 --> 00:59:30.320
My immune system
is super strong.

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.990
My telomeres are like
in the 98th percentile.

00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:34.890
Really, it's diet and lifestyle.

00:59:34.890 --> 00:59:38.030
And so those three
separate events,

00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:40.340
wish I had gotten when
I was in my early 20s.

00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:41.350
But I didn't.

00:59:41.350 --> 00:59:42.860
I only got part of
it when I was 23.

00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:45.350
I had to pick up the
rest as I got older.

00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:47.245
So good luck to you.

00:59:47.245 --> 00:59:47.870
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:50.420
I was curious what the
role of the preparation

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:53.030
method of the food
is in the Whole Foods

00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:54.590
diet and the role of fats.

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:57.960
When I think of even cooking
healthy vegetable things,

00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.810
I think of that I put
a little oil in it

00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:02.690
for salad dressing or oil
to grill it or roast it.

01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:05.210
Is cooking or not
cooking it a dimension?

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:07.335
And what kind of fats, if
any, would be acceptable?

01:00:07.335 --> 01:00:09.043
JOHN MACKEY: Well, in
the diet, again, we

01:00:09.043 --> 01:00:10.980
don't make a big deal
out of protein, fat,

01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:11.750
and carbohydrates.

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:15.000
We consider that to be
misleading to people.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.060
If you eat a whole foods
diet, mostly plants,

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.060
you don't have to worry
about any of that stuff.

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:21.230
You're going to
get enough protein.

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:22.604
You're going to
get enough carbs.

01:00:22.604 --> 01:00:24.760
You're going to get enough fat.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:27.680
But you are using oil
to cook, and we do

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.000
argue against oil in the book.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.980
You don't need any-- you
never need to eat oil.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:33.260
You don't need to cook with it.

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:36.050
I steam fry my veggies.

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:38.020
And it's easy to do.

01:00:38.020 --> 01:00:39.920
You just do it with
water or vegetable

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.740
broth or even a
little wine, which

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.630
alcohol will evaporate off.

01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:47.930
So you don't need that to saute.

01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:51.110
And if you're talking about
fats to add some kind of sauce

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:53.310
to say put on the
veggies and stuff,

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:56.570
it's so easy if you get a
high-powered blender like

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.930
a Vitamix or a Blendtec or
even a little NutriBullet,

01:00:59.930 --> 01:01:01.780
you can make--

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.870
you just mix nuts and seeds.

01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:07.420
I mean, a simple way to do it
is some kind of nut or seed,

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.680
a little bit of some kind
of vinegar or lemon juice,

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:12.020
and fat and acid.

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:15.849
And then either you go savory
with like garlic and mustard

01:01:15.849 --> 01:01:18.140
or something like that or
you go sweet by just throwing

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:21.050
like blueberries or blackberries
into it or cherries,

01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:23.240
and you'll get the
most delicious sauces

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.950
you can possibly imagine.

01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:27.590
And so a typical dinner
for me, for example,

01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:33.260
is I cook a sweet potato, steam
up a big plate of veggies,

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:36.240
make up some kind of
little nut dressing

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:39.040
and put that on the
veggies and voila.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.490
Takes me 10 minutes
to cook dinner

01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:43.200
or after you get
the sweet potato,

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:45.517
you've got to bake
that or steam it.

01:01:45.517 --> 01:01:46.850
But that takes very little time.

01:01:46.850 --> 01:01:48.070
It's not expensive at all.

01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:50.760
It's delicious, and it's
incredibly nutritious,

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.040
and couldn't be easier.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:57.380
So I get my fats from the Whole
Foods avocados, nuts and seeds,

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.180
primarily the
concentrated sources.

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:01.040
But what people don't
realize, fats are--

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:01.985
they're in everything.

01:02:01.985 --> 01:02:04.310
You can't possibly
not get enough fat.

01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:06.350
If I had steel cut
oats for breakfast,

01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:13.100
and oats are 13% fat,
just regular oats, fats,

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:14.586
they're just there.

01:02:14.586 --> 01:02:17.346
It's like not something
to worry about.

01:02:17.346 --> 01:02:18.360
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.860
JOHN MACKEY: Guys,
thanks very much.

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.020
Good luck at Google.

01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:22.140
Keep changing the world.

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:25.190
[APPLAUSE]
