00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[D. Evans] The answer is the first 2 can be produced.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The third one cannot.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And the way to see that is to follow the rules.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So if we start from sentence we only have 1 rule from sentence,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
so we're always going to end up with subject, verb, object.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We also only have 1 rule from subject and 1 rule from object,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so we're always going to end up with noun, verb, followed by object,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which also is replaced with noun.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
From here we have lots of choices.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We can replace the noun with Python,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
we can replace the verb with eat,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and we can replace the second noun with cookies.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
That will derive the first sentence.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We could replace the second noun with Python,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
using instead the second choice.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
That would derive the second sentence.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There's no way to produce the third one.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We can get close. We can turn the noun into I following this rule.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We can turn the verb into like following this rule.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We can't turn the noun into eat. The noun can be either I, python, or cookies.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
That's why we can't derive the third sentence.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The important thing about replacement grammars

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
is we can describe a large language--in fact, an infinitely large language--

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
with a small set of rules.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This language itself is quite small, but we'll see how to describe much bigger languages

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
still using a small number of rules soon.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And it's very precise.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We can figure out exactly what sentences are in the language

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
just by following the rules here doing replacements.
