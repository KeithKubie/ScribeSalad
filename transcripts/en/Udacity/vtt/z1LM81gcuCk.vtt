So would the idea of diagnosis help us design an agent that can answer Raven's

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.710
progressive matrices? Perhaps the best way to think about this is to

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.150
consider how your agent might respond when it answers a question wrong.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.620
First, what data will it use to investigate its incorrect answer?

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.020
Second, what hypotheses might it have for incorrect answers?

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.740
Third, how will it select a hypothesis that best explains that data? And last,

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.560
once it's selected hypothesis that explains that data, how will it

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.400
use that to repair its reasoning, so it doesn't make the same mistake again?
