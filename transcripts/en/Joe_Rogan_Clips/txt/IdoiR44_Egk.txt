Speaker 1:          00:00          Well, your, your concern is anti aging. You certainly want people to live longer, but you yourself are more concerned with your work than you are with your own personal life. Oh, 100%. My wife will tell you that. Um, the reason that I look off to myself as best I can when I've got the energy is, um, it would be a bad look if I died from heart disease tomorrow. Yes. The anti-aging guy. Well, if you died from anything other than an accident, right? Yeah. All right. So I'm trying to be a role model for others. Um, but you know, I, if I, if I died tomorrow, that'd be fine with me. I'd like to finish my work at least, uh, I would like to leave something behind. But what I don't want to do is to be a burden on my kids and my grandkids.

Speaker 1:          00:47          Yeah. And so that's what I'm also trying to prevent. Yeah. That would seem to me to be the real final frontier of anti-aging is folks that are really, really old because it seems like they would be open to try almost anything. And if you could bring them back, that would be Uber bizarre. Right. How far away do you think we are from doing something like that? While it, it often comes as a shock to people who don't work on this that we're already testing these molecules in clinical trials on elderly people. I've been doing that for a number of years now, um, with some positive results. Um, over at Harvard we were getting any man and, and another molecule called MIT be 66. Um, what's the other one called? My laundry list so that the company's called Metro Biotech and uh, it makes Super Nad boosters and the drug is called developmental drug is MIB dash six two six six two six.

Speaker 1:          01:47          Yeah. And we're, we're hoping that it will not just of g of that alleyway somewhere. Ah, or of that I got to go to some shady doctor with a weird accent. Uh, that one, uh, that one we hope to get on the market in about, uh, three years from now. Really? Yeah. Foot for diseases, FDA approved. And so they're using it right now on old folks are testing it for safety. Yeah. But we're also going to be testing later, uh, energy. Uh, we can measure actually the Nad levels, that molecule I mentioned. Um, we can measure that in their muscles and we'll test if that worked. Um, and we'll, we'll measure of course their insurance because at the mice that we traded with Nmn, uh, they just ran and ran and ran. They actually broke the little treadmill in my lab because they ran so far.

Speaker 1:          02:33          And you're giving it to them orally or you're injecting it to them? Uh, it's a, it's a little tablet. They just put food, put it in their food or something like that. All the mice. Yeah. Oh No, I thought you're talking about humans. Uh, in the mice we put in their drinking water, Haley's trinkets, early easy. Wow. And they have no idea. No idea. Um, and in fact that people who are running the treadmill have no idea which is which, but we had mice running three kilometers and then the machine stopped and I get a text from the researcher, Hey, the machine broke. And I said, uh, check the software. And turns out software was written to stop at three kilometers cause no mouse had run that far before. That's long. And those are old mice. Don't forget, these are mice that equivalent or the equivalent of a 65 year old human.

Speaker 1:          03:15          Really? Yeah. And we figured out why they run further. This isn't just, uh, try it and see. We figured out that, that the lining of the blood vessels needs nad as you get older. Well they need it all the time, but as you get older you don't have enough nad. So the Nmn replenishes that and allows the blood vessel lining to respond to exercise, um, and even grow blood vessels if you don't exercise. And so those mice, they ran and ran around, they didn't get lactate build up as much. I just didn't feel tired. So in that lactic acid buildup, right. Wow. So muscle fatigue would be different. Uh, well they didn't seem to get that either. Wow. Is the just better blood flow? We even pinched off an artery, uh, and the body responded much better to restate restoring blood flow, which would be great for patients who have a heart attack. Whoa. Now with human beings, what has been the most dramatic result?

Speaker 1:          04:15          Uh, that's a hard question because a lot of its early stage, um, we developed a molecule that, uh, seem to effectively treat a disease called psoriasis, which is the, yeah. How's that? Yeah. So that, that, that worked and that's a molecule. That's something you apply to the skin. It was a, it was a pill actually. Hmm. Yeah. Um, how does that work? What does it doing? A, so it's an activator of one of these [inaudible] are two ones that we found in yeast originally. These are two and protective enzymes in the body and there are antiinflammatory and so that worked well against that disease. So psoriasis has something to do with inflammation. It isn't an inflammatory disorder. Yup. Um, are all autoimmune disorders anti inflammatory based disorders? I believe so. Really? Interesting.

Speaker 2:          05:07          Huh?

Speaker 1:          05:09          Cause I have a, I have Videle ego. You don't see that little spots on my skin where I don't have a, any pigment, it's genetic. My grandmother had it. My grandmother sister had it. Um, I wonder if that would help me. Uh, yeah. I really couldn't say. What's it called again? Which one? The drug that was tested. Yeah. Um, it has a name, s, r t 2104. And this is the stuff that worked on psoriasis. Yeah. In a small study in New York. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          05:36          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          05:39          Now what other, um, what other things had really a dramatic results on humans? Well, we're not there yet. We don't have dramatic results. Is there anything promising results on humans or then NMN and yes, there are there. So this m tore I mentioned earlier where, uh, the drug rapamycin, which is too dangerous, try on normal people. Um, that drug has been tried on elderly people and it boosted their immune system in the same way that you see with calorie restricted mice. And so that, that was an early signal that you might be able to reverse aspects of aging and the elderly with that truck.
