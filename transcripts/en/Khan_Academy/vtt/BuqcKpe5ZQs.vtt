00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.180
In the last video, we started
with a linear transformation

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.520
S, that was a mapping between
the set x, that was a subset

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.510
of Rn to the set y.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.390
And then we had another
transformation that was a

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.540
mapping from the set
y to the set z.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.060
And we asked ourselves,
given these two linear

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.900
transformations, could
we construct a linear

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.320
transformation that goes all
the way from x to z?

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.780
What we did was we made
a definition.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.820
We said let's create something
called the

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.290
composition of T with S.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.180
What that is, is first you apply
S to some vector in X to

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.535
get some vector in Y.

00:00:38.535 --> 00:00:40.990
And that's your vector
right there.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.090
And then you apply T to
that, to get to z.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.720
And so we defined it that way.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.420
And our next question was, was
that a linear transformation?

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.890
We show that it was.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.010
It met the two requirements
for them.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.620
And because it is a linear
transformation, I left off in

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.440
the last video saying that
it should be able to be

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.870
represented by some matrix
vector product.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.440
Where this will have to
be an l by n matrix.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.690
Because it's a mapping from an n
dimensional space, which was

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.300
x-- it was a subset of Rn--
to an l dimensional space.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.860
Because z is a subset of Rl Now
in this video, let's try

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.340
to actually construct
this matrix.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.130
So at the beginning of the last
video, I told you that T

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.050
of x could be written as some
matrix product, B times x.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.170
Let me write that and rewrite
it down here.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.090
So I told you that the linear
transformation T applied to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.900
some vector x, could be written
as the matrix vector

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.410
product, B times a vector x.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.540
And since it was a mapping from
an m dimensional space to

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.170
an l dimensional space, we know
this is going to be in l

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.800
by m matrix.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.000
Now similarly, I told you that
the transformation S can also

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.780
be written as a matrix
vector product.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.729
Where we can say A is its
matrix representation

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.160
times a vector x.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.060
And since S was a mapping from
an n dimensional space to an m

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.950
dimensional space, this will
be an m by n matrix.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.600
Now by definition, what was the
composition of T with S?

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.460
What is this?

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.680
By definition, we said that this
is equal to-- you first

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.590
apply the linear transformation
S to x.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.890
And I'll arbitrarily
switch colors.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.000
So you first apply the
transformation S to x.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.400
And that essentially gets you
a vector right there.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.560
This is just a vector in Rm.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.360
Or it's really a vector in y,
which is a subset of Rm.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.600
And then you apply the
transformation T to that

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.460
vector to get you into z.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.340
Given this we can use our matrix
representations to

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.620
replace this kind of
transformation representation.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.830
Although they're really
the same thing.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.110
What is a transformation
of S applied to x?

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:25.830
Well this right here is just
A times x, where this

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.530
is an m by n matrix.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.800
So we can say that this is equal
to the transformation

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.480
applied to A times x.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.080
Now, what is the T
transformation applied

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.410
to any vector x?

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.740
Well that's the matrix B
times your vector x.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.960
So this thing right here is
going to be equal to B times

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.040
whatever I put in there.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:58.790
So the matrix B times the matrix
A times the vector x

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.710
right there.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.010
This is what our composition
transformation is.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.440
The composition of T with S
applied to the vector x.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.730
Which takes us from the set x
all the way to the set z is

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.140
this, if we use the matrix
forms of the two

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.700
transformations.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.850
Now at the end of last video I
said I wanted to find just

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.500
some matrix that if I were to
multiply times this vector,

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.260
that is equivalent to
this transformation.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.800
And I know that I can
find this matrix.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.100
I know that this exists because
this is a linear

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.440
transformation.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.910
So how can we do that?

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.180
Well, we just do what we've
always done in the past. We

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.040
start with the identity matrix,
and we apply the

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.370
transformation to every column
of the identity matrix.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.980
And then you end up with your
matrix representation of the

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.530
transformation itself.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.200
So first of all, how
big is the identity

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.750
matrix going to be?

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.600
Well, these guys that we're
inputting into our

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.500
transformation, they are subsets
of x, or they're

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.960
members of x, which is
an n dimensional

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.410
space, a subset of Rn.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.460
So all we do to figure out C
is we start off with the

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.710
identity matrix.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.610
The n dimensional identity
matrix, because

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.110
our domain is Rn.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.705
And of course we know what
that looks like.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.600
We have 1, 0 all the way down.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.880
It's going to be an n by n
matrix, and then 0, 1 all the

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.540
way down 0's.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.410
These 0's right here, and then
you have 1's go all the way

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.430
down the columns and everything
else is 0.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.680
We've seen this multiple times
that's what your identity

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.970
matrix looks like, just 1's down
the column from the top

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.700
left to the bottom right.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.340
Now to figure out C, the matrix
representation of our

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.060
transformation, all we do is we
apply the transformation to

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.950
each of these columns.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:12.580
So we can write that our matrix
C is equal to the

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.900
transformation applied
to this first column.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.615
What is the transformation?

00:06:15.615 --> 00:06:23.150
It is the matrix B times the
matrix A times whatever you're

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.450
taking the transformation of.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.190
In this case we're taking the
transformation of that.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.850
We're taking the transformation
of 1, 0, 0 all

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.380
the way down.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.100
There's 1 followed by
a bunch of 0's.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.350
That's going to be our
first column of C.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:42.370
Our second column of C is going
to be B times A times

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.300
the second column of our
identity matrix.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.650
And, of course, you remember
these are each the standard

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.980
basis vectors for Rn.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.740
So this is going to be times
E2, which is a 0, 1,

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.290
0 all the way down.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.560
And then we're going to keep
doing that until we do get to

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:13.700
the last column, which is B
times A times a bunch of 0's

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.680
all the way down
until get a 1.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.970
The nth term is just
a 1 right there.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.110
Now what is this going
to be equal to?

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.540
It looks fairly complicated
right now.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.970
But all you have to do is make
the realization-- and we've

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.500
seen this multiple times.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.490
If we write our vector A or we
write our matrix A as just a

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:34.690
bunch of column vectors.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:40.610
So this is a column vector A1,
A2, all the way to An.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.413
We already learned that this
was and n buy m matrix.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:56.670
Then what is the vector A times,
for example, x1, x2 to

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.140
all the way down to xn.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.800
We've seen this multiple
times.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:12.390
This is the equivalent to x1
times A1 plus x2 times A2, all

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:16.210
the way to plus xn times An.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:17.460
We've seen this multiple
times.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.290
It's a linear combination of
these column vectors where the

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.000
waiting factors are the terms
in our vector that we're

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.470
taking the product of.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.620
So given that, what is this
guy going to reduce to?

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.410
This is going to be A1 times
this first entry right here,

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:36.100
times x1, plus A2 times a second
entry, plus A3 times a

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:36.559
third entry.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:37.900
But all these other
entries are 0.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.189
The x2's all the way
to the xn are 0's.

00:08:40.189 --> 00:08:43.789
So you're only going to end
up with 1 times the first

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.590
column here in A.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.680
So this will reduce to--
let me write this.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:56.820
So the first column is going
to be B times-- now A times

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.780
this E1 vector, I guess we could
call it, right there is

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.720
just going to be 1 times the
first column in A plus 0 times

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.430
the second column in A plus
0 times the third column.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.420
So it's just 1 times the
first column in A.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.240
So it's just A1.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.300
That simple.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.610
Now what is this one going
to be equal to?

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:23.740
It's going to be 0 times the
first column in A, plus 1

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.660
times a second column in A, plus
0 times a third column in

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:28.180
A, and the rest are
going to be 0's.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.250
So it's just going to be 1 times
the second column in A.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.410
So the second column in our
transformation matrix is just

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.850
going to be B times A2.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.230
And I think you get
the idea here.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.830
The next one is going to be B
times A3 and all the way until

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.660
you get B times An.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.670
So that's how you would
solve for your

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.800
transformation matrix.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.050
Remember what we were
trying to do.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:59.100
We were trying to find some--
let me write down and

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.140
summarize everything that
we've done so far.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:09.170
We had a mapping S, that was
a mapping from x to y.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.490
But x was a subset of Rn.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.370
Y was a subset of Rm.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.110
And so we said that this linear
transformation could be

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:27.760
represented as some matrix A
where A is an m by n matrix

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.750
times a vector x.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.700
Then I showed you another
transformation, we already

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:39.320
called it T, which was a
mapping from y to z.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.570
z is a subset of Rl.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.490
And of course, the
transformation T applied to

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:53.430
some vector in y, can be
represented as some matrix B

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:57.450
times that vector.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:58.740
I shouldn't have drawn
parentheses there,

00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.430
but you get the idea.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.870
And this, since it's a mapping
from a subset of our Rm to Rl,

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.850
this will be an l by m matrix.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:12.220
And then we said, look, if
we actually just take the

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:20.750
composition of T with S,
of some vector in x,

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.180
this reduced to B.

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.790
So first we applied the
S transformation.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.060
We multiplied the matrix
A times x.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.800
And then we applied the T
transformation to this.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.910
So we just multiplied
B times that.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.100
Now we know this is a linear
transformation, which means it

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.450
can be represented as a
matrix vector product.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.840
And we just figured out what the
matrix vector product is.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:12:00.210
So this thing is going to be
equal to C times x, which is

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:03.400
equal to this thing right there,
which is equal to that

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.040
thing right there.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:16.280
Which is equal to-- let me write
it this way-- B, A1,

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.020
where A1 is the first column
vector in our matrix A.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.030
And then the second column
here is going to be B.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.990
And then we have A2, where
this is the second column

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.970
vector in A.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:42.140
And you can keep going all the
way until you have B times An

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.770
times x, of course.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.980
Now this is fair enough.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.470
We can always do this if you
give me some matrix.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:00.350
Remember this is an
l by m matrix.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:05.370
And you give me another matrix
right here that is an m by n

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:08.650
matrix, I can always do this.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.250
And how do I know I can
I always do that?

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:16.000
Because each of these
A's are going to

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.900
have m entries, right?

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:22.580
They're going to be Ai.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.150
All of them are going to
be members of our Rm.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.490
So this is well-defined.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.080
This has m columns.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.360
This has m entries.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.820
So each of these matrix vector
products are well-defined.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:36.480
Now, this is an interesting
thing, because we were able to

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.620
figure out the actual matrix
representation of this

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.350
composition transformation.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:43.970
Let's extend it a little
bit further.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.630
Wouldn't it be nice if this
were the same thing as the

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.820
matrices B times A.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.740
All of that times x.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.500
Wouldn't it be nice if these
were the same thing?

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.010
Because then we could say that
the composition of T with S of

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:14.490
x is equal to the matrix
representation of B times a

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.580
matrix representation of S.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.270
And you take the product
of those two.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.690
And that will create a new
matrix representation which

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.135
you can call C.

00:14:24.135 --> 00:14:26.600
That you can then multiply
times x.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.480
So you won't have to do it
individually every time, or do

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.360
it this way.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.870
And I guess the truth of the
matter is there is nothing to

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:38.330
stop us from defining this
to be equal to B times A.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.080
We have not defined what a
matrix times a matrix is yet.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.290
So we might as well.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.500
This is a good enough motivation
for us to define it

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.530
in this way.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.010
So let's throw in
this definition.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.510
So if we have some matrix B.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:04.980
B is an l by m matrix.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.630
And then we have some other
matrix A-- and I'll actually

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.090
show what A looks like, where
these are its column vectors.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:16.600
A1, A2, all the way to An.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.500
We're going to define
the product.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.750
So this is a definition.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:28.880
We're going to define the
product BA as being equal to

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.360
the matrix B times each of
the column vectors of A.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.080
So it's B times A1.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.410
That's going to be
its first column.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.220
This is going to
be B times A2.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:44.320
All the way to B times An.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.750
And you've seen this before in
algebra two, but the reason

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.740
why I went through almost two
videos to get to here, is to

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:56.480
show you the motivation for
why matrix products are

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.670
defined this way.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.270
Because it makes the notion
of compositions of

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.900
transformations kind
of natural.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.740
If you take the composition of
one linear transformation with

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:10.050
another, the resulting
transformation matrix is just

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:14.000
the product, as we've just
defined it, of their two

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.250
transformation matrices.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.850
For those of you who might not
have a lot of experience

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:22.590
taking products of matrices, and
who think this is fairly

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:25.240
abstract to look at, in the next
video I'll actually do a

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.270
bunch of examples and show you
that this definition is

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.560
actually fairly straightforward.
