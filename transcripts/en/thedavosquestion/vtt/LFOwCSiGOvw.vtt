I think perhaps it's a bit too simplistic
to say China will save the world through this

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:13.599
global financial crisis. I think the global
financial crisis is a situation where more

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:19.429
than one country has to come to find a solution.
It's not one country's burden or one country

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:25.390
has the capability to do this. China has its
own issues that it needs to go through. It

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.619
needs to make some internal changes as well
as it goes through this financial crisis.

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.159
In short, yes. No I believe that it needs
to be a collective effort.
