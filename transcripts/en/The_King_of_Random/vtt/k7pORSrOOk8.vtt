00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.350
Hey guys i'm Grant Thompson the King of Random

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.980
I just released a video on my YouTube channel about the stealth shelf which is a DIY concealment shelf

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.460
It'll let you hide money, passports, firearms or anything else that you want out of sight and out of mind.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.840
If you maneuver some of the decorations on top into just the right position you can press the bottom of the shelf

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.100
And it will open up revealing your secret stash inside.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.860
Now, I designed this to be a DIY project that you could do at home with your own tools materials

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.080
But I have had an unprecedented number of requests to sell these things

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.680
I've heard your requests and I put together a team that right now is in the process of manufacturing these things

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.940
So we can make them available to you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.980
So I know a lot of you are DIYers, but I know a lot of you have two main problems

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.020
One, You don't have the tools to make the projects and two you don't have the time. So, in this kickstarter

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.720
we're going to solve both of those challenges for you by offering three different variations of this product. We've got three different packages

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.580
You can choose from. The first one is for someone who likes to tinker and do things themselves. All of the materials will come pre-manufactured.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.020
All the boards are already cut to size the holes for the hinges are already drilled

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.720
you just need to assemble it together .The second package comes pre-assembled for you

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.710
It's a basic shelf

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.440
But you can get it in a light stain a dark stain or no stain at all so you can choose your own color.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.760
This is put together for you and ship ready to mount straight to your wall. The only thing

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.470
it doesn't have are the bells and whistles and that's the third package

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.049
This is the premium shelf like the one you see in my shop

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.619
It comes with multiple locks diamond plate aluminum trim magnetic locking options and the magnetic motion activated LED

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.730
Now come check this out if you look at the side of the shelf here

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.219
You can see this actually flush against the wall, as I open the shelf it moves up out of position

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.980
And it never actually makes contact [with] the wall through the entire cycle

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.160
It's called a floating shelf, and it looks really elegant and really decorative now in this particular shelf

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:57.489
I just have a (BB) gun which actually has some magnetic locks on itself for my CO2 (Carbon-dioxide) cartridges, and it's also got a removable

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.180
Led light you can use as a makeshift flashlight in the event of emergency

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.879
Or if you have intruders you want to go check them out

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.800
you've got easy access to everything right there. When you're ready to get back to hiding your item simply move your

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.700
decorations back out of position and press the bottom back into position. You're back in stealth mode just like that

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.179
You can't lose your keys because there aren't any the keys are the decorations themselves

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.390
And you can quite literally put your keys into any decorations you want

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.330
But you still have to go the secret magnetic location to get to open

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.930
Which makes it very very difficult for children to open, but the stealth shelf isn't limited to concealing firearms think about spare money

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.010
Or cash you might have around the house that you don't want people getting into it's also a good place to store

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.709
Passports or spare keys because it'll just sit there until you need them. You have full control with the stealth shelf

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.980
What goes in what comes out and who knows about it now for me? I've put these in my workshop

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.420
I put them in my bedroom you can put them by your front door you can basically put them wherever you want to access something quickly

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.500
It comes in a couple different designs

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.190
So it'll nicely complement the decor you already have in your home, and at a price point

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.219
it's very competitive with floating shelves that are already on the market

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.919
So if you get the value of having a stealth shelf in your home

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.220
Then back the project now choose the kit that makes the most sense for you

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.619
And you'll be one of the first to have one. I'm doing this for you guys

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.730
I'm excited to see King of Random products in your home. Thanks for making this reality

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.730
