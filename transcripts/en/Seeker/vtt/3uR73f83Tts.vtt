00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.460
Did you know more Russians are down with getting
it on outside their marriages and terminating

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.459
pregnancies than being gay?

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:10.400
[MUSIC]

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.459
Hey this is Meg Turney from Sourcefed guest
hosting on DNews. We've all talked forever

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.430
it seems about all of the hilarious and sometimes
disgusting debacles taking place in Russian

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.210
hotels that are currently overshadowing the
Sochi Olympics, but let's go back to a time

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.340
before Olympic rings didn't transform and
bathroom doors refused to open. Back to when

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.339
Russia's biggest problem in the international
community was its controversial stance on

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:39.699
homosexual rights. Russia has what's been
labeled an anti-gay propaganda law, which

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.569
states that no one is allowed to show positive
or even neutral depictions of non-traditional

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:48.870
relationships anywhere a minor may see them.
Obviously, this makes it damn-near impossible

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.769
to hold protests, marches, or any other sort
of demonstrations in support of LGBTQ rights.

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.089
Many of those criticizing the law cite a rise
in anti-gay violence as a direct result of

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.989
the law's passage and it wasn't just a big
deal in Russia. Debbie Harry of Blondie fame

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.219
posted this rejection of an offer to perform
at the games on the basis of "human rights".

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:11.850
While much has been made of what some consider
Russia's archaic views on same-sex love, you

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.600
may find yourself asking "What do Russians
approve of?" I'm going to forego the obvious

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.170
vodka joke and just give you a look at what
Russia approves of more.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.649
First up - extramarital affairs. According
to a new Pew Research Center survey, a whopping

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.899
72% of Russians surveyed think it's unacceptable
to be gay, but only 69% disagree with cheating

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:37.030
in a marriage. 7% said they think it's perfectly
acceptable and to those people I say I hope

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.500
you have an open marriage or else my heart
weeps for those you're married to.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.780
Next up, gambling. While gambling is a multi-million
dollar industry here in the US, 62% of Russians

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.670
surveyed said no-no to rolling dice. 10% said
they think it's morally acceptable and I'd

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.780
like to introduce those people to Las Vegas.
Come spend your dirty gambling rubles here!

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.700
Another hot-button issue is abortion. In Russia,
44% disapprove of abortion. A gallup poll

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.789
taken in May of last year shows that 49% of
those surveyed in the US said they believe

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.850
it's morally wrong, so while our views on
homosexuality differ greatly, our nations

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.729
seem to be on the same page about terminating
pregnancies.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.820
Let's see if I can get through the next bit
without a vodka joke. According to the study,

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.490
44% of Russians say they disagree morally
with drinking alcohol, while 26% say they

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.220
think it's totally fine. Now interestingly
enough, a brand new study published in the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.580
Lancet last month found that 25% of Russian
men die before the age of 55, with most deaths

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.730
being attributable to alcohol and in particular,
vodka. No jokes! And in 2011, Russian adults

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.770
drank, on average, 13 liters of pure alcohol,
again mostly vodka, which is a lot of booze

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.620
for people who don't think it's morally cool.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.230
And finally, doin' the ding-ding without a
wedding ring. 30% of Russians said they believed

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.710
premarital sex is morally wrong, while 40%
gave it two thumbs up.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.710
So guys, what do you think of Russia's anti-LGBTQ
laws? Let us know in the comments down below.
