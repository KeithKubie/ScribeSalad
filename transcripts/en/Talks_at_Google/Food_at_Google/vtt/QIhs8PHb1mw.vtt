00:00:10.532 --> 00:00:12.240
FRAN COSTIGAN: So I
don't even need this.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.948
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:13.740
Hi, everyone.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.780
Welcome.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.170
I'm introducing
Chef Fran Costigan.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.390
She's going to be doing a
little talk and a little demo

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.090
on her book "Vegan Chocolate."

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.610
So sit back, relax.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.610
Don't spoil your lunch,
but have a piece of cake

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.460
if you already had lunch.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.858
I hope you enjoy,
but here she is.

00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:35.316
FRAN COSTIGAN:
Thank you very much.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.434
I'm really so
excited to be here.

00:00:41.434 --> 00:00:43.600
It's still winter in New
York, so that's one reason.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.140
But it's a pleasure to come and
meet you, and I do desserts.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.860
I changed my diet 22 years ago.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.450
I was working as a
traditional pastry chef,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.200
and I loved what I was doing.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.209
I loved the work, but my
allergies and stomach-- I

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:02.250
couldn't take it anymore.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.780
So I left.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.069
I went into rock
and roll management.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.209
That's a whole other story.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.970
And I changed my diet
without thinking vegan.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.550
You know I just said I read a
book called "Food and Healing"

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.080
by Anne-Marie Colbin.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.970
Said I'll give up
dairy, but I actually

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.240
gave up all animal foods.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.650
And I'm not the food police.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.930
I never say to people
how can you eat that?

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.690
And this is the right
way for everyone.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.460
Because it isn't.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.110
We're a bio individual.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.780
But for me-- and I do things
either black or white.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.570
That's the way I tend to
be-- it was a miracle.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.880
My allergies went away
except for yesterday

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.240
with all those purpley trees.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.030
They seemed to be
making eyes run.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.560
But no stomach
aches, great allergy.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.974
I don't have to think about my
weight ever-- pretty much ever.

00:01:42.974 --> 00:01:45.390
But I didn't want to do desserts
anymore, because I really

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.640
liked eating whole foods.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.380
So I'm not a junk food vegan.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.150
You know what I mean about that?

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.220
I eat plants.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.900
I eat real food.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.040
And then because it
was the very beginning,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.760
I had just started
eating this way,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.160
and I was so excited about
the way I felt. I did

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.530
get a little bit obnoxious,
a little bit food policie.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.030
And my son, who was
about 12 at the time,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.680
said you're not putting a
candle in a sweet potato

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.630
and telling me that's
my birthday cake.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.290
Get back to making cakes.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.110
So I went into the
marketplace 22 years ago.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.010
It's not what it
is today at all.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.880
I mean, everything tasted
dry or gummy to me.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.915
And the recipe books-- and I had
gone through culinary school.

00:02:25.915 --> 00:02:27.110
It didn't make any sense.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.600
You used a cup of barley malt,
or a cup of sugar, or whatever.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.830
Didn't make sense.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.570
Nothing tasted good.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.070
And the biggest insult was
someone handing me a cake,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.842
not as pretty as this,
but it was brown.

00:02:38.842 --> 00:02:40.300
And it didn't taste
like chocolate.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.300
They were like, oh here.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.730
You can have chocolate
cake, but it was carob.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.850
So they're both brown.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.240
That's about it.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.920
I said, well, that's it.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.340
Michael's not having
a baked sweet potato.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.750
I don't want carob cakes.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.385
There's nothing wrong with
carob, but it's not chocolate.

00:02:55.385 --> 00:02:57.510
I went in, and I said I
went into the test kitchen.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.200
I said if I can get a cake
that was as good as if not

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.330
better than a good version
of a conventional dessert,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.040
then I'd be good.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.660
And I say that because not every
conventional dessert you eat

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.794
is good, right?

00:03:11.794 --> 00:03:13.710
But there were a lot of
bad vegan cakes there.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.170
Today, I'm happy to say--

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.410
So this was my original--
a tweaked version

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.080
of my original cake,
the chocolate cake

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.620
to live for which one of
my testers, a non vegan,

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.370
went, oh my god.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.990
This is a cake worth living for.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.480
And it's stuck in a couple
of different incarnations.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.300
Anybody here familiar with Rip
Esselstyn or the Engine 2 Diet?

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.630
Dr Esselstyn is Bill
Clinton's diet doctor

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.050
and reversed his heart disease.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.620
So his son Rip
has Engine 2 Diet.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.100
That was his wedding cake.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.452
So I've been making it and,
today what I've learned-- I

00:03:45.452 --> 00:03:47.410
didn't know any vegans
then, so I didn't really

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.350
know I was vegan.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.930
I guess maybe I was macrobiotic.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.190
But if you're allergic
to dairy, eggs,

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.810
don't want to use
white sugar, then

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.140
for me, this isn't about
what's not in the food.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.410
It's that everybody
can be served.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.260
So generally speaking,
I want to tell you

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.072
that Kathleen made the cakes,
and it's really gorgeous.

00:04:11.072 --> 00:04:13.030
I asked her how'd you
get the glaze so perfect?

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.821
Because mine isn't.

00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:16.350
Usually, I have to do
this Picasso effect, which

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.810
I'm going to do to show you.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.700
The glaze was made
with almond milk.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.250
And there's soy
milk in the cake.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.540
Now, when I'm doing
something for a group

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.190
and I can't poll
people about allergies,

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.320
I just assume allergies
in today's world.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.824
So I generally just
think there are

00:04:33.824 --> 00:04:35.990
going to be people who avoid
soy and there are going

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.050
to be people who avoid nuts.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.210
And I have found "So Delicious"
brand coconut milk beverage,

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.290
which is different from
canned coconut milk

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.730
but it's really just a plant
milk like almond milk, soy

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:48.750
milk, and so on.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.660
Works great.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.570
So you can make the same glaze
using coconut milk beverage.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.970
In my book, I have
a recipe for making

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.140
a ganache with canned
coconut milk and so on.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.100
So some of you probably
know things like this,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.450
but I'm used to teaching.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.220
I teach in New York City.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.570
I teach everywhere
at this point.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.310
I've seen vegan or dairy
free really explode.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.080
And so I'm going to just say
things from the beginning

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.890
that you may already know.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.670
Ganache is an emulsion,
typically of heavy cream

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.070
and chocolate in varying
percentages depending

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.900
on will it be a
glaze for a cake,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.100
will it be the
center for a truffle?

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.020
I'm going to show you some.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.127
I like to toast a really
delicious, crispy crostini.

00:05:40.127 --> 00:05:41.210
You know, make a crostini?

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.650
I toast a baguette, spread
it with some olive oil,

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.990
and then smear it with
some thickened ganache,

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.420
and finish it with olive oil
and salt, and you have ganache.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.440
It's chocolate milk
over ice cream.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.230
To me, it's just
indispensable, and you

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.740
can keep it in your
refrigerator for at least a week

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.600
and in your freezer.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.020
When you've made it ahead--
when I often make this ahead,

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.300
and it will look like this.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.990
It will look like this,
which isn't so attractive,

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.360
but it will look like this.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.400
Or this is better.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.350
Like this.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.040
And then this is the way it was
when I got here this morning.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.130
And all I did was
make a water bath.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.840
I don't use a double boiler.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.300
I don't bother with that.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.540
Just a saucepan with a
little bit of water in it.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.856
You don't want
the bowl to touch,

00:06:37.856 --> 00:06:39.230
and you don't want
steam, and you

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.595
don't want just a little
bit of steam or water

00:06:41.595 --> 00:06:42.980
to touch chocolate.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.300
When it does, anybody
have this happen?

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.600
I see heads nodding.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.280
It seizes.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.180
It gets gray.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.440
It gets hard like pebbles.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.290
And if it can be fixed-- maybe.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.610
So you don't want to go there.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.980
So just with some patience,
very slowly, you do this.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.010
So it can be made ahead.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.450
What you need is
a measured amount

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.110
of chocolate chopped very
finely in a heat proof bowl.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.080
So the basic recipe
for enough glaze

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.440
to do a nine inch cake
with two coatings of glaze

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.240
is eight ounces of chocolate.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.490
The right chocolate
to use is the one

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.930
that tastes good to you.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.480
And I know from doing
chocolate tastings

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.670
with a lot of food bloggers,
and civilians, and so on we

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.260
all have individual taste buds.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.150
So over here, these
two people-- it's

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.570
called the Food
Duo in New York--

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.970
said that chocolate
is so sour and tannic,

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.550
and other people
liked it and so on.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:39.340
So it's up to you.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.320
You have to do a
little homework.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.829
If you want to work
with chocolate,

00:07:41.829 --> 00:07:43.370
find the one that
tastes good to you.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:50.080
But what isn't up to you if you
want the result to be positive,

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.310
successful, is that
you have to stay

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.710
within the percentage
of chocolate that's

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.710
listed in the recipe.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:08:03.580
So I typically say 70
to 72% chocolate is my,

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.150
let's say, go-to to chocolate.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.850
That works for most everything.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:13.750
This glaze was made with
70% [? chow ?], right?

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:14.390
Yeah.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:17.550
So it's a little bit-- it
might be a little bit softer.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:22.210
So what happened here was I
don't think the sugar ever got

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:22.710
in here.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.360
You bring whatever
plant milk you're

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.600
using, which would be almond
or coconut milk beverage

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.320
are my favorite.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.650
Or if the recipe calls
for canned coconut milk--

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.146
to a boil.

00:08:35.146 --> 00:08:39.815
It would be good to give it
a little stir, so I will.

00:08:39.815 --> 00:08:41.690
So I knew that I would
have all the equipment

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.980
I needed here because
of the chefs were great.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.870
But I travel teach a
lot, so I bring things

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:53.450
like my little baby measuring
cup and my little tiny whisk.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.520
So you pour.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.640
What's important is
the milk, the sugar,

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.064
and the pinch of salt
has come to a boil.

00:09:01.064 --> 00:09:01.730
You pour it out.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.240
You saw that I poured it over
the chocolate all at once.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.730
If you just drizzle it
in, you're in trouble.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.000
So you have to pour
it in all at once.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.790
What I normally do, and I didn't
do, is not very scientific.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.370
But I take a spoon, and
I put some of the milk.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.610
I bring the milk to a boil.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:24.800
A lot of other pastry
chefs, particularly vegan,

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.930
will tell you don't bring
the plant milk to a boil.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.160
But I think it gives
a better result.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.270
And then without picking
it up-- because I

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.190
have chocolate all over
me all the time anyway--

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.860
is just swirl it.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.430
And now we're going to
pretend that this is

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.600
covered for about four minutes.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.060
And people say, ugh.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.021
Your recipes are so long.

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:50.020
That means they're hard.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:50.720
They're not.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.740
They are long, but I
say go in the kitchen,

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.285
turn on the lights, set the
rack in the right place,

00:09:57.285 --> 00:09:59.610
turn on the oven thermometer.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:00.560
A lot of detail.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.670
The batter will be thin.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.010
Don't worry about it.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.920
Cover the chocolate.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.310
So that's why they're long.

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:07.700
You give it a swirl.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:08.780
I didn't trickle it in.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.980
And I have found that by
letting the chocolate melt

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.280
into the hot liquid for about
four minutes really makes

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.470
a difference in the mouth feel.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.520
You want something that's silky.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:26.340
I would rather have it not
melt 100% than be too hot.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.390
And I'll tell you what
happens if it's too hot.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.670
If it doesn't melt, part of
my mise en place-- and that

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.300
just means getting
everything together

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.360
that you need-- if nuts need
to be roasted and cooled,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.020
it's done.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.400
Because you can't
always grind hot nuts.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.810
It's great for nut butter
but not for nut flour,

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.840
and things like that.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.250
Get them together.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:47.780
So I have a saucepan.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.127
You see how little
water is in here?

00:10:51.127 --> 00:10:53.210
So it's always on the back
of the stove somewhere.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.190
And if it didn't
melt altogether,

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.880
just put it over here.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.220
Count to-- I usually
say sing happy birthday,

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.020
and you're done.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.780
And now I'm going to
add a pinch of salt.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.240
That's another thing I hear.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.080
People seem to be
afraid to eat nowadays.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.410
I heard that was
really bad for you.

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.751
I heard this was good for you.

00:11:12.751 --> 00:11:13.250
This is bad.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.360
That's good.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.620
I don't know.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:21.900
I think if we clean food,
that works for what we like,

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.230
if something is said to be a
super food or really fabulous

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.740
and you really don't like
it, your body is probably

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.500
saying it's not for you.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.890
I haven't met anyone who doesn't
like chocolate yet though.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.500
And I say chocolate is
a bean, and I eat beans,

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.800
but it's not a salad.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.220
So get your healthy from
eating other things,

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.830
and then save room for this.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.060
So I am stirring from
the center out, whisking.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.480
Why from the center out?

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.630
I can only say that when
I was in culinary school,

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.740
my chef said serve ganache
from the center out.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:55.400
Once it's smooth-- and
you can see that it is.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:59.490
Can you see that it is?--
you really have to stop.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.070
Two things can happen.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.320
A few things can happen.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.400
If the plant milk or any
liquid, because I have-- anybody

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.180
here like tahini?

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.360
I have an orange
juice tahini truffle

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.030
in this book that is so good.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.620
It's just delicious.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.490
So there is a case where
it's not a plant milk.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.830
It's a different liquid.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.560
But if the liquid is too
hot, what would have happened

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.160
is I'd be stirring,
and I have this

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.650
really lovely-- it's glossy.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:29.990
It's lovely.

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:33.810
And all of sudden, just like
an oil slick on the top.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.740
And it starts dancing around.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.760
And what that is
was that the liquid

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.750
was so hot it was too
hot for the chocolate.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.880
So the cocoa butter separated.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.140
Now, cocoa butter isn't dairy.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.820
It's the fat in chocolate.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.670
It's the white fat.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.480
And the other thing
that might happen

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.080
is if I just keep whisking
really vigorously.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.880
Then it can get gritty.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.300
So that's it.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.770
I mean, I'm telling you that
this is a very easy recipe.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.530
And it's very
variable, depending

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.540
on the kind of chocolate that
you use, the proportions.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.960
You can make truffles with this.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.340
You can do tons of stuff.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.097
I added the salt, didn't I?

00:13:14.097 --> 00:13:15.430
Because I feel it on my fingers.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.750
Thank you.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.750
I always need people in
the front to help me out

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:18.670
when I'm talking.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.920
I don't always remember.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:27.160
The next thing that I do
is I say to my students

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.200
when they leave, they're
like, oh I don't know.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.680
We learned a lot of recipes
in vegan baking boot camp,

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.570
but the one thing I
remember is did you test?

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:35.640
Did you test?

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.130
And they say, well,
it tasted good.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.470
Well, that's a taste test.

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:44.000
But a test is that
looks OK, but is it OK?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.570
I don't know.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.470
And I don't want to wait until
it's time to glaze the cake.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.240
Company's coming.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.740
Or I'm short on time, and I
have to run out for something.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.510
I don't want to wait
until the last minute

00:13:55.510 --> 00:14:00.100
to find out that this ganache
is too thick or too thin.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.210
If it's too thick, I'll just
whisk in a little at a time,

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.930
stir in a little bit
more of the liquid.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:11.960
If it's too thin, I'll melt
some chocolate and whisk it in.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.960
So all you need to do--

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.400
I mean, sometimes I do it in
a little pinch cup, sometimes,

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.220
literally I'll take the whisk
and go like this on a plate.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.430
Five minutes in a cold
refrigerator, and you

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:25.300
go like this.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.970
What'll happen in
a few minutes--

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:30.260
and I'll show you-- is it
will look like it's set,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.760
but you need to taste it.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.110
Because is it creamy?

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.340
Is it too firm?

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.050
A lot depends on what you want.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:41.340
Now, truthfully, I used a
little bit less milk in here

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.907
this time because I wanted
it to set up more quickly.

00:14:44.907 --> 00:14:45.990
So we'll see what happens.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.950
This isn't going
to set this way.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.830
Anybody have any questions?

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.480
The only time I can
answer questions

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.430
is when I'm measuring.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:54.610
It's impossible for me.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.910
But other than that, any
questions about this?

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:04.060
Anybody here not like what's
called dark chocolate?

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:10.070
So I would say that the most
surprising fact that I learned

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.360
when I was researching "Vegan
Chocolate," which wasn't

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.740
my choice for a
title by the way,

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:20.070
but it just showed me how
the world's gone round.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.840
I used to have to defend.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:22.610
No, try it.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:23.520
It's OK.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.091
He Don't worry just
because it's vegan.

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:27.840
But now they wanted
to vegan in the title.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.140
But also the tagline
says dairy free

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.140
because there are
people who walk by vegan

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.690
but really need
to be dairy free.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.730
Almost everyone's lactose
intolerant, almost every adult

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.520
really if you do
a little research.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:45.190
So what I learned was in
the United States up to 12%

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:48.680
milk or milk solids is
allowable in chocolate

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.800
that is non-milk chocolate,
that's labeled dark chocolate.

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.170
And you see it more in the less
expensive brands, not so much

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.730
in the premium brands.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:58.660
It's definitely disclosed.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:03.390
It will say cacao mass,
or unsweetened chocolate.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.670
Those are interchangeable.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:07.530
If you're using
organic sugar, it'll

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:11.480
say evaporated cane juice or
organic sugar or whatever.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.310
Maybe some lecithin
and vanilla, and then

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.860
milk-- the words for milk.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:21.650
And I was so curious about that
because I used to say-- not

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:23.890
exactly roll my eyes,
but when someone asked me

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:25.750
how do you know if
the chocolate's vegan,

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.070
I'm going to think, well,
if it's not milk chocolate,

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.110
I suppose it's
vegan unless you're

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:33.807
that really ethical vegan that
will only use vegan sugar.

00:16:33.807 --> 00:16:35.140
Do you know what vegan sugar is?

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.040
So it's not filtered
through bone char.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.670
And vegans used to like beet
sugar for that reason, years

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.340
before we had all these
choices, because that is never

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.050
filtered through bone char.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.890
But because beets
are almost 100%

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.910
genetically modified
crop today, we

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.360
don't like beet sugar anymore.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.290
So it's interesting.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:59.370
I was doing a chocolate
dessert demo in Paris.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.342
I got invited to
Paris Vegan Days.

00:17:02.342 --> 00:17:04.800
And I was thinking, well, I'm
not going to turn Paris down.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.466
That's for sure.

00:17:05.466 --> 00:17:08.280
But that's an oxymoron
if I ever heard one.

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.660
And 10,000 people
came from all over.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:11.520
Really.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.510
There's a London veg fest now
and all this kind of stuff.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:19.530
So I try to tell the same
story about the beets and GMO,

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.250
and the translator
pokes me and she

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.410
says not here, not in Europe.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:24.619
We don't do GMO.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:26.780
We don't buy your
foods and so on.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.820
So there you go.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.350
So the other ingredient
that belongs in here

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.050
is a little bit of oil.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.400
It's optional.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.550
It's about two
teaspoons per recipe.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:44.460
But I feel that you
get the nicest feel,

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.888
the silkiest texture, and so on.

00:17:46.888 --> 00:17:48.471
So we'll put that
aside, and I'm going

00:17:48.471 --> 00:17:51.900
to use Kathleen's
glaze for this cake.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.566
And I'm going to put gloves
on because I will get messy.

00:17:55.566 --> 00:17:57.690
And then this is going to
get popped in the fridge.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.230
What I like to do
is glaze it once,

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:05.750
let it set a little bit just
until it's not wet anymore,

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.490
and then glaze it a second time.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.710
And that is the right
amount of chocolate to use.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.340
I'm not very good
at cake decorating,

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.760
which is why I do what I'm
going to show you-- my Picasso

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.260
effect.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.090
I tasted this.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.480
It's delicious.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.610
And it was as solid as
what I showed you earlier

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.450
when we got here.

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.390
So sometimes I just pour
it right out of here,

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:34.280
but that would be exceedingly
messy and I'm trying not to be.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:41.630
So you could say that this is
perhaps a little bit thinner

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:45.920
than I might want it to be.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.760
And you just go like this.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.480
Sometimes, I do the cakes.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.880
So you definitely want to
do it over parchment paper.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.824
And then if you get the
paper cold, you know,

00:18:54.824 --> 00:18:56.240
let it set up in
the fridge again,

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.409
you can reclaim this chocolate.

00:18:59.409 --> 00:19:00.950
So I'm going to do
this, and then I'm

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:05.154
going to do the second glazing.

00:19:05.154 --> 00:19:06.820
See why I don't I
wear a white chef coat

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.990
when I'm doing chocolate?

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.780
For obvious reasons.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:16.610
Now, the recipe is for
a single layer cake.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:19.662
But you just double the recipe
and you have a double layer

00:19:19.662 --> 00:19:20.162
cake.

00:19:22.745 --> 00:19:24.370
Well, I'm going to
put it right on here

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.828
because we were
doing that earlier.

00:19:25.828 --> 00:19:29.220
So this can go in the
fridge if you wouldn't mind.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.260
I'm going to get rid of these.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:36.780
And now I want to
make-- let this set up.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.910
So what you remember
is OK it's too firm.

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:41.970
I made it ahead.

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.060
I'm going to put it over a water
bath and let it get pourable.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:52.070
But wait until it's
perhaps more like this.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:56.950
And this will also be creamy
like a butter cream that

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.640
isn't a butter cream.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:03.460
I never used to use the
word high speed blender

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.600
in any of my talks because
I didn't have the heart

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.750
to tell people that they
needed something so expensive.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.730
And then I got one.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.420
And it really is a game changer.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.560
If you like being in the
kitchen-- and I mean,

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:22.175
I use my high speed
blender many times a day.

00:20:22.175 --> 00:20:30.310
And what I have here is five
ounces of raw whole cashews

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.220
unsalted-- they're raw--
that have been soaked.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.010
So you soak them for
four hours to overnight,

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.660
even if you're using
a high speed blender.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.900
They can go overnight.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.250
They could probably go two days,
but after that nothing happens,

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.050
especially if you
change the water.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.980
I think you lose
some of the flavor.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.250
If you want to make a
nut cream-- or this can

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.680
be a base for an ice
cream or many things--

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.480
we're going to serve
it you can taste it,

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:59.580
and you didn't remember to
soak the nuts, hot soak them.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.900
Bring some water to a boil.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.260
Put them in the boiling
water for just a few minutes,

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.270
drain them, and
they're ready to go.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.720
Now, cashew cream has become
this like wow ingredient

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.160
in vegan non-dairy
desserts because it can

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.040
be used to do so many things.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:18.550
So some of the savory chef say
but if you had soaked them,

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.990
they'll be a little sweet.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.820
I don't care.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.970
We're doing sweet.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.428
So what I have in here, I'm
just going to get this started.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.140
And then you get one.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:36.440
What goes in here is-- I could
look at the recipe, couldn't I?

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.500
But I know it by heart.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.030
Remember, that's fighting words.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:40.980
That's dangerous.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.650
Oh, I knew it by heart.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.070
No, I really do know it.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:47.104
So this one I do.

00:21:47.104 --> 00:21:48.270
Cake, I'm going to show you.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.480
I'm going to show
you how I measure.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:56.500
So it's one cup of canned,
full fat coconut milk,

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.580
any brand that you like.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:03.320
I never buy light
coconut milk in a can.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.070
I spend a lot of money
on good ingredients

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.072
because you taste it.

00:22:07.072 --> 00:22:09.030
What you put in, you're
going to get out of it.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:12.220
If all you're going to taste
is the chocolate in the glaze,

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.190
you need to use a
chocolate that tastes good.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:17.270
But I'm not paying for water.

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:21.720
So if I want light coconut
milk, I mix it with water.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:28.220
So here this is very unusual
to have the coconut milk be

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.120
so solid all the way through.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.090
Have any of you made the
coconut whipped cream

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:36.172
where you put the can of
coconut milk in the fridge

00:22:36.172 --> 00:22:37.630
and then it's
supposed to separate?

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:39.500
Does yours always separate?

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:40.129
No, right?

00:22:40.129 --> 00:22:41.670
Because they're
putting more and more

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.060
guar gum in the coconut milk.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.090
So people like
coconut whipped cream,

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:51.670
which is when you take the
fat off here and mix it

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.340
in a stand mixer.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:59.230
But I always chill the
can for at least 24 hours,

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:03.880
usually more, and I always have
an extra can because you just

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.646
never know.

00:23:04.646 --> 00:23:07.020
There are some brands that
seem to be better than others.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:12.975
That was a pinch of salt.
And now this and the ganache

00:23:12.975 --> 00:23:16.580
are pretty much the only recipes
I have committed to memory.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:21.250
My daughter-in-law wants me to--
Yeah, but if you have it there,

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:21.960
I wouldn't mind.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.950
Six tablespoons of sugar.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.010
So I am very bad at math.

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.590
My daughter's a statistician,
but I can't do math.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.320
But I had to learn
some kitchen math,

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:35.090
so I know a quarter of a
cup is four tablespoons.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:39.230
And a third of a cup is five
tablespoons and a teaspoon.

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:43.300
So when I'm baking,
when I'm doing desserts,

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:44.520
I really am precise.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.690
I'm going to show you the
way that I measure for cakes.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:52.630
Because the difference between
this is pretty good and great

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:55.530
can be a teaspoon,
or two teaspoons,

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:57.840
or the oven temperature
being wrong, and so on.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.990
And it's a tablespoon of oil.

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:03.780
So my oil of choice--
in my earlier book,

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:05.230
I used canola oil.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:08.870
Because remember,
I don't use butter.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.290
And I don't use margarine,
because I consider that

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.960
an inferior product.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.390
I mean, I would use butter
before I'd use margarine.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:22.090
Now, I know a lot of people like
the Earth Balance margarines,

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:25.560
but I also don't use palm oil
because of the orangutans.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.620
But I will tell you this.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.750
Miyoko Schinner, who's a
friend and colleague of mine,

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.300
is coming out.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:35.490
Her new book is
launching in June,

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:37.310
and it's called "Vegan Pantry."

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.890
And I stayed with her.

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:42.090
I was at San Bruno Google.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:43.790
And I stayed with
Miyoko, who's nearby,

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.530
and I tasted her butter.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.554
She also has vegan cheeses
that are unbelievable.

00:24:48.554 --> 00:24:49.470
And you can make them.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:52.100
If you have a blender,
you can make butter.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.870
So pretty much that's it
except for the vanilla, right?

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:56.500
Right.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.430
So before I turn this on,
because I can't talk over i,

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:04.980
what you're going
to have is this.

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.190
We made this earlier.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:13.070
The full recipe
calls for grinding

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:16.130
the nuts, and the coconut
milk, and the pinch of salt,

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:18.920
and the vanilla, and so
on-- not the vanilla--

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.730
until this is very
warm, and then adding

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:29.310
a little bit of agar powder--
agar is vegetable jello.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:32.720
Agar, agar-- the powder
until it actually boils,

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.300
and a little bit of guar gum.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.100
And then it becomes
quite thick so

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.950
that this becomes
a pastry cream.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.700
If you want to do a
fruit tart, but you

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.830
don't want to use a dairy cream,
creme anglaise or something

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.320
like that, it's really
gorgeous that way.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.235
But as a sauce, you just can
leave the guar and the agar

00:25:54.235 --> 00:25:55.140
out.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.270
So this takes
pretty much no time

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:09.178
assuming I can get this-- This
a different kind of a Vitamix

00:26:09.178 --> 00:26:11.610
from what I'm used to.

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:16.340
Yeah, I'll use-- I've learned
my lesson about putting

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.180
this in with the-- you know?

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:19.680
OK.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.080
And it could be because
I didn't really measure,

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.450
which I never don't measure.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.080
I just really relaxed today.

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:30.590
I think don't want to go home.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.872
I like it here.

00:26:32.872 --> 00:26:34.330
I like it here.

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:34.830
All right.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:35.940
Like this.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.530
I've learn two things about
using the high speed blenders.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:44.320
And one is make sure
that the top is on here.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.910
Must go this way.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.580
Yeah, I've seen most of them,
but not this particular kind.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:52.660
And then if I need to thin it,
I'll know by tasting and so on.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:59.400
And then vanilla
or vanilla bean.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.182
I put some vanilla
bean in because I

00:27:01.182 --> 00:27:02.390
have all these vanilla beans.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:12.380
And you know, one of
the really nice things

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:17.070
about vegan desserts too
is that you can taste away.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.930
And you should taste,
because you don't

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:20.440
have to worry about salmonella.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:26.134
There is no egg
situation here, right?

00:27:26.134 --> 00:27:27.050
So you can just taste.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.922
This isn't quite as
smooth as I'd like it.

00:27:29.922 --> 00:27:31.630
So I'm going to put
a little bit of water

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.895
in and a little bit of
vanilla, and we're good to go.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:40.200
Then I want to show
you how I measure.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.490
And then you want cake?

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:45.219
We could start passing
the cakes around.

00:27:45.219 --> 00:27:47.260
I don't usually do that
till I'm finished talking

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.301
because I lose everybody.

00:27:48.301 --> 00:27:52.420
But I really am eager for
you to taste that cake.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:56.490
Taste the cake because
that's where the proof is.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:59.900
And is there anybody here
who can't have cashews?

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.650
Right, OK.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:07.350
So we'll get the cakes served.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.350
Ah-hah.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.080
It's counter-intuitive.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.330
The button goes down, not up.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:27.771
There you go.

00:28:27.771 --> 00:28:28.270
All right.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:29.431
That looks much better.

00:28:29.431 --> 00:28:29.930
You see?

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:33.400
So it's not as people say how
do you know when it's done?

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.240
When it's done.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:38.110
Sometimes, baking the cake
should every risen, come away

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.810
from the sides, pulled
away from the sides,

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:44.460
and this wooden skewer inserted
in the center and pulled out

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.450
should be almost dry.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.880
And if that's your only test,
the cake can be overdone.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.680
So you start using
all of your senses.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:29:00.080
I want to show you what I
do when the glaze is not

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:05.690
so perfect as Kathleen got the
glaze, which is pretty much all

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:06.720
the time for me.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.660
For some reason, I
haven't mastered glaze.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.310
But I do this.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:15.520
And then I'm going to hit it
with a little gold luster dust.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.420
And it looks like $1 million.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.150
And your friends really think
that you worked extra long

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.650
on it.

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:23.150
What's that?

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:24.560
The gold luster dust?

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.424
Any cake shop-- any cake shop.

00:29:29.424 --> 00:29:30.750
There you go.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.470
So I do this pretty often.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:34.660
And let's just see.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.670
We've got so much
ganache that we

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:40.700
can have a little ganache on the
side so you can taste it also.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:44.140
And here's the gold luster dust.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.380
There we go.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.638
Does anybody have any questions?

00:29:47.638 --> 00:29:48.138
No?

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:56.840
That's a great question
because it depends.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.370
When I'm doing just eight
ounces of chocolate,

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:02.330
or even 16, or
just in the mood--

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:06.870
it's like my relaxation-- then
on a very dry cutting board,

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:09.480
always with chocolate,
dry, dry, dry--

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.970
and I like a flex
board for chocolate

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:15.380
because it can go like that.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:20.160
And I have either a
heavy knife like this

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:25.830
but from the corner of the
bar, and just keep going.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:30.670
I happen to have a serrated
knife that isn't flexible

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:32.020
that I like.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.960
If you're doing
quantity, what I'll do

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.470
is I'll chop 10 pounds
of chocolate at one time

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.015
and weigh it.

00:30:39.015 --> 00:30:45.390
I really recommend those
little electronic scales

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.870
that cost pretty much nothing.

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:53.710
But they're really amazing
for weighing things.

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:57.370
Then I will chunk the chocolate
and put it in a dry food

00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:59.700
processor, not too
much at a time,

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.070
and run it until
it's finely chopped.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.730
Finely chopping your chocolate
really makes a difference.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:10.840
Letting it relax, melt
slowly into the milk as well

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.087
really makes a difference.

00:31:12.087 --> 00:31:13.920
If you're tempering
chocolate-- anybody here

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.760
interested in
tempering chocolate?

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.850
It's that shiny thing?

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.860
Well, nobody that I know,
not one single pastry chef I

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.880
know pretty much-- I
shouldn't say that.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.890
Never say never.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:24.960
People aren't really
tempering the old way,

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.310
which meant bringing
it up to temperature

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:31.590
and then smearing it on
a marble board and so on.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:32.570
We seed temper.

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:36.380
So you guys can do
the math for me.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:40.780
If you have x you
want to melt, 70%

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.910
of the chocolate
that you're melting,

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:46.930
and then hold out 25%
in a chunk or in chunks.

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:48.480
Those are the seeds.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.180
And then bring it in
and let it stir again.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:55.400
And that will take care
of keeping the chocolate

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.943
shiny for example.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.390
But another workaround
is to just keep

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.980
things that are glazed
with that kind of chocolate

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:08.770
in the freezer really
tightly covered.

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:10.410
And that works.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:13.630
So this, for
example, is the cake

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:17.020
that you're tasting
but sort of tarted up.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.490
So it's a double layer cake.

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:23.730
It's a sachertorte with apricot
in the center and this cream

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:26.390
that you're having but
thicker-- by the way,

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:29.420
I love being in this Lebowski
room, because when I came in,

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.650
I'm like what?

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:34.940
There are vegan white
Russians in this book.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.860
And yeah, in the
day, people used

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.560
to say-- I would hear
them behind me saying,

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.810
we're not sure about Costigan.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:43.226
We don't really
think she's vegan.

00:32:43.226 --> 00:32:44.590
She drinks wine.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:46.400
She wears lipstick.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.880
Nobody really does
things like that anymore.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.790
But my son-in-law,
who is a great--

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:55.460
that film is the film
of all time, I think,

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.685
heard me talking about it.

00:32:56.685 --> 00:32:58.270
And he said, oh my god.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.540
How do you know about that?

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.220
And I'm like, really?

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:01.920
Give me a break.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:06.210
You can make vegan
ice creams using

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:09.490
cashew cream base,
avocado base, or just

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:12.050
a plant milk base in the book.

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:12.990
And I don't know.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:16.040
Do you know the
black bottom kind

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.440
of ice cream shell
that gets hard?

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.946
So there's a two
ingredient recipe

00:33:21.946 --> 00:33:23.320
in here for that
ice cream sauce.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.287
So I have ice creams.

00:33:24.287 --> 00:33:25.120
I have creme brulee.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.940
I have pies.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.110
People say, how do
you get your ideas?

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:31.590
It's the things
that I like eating

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:35.400
and where I won't have to
use junkie, junkie stuff.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.060
Because I won't use junk.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:40.940
This is an opera cake
with a similar glaze

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.520
but made with a little bit
of agar to give it body.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:48.380
And once you learn a
couple of the techniques--

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:52.090
so essentially that's
what I did today.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:52.700
It was this.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.810
But I just want to
show you the truffle.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:56.800
I like to enroll truffles.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:57.760
Just roll them.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:02.090
This is the sesame truffle for
the person who liked tahini.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.830
I just learned that
sesames are really high

00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:10.510
up on the allergy alert scale.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:13.276
And I wonder about all
these allergies now.

00:34:13.276 --> 00:34:14.650
I certainly don't
make fun of it,

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:17.190
because I know that it's true.

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:20.280
But it wasn't true
back in the day,

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.120
and I'm clear that we just
broke the food system.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.000
We're just doing things
to food that we shouldn't.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.120
These are truffles made with
exactly what I did here,

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:36.320
but I infused the liquid with
spices and then strained it.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.320
So you can do that-- curry,
or I really love ginger.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.860
My new favorite
thing is turmeric.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.900
Has that hit here?

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:45.820
Turmeric.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.850
Fresh turmeric root.

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.080
So everything that I touch,
everything in my kitchen

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.380
is now orange because I haven't
figured out how to get it out.

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.260
So these are cashew
cream truffles,

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.700
but any truffle can be enrolled.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:02.630
And this chocolate
was seed tempered.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:07.200
But when I don't have time, I
put this, I said, in the book.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.135
I said, well, you know,
sometimes they crack,

00:35:09.135 --> 00:35:13.070
or I don't really even
feel like seed tempering.

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.250
I do the hybrid method.

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:17.210
So I dipped the truffles in
chocolate, let them get set up,

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:19.390
and then roll them a
little bit in a little bit

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:21.715
of dusting of cocoa powder.

00:35:21.715 --> 00:35:22.840
And then you're good to go.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.450
Nobody knows that
maybe it's not perfect.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:27.280
The last thing I
want to show you--

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.380
and then I want to invite
everybody up to get some cake.

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.907
We've got berries
there and the cream.

00:35:32.907 --> 00:35:33.990
And I'm going to cut this.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:35.870
This is how I measure.

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:41.510
So if you go to my
YouTube channel,

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:45.770
I have a cookbook trailer in
English and in German now.

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:49.490
The person who dubbed my voice
in German sounds very stern.

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:51.560
And one of my
German-sounding friends

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.650
said I don't think that's
going to sell any books.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:56.020
But anyway, that's
what happened.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.450
I choose my battles.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.972
I'm not I'm not
fighting over it.

00:36:00.972 --> 00:36:02.270
So who bakes here?

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:03.701
Anybody bake?

00:36:03.701 --> 00:36:04.200
Yay.

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:06.240
Great.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:11.010
So some recipes say spoon
the flour into the cop,

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.350
and my recipes say
quite the opposite.

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:16.600
Did you just see me whisk?

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.670
So I aerate all of
my dry ingredients--

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:21.590
flour, sugar cocoa powder.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:25.000
My book is in metric
as well as weights,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.820
and I know metric is-- I
mean [INAUDIBLE] is cups.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:31.420
I know metric is supposed
to be exact, but we found--

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.060
I had a bunch of
interns with scales--

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.400
and we found it wasn't.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.410
How fine is the
sugar, and how long

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:39.870
has the flour been sitting?

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.260
So I whisk
everything, and then I

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.600
do what I call whisk,
dip, and sweep.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:54.650
So I whisk, overfill, and with
a flat edge just go like this.

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:56.980
And then this goes.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:00.640
I don't have a sifter-sifter,
but I absolutely recommend

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.510
sifting as part of the process.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:07.760
So we're going to pretend that
this is all purpose flour,

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.260
whole wheat pastry flour.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:11.570
Whole wheat pastry flour is
different from whole wheat

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:12.720
flour.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.120
It's softer.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.250
Cocoa powder.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:19.400
And you need to know is
the cocoa powder alkalized,

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.840
or Dutch process, or natural?

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.980
The recipe should tell you.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.490
They don't always.

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:29.850
One way to find out is if the
leavening is just baking soda,

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:35.770
you can be pretty sure that
it's natural cocoa powder.

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:39.550
And if it's baking soda,
baking powder, then it's

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.360
Dutch process or alkalized.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.420
And then so everything's
in here now, right?

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.180
All of the dry ingredients?

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:49.030
And I whisk it, strain it.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:52.579
I call it sifting into the bowl.

00:37:52.579 --> 00:37:54.370
If you don't have whole
wheat pastry flour,

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:58.170
you can just add up the amount
of flour and use all AP.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:02.340
And then the last step with all
these ingredients is to whisk.

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:06.230
And then all the liquid
ingredients in another bowl.

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:08.870
And I just don't
combine them until I

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.970
know that the oven rack is
in the right place, which

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:15.780
for a standard oven would be
the center, that the cake pan is

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.470
greased, oiled, and a piece
of parchment on the bottom.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:21.080
And don't flip the
parchment over,

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:25.197
and don't use flour
unless the recipe

00:38:25.197 --> 00:38:27.530
writer is telling you to do
it, but not with my recipes.

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:29.420
I find it doesn't work.

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.240
And then you're good to go,
and then put it in the oven.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:35.120
So if you don't have time,
it's like the phone rang

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:38.280
or something, just don't
combine your batter.

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:42.460
I do recommend everybody has an
oven thermometer in their oven

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.490
because they vary
like crazy, right?

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:50.440
I had a brand new oven,
and I set it to 350.

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.380
And I looked at
it, and it was 425.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:57.661
So my cake would have been
not very good, not very good

00:38:57.661 --> 00:38:58.160
at all.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:58.940
And here you go.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.730
You did a gorgeous job.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:07.980
Now, I would never serve
a piece of cake this big,

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:09.570
but I'm just
feeling like it now.

00:39:12.731 --> 00:39:13.230
Yeah.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:20.887
So nobody asked me
about replacing eggs.

00:39:20.887 --> 00:39:22.220
So are you all just hip to that?

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:31.160
So I have never used
commercial egg replacer.

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:34.710
What I think is
that in the day--

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:40.565
because I started 22 years ago--
I don't know if there was any.

00:39:40.565 --> 00:39:42.410
And I can always taste it.

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:45.670
And all it is, is a
mixture of starches.

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:48.640
So what function of the
egg are you replacing?

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.560
Liquid?

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.580
Very easy, right?

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.400
Binding?

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.650
Very easy.

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:54.320
Flavor?

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.630
No problem.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:40:00.220
And so what I
figure is there were

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.870
a lot of accidentally
vegan recipes

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:08.490
that happened during the
war, that everybody's grandma

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:12.560
had a cake with baking powder,
baking soda, and vinegar.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.550
And that's what leavens
your cake-- baking powder,

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:16.720
baking soda, and vinegar.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:23.240
So my recipes say organic
sugar, organic flour,

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.000
aluminum free baking soda.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.860
You don't have to use organic.

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:31.270
You don't have to use aluminum
free baking powder as long

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:33.010
as your baking powder is fresh.

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:35.280
I just figure,
for me personally,

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.650
once I've learned things I
can't get them out of my head.

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:42.830
So that's where I'm going.

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:45.400
But you do have
to measure right.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.400
I just did an event at
a spa hotel last week.

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:53.130
And the pastry chef
wrote happy birthday

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:56.950
with the ganache, which is
a bit thicker on the plate.

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:58.160
Put it in the fridge.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.080
You can do things like that
with a little squeeze bottle

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:01.730
and so on.

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:04.820
And it looks really beautiful.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:10.716
You can also-- I like
a lot of berries.

00:41:10.716 --> 00:41:11.840
Because this is California.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.310
Boy, have you got fruit here.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:15.630
Oh my goodness gracious.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:19.990
You know, at home, I have
two kinds of avocados.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:22.870
I went to the Hollywood
farmer's market,

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:24.680
and we had an avocado tasting.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.540
I never saw such things.

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:28.120
Here we go.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.980
Let's just really pile this up.

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:34.545
And here, sometimes
I will do a parfait.

00:41:34.545 --> 00:41:37.420
You know, if you have left over
cake or just cut cake circles,

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.950
put them into a glass.

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:41.310
So you can serve
this on the side,

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:45.862
or you can just put it
over some of the berries.

00:41:45.862 --> 00:41:46.820
I'm going to be around.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.945
So while you're tasting,
if you have any questions,

00:41:48.945 --> 00:41:49.930
just ask me questions.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:52.237
I want to thank you
very, very much.

00:41:52.237 --> 00:41:53.320
I hope you like the cakes.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.360
I mean, that's the
proof really, isn't it?

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.210
No questions?

00:41:58.210 --> 00:41:59.110
All right.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:01.810
Well, if you think of
something, here I am.

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:03.386
Thank you.

00:42:03.386 --> 00:42:04.100
Yum.

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.850
[APPLAUSE]
