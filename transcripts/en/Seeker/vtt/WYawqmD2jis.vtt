Shh I’m accessing my mind palace like Sherlock
Holmes…huh… living room is a bit smaller

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.012
than I expected… bedroom's kinda cramped…

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.012
But LOTS of storage!

00:00:14.012 --> 00:00:15.012
I actually STORE in there?

00:00:15.012 --> 00:00:16.012
Hey there my neuro-nerds, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:16.012 --> 00:00:18.770
Now we all know that our brains can store
an incredible amount of information -- a lifetime

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.260
of memories, everything from the good, the
bad and the downright embarrassing.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.080
Up until recently, it was thought that the
brain could only hold the equivalent of 100

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.939
terabytes of information, max -- which, let's
face it, is a lot.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.770
But it turns out our brains may actually have
ten times that capacity.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.350
In a 2016 study conducted by The Salk Institute,
researchers discovered our brains could store

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.740
at least a petabyte of information!

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:49.000
A petabyte is the equivalent of approximately
one thousand terabytes or one million gigabytes!

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.150
To put it another way, if you were to continuously
play a petabyte of 4-minute songs, it would

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.739
take 2,000 years to listen to all of them.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.420
To-do list, check.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.449
Obviously, this unit of measurement is generally
used for computer memory not brain capacity,

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.869
but neuroscientists can also use bytes as
a useful comparison for our brain's own storage

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:09.869
capacity.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.610
So, both elephants and whales have physically
larger brains, but relatively speaking, our

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.689
body-to-brain ratio is about the same as a
mouse!

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.670
Learning about how our brains store and process
information can give us insight into why we

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.509
seem to be more intelligent than other animals.

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.869
When you experience something, let's say,
your first kiss, that experience is converted

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.400
into pulses of electrical energy coming from
your external senses (lips, nose, hands, for

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.740
example) and your internal senses (emotional
responses and heart rate).

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.990
That electrical energy is fired across the
brain through a network of neurons until it

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.149
reaches the hippocampus -- a sort of memory
data bank, though some recent studies suggest

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.340
that certain long-term memories might also
be stored in the Cerebral cortex.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.810
Everything we do produces pulses, thousands
of them every day, and each one travels across

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.890
neurons via specific gap called a synapse.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.350
In that synaptic junction, neurotransmitter
chemicals ferry the pulses from one neuron

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.560
to the next as fast as possible.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.450
The brain has roughly 86 billion neurons,
not 100 billion, only 86.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.450
Specifically.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.450
Myth busteeedddd!!

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.620
And each brain cell connects to at least one
other, but likely more!

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.530
Meaning there are TRILLIONS of synapses.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.480
The gap between the neurons is small, only
20 to 40 nanometers, but studies seem to indicate

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.129
these synapses are crucial in the process
of making and storing memories.

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.660
To find out how, the Salk Institute used a
3D digital model of a rat’s hippocampus,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.820
and examined how synapse size effects brain
capacity and efficiency, and in doing so,

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.099
noticed something unusual… in 10 percent
of cases a single neuron had two synapses

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.599
connected to the same neighboring neuron…

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.660
They were sending two copies of the exact
same message!

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.890
Curiously, those two synapses varied in size
by 8 percent, and when it comes to synapses,

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.360
size really DOES matter.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.530
Larger synaptic gaps require more neurotransmitter
chemicals so they're more likely to succeed

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.209
in communicating their electrical data to
the neighbouring neuron.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.709
That simple eight percent variation enabled
researchers to create mathematical models,

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.209
concluding that synapses come in 26 different
discrete sizes!

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.220
Exiting RIGHT?!

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.470
Trust me, it is.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.920
This size variation is almost ten times what
was previously thought.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.970
Suggesting that more size variability means,
in digital terms, synapses are able to process

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.580
4.7 bits of memory.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.550
Previously scientists thought synapses could
only process one or two bits…

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.010
A small change, but, again, given there are
trillions of synapses spread throughout the

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.239
brain, the researchers calculated one petabyte
capacity.

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.769
Now, before we get too excited, remember,
this study wasn’t modeled on a human brain…

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.550
but a rat brain, although scientists think
it could translate to humans.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.739
And some neuroscientists believe the estimation
is low!

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.280
Maybe we could store 2-3 petabytes of memory!

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.189
It’s a lot to think about…!

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:08.189
Pun intended.

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:12.400
