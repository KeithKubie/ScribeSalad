active investor not an activist but we

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630
active investor not an activist but we
 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.690

could point to examples where activists

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700
could point to examples where activists
 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.940
could point to examples where activists
have created an enormous beneficial

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950
have created an enormous beneficial
 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.000

change in an organization we could also

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010
change in an organization we could also
 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.940
change in an organization we could also
point to examples of where that has

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950
point to examples of where that has
 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.340
point to examples of where that has
created horrible outcomes and so how do

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350
created horrible outcomes and so how do
 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.250
created horrible outcomes and so how do
we deal with that and what should happen

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260
we deal with that and what should happen
 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.410
we deal with that and what should happen
how should we view it what role can you

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420
how should we view it what role can you
 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.940
how should we view it what role can you
individually play in it each of you in a

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950
individually play in it each of you in a
 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.350
individually play in it each of you in a
very different role at the current time

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360
very different role at the current time
 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.140
very different role at the current time
but it will have a voice in that and I

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150
but it will have a voice in that and I
 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.750
but it will have a voice in that and I
think the challenge is how do we have a

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760
think the challenge is how do we have a
 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.620
think the challenge is how do we have a
voice that takes us to a new place in a

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630
voice that takes us to a new place in a
 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.760
voice that takes us to a new place in a

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.160
gives some guidance to what maybe should
be the transition we've lived for

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170
be the transition we've lived for
 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.460
be the transition we've lived for
decades with boards owning corporate

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470

decades with boards owning corporate
governance but now with things like

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170
governance but now with things like
 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.430
governance but now with things like
proxy access maybe we're moving into a

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440
proxy access maybe we're moving into a
 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.270
proxy access maybe we're moving into a
near era of shared governments and if so

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280
near era of shared governments and if so
 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.760
near era of shared governments and if so
how do you do that what are the

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770
how do you do that what are the
 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.160
how do you do that what are the
guidelines you follow and I think the

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170
guidelines you follow and I think the
 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.630
guidelines you follow and I think the
thing that we need to think about as we

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640
thing that we need to think about as we
 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.350
thing that we need to think about as we
move into this is that this change can

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360
move into this is that this change can
 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.660
move into this is that this change can
come from within we can do it to

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670
come from within we can do it to
 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.210
come from within we can do it to
ourselves or somebody will do it to us

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220
ourselves or somebody will do it to us
 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.039
ourselves or somebody will do it to us
and generally speaking change is better

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049
and generally speaking change is better
 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.780
and generally speaking change is better

in new ways things that were

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880
in new ways things that were
 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.040
in new ways things that were
uncomfortable last year maybe need to be

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050
uncomfortable last year maybe need to be
 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.130
uncomfortable last year maybe need to be
very comfortable next year and I think

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140
very comfortable next year and I think
 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.960
very comfortable next year and I think
one of the great things we have gone for

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970
one of the great things we have gone for
