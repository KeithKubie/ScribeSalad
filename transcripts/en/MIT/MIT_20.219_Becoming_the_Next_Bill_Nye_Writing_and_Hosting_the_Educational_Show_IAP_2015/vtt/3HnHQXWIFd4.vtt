00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.410
PROFESSOR: So this
is Josh and John.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.830
They're both from
Planet Nutshell.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.260
Josh is the founder and
John is an animator?

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.140
JOHN MCGOWAN: Yes.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.889
PROFESSOR: And they're
going to talk today

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:38.950
about storyboarding and
continuing our discussion

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.640
on visual storytelling.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.380
I'm super excited
about today's session.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.770
It's going to be a lot
of not only lecture,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.950
but workshopping some
of the scripts and ideas

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.920
that you guys have been
thinking about so far.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.871
Anything else?

00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:52.370
Oh!

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.080
Josh's background is
in creative writing.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.320
So you can also get feedback
from him on your scripts.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.960
And they make short
explainer videos

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.790
that engage people, not only
in diseminating information,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.890
but entertaining them as well.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.640
JOSHUA GUNN: Yeah.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.040
So we in lot of ways do many
of the things that, I mean,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.370
I guess directly that
you guys are working on.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.500
So this is a good fit for
us to be talking to you.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.030
So, yeah.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.090
So my job is to
sort of rally all

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.270
of the people who work
at Planet Nutshell

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.380
in interesting,
creative directions.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.520
And John is a really talented
illustrator and animator.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.500
And he also does our
storyboard artwork.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.430
So today, after I give a brief
little talk about animation

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.090
and storyboarding,
we'd like to just

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.430
open things up and
share with you a script

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.260
that we produced a while ago.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.070
And we'll all
storyboard it together.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.480
And I would love to see
what we come up with.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.610
We've produced this
script, but what's

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.560
really great about
what we do is there's

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.900
no one right way to do it.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.060
So what will be interesting
is to see what we

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.960
come up with collectively here.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.272
As opposed to what we produced.

00:02:22.272 --> 00:02:24.202
And I have looked at
your scripts, the things

00:02:24.202 --> 00:02:25.160
that you're working on.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.970
They're all really interesting.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.950
So I would like
to open things up

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.370
to any questions you
have about what you're

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.220
working on a little later.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.290
And yeah, I write
a lot of scripts.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.320
So if you need
help with that, I'm

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.421
very willing to give
you any guidance I can.

00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:51.095
So I'll get started with
this short lecture portion.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.060
Somebody made this spinning
thing for you guys today.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.060
We thought that would
be a nice touch.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.530
Ding!

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.030
All right.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.480
Let's see.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.820
Yeah, so we're going
to talk about animation

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.570
and storyboarding.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.630
And specifically, animation in
the context of what you guys

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.150
are doing.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.100
I mean, animation
is a huge topic.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.380
I'm not going to talk about
techniques or theory or any

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.070
of that kind of stuff.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.760
But I do want to talk about
when it's a good idea to use it

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.280
maybe in your own work.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.600
And there may be more
reasons why it might be good.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.050
But these are the ones that
I came up with for today.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.900
So animation is good when
synthesizing, reinforcing,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.400
or recapping information
in a simple, visual way.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.720
Cows plus farts
equals global warming.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.050
So taking abstract ideas
or summarizing information

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.210
and presenting it very
simply is something

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.910
that animation is
really good at.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.120
So when thinking about
developing your own scripts,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.520
you can think about moments
where the visual story could

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.200
be augmented with some sort
of encapsulation or summary

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.820
that is worthy of animation.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.940
And here's one that's
pretty obvious.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.820
The subject cannot be seen,
it's microscopic, cosmic,

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.140
or theoretical and abstract.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.562
So those are often good times
to think about animation.

00:04:36.562 --> 00:04:38.770
And we have some examples
of where this sort of thing

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.070
is employed later.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.079
John came up with this one.

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:45.620
Actually, John helped
with all these.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.990
Because I was really
busy this week.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.850
So I really appreciate it.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.305
Footage is not
easily attainable.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.300
So say you want to do a video
about-- well, in your case,

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.720
you know you're doing
navel engineering.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.340
Maybe you want to shoot
something about, like,

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.760
the bottom of the ship.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.240
Or something,
you're going to have

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.510
to hire a team of scuba
divers to get down there

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.690
and shoot the hull of the ship.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:21.450
So that might be a nice
opportunity for visualization

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.280
that can't be attained
through live action.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.480
And kind of the
catch-all category

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.990
is that animation adds
visual engagement.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.860
The story is somehow
made better by using it.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.440
And that's sort of an abstract,
subjective thing to say.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.150
But I think the best
way to demonstrate

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.460
that is just to show examples.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.000
Which I'll do in a bit.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.980
So animation is sort of
silly or not a great choice--

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.040
we use this term a lot.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.000
Like, is this eye
candy, or is this really

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.875
a functional part of the story?

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:09.220
Again, is it eye candy or
is the story made better?

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.420
So just using animation
because it's cool or it's neat

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.500
can actually distance the
viewer and disengage them

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.010
from the experience.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.370
Because, I don't know if
you guys watch-- you know,

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.580
you've seen a movie
like Transformers.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.780
Or, god, what are some of
these ridiculously visually

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.010
opulent movies, you know?

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.620
And a lot of times when I
watch those sorts of things,

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.130
I begin to emotionally
disengaged from them.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.930
Because all I'm doing
is being bombarded

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.120
by visual information.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.362
There's no story that's really
compelling or engaging me.

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:45.820
So that's something
to think about.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.750
Live action is really great
that at a number of things.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.750
And these are some of the
things I came up with.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.470
The notion of personality,
the human face,

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.360
the human experience.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.670
The host, is Elizabeth
talked about on Monday.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.880
Location, creating--
animation can create

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.860
a lot of interesting locations.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.870
But why would you
draw the MIT campus

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:25.110
when you have it right in
front of you, for instance?

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.390
And again, the notion
of human interaction.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:35.640
Humans talking to each other
and engaging with each other

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.550
is something that live
action is really good at.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.230
And the final,
catch-all category

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.500
is you just can't think
of anything better to do.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.677
So, oh, I'm just going
to animate that part.

00:07:46.677 --> 00:07:48.260
I don't really want
to think about how

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.800
I'm going to present this.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.720
So I'm just going to
do some animation.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.240
And that's not the best choice.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.560
You should be
making choices based

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.300
on what the strengths
of animation are

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.452
and the strength of live action.

00:08:02.452 --> 00:08:03.910
PROFESSOR: And just
to add to that,

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.970
that's also the
easiest choice to make.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.907
And the one that
happens most often.

00:08:07.907 --> 00:08:09.365
Or the one that
happened most often

00:08:09.365 --> 00:08:12.140
when we were making seasons
one and two is that we'd

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.310
hit a point in the script
that looks a little bit

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.227
complex in terms of
visual execution.

00:08:17.227 --> 00:08:19.310
And we'd say, well, what
are you going to do here?

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.770
And the host or the cast
would say, oh, well,

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.177
we're just going to animate it.

00:08:25.177 --> 00:08:27.510
As if, like, that was going
to solve all their problems.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:32.559
And I think that
these points may sound

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:34.520
pretty reasonable and obvious.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.789
But it's very, very hard to
thoughtfully integrate that

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.169
into your visual script.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:43.000
So I really encourage you
guys to think about especially

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.330
the third point, not
defaulting to animation

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.520
because you don't want to figure
out how to visually integrate

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.400
your script into the video.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.150
JOSHUA GUNN: Yeah.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:09:00.540
OK, so here are some examples
of videos that integrate

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.410
both live action and animation.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.430
There are many examples.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.470
I thought these were
especially strong ones.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.310
I don't know what
you guys-- you're

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.570
going to talk more about
how you made this one.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.190
But the composition
of this one works.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:23.450
It was obviously
designed around position

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.960
of the live action character
and the animated elements.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.307
Who has seen this
Story of Stuff series?

00:09:30.307 --> 00:09:31.265
It's quite interesting.

00:09:31.265 --> 00:09:32.710
PROFESSOR: Do you want to
play just a little of it?

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.709
JOSHUA GUNN: Yeah, I'll
play a little bit of it.

00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:39.380
FEMALE SPEAKER: So next, the--

00:10:00.326 --> 00:10:02.754
Do you have one of these?

00:10:02.754 --> 00:10:04.170
I got a little
obsessed with mine.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.839
In fact, I got a little
obsessed with all my stuff.

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:09.380
Have you ever wondered where
all the stuff we buy comes from?

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.230
And where it goes
when we throw it out?

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.430
I couldn't stop
wondering about that.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:14.570
So I looked it up.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.860
And what the textbook
said is that stuff

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.240
moves through a system.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.400
From extraction, to
production, to distribution,

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.650
to consumption, to disposal.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.582
All together, it's called
the materials economy.

00:10:26.582 --> 00:10:28.290
Well, I looked into
it a little bit more.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:31.310
In fact, I spent 10 years
traveling the world,

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.360
tracking where our stuff
comes from and where it goes

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.210
And you know what I found out?

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.160
That is not the whole story.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.820
There is a lot missing
from this explanation.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.640
For one thing, this system
looks like it's fine.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.950
No problem!

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:47.820
But the truth is it's
a system in crisis.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.820
JOSHUA GUNN: Just a
storytelling component there

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.160
that I really like is you
may already sort of know--

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.520
we talked it about on Monday.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.770
Here's a paradigm or here's
a situation that you probably

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.380
already understand, but hang on.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.330
There's a problem.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.130
There's more complexity
here than you ever

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.380
could have imagined.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.020
And I'm going to
tell you about it.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.740
And that is a really cool
storytelling component

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.582
on top of the integration of
animation and live action.

00:11:12.582 --> 00:11:14.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: An the reason
it's a system in crisis

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.560
is it's a linear system.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.150
And we live on a finite planet.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.580
And you cannot run a linear
system on a finite planet

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.190
indefinitely.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.230
Every step along
the way, this system

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.150
is interacting with
the real world.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.050
In real life, it's not
happening on a blank white page.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.890
It's interacting with
societies, cultures, economies,

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.010
the environment.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.030
And all along the way, it's
bumping up against limits.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.599
Limits we don't see here because
the diagram is incomplete.

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:41.640
So let's go back through.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.677
Let's fill in some of the
blanks and see what's missing.

00:11:44.677 --> 00:11:47.260
Well, one of the most important
things it's missing is people.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.450
Yes, people!

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.840
People live and work
all along this system.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.200
And some people in this
system matter a little more

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:54.790
than others.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.740
Some have a little more say.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.410
JOSHUA GUNN: OK, so
you get the idea.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:59.610
I mean, it's a long video.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.720
But I think it retains
engagement because

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.910
of the quality of the writing.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.100
And because of the
interest that's

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.089
created from the art work.

00:12:10.089 --> 00:12:11.755
I encourage you to
watch the whole thing

00:12:11.755 --> 00:12:12.650
if you get a chance.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:16.650
Let's see--

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.733
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE] all
of the videos that Josh

00:12:18.733 --> 00:12:20.602
is going to play today
are on the syllabus.

00:12:20.602 --> 00:12:21.800
JOSHUA GUNN: Oh, OK.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.300
Cool.

00:12:25.147 --> 00:12:26.480
You mind if I play some of this?

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.556
Or have you guys
already seen this video?

00:12:28.556 --> 00:12:30.555
PROFESSOR: I've got a
little clip of the portion

00:12:30.555 --> 00:12:32.638
that I'm going to talk
about, but you can play it.

00:12:32.638 --> 00:12:35.581
JOSHUA GUNN: OK, I'll
just play the beginning.

00:12:35.581 --> 00:12:37.830
This has George in it, who
I assume you saw yesterday.

00:12:40.277 --> 00:12:42.110
MALE SPEAKER: You know
what's more like life

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:43.840
than a box of chocolates?

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.770
Farts.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.062
You really never know
what you're going to get.

00:12:48.062 --> 00:12:50.760
Skunk, rotten eggs,
garbage dumpster?

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.670
The possibilities are,
unfortunately, endless.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.700
But why do we fart?

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.330
And how does your body make
so many different smells?

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.510
The answer is fermentation.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:01.112
This is a giant bioreactor.

00:13:01.112 --> 00:13:02.320
It's also called a fermenter.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.530
And in here, a fungus
known as brewer's yeast

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.590
is transforming water
and dead plants to beer.

00:13:15.182 --> 00:13:17.390
So you know that thing where
you eat food and breathe

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.060
in oxygen to get your energy?

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.530
That's called respiration.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.280
Yeast also need to
get energy from food,

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.120
but there's no oxygen
in those tanks.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.140
So they have to use a different
process called fermentation.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.190
Now, both your cells
and yeast cells

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:31.990
break food down to get energy.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.640
But your main byproducts are
carbon dioxide and water.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.940
And yeasts main byproducts are
carbon dioxide and alcohol.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.290
That's how this stuff
gets to be beer.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.045
JOSHUA GUNN: OK, I think
that-- similar concept,

00:13:45.045 --> 00:13:47.720
the integration of
animation and live action.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.614
And the way that the animation
somehow augments or improves

00:13:51.614 --> 00:13:53.530
your understanding of
what he's talking about.

00:13:57.085 --> 00:13:58.485
So let's see.

00:13:58.485 --> 00:13:59.940
So let's switch back here.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:10.910
So that's a very brief overview
of how you can use animation

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.520
in your own work.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:18.020
How to do it, technically and
artistically is another matter.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.840
I'm happy to talk
about that separately.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.740
I don't know how
much training is

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.380
in this course for animation.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.871
PROFESSOR: Not whole lot.

00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:31.170
We do have the equipment
if you want to learn more.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.760
We have about 10 of
these similar tablets

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.930
if you guys are interested
in learning about this.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.409
But we're not going
to go super in depth.

00:14:39.409 --> 00:14:41.700
JOSHUA GUNN: Yeah, this might
be an opportunity for you

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.980
to talk about that
segment that you did.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.210
And from what I understand,
the animation that you do

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:49.910
is fairly rudimentary.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:50.990
And very effective.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.374
And it might be something that
these guys could pull off.

00:14:54.374 --> 00:14:55.790
PROFESSOR: All
right, so I'm going

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.220
to talk a little bit
about one of the scenes

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.720
from the farts video.

00:15:02.795 --> 00:15:04.420
This was actually
something that George

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.050
was going to talk about
yesterday in his script writing

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:08.380
workshop.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.890
So this will tie
in pretty nicely

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:11.675
if I can get this to work.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.040
All right, so take a second
to read this passage.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:36.700
So when you were writing
the farts script,

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:40.450
this was a piece of information
that George had come across.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.470
Which he found very fascinating.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.870
It was one of the shareable
facts that he latched onto.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:51.210
The fact that the microbial
population in your gut

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:54.800
is about 10 times greater
than all the somatic germ

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.770
cells in your body.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.710
Now if he had said this line
in the video it would've

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.030
been a disaster, right?

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.302
But what is this passage
essentially saying?

00:16:04.302 --> 00:16:06.362
Does anyone want
to take a guess?

00:16:06.362 --> 00:16:07.237
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:09.789 --> 00:16:10.830
PROFESSOR: Not just that.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.530
So somatic and germ
cells basically

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:15.205
refers to all of
your human cells.

00:16:19.738 --> 00:16:23.364
AUDIENCE: There's more
stuff that's not you in you

00:16:23.364 --> 00:16:24.530
than there is pieces of you.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.080
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah basically.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.820
AUDIENCE: Mostly [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.820
PROFESSOR: Right, right.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.830
So the way George decided
to distill this down there

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.030
10 times as many microbes
living in your gut

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.940
as there are human
cells in your body.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.740
I mean, that's basically
what this entire passage

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.500
taken from a journal
article is saying.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.310
But the problem with
saying just this

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.660
is that, at least for
me and for George,

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.650
one of the questions
that we thought

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:54.680
of as an audience
member was well,

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.840
how does that exactly work?

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:01.040
Like, how can you fit 10 times
as many bacteria in you, yet

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.400
you're not walking
around just oozing

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.839
bacterial cells completely
outside of your body.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:09.470
Because I think a misconception
that people often have

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.400
is that they're the
same size, right?

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.060
So it was kind of this
paradox that wasn't essential

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.579
to the story of the
video to explain,

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.680
yet was a potential
point of confusion.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.640
So this was a reason
why we decided

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.490
to use an animation in
this particular spot.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:28.470
Because As Josh
was saying earlier,

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.970
we felt like the story
needed to be clarified.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.580
We felt like the story needed
to be advanced a little bit.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:39.502
But we also felt like if
we took the time to say

00:17:39.502 --> 00:17:41.460
there are 10 times as
many microbes in your gut

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.370
as there are human
cells in your body.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.330
Which doesn't make
sense, because you

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.260
would think that you'd
be oozing out bacteria,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.130
but it actually is fine because
bacteria are a lot smaller

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.270
than human cells, right?

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.400
That actually is, like,
two or three seconds

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.400
of very, very
precious time wasted.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.340
And sort of loses the
momentum of the video.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:04.540
So we decided to do an animation
to explain all of that instead.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.610
So what we did was we
had shot everything

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.550
without the animations.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:13.880
And our storyboarding
process is incredibly janky.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.220
But it essentially works.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.380
And hopefully after
today your storyboards

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.450
will be a lot better
than the one we used.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:25.212
But what I literally did was I
got the rough cut of the video.

00:18:25.212 --> 00:18:26.420
And I got all of the footage.

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.470
And I specifically was looking
at this portion of the video

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.620
where this animation
would need to go.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:35.440
And I took screenshots of the
video at various time points

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.290
where I knew the
information needed to go.

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:42.610
So this is setting the line
in context of the section

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:43.879
that he was delivering.

00:18:43.879 --> 00:18:46.170
So the first line [INAUDIBLE]
that we carry a fermenter

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.960
right here with us in our gut.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.490
And this was the
still that he said

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:53.350
that, so I was telling
the editor, at this point

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.700
I want a fermenter to show up.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.522
And he actually motions
during the scene.

00:19:00.522 --> 00:19:02.980
And then there was this second
line, "Except instead yeast,

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.150
my gut uses gut bacteria."

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.820
So I was trying to
convey to the editor

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.010
to take my drawing of
the yeast and swap it out

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:11.130
for drawing of a bacteria.

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.440
Again, this is
incredibly rudimentary.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.480
You don't have to be an amazing
artist to pull off the clarity

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.490
that you need for a storyboard.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.370
Then he says, "A lot of them,"
and I wanted a ton of bacteria

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.082
to show up.

00:19:24.082 --> 00:19:25.540
And then we get to
the line, "There

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.350
are 10 times as
many gut bacteria

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.775
as there are human
cells in your body."

00:19:29.775 --> 00:19:33.010
At which point I
wanted lots of bacteria

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:36.450
to show up and then show it in
comparison to the human cell.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.440
This was going to
be the key frame

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.250
to explain the
concept of how you

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:45.870
can have so many bacteria
without oozing it

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.100
outside of your body.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.670
So essentially we were
explaining the whole difference

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:53.810
in scale through one frame.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:58.890
JOSHUA GUNN: This reminds me a
bit of the flipping cat video

00:19:58.890 --> 00:19:59.680
we saw on Monday.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.260
And there's a
segment in that video

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.610
that I think is kind of weak.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:07.380
Where he is explaining a lot
of technical information.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.150
I just didn't absorb it.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.140
I couldn't follow it.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.040
And I was thinking,
you know, this

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.540
would have been a lot better
if he'd maybe done some better

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.230
script writing.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:21.280
But also maybe some
animation, you know?

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.760
I think animation can be really
good at moments like these

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.820
when you've got this
sophisticated or complex

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.500
information and you need
to maintain engagement

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.290
with the viewer.

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:33.650
But also encapsulate it.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.680
Yeah, anyway, sorry to highjack.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.596
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:20:38.596 --> 00:20:41.560
That's fine. [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.890
And then the whole
way we wrap up

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:48.700
that scene is he explains
that instead of just one

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:52.270
species of yeast like they use
when you brew beer-- that's

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.560
the whole reason why we
were at the brewery--

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.210
my gut uses hundreds.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:59.870
And if we just had
that text, I think

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.790
that it would bring up a
lot it questions or maybe

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.610
points of clarification
for the viewer

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.560
that, again, we just
didn't have the time

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.180
to explain in the script.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:14.520
Which is why we relied on the
animation to do it for us.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.890
So John's going to show
you some animations that

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:21.490
are awesome and very artistic.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.850
For our animations,
I literally just

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:25.560
take a Sharpie and
a piece of paper,

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.225
and I draw out the doodles.

00:21:27.225 --> 00:21:28.350
JOHN MCGOWAN: They're nice!

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:29.760
PROFESSOR: Thank you!

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.280
But it's nothing crazy.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.010
And I basically scan
them in to our editor

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.920
and had named each picture.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.140
And then in the storyboard
I had explained, OK, here's

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.610
my drawing of the fermenter.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.750
Please refer to
fermenter.jpeg for the image

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:49.300
I want you to use.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.010
And then he went into
After Effects and inverted

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.720
all of the drawings
and moved them around.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.020
And I think you're going
to talk about After Effects

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.570
just a little bit.

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.486
JOHN MCGOWAN: We can
talk about After Effects.

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:01.150
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.400
And again, if you want to play
with any of this on your own,

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.900
there are really good
tutorials on Lynda.com.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.220
And as MIT students, you
guys have free access

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.360
to the entire library.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.990
So if you want a tutorial
on how to use After Effects,

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:17.800
which you all have access to
as well if you're interested.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.450
You can just come talk
to me during class.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:22.900
So we storyboarded
everything out.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.430
And then I drew the doodles.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:28.570
And the key frame
here was this picture

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:33.010
that sort of explains the whole
concept of how so many bacteria

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.260
can fit inside of you.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:40.030
But it just takes one
picture instead of 10 words.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:45.477
So this is what that scene
ended up looking like.

00:22:45.477 --> 00:22:46.310
MALE SPEAKER: Weird.

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.660
Turns out, we all carry
a fermenter with us

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.810
right here in our gut.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.520
Except instead of
yeast, my guy uses

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.110
bacteria, and a lot of them.

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:55.990
There are 10 times as many
bacteria in my intestine

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:59.080
as there are human
cells in my entire body.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.557
And instead of just one
species, my gut uses--

00:23:02.557 --> 00:23:03.890
PROFESSOR: My gut uses hundreds.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.420
Sorry, it got cut off.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.240
So, I mean, there are many ways
that we could have done that.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.990
Like Josh was saying,
there's no right way

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.510
when it comes to
animations, when

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.630
it comes to video in general.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:16.700
But this was sort of our
way of working around

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.700
the problem of not having access
to the footage of real bacteria

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.820
necessarily.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.070
It was just a world that we
couldn't access, or didn't

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.430
have time to access, or would
have been too distracting

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.680
to access in this video.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.430
The other thing I
wanted to mention really

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:35.170
quickly before Josh
continues is when we shot,

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.910
we shot knowing that we were
going to do the animation

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:40.120
overlay in mind.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.000
You may not know
that ahead of time.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.890
So what I would
suggest, if you're

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.710
interested in doing
something like this,

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:47.980
is to shoot thinking
that you're not going

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.230
to do an animation overlay.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:50.480
And then just do another take.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.480
Just in case you want to
do something like this.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.770
So the way we
framed the shot, we

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.839
tried to make sure that the
background was dark enough

00:23:59.839 --> 00:24:01.380
to where the animations
could appear.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:06.120
This is not an ideal framing
in a not an ideal background.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.350
So I'm sorry to use
this as an example.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:11.480
This is probably one that
we could have improved.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.460
But I'll show you another one.

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.090
FEMALE SPEAKER:
These small molecules

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:17.680
are called metabolites.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.900
Just like how all the DNA in
an organism forms the genome,

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.820
all of the metabolites
form the metabolome.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.940
Even though each metabolite can
be made from only six elements,

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.320
there are so many
possibilities that it

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.230
would take scientists
thousands of years

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:33.217
to make each one
and figure out--

00:24:33.217 --> 00:24:35.050
PROFESSOR: And configure
out its usefulness.

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.660
So we had the exact same
storyboarding process

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:38.780
to create this.

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.300
But when we shot
Anastasia that day

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.670
I knew that this is what I
wanted to do for that scene.

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:47.397
So we told her to go
like this with her hand.

00:24:47.397 --> 00:24:49.980
And we were like, we're going
to put stuff there, don't worry.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.630
And we framed her wide enough.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:54.300
And we gave her enough
grass space outside of her

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.410
that we could fit some
of these animations in.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.584
So just anticipating
that-- and I

00:24:58.584 --> 00:25:00.000
can talk more about
this tomorrow,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.880
when I talk about producing--
is a good thing to do

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.405
if you want to do animations.

00:25:04.405 --> 00:25:05.990
And I'll show you one last.

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.220
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Those animals get

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.665
eaten by slightly bigger
animals, which get eaten

00:25:08.665 --> 00:25:09.790
by slightly bigger animals.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.160
Which get eaten by animals
at the top of the food chain.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.010
Animals like us.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:17.130
PROFESSOR: So that's the
raw footage from our video

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:18.820
on engineering river cleanups.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.610
And again, this
is a spot that we

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:22.340
knew we wanted to do
an animation there.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:26.200
So we framed her in such a way
that there is enough background

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.970
space to accommodate
for the animation.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:29.650
And we actually
told her, OK, we're

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.670
going to put fish
along here in post.

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:35.350
So pretend like you're looking
at stuff, point to them

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:38.270
as if there are going be
fish there eventually.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.540
I think we also did
it take where we just

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.640
had her delivering it normally.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.614
So we had her framed with not
as much extra space behind her.

00:25:46.614 --> 00:25:48.780
Just in case we weren't
going to use that animation.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.590
But again, sort of anticipating
using that if you need.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.185
So this is what the
final scene looked like.

00:25:55.185 --> 00:25:56.810
FEMALE SPEAKER: Those
animals get eaten

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:57.940
by slightly bigger animals.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.760
Which get eaten by
slightly bigger animals,

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.110
which get eaten by animals
at the top of the food chain.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:05.130
Animals like us.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:07.190
PROFESSOR: So again,
it wasn't incredibly

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.370
vital to have these animations.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:10.940
One of the reasons
why we did use

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.330
it is that, in the context
of the video-- which

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:15.130
I'm going to show
tomorrow-- we felt

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:18.760
like the visual interest was
getting a little bit static.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.040
So we used animation to
move the story forward

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.210
in that we felt like it was
getting a little visually

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.480
monotonous by the time this hit.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.386
And the other thing is the food
web stuff is OK to explain.

00:26:31.386 --> 00:26:33.260
I think that if you
didn't have the animation

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.560
it would still be OK.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:40.027
But it just added I guess a
little moment of whimsy to it.

00:26:40.027 --> 00:26:41.735
And so that was sort
of our justification

00:26:41.735 --> 00:26:44.099
of putting it there.

00:26:44.099 --> 00:26:46.140
So I just wanted to show
you guys those examples.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.088
And Josh, you can continue on.

00:26:49.088 --> 00:26:49.754
JOSHUA GUNN: OK!

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.386
I can switch here.

00:26:54.386 --> 00:26:55.010
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.850
JOSHUA GUNN: When
John is helping us

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:05.500
out with the
workshopping portion,

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:10.300
he can show you some
projects in After Effects.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:15.310
I don't think After
Effects-- it's

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:17.850
a complex program with
a lot of capability.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.430
But I think some
basic compositing

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:23.380
like this would be
quite easy in it.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:27.840
So we can show you some of
those, just some basics about

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.660
After Effects.
