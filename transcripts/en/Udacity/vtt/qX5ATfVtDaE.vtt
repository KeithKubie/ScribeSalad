00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.400
Now that we've discussed the inception phase, let's move

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.180
on to the second phase of RUP, which is

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.280
the elaboration phase. And there are four main goals

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.900
and activities for the elaboration phase. Analyzing the problem domain

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.690
to get a better understanding of the domain. Establishing

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.840
a solid architectural foundation for the project. Eliminating the highest

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.454
risk elements which basically means addressing the most critical

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:25.590
use cases. And finally, refine the plan of activities and estimates

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.250
of resources to complete the project. The outcome

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.310
of the elaboration phase reflects these activities and also

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.440
in this case produces several artifacts. The first one

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.700
is an almost complete use case model with all use cases

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.560
and actors identified and most use case descriptions developed.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.070
As part of this phase we also identify a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.550
set of what we called supplementary requirements. So these

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.685
are basically all the requirements that are not associated

00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:53.483
with a use case. And these sets includes in particular all

00:00:53.483 --> 00:00:56.110
non-functional requirements such as security,

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.630
reliability, maintainability and so on. So

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.770
all the ones that are relevant for the system that

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.280
you're developing. We mentioned before

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.410
that the software architecture is developed

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.220
in an incremental way, so it's not created at once.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.650
And this is exactly what happens in the elaboration phase, that

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.990
we take the initial architecture that was defined in the inception

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.280
phase and we refine it until we get to a software

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.400
architecture which is complete. And that is part of the

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.410
deliverables for this phase. And the list continues, so let

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.020
me make some room. In addition to producing a complete

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.270
architecture for our system, in the elaboration phase we also

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.130
define the lower-level design for the system. And, therefore, as

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.560
part of this phase, we produce as deliverables a design

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.000
model, and together with that, a complete set of test

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.770
cases, and an executable prototype. We also produce a revised

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.390
project plan. Now that we have more information about the

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.120
project we can refine the various estimates and the various

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.020
pieces of information in the project plan. And also an

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.160
updated risk assessment document. Finally, in this phase we also generate

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.680
a preliminary user manual that describes to the users how

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.350
the system can be used and should be used. So now

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.630
let's see what are the evaluation criteria for the elaboration

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.880
phase which is our second milestone. So I'm just going to list

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.400
them here. The first one is whether the vision

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.620
and the architecture are stable or they're still changing so

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.680
did we converge into a final complete vision for the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.620
system? Does the prototype show that the major risks that

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.090
we have identified have been resolved or at least addressed

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.390
in this phase? Is the project plan sufficiently detailed and

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.030
accurate? Do all stakeholders agree that the vision can be

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.320
achieved with the current plan? Is the actual resource expenditure

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.840
versus the planned expenditure acceptable? So now we study consumer

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.120
resources and therefore we can check whether our estimates were

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.964
correct. And also in this case the project might be

00:02:41.964 --> 00:02:45.730
cancelled or considerably reshaped if it fails to pass this milestone.
