00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.634
FEMALE SPEAKER: Is everybody
excited to be here?

00:00:02.634 --> 00:00:04.530
What a good turnout.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.952
Chris and I were just joking.

00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:06.900
We're like, sex sells.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.180
[LAUGHING]

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.580
FEMALE SPEAKER: So we're so
happy to have Dr. Wendy Walsh

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.660
here today.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.610
And I know you guys have been
bombarded with emails as

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.890
reminders of why
Wendy is here.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.020
But just to give you guys some
background on her, she's

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.330
America's thought leader
on relationships.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.760
And each week on CNN and "The
O'Reilly Factor," she breaks

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.810
down the psychology of sex,
love, gender roles, divorce,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.370
parenting, and other
human behaviors.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.960
As host of Investigation
Discovery Network's "Happily

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.540
Never After," she guides viewers
through the sometimes

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.423
treacherous sides of love.

00:00:42.423 --> 00:00:46.180
As resident expert at
datingadvice.com, no subject

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.940
is taboo in her popular
advice column.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.785
And as former co-host of the
"Doctors" TV show-- if you

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:53.150
guys haven't seen
it, definitely

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.560
check her out on YouTube--

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.030
she was nominated for a 2012
Daytime Emmy Award.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.810
And she also lectures on
evolutionary psychology and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.850
human mating strategies at
California State University,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.910
Channel Islands.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.610
She holds a BA in journalism,
a master's degree in

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.990
psychology, and PhD in
clinical psychology.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.380
She has authored "The Boyfriend
Test," "The

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.020
Girlfriend Test," and "The
30 Day Love Detox."

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.600
WENDY WALSH: Thank you.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.965
Wow.

00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:22.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.370
WENDY WALSH: I don't need to
use a microphone, right?

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.750
You guys can hear me all, OK?

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.510
Yeah, OK.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.940
It's a little more intimate
that way.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.730
If you hear anything that you
want to tweet, I would be

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.070
really, really thrilled if
you would tweet it today.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.220
It's @DrWendyWalsh.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.130
The reason why I called my
lecture the Economy of Sex is

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.740
because it's a very provocative
title, and people

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.170
immediately think
of prostitution.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.430
But it has nothing to do
with that, actually.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.570
It has to do with the fact that,
anthropologically, we

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.750
are here to reproduce, right?

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.330
And we have a survival mechanism
to reproduce.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.970
And the big currency for
reproduction, of course, is

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.540
obtaining a mate who will give
you offspring that will

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.890
survive into the next level.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.950
So that's why I call it
the Economy of Sex.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.730
And I really love that
slide, by the way.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.090
Because how many people have
ever sat on a date and watched

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.889
somebody eat their money?

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.100
OK, let's start off with a
fun little fun fact quiz.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.230
If you had to guess, what
percentage of American men

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.880
aged 18 to 25--

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.830
this was a young
person study--

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.580
can obtain sex on a
first date-- they

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.110
have such an A game.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.310
Why don't you just think the
number in your head for now,

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.990
and then we'll go over them.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.670
What percentage of men
in our culture

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.850
are considered players?

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.140
And here's how this study
defined players-- they've had

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.010
at least three sexual
partners a year for

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.490
three consecutive years.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.370
That's at least nine partners
in three years.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.770
That's considered a Don Juan.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.640
Number of hook-ups the typical
college student has each year.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.260
Think about it.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.440
Think about it.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.910
Percentage of college students
who are virgins.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.880
And the number of lifetime
sexual partners.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.860
Now, I don't want any men to
talk, because men always know

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.140
the correct answers to this,
I will tell you that.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.390
[LAUGHING]

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.510
WENDY WALSH: Men know
the numbers so well.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.880
OK, so I only want to
hear from women.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.930
How many men aged 18 to 25, if
100 of them go out on a first

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.080
date with a new woman tonight,
what percentage are going to

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.243
obtain sex.

00:03:07.243 --> 00:03:07.626
AUDIENCE: 60.

00:03:07.626 --> 00:03:08.010
AUDIENCE: 25

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.450
WENDY WALSH: 60.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.060
25.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.800
What else I got?

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.320
30.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.170
No men talk yet.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.682
OK, guy, give me something.

00:03:14.682 --> 00:03:15.124
AUDIENCE: 2%.

00:03:15.124 --> 00:03:15.566
AUDIENCE: 5%

00:03:15.566 --> 00:03:16.450
WENDY WALSH: There we go!

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.340
OK.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.500
it's actually just under 20%.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.250
But again, these are young,
18 to 25-year-old guys.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.700
So it's just under 20%.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.120
I'm sorry?

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.720
AUDIENCE: What number
did you say?

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.200
WENDY WALSH: Just under 20%.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.250
So it's about a one in five
chance, if you're 18 to 25 and

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.490
filled with testosterone and
you've honed your A game as

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.390
much as possible.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.310
But the point here is women are
ingesting this idea that

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.150
sex happens all the time to
everybody, and they're the

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.340
ones that should be complying.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.290
All right, percentage of
men who are players.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.680
They've had at least three
partners a year.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.760
Let's start with women.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.080
These guys have had three
partners a year for three

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.950
consecutive years.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.160
Women, what percentage of
our male population?

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.460
This study was older.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.445
These were men 18 to 30.

00:04:03.445 --> 00:04:04.315
AUDIENCE: 25.

00:04:04.315 --> 00:04:05.015
WENDY WALSH: 25%.

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:05.640
AUDIENCE: 65.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.976
AUDIENCE: 50.

00:04:05.976 --> 00:04:06.650
WENDY WALSH: 65.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.940
50.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.090
Come on, anybody else?

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.660
40?

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.180
OK, I want a man to answer.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.270
AUDIENCE: 10.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.630
WENDY WALSH: 10-- that's
pretty generous.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.650
It's 3%.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.690
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.890
WENDY WALSH: Now, remember,
you guys are living

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.795
in LA and New York.

00:04:17.795 --> 00:04:20.241
It's a whole different world
in LA and New York, right?

00:04:20.241 --> 00:04:22.350
[LAUGHS]

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.440
OK, number of hook-ups the
typical college student has

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.590
every year.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.385
AUDIENCE: What's a hook-up?

00:04:27.385 --> 00:04:30.680
WENDY WALSH: Oh,
a hook-up is--

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.030
that is the big question,
actually.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.630
Because people use the term so
loosely, and they may mean

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.420
that they just met for coffee.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.570
But the truth is a hook-up is
a sexual encounter with no

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.710
strings attached and no
expectation of ever seeing the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.730
person again.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.830
AUDIENCE: Five.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.400
WENDY WALSH: Five a year
per college student.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.010
AUDIENCE: One.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.415
WENDY WALSH: One.

00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:47.630
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.420
WENDY WALSH: OK, the
one is right on.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.135
The average college student
has about one a year.

00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:55.180
AUDIENCE: That's the average.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.940
WENDY WALSH: Right, that's
the average.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.470
Right.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.430
The study showed that, in the
same study, when they asked

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.780
people what do you think the
typical college student has--

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.430
not me, them--

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.720
they found that they said
about 80% of the typical

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.080
students have at least
two or more.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.600
That's the belief system.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.760
But when they actually ask
people have they had hook-ups,

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.990
they found that only 35% of
the students had only one

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.110
hook-up in the last year,
and the rest had none.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.290
Percentage of college students
who are virgins in 2013.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.816
Guess, men or women.

00:05:26.816 --> 00:05:27.242
Huh?

00:05:27.242 --> 00:05:27.670
AUDIENCE: 15%.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.280
AUDIENCE: 30.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.880
WENDY WALSH: It's 25%.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.080
25%.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.890
Human beings begin having
sexual activity usually

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.460
somewhere between the
ages of 16 and 25,

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.300
and it's a big range.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.480
And the higher one is educated,
the longer they

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.970
delay the onset of sexual
activity, because they tend to

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:42.730
put career--

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.790
oh, and by the way, religion is
named number three as why

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.790
these college students
choose virginity.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.660
Number one is STD, pregnancy,
and then the other is

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.700
derailing their career
and education plans.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.200
And then three is religion.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.440
I'm going to save the number
of lifetime sexual partners

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.830
until we get to the end
of this lecture.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.740
But I want to say quickly, what
I'm hearing from you is

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.540
that you guys are believing
the media mythology that

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.620
everybody--

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.610
especially the women--

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.570
that everybody's hooking up
everywhere, all the time.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.840
And that's actually not the
reality of what's going on.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.970
OK, what we're in right now is
what I call a high supply

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.680
sexual economy.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.110
And it's actually related
to the rise of women.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.670
Now, I'm not blaming
women here.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.080
I just want you to understand
that when women rise in power,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.830
sex rises in supply
in our culture.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.550
Now, we know what happens when
women are disadvantaged.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.660
We have enough examples of that
around the world, enough

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.980
examples in history.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.860
When women are disadvantaged
and they cannot extract

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.280
resources from the environment,
they basically

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.630
have to monetize their pussies.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:44.910
I'm sorry.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.210
We can't put that on
YouTube, can we?

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.030
[LAUGHING]

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.180
WENDY WALSH: So either they
withhold sex, wait till a guy

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.630
signs on the dotted line to
support them and their

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.530
offspring in a contract called
love and marriage, right?

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:57.900
Here, they don't have a
choice, by the way.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.020
It's not a choice.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.070
When you don't have the ability
to extract resources,

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.250
get a job, gainful employment,
the only thing you can hope to

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.210
do is hook up to a guy
who will support

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.900
you and your kids.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.170
And in order to do that,
virginity is coveted.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.800
We know that in cultures where
women are disadvantaged,

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.760
marriage rates go up, more
children are born into

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.930
wedlock, virginity is coveted,
and, oh, yeah, prostitution

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:21.795
goes way up.

00:07:21.795 --> 00:07:24.050
I used an old-fashioned
prostitute there because the

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.870
height of prostitution worldwide
was probably

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.860
Victorian England, the most
repressed time for women.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.380
And it was a time of great
economic expansion, when the

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.520
middle class was developing
in England.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.840
But it was only a time of
economic prosperity for men.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.820
So women had a choice-- not even
reveal a ankle or, God

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.120
forbid, they couldn't get
a husband, or sell it.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.870
And in Victorian England, it
was estimated there was one

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.630
prostitute for every 12
men in the population.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.670
That's pretty high--

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:52.900
a lot of competition there.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.890
So we know what happens when
women are disadvantaged.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.165
We know what happens
with sexuality.

00:07:58.165 --> 00:08:00.500
And I want you to think a little
bit about what's going

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.820
on in the sex slave trade
in Asia right now.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.830
Think about what's going on in
India, China, Thailand, where

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.570
women are disadvantaged,
right?

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.810
And one interesting thing, a
modern day twist on it, is

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.990
that as women are becoming
more educated,

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.050
particularly in India--

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.100
they're working the
call centers,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.400
they're becoming doctors--

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.770
they're retaining
their virginity

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.440
because of cultural pressures.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.200
So you've got this population of
women who are now working,

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.670
having education, retaining
their virginity maybe until

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.460
they're 30, until their wedding
day, because of the

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.630
cultural pressures.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.129
And you've got this huge
population of men-- what, 20%

00:08:33.129 --> 00:08:35.460
of them who get laid on the
first date-- who can't.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.179
So it gives rise to
more prostitution.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.580
When we have powerful women that
we have right now, what

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.424
happens is--

00:08:42.424 --> 00:08:45.200
[LAUGHING]

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.020
AUDIENCE: --we know that we're
seeing an unprecedented rise

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.520
of women in America.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.690
For every two guys that graduate
college, there are

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:52.800
three women.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.070
Women make up 3/5 of graduate
school populations.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.860
The only place we're
50-50 are law

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.030
schools and medical schools.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.790
Maybe we're lagging a little
bit in engineering and the

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:04.160
hard sciences-- we're
catching up fast.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.200
So in the aged 22 to 32
population, women are actually

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.650
making more than their
male peers.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.060
Because we are now in a world
of information technology.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.400
And guess who are great
communicators?

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.330
Hmm.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.140
We are darn good talkers
and good typers.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.700
So all of a sudden, women have
an equal ability, or better

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.960
even advantage, to extract
resources from the

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.230
environment.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:28.780
And there are more women
in the workforce

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.650
right now in America.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.580
Now, a lot of expensive
men were laid off

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.930
during the Great Recession.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.090
And we still need a lot more
heels and stilettos and skirts

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.930
in the board rooms, but there
are definitely more women

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.850
working than men in
America right now.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.990
So what happens is when women
have their own economic

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.670
potential, they don't need
marriage necessarily, so they

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.280
put sex out into the culture
in high supply.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.420
Because they can finally just
enjoy the pleasures of their

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.822
body, right?

00:09:52.822 --> 00:09:54.090
It sounds good, doesn't it?

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.310
You know, it does.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.150
It sounds really good, that
women can just make their own

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.330
money and have sex with
whoever they want,

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:00.770
whenever they want.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.990
Except three things happen
to men in a high

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.540
supply sexual economy.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.760
And this is the first example
in history where we've been

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.710
able to actually look at it.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.870
The first is some men
lose ambition.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:17.970
Historically, hunter-gatherer
men competed against other

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.300
young men to extract resources
from the environment so they

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.810
could impress women.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.120
Did you know a hunter-gatherer
man could have easily

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.480
supported his entire village
on squirrels.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.670
But oh no, he had to go out and
risk his life, get a team

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.080
of boys together, pull back a
huge woolly mammoth, because

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.880
what would he get?

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.530
He'd get access to more women.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.570
He could also display waste,
because there's no way of

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.350
refrigerating all that
meat, right?

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.340
So he could say, hey, I'm so big
and cool, I can let that

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.910
meat just rot in the sun.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:46.980
Because I know all you ladies
will have your pick, and then

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.190
I'll have your pick of you.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.930
By the way, today's woolly
mammoth is called

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.100
a Super Bowl ring.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:51.745
[LAUGHING]

00:10:51.745 --> 00:10:53.190
WENDY WALSH: Same deal.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.030
So when women are making their
own money, there's a small

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:01.920
population, maybe 30% of the
men, who can now sit their

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.140
mom's basement until they're 30
playing Xbox and ask women

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.310
to text in naked pictures
of themselves.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.720
And then they can go over to her
condo, because she has a

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.370
perfectly well-suited Martha
Stewart bed, and they don't

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:13.190
need to do anything.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.860
So that's one problem that
we're starting to see.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.250
There are a host of books about
it. "Failure to Launch"

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.430
is one of the big ones about
young men failing to launch.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.090
That's one of the problems in a
high supply sexual economy.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.650
Some others lose the
ability to commit.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.610
Because there is a group of men
who are loving this high

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:30.780
supply sex.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.820
And they're riding this wave
of free sex, because, oh,

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.880
guess what?

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.550
Men don't have a fertility
window.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.380
Oh, there is no rush.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.250
They can wait until they're in
their 40s, and they can marry

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.040
a girl who's in her 20s.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.620
Or they can leave baby
mamas along the way.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.830
They've got lots of choice.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:48.910
So it's getting harder and
harder for women to get some

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:49.680
men to commit.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.500
I say some, because they
don't all fall.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.230
And the other thing that happens
is plenty of good

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.190
guys-- remember the other 97%
that aren't the players--

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.220
they feel pressure in a high
supply sexual economy to act

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.420
like players.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.330
So you end up not being
authentic with who you are.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.600
AUDIENCE: To me, are
they players?

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:05.870
WENDY WALSH: What?

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.040
AUDIENCE: That's New
Kids on the Block.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.236
WENDY WALSH: That is New
Kids on the Block.

00:12:08.236 --> 00:12:08.620
[LAUGHING]

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.070
WENDY WALSH: I wondered if
anybody would recognize that.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.970
I just like the picture.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.370
OK, so those are the three
things that happen to men in a

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.030
high supply sexual economy.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.360
But there are also three things
that happen to women in

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.550
a high supply sexual economy.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:25.470
Some women adopt a male
model of sexuality.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.940
Now, this is a good place for
me to stop and explain that

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.230
men and women are biologically
a little different.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:34.610
I love that we're really
politically correct in our

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.510
world and we do know that in
our workplace we can be as

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.980
equal to extract resources
from the environment.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.725
But I have not met a guy yet
who can breast feed.

00:12:42.725 --> 00:12:46.200
I have not met a guy who
can actually grow baby.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.710
And none of you have
fertility windows.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.010
So when you hear me talk about
the differences, don't think

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.860
political incorrectness, think
I'm thinking about the

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.640
biological reality of
what's going on.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.100
So let's talk about sexuality.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.120
Men and women have sex for
different reasons and in

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.060
different ways.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.030
Women, not all women--

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.460
OK, don't jump on me--

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.890
can fall in love through sex.

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.320
Because their body excretes
large amounts of oxytocin, the

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.520
female bonding hormone.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.740
There are only two times in a
woman's life where her body

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.560
excretes a lot of oxytocin.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.950
It is during breastfeeding, so
that she can have a bonding

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:16.960
experience with her baby.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.680
And it is during
female orgasm.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.300
So there are plenty of women out
there, because of our high

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.450
supply sexual economy and our
permissiveness and our media

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.040
telling you that everybody's
hooking up, who start hooking

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.370
up, and then start
going, whoa, this

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.110
doesn't really feel good.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:34.180
Or they call me and say, why
hasn't he called me back?

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.380
And I'm like, but you said
that was just sport sex.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.150
Why do you care if he
calls you back?

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.500
But I don't know.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.180
He should still call me back.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:40.440
Right?

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.830
So their body is bonding, and
they're not even aware of it.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.250
Now, men can also fall in love
not necessarily through sex,

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.410
but if they are in love with
someone, they can have much

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:49.640
better sex, OK?

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.880
But a man can also have sex with
the same woman every week

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.150
for six months and not like her
one bit more than he did

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.080
that first date.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.110
Because men, biologically, can
separate sex and feelings a

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.840
little easier than women can.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.220
Now, we are seeing a group
of women who are able to

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.440
disassociate and disconnect
from their biology.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.560
We also see high school students
give birth in the

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.310
stall of their prom and didn't
know they were pregnant.

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:13.450
OK, so people can separate
from their bodies.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.810
Now, the other thing that
happens in a high supply

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.090
sexual economy is all these
super educated, powerful women

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.420
start to look at their male
peers who may not be doing as

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.730
well and say to themselves,
well, I'm going to

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:23.840
wait for the CEO.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.380
Because I've got an MBA, and
I'm making $240,000 a year.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.180
Why should I be dating my buddy
from the block who's

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.760
working blue collar somewhere?

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.710
So what happens is you see this
population of women who

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.110
are holding out for a
higher status man.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:42.322
And sociologists actually call
it the George Clooney effect.

00:14:42.322 --> 00:14:44.250
[LAUGHING]

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:48.410
WENDY WALSH: So we are seeing
this population of women,

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.000
there are some behaving
like men.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.570
There are some saying, I'll
settle down when I feel like

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:54.490
it, because I know there
will be a greater guy.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:57.720
But remember, there's one
population of peer men who are

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.540
in their mom's basement.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.380
There's another population
of peer men who are not

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.390
committing any time
soon, all right?

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.595
So this is a message.

00:15:05.595 --> 00:15:07.010
AUDIENCE: The numbers
don't work out.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.520
WENDY WALSH: The numbers
don't work out.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.250
They're losing out.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.890
Because number three is, many
women are losing the freedom

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:12.760
to be mothers.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.860
This is the new feminist crisis
of our generation, and

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.320
it is this--

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:22.000
one in five women are losing
the freedom to be mothers.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.530
Because either their fertility
window closes before they can

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.620
get a guy to settle down, or
because they believe the

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.600
marketing mythology of the
fertility clinics.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.510
In vitro fertilization has not
improved since the 1980s.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.020
It's efficacy is
about the same.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.340
It's about 15% success rate.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.735
The average cost--

00:15:39.735 --> 00:15:42.900
I did a little bit of research--
is $13,700.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.780
So for your $13,700, you
have an 85% chance of

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:48.160
failing with in vitro.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.360
But every time a celebrity goes
on the news and says that

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.410
they bought a baby or grew an
egg or bought an egg or froze

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.350
an egg, everyone gets excited.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.910
Egg freezing-- don't even get me
started about egg freezing.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:58.950
We have not even thawed out
those suckers enough to know

00:15:58.950 --> 00:15:59.800
what's going to happen.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.745
You think autism was the big
diagnosis of our generation?

00:16:02.745 --> 00:16:04.660
Wait till you see kindergarten
classrooms filled

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.770
with thawed out eggs.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.410
And they're taking $20,000 of
women's hard earned after-tax

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.240
money to freeze their eggs.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.707
AUDIENCE: Well, women--

00:16:13.707 --> 00:16:15.663
why don't they go for men
who are older than them?

00:16:15.663 --> 00:16:17.619
Our windows are different.

00:16:17.619 --> 00:16:18.597
And men mature at a
different rate.

00:16:18.597 --> 00:16:19.855
So I think there's a natural--

00:16:19.855 --> 00:16:22.360
WENDY WALSH: There's lots of
solutions, yeah, but you have

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.530
to do it before your 35.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:25.820
The height of female
fertility--

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.530
anybody know?

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:27.533
[LAUGHING]

00:16:27.533 --> 00:16:30.311
AUDIENCE: I just had a baby.

00:16:30.311 --> 00:16:31.932
AUDIENCE: It is more that
they're losing the choice to

00:16:31.932 --> 00:16:33.280
be mothers, not necessarily
the freedom?

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.580
To your point earlier that
they're constantly choosing--

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.920
WENDY WALSH: Well, they think
they're choosing, but they're

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.010
not being given the
full picture.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.260
They're given the marketing of
the fertility clinics that

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.560
they can wait.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.390
So many young women think
they can have a baby

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:47.120
until they're 50.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.910
Quick question-- what do you
think the biological height of

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.810
female fertility is?

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:52.260
AUDIENCE: 32.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:52.910
AUDIENCE: 27.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:53.480
AUDIENCE: 25.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.990
WENDY WALSH: That's
a great example.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.590
You're closer.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.290
It's 20!

00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.327
It's 20.

00:16:58.327 --> 00:16:58.734
AUDIENCE: Oh, I understand.

00:16:58.734 --> 00:16:59.550
I thought you said--

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.170
WENDY WALSH: The height.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.670
No, the height.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:01.510
I'm sorry, the height.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.990
The best it gets.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:08.839
It takes a big decline at 30,
falls off a cliff at 35, OK?

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:10.198
AUDIENCE: That's, again,
the average.

00:17:10.198 --> 00:17:11.560
The variety is huge.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.480
WENDY WALSH: Yes, there's
a huge range.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.320
AUDIENCE: Some women lose
it at 28, and some

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:18.270
women lose it at 45.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.599
WENDY WALSH: Right.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.339
One of the women I interviewed
for my book actually had

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:24.960
fertility problems
in her late 20s.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.130
AUDIENCE: This is very complex,
because we go for our

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.910
career, and some of us are
choosing to opt out--

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.580
WENDY WALSH: This is
the big question.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.910
We're going to get there.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:33.830
We're going to get there.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:38.180
OK, I just want you to
understand that when sex

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:42.080
changes in price, it affects our
families, it affects our

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.610
cultures, it affects
everything.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.680
OK, so what happens to both
genders in a high supply

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.330
sexual economy?

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.930
Many are unknowingly shuttled
onto the sexual mass market.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:57.150
And so when I hear you guys talk
about these ideas that

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.745
people are having--

00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:04.040
that players are 25% or 60% of
men, that college students are

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.640
hooking up everywhere, I know
you're ingesting the message

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.470
of our culture that
sex is cheap.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:10.980
And sex is not cheap.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.700
A high supply sexual
economy creates a

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.550
myth of sexual freedom.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.730
The message it sends to
men is take all sex,

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.770
any sex, at any cost.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.250
And the cost to men--

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.280
usually, by the way, men don't
read relationship books.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.760
And I'll love you all if
you would read mine.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.880
But they do you call in to radio
shows, especially the

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.995
truckers in the middle
of the night.

00:18:30.995 --> 00:18:31.250
[LAUGHING]

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.800
WENDY WALSH: And they
do email me a lot.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.850
And I hear from so many
men who tell me, I'm

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:40.780
actually a good guy.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.840
I actually want a girlfriend.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.180
I actually would be happy
to have a family

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.260
before I'm too old.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.970
But all these girls are so
sexually aggressive right now,

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.030
and I can't get one to stay
still long enough.

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.670
So they're being overlooked by
their peers, maybe, because

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.650
they're not George Clooney.

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:59.090
And the other thing that
happens, the message to women

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:03.770
is have plenty of not-too-much
sex.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.150
Because we have this
thing called the

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:06.640
sexual double standard.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.070
And I want to explain to you why
the sexual double standard

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.270
is actually hardwired in men.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.810
What I tell women all the time
is, the good news is the

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:17.340
sexual double standard has
been completely erased--

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.940
but only in the minds
of women.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.040
And it's still very
much alive in men.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.020
And you can sit there and train,
and train, and train

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.690
men all you want, but it's a
reflex in them as hard-grained

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:29.860
as our fear of snakes.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.240
Did you know, by the way, I
teach some evolutionary

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.770
psychology at my kid's
high school.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.500
And I come with a bag.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.470
I pretend it's moving.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:37.800
It's got stuff in it.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.180
And I throw a big giant, very
realistic looking rubber snake

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:41.610
into the room.

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:42.600
And the kids scream!

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.310
And I go, why are
you so afraid?

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.010
And then I take the next
thing out, and

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.310
it's electrical cable.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.860
I go, in your lifetime, more
people die of electrocution

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.450
than snakebite ever.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.230
But you are hard-wired to
be afraid of snakes.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:58.210
So you are also hard-wired to
have a double standard.

00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.590
And here's why.

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.800
The double standard, by the way,
is the thing that gives

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.830
women demerit points for sexual
experience, and gives

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:09.610
men, woohoo, great, exciting
credit for the same sexual

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:10.530
experience.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:14.000
So in our hunter-gatherer past,
if a man happened to

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.810
hook up with a promiscuous
woman, and he spent his time

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:18.690
getting those squirrels or
woolly mammoths or anything

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:23.250
else for that offspring, he
would risk giving his time,

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.960
his resources, and protection
to somebody

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.260
else's offspring, OK?

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.900
So just to show you that this
fear is very real, in one

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.720
inobtrusive study in American
hospitals, they found out that

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.280
a full 10% of the babies born
do not match the DNA of the

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.955
doting daddy at bedside.

00:20:40.955 --> 00:20:43.640
Aw, so women fool around, too.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.347
AUDIENCE: Or maybe the men know
that it's not there, but

00:20:45.347 --> 00:20:48.160
they are there anyway.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.280
WENDY WALSH: Or they
may not know.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.350
This was an unobtrusive
study, yeah.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.520
Why do you think those
celebrities run right away for

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.770
a DNA a test whenever they get
that bill for the baby.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:57.930
It's the same thing.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.020
Whether you're bringing them
squirrels or paying an alimony

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.450
check or a child
support check.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:01.990
It's the same thing.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.860
Guys want to know.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.880
And by the way, guys didn't
invent monogamy.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.980
This new research came
out in the last--

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.580
I love that more women are
getting into anthropology.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.800
Apparently they're signing
up for that,

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.260
too, besides med school.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:16.230
So the belief was that monogamy
was invented because

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.970
women were so frail and
fragile during those

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:23.450
vulnerable years of pregnancy
and nursing that they needed

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.390
to have the protection
of a man.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.980
They needed to have
his resources--

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.420
OK, first of all, the
hunter-gatherer societies that

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.010
exist on the planet today, the
gatherers, primarily women,

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.530
bring home way more calories
than the hunters.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.090
The hunters get the glory,
because that

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:38.920
woolly mammoth is big.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.820
But if you just count nuts,
roots, and berries, we're

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.200
doing just fine without
you all.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.520
But what happened is women move
because we're gatherers.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.480
So women were the ones
roaming further

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.630
and further and further.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.070
And if a man wanted to be sure
that that was his offspring,

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.300
he better tag on to her and keep
going after her, right?

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.130
So it was actually men who
invented monogamy, they're now

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.460
suggesting, because they wanted
to make sure who their

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.920
offspring were.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.720
The double standard's around.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.580
It's probably not going
anywhere for

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.440
another 100,000 years.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.340
So that's the problem in the
high supply sexual economy, is

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:15.710
that women are loving their
sexual freedom but, at the

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:18.970
same time, astutely aware of
their count, and having

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:22.650
conflicted feelings about
what's going on.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:25.270
So let's talk about what
is natural mating.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.820
And some of the pictures that
you're going to see here, I'm

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.520
thrilled to tell you that
there are a few

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.390
hunter-gatherer societies
on the planet today.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.850
And many of them are being-- did
you see the new stuff from

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:37.540
the new tribe they found in
Peru in the last week?

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.350
Oh, go online.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:41.100
Google it.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.350
AUDIENCE: So every one of them,
there will be 100 people

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.820
and 300 anthropologists
around them?

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.650
WENDY WALSH: Exactly.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:46.840
Actually, you can't
go near them.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.590
Because there's a rule in Peru
that if you meet any

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.450
indigenous people, you
cannot touch them.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.270
You have to go far away.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.170
So most of these pictures--
maybe not this one in

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:55.550
particular, because
they're posing--

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.810
are taken with long
range telescopes.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:01.140
Because they will die from
diseases from us.

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.070
They're not ready
to be exposed to

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.140
our modern city diseases.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.130
So here's what our families
look like.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:14.290
We lived in a roving encampment
of maybe 25 to 35

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.450
people-- about the size of an
average office work group,

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:19.940
about the size of an
average classroom.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.930
This is a number that works
well for humans.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.070
Most of the people were
related to us.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.580
They were biologically
related.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.290
We lived with aunts, sisters,
cousins, mothers.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.770
We were protected
by our brothers.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:34.180
Probably the longest male-female
relationship and

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.830
the closest one in our history
was brothers and sisters.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.350
Because think about it-- your
siblings are with you your

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.430
whole life.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:40.880
Your parents eventually
die off.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.130
Your mate you meet and
stays for the second

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:43.720
half of your life.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.700
But your siblings are there from
the beginning and end.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.290
So they tend to be very helpful
with keeping-- anybody

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.120
who has a biological
interest in those

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.760
offspring help them grow.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.070
And in fact, anthropologists
are now showing that our

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:56.920
increase in intelligence is
largely related to this very

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.600
important family structure,
that if a child has

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.566
consistent--

00:24:00.566 --> 00:24:03.020
consistent is the key word, not
a new nanny fired every

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.250
week because you don't
like her--

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:07.860
OK, consistent primary
attachment figures.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.420
A young baby has to learn how
to decode different people's

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.560
ways and expressions when
they're pre-verbal.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:16.390
So that decoding process while
the brain is tripling in size

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:20.510
in the first year of life is
actually the big intelligent

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.710
explosion of humans.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:24.910
So we lived in these
encampments.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:26.730
We really didn't see many

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:28.510
non-biologically related people.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.940
Except, oh, yeah, those hunters,
the odd hunter, the

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.700
3% player, the Don Juan.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.880
He's meant to be in this
culture, too, for a reason.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.550
So he would travel a little
further with his little pack,

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.980
and, trying to look for woolly
mammoth, oh, he'd stumble on

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:41.660
our village.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.930
And all of a sudden, all the
women would sit up and take

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.780
notice, because there was
pheromones that smelled a lot

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.550
different than their brother.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:52.220
OK, so let's talk a little bit
about how anthropologists

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:58.830
decide whether a certain primate
species is monogamous,

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:02.270
promiscuous, or something
in between.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.740
AUDIENCE: Testicle size?

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.020
WENDY WALSH: Yeah, very good.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.340
It's scrotum size.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.890
So basically, we look at scrotum
size in relation to

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:10.180
body weight.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.540
So at one end of the scale,
you've got the orangutan--

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:17.240
big, hulking body, teeny
little nuts--

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.080
very paternal, very
monogamous.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.880
At the other end, you've
got the chimpanzee.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.780
I don't think you can take
a picture of a chimpanzee

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.730
without showing his balls,
they're so big.

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:27.050
[LAUGHING]

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.270
WENDY WALSH: Tiny, little,
fast-moving body, huge,

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:30.720
enormous gonads--

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.180
very promiscuous.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:35.640
So what do you think
human beings are?

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.520
We're somewhere in the middle.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.380
Because we have it all.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.130
We have it all.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.090
We have, some people would say,
a system of perceived

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:44.270
monogamy, or culturally imposed

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:47.360
monogamy, or some natural--

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.610
serial monogamy.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:51.130
In fact, because our life is so
long now, most people will

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:54.420
see at least two very long term
stints of monogamy in

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.660
their life span.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.580
When "till death do us
part" was invented,

00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.280
death was pretty imminent.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.080
[LAUGHING]

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.180
WENDY WALSH: So we'll probably
see long stints of monogamy.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.050
But, yeah.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:07.670
So this is why, in America
today, if we're looking at

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:11.050
paternal investment in one's
offspring, you are going to

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.260
see a guy who's only investment
in his offspring is

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.890
one teaspoon of sperm at the
one end of the scale.

00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:19.260
And at the other end of the
scale, you're going to see a

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:23.760
baby-wearing, carpool-driving,
softball-throwing, doting dad,

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.580
and everything in between.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.640
I happen to live in a
neighborhood that's a

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.120
wonderful--

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.850
I live in Playa Vista, a little
bedroom community, and

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.640
it's filled with small
children and babies.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:37.040
And I would say that at least
30% are stay-at-home dads.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.390
I don't know if they are working
from home offices.

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:41.150
But they line up those little
strollers by the basketball

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:42.720
courts in the morning-- it's
pretty hysterical-- and they

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.380
get their game in.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:47.790
I'm like, don't let the ball hit
the pink stroller, please.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.910
OK, but I mentioned
attachment.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:52.630
My area of interest is an area
of psychology called

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:53.700
attachment theory.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.420
It's the ways human beings
attach across a lifespan.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.870
And specifically, the mass
media talks about

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:02.550
mother-infant attachment,
father-infant attachment,

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.520
because we know that that is
the foundation for healthy

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.300
personality development.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.180
And it eventually translates
into a healthy love

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.730
relationship in adult life.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:16.060
So a healthy attachment means
that you've got caregivers who

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.350
are responsive to a child's
needs, and they help create

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.760
emotional intelligence,
feelings of security.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.390
When a baby is not stressing
about when mom's coming back

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:25.860
or because their diaper is wet
or they're crying because they

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.420
need food, guess what?

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.780
They're having this moment
of quiet looking

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:31.630
out into the world.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.420
And their brain is growing
synapses like crazy as they're

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.380
able to learn.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:39.040
If a baby lives stressed, not
feeling safe, they don't grow

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.020
as much in intelligence.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:42.490
So attachment is primary.

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:45.010
It leads to intellectual
intelligence, as I mentioned,

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:47.750
less anxiety, depression,
personality disorders.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.440
Attachment is now being linked
to so much stuff that's

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.090
happening later in life.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:54.380
And more than anything, the
thing I care about is that it

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.750
becomes a blueprint for love
that transfers eventually to

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.830
adult relationships.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.600
This is one of the pictures that
was taken last week of

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.140
this new tribe they
found in Peru.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.200
They're all over Google
right now.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.050
They're really great pictures.

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:10.100
This is what our biology
is wired for,

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.730
to live near nature.

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.600
And there's a psychologist
in Canada--

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.540
I'm Canadian, so I love
to quote this guy.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.770
I think his book is called "Last
Child in the Woods." And

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:21.070
he coined a new diagnosis that
he calls Nature Deficit

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.760
Disorder in children, and they
are associating with ADD,

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.340
ADHD, anxiety issues,
et cetera.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.140
So we're meant to be surrounded
by nature.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.890
This is what our biology
is wired for.

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:34.730
We're meant to be with a very
safe, secure group of not more

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.340
than 30, 35 people.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.950
And every once in awhile, you
get a new hunter, or you meet

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:41.470
with another band of
30, 35 people.

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.380
And you say, oh, that's probably
only my third cousin.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.900
I think that'd be fine, right?

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.810
And that's how we made it.

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:51.230
This is what we are wired for.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:54.300
But this is what our biology
is responding to--

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:58.750
crowded subways, crowded
nightclubs,

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:01.400
crowded digital worlds.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:06.440
So imagine your biology now
responding to all these

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:11.400
objects, pheromones, cues that a
new hunter has walked in, or

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.900
you ventured on a new place
with new young--

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.610
but our biology is
going crazy.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:19.410
Because actually, sex with
somebody who you weren't

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:21.950
related to was a trace
nutrient in our

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:23.730
anthropological past.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:27.190
I make the comparison between
the slow food movement.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:31.590
Sugar, salt, and fat were vital
but trace nutrients in

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.340
our anthropological past.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.720
Our smart corporations realize
that we have an unsatiated

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.840
craving for salt,
sugar, and fat.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.260
So they put it into absolutely
everything

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.240
to make us get addicted.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.536
So the slow love movement, which
I'm going to be talking

00:29:45.536 --> 00:29:48.880
to you about, is very much like
the slow food movement.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.250
Remember, this is what
we're wired for.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.200
This was taken with a long
range telescope.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.530
And this is this new tribe in
Peru that I can't pronounce

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:56.030
the name of.

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:58.400
This is really what
we're wired for.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.650
And this is what we have.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.220
This is what we need--

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.650
high nutrition relationships
that are good for our biology,

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.030
that are good for our
psychology, and, more than

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:13.300
anything, good for
our offspring.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.580
Of course, the answer
is to charge the

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.080
highest price for sex.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:23.695
And that price is care
and commitment.

00:30:23.695 --> 00:30:26.570
I was holding a lot of focus
groups for my book, because I

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.870
pulled up all the research-- and
by the way, I didn't start

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.130
out to write a book called
"The 30 Day Love Detox--

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:34.280
don't have sex for 30 days, or
you're going to break up." I

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:38.670
set out to write a book about
Love 2.0, Love 3.0.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.070
I want to pull all the
research and see

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.300
what's going on.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:44.270
And the research spoke
to me, and I started

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:46.090
pulling in focus groups.

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:47.110
And that's how I met Marty.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.770
Thank you very much.

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:49.600
Marty was at one of my original
focus groups when I

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.090
was researching my book.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:52.050
AUDIENCE: You knew me
from somewhere.

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.100
WENDY WALSH: I pulled in groups
of women, and I just

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.670
asked them to talk to me about
their dating lives and what

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:57.740
was going on.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:01.210
And what I discovered is that a
lot of women-- because we're

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.760
going back to the beginning
now-- who believe that we're

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.990
in this high supply sexual
economy, where every guy's a

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.630
player and every woman should
comply, are signing up for

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:10.890
these low criteria relationships
that don't

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:13.110
actually suit their biology.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:16.970
A low criteria relationship is
one where they text a lot.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:19.160
They meet for dinner and sex
every once in awhile.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.310
Their families haven't met.

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:21.780
They haven't ever talked
about a future.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:25.070
And, oh, they forgot to mention
sexual exclusivity.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:27.600
So these are the low criteria
relationships that are

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.350
existing today.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.250
And they work great for guys, by
the way, with no fertility

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:35.440
window, and it's
not a problem.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.040
But to actually take
the time--

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:40.240
Now, here are the myths that I
came up with that are really

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.760
keeping people single.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.870
The first is this idea that we
talked about already, that the

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:46.400
hookup culture is everywhere
and everybody's doing it.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.020
It's not.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:50.280
The media is selling you
products using sex and selling

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.970
you reality shows using lots
of hook-up sex to get your

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.520
eyeballs there, because this
was trace nutrients in our

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.760
anthropological past.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.970
This idea that women have
sexual needs-- women's

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:04.800
sexuality is very responsive,
meaning that women's biology

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.460
gets geared up when they meet
someone they're interested in.

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.260
All of a sudden everything
gets charged up

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.410
and they get excited.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:13.210
But when that interest goes
away, everything calms down

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:15.000
and gets suppressed
for a while.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.160
Women don't tend to replace
their boyfriend with

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.410
pornography and masturbation.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:21.400
That's a guy thing.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.890
Guys do that.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:24.650
Women, it just goes away.

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:26.610
And then they meet someone else
they're interested in,

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:27.990
and it all charges up again.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:31.130
But what I hear a lot of women
say today, because, again,

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:34.060
they've been adopting a male
model of sexuality, is, well,

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.310
what about my needs?

00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:36.960
What about my sexual needs?

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.230
Well, when you look at the
research, plenty of women have

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:41.470
sex because they're
actually looking--

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:44.130
sometimes they have a desire
to be desired.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:47.170
Sometimes they just want
closeness and companionship.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:50.970
So the sexual act is something
that they will do because

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:52.790
they're getting all those
other things.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:54.780
So when I hear about, what
about my sexual needs?

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.920
I always say, you know, guys
are a little different.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.680
Guys are wired to be a little
more like basic plumbing--

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.000
clean the pipes every
once in a while.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.710
And every guy's different--
sometimes it's once a day,

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:04.290
once a month, twice
a week, whatever.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:05.360
Everybody's got their thing.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.180
They use their girlfriend.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:06.860
They use their hand.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:07.920
They use their porn.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.080
Did you know--

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.170
I'm telling you guys this-- one
third of all content on

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:13.230
the internet is porn.

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:15.460
Which is causing a whole other
problem for guys, because,

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.290
again, that's junk food sex.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:18.920
So it's desensitizing them.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.180
They're having trouble with
real, live, warm-bodied women.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:24.400
Because it's not a new
visual stimulation.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.250
What makes long term monogamy
work is a very

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.600
rich fantasy life.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.000
And porn disables your fantasy
life because you're being fed

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.920
new images all the time.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.435
OK, this is the one that people
always ask me about.

00:33:36.435 --> 00:33:38.560
Well, what about sexual
chemistry?

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.860
You've got to make sure you've
got that sexual chemistry.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:45.380
Like somehow winning the husband
lottery is what you're

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:45.900
trying to do.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.500
If you just hit on enough,
eventually you'll go, oh!

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:49.520
It's perfect.

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:52.880
Well, actually, one study of
more than 2,000 couples showed

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.920
that the hotter the sexual
chemistry early on, the worse

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.460
the relationship outcomes--

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.060
the more breakups, the
more fighting.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.140
Because sex is a trick.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:07.080
What it does is your body is
overwhelmed with hormones, and

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.670
your neurotransmitters are
on fire with excitement.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.989
It's not unlike heroin,
in fact.

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:15.719
So while you're on this heroin
high of dopamine, [INAUDIBLE],

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:18.670
you literally are not making
decisions about whether this

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:20.340
person would be a good
partner for you.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.850
You're saying, they're perfect
because I'm orgasming.

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:23.497
They're perfect.

00:34:23.497 --> 00:34:24.719
I'm getting off.

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:25.540
It's great.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:28.420
And then, when your body starts
to get accustomed to

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:32.570
the dopamine hits, you go, oh,
now who are they again?

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.409
What was that about?

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:36.080
And then you say, well, we just
didn't have chemistry,

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.150
and you move on.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.790
Actually, studies of long-term
married people, and even

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:42.250
arranged marriages, shows that
sexual chemistry is something

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:43.159
that's fashioned.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:45.920
It's fashioned out of intimacy,
emotional intimacy,

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.040
where can actually say,
here's who I am.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.010
I'm not necessarily part
of the hook-up culture.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:52.590
I'm part of this, or I like to
do this, or I like to do that.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.210
But if you don't have emotional
intimacy, you can't

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:57.040
even talk about it, right?

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:00.000
And the last one, this idea that
sex leads to love that I

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.620
talk about.

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:03.060
Sometimes for women, sex
does lead to love.

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.990
But it rarely does for men.

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:05.440
You know what?

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.445
Men don't fall in love
through sex.

00:35:06.445 --> 00:35:08.570
Men fall in love
through trust.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:10.980
And because of the sexual double
standard, they don't

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.980
really trust women
who are easy.

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.940
So it's a crazy catch-22 that
women are being forced into.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.630
And finally, this idea that
promiscuity can be turned off.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:21.880
Do you know how often I hear
people say, look, I'm doing

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.370
this for now, but when I settle
down, I'm just going to

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:25.390
settle down.

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:27.480
I would venture to say that
every relationship you have in

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.620
your life is a training ground
for every relationship you're

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:30.850
going to have in your future.

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:33.390
And the only way to train for
monogamy is to abstain or be

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.420
monogamous, actually.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.650
Because you're setting yourself
up for needing more

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:40.690
variety of stimuli.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:44.780
So I hope I've been able to
explain to you how the slow

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:49.030
love movement is a lot like
the slow food movement.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:52.800
When Carlos Petrini, the chef
who started the slow food

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:58.250
movement in Italy, when he saw
the McDonald's go up near the

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:01.070
famous Spanish Steps in Rome and
finally put his foot down

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.280
and said, enough.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.180
We will return to the
family table.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.710
We will have slow food.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:09.640
We will not have mass-produced,
high-technology

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.940
food, and started this
slow food movement.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:13.430
And we've started to
see little farmers'

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:15.140
markets crop up.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.600
The beginning of that, they
all thought we were nuts.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.120
They thought we were a bunch
of hippies, in the '80s and

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.720
'90s, growing our food
and being organic.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.120
Well, now what do we know
about nutrition?

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.960
We realize that high-tech,
mass-produced food is not what

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.730
we should be taking
into our body.

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:33.080
And the same thing
with high-tech,

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.580
mass-produced junk food sex.

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:40.320
Farmers' markets, in my mind,
equals the kind of close,

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.070
emotional, loving, supportive
intimacy that

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.200
we want in our lives.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.200
And so I came up with this
idea of slow love.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.870
Oh, and by the way, my book
is called "The 30 Day Love

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:51.930
Detox," because one study I
found showed that if you have

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.540
sex within 30 days of meeting
somebody, you've got about a

00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.560
90% chance of being broken
up within one year.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.600
If you wait only 31 to 90 days,
the stats go to about

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.750
25% that you'll still
be together.

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:03.700
But what does it mean?

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:06.160
It means that you're building
some kind of friendship, some

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.100
kind of connection before the
onset of the heroin that

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:09.900
you're going to do.

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:10.960
So slow love--

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.660
[LAUGHING]

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.060
WENDY WALSH: --is about
purging low nutrition

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:15.760
relationships.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.960
The other thing I've noticed
that people do to satisfy

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.470
themselves emotionally while
they're in one of those low

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:22.540
criteria relationships, the
one that's just mostly

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:26.650
text-based and meet for dinner
and sex, is they keep their

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:30.120
self-esteem by having a bunch
of other partners online.

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.910
When I say partners, I mean
potential partners.

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:33.030
They've got Facebook friends.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.880
They've got Twitter.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.850
They've kept in touch with their
high school sweetheart.

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:36.950
They've got maybe ex.

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:38.740
They've got somebody
at the office.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:43.290
Part of purging low nutrition
relationships includes purging

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.880
all those digital relationships
that are not

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.690
really bringing you emotional
sustenance.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:51.050
And then delaying the onset of
sex with a new partner--

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:54.610
I could not find any research to
show that waiting too long

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:55.600
was too long.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.820
Also for my book, I interviewed
these born again

00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:01.440
virgins, men and women who
decided to opt out of the high

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.180
supply sexual economy and
just say, mmm, it's

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:04.970
really not for me.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:06.690
I'm going to wait until
I find someone.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:10.520
And I also interviewed former
virgins who were now married,

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.020
nursing babies.

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:16.650
One woman was a Harvard MBA
Wall Street broker, and

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:18.190
dressed sexy as anybody else.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:18.880
And I said, hah!

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.310
I wanted to know, how
do you say no?

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:20.960
How can you say no?

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.750
You're looking hot.

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:23.920
You're going out on dates
with same guys.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.690
How can you, when the pressure
comes on-- and what I heard

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:31.710
over and over from women is
that when you are so sure

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:34.550
inside yourself, men and women,
that this is what you

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:37.420
want for your health, that it's
really easy to say no.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:39.930
Because you're not even
pressured that much.

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:44.760
But this one 25-year-old MBA
virgin, I asked her, so what

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.230
do you do when a guy says, oh,
come on, I'm going to get it

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.650
from somebody.

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:48.820
I might as well get
it from you.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.410
I mean, you know I'm going to
go out there and get it.

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:53.350
So come on, you and I, we've
been dating for a while.

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:55.420
And she said, oh, I love
it when they say that.

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.950
I just say, actually, I don't
think you can get sex with me

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:00.660
from someone else.

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:03.280
So the point is she
values herself.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.960
I know a college student
girl who--

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.440
the pressure line from the guy
was, I don't think I should

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.260
have to work for sex.

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.490
And she said, I'm not sex.

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:12.550
I'm Sheryl.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:13.490
Right?

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:17.220
So it's about understanding
what's going on

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.750
and where you fit.

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.140
The other thing is to make sure
that you are brave enough

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:23.460
to ask for sexual exclusivity.

00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:27.310
Isn't it amazing that although,
as I say, 20%

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.970
percent of men may be able to
obtain sex on a first date,

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.610
80% of women are smart enough
not to expose their eggs and

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:34.365
their bloodstream to somebody
they wouldn't even give the

00:39:34.365 --> 00:39:36.420
keys to their apartment to to
water their plants while

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.510
they're out of town, right?

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:40.000
So we get into these sexual
relationships, and plenty of

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.420
people are afraid to ask for
exclusivity when STDs are

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:44.840
running rampant in
our culture.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.980
It's so simple to just ask.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.650
The "what are we" conversation
is so difficult

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:50.880
for people to have.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.540
And then, of course, to make
sure you use the F word, which

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.460
are "feelings." How do
you feel about this?

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:56.640
What's going on?

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.840
And to practice intellectual
commitment.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.500
Now, what is intellectual
commitment?

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.310
Love and sex are what happens
at the beginning of a

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:03.970
relationship.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:05.980
But once all the hormones die
down, then it becomes an

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.470
intellectual commitment.

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:10.280
And that's when I hear people
say all the time, well, I want

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.820
to keep my options open.

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.800
Or, I want to just--

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.140
later I'll be-- and I'm just
like, no, why don't you make

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.750
an intellectual commitment like
you do in an exercise

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:19.700
program, to a diet?

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:20.920
See what happens.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.280
See what you learn, even if
you're just practicing

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.910
emotional intimacy.

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:26.420
Because here's why.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.700
It's very well researched--

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:32.340
long-term, monogamous bonded
people actually have higher

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.540
life expectancies.

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:36.280
They live longer.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.190
AUDIENCE: How do you control?

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:38.420
How do you be sure?

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:39.950
WENDY WALSH: Do you know
Dan Buettner's

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:41.190
work "The Blue Zones"?

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:42.350
Anybody read "The Blue Zones"?

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:45.260
It's these five areas on the
planet they call blue zones

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:46.990
where a disproportionate amount
of people live to be

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.340
over the age of 100.

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.900
And then he looks for
commonalities between these

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:51.940
five areas--

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:55.310
and long-term married
partners.

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:57.952
None of the men over 100
have been playboys.

00:40:57.952 --> 00:41:00.470
They have like one wife
taking care of them.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:04.180
Actually, health-wise, monogomy
benefits men more

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.380
than women, believe it or not.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.510
Women's health goes down just a
little bit, because they're

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:09.140
doing double duty.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.250
Men tend to have much better
health if they're in a

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:12.590
relationship.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.680
Long-term married people of
course accumulate more wealth.

00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:17.310
Do you know how expensive
divorce is?

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:19.520
Or maintaining two houses
with a baby mama

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.170
and a bunch of kids?

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:21.260
Or two baby mamas?

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:22.060
Yeah.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:25.960
Putting it all in one big pot
and planning for the future.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.450
Their offspring do a
whole lot better.

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.120
I always say this to young
men when I see them out

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:30.880
at parties and stuff.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.420
I go, OK, here's a little
quiz for you.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.970
If your choice tonight is to
hook up with five women and

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:37.600
hope that three of them have
your babies, and you never see

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:41.470
them again, or you find one
woman and stay with her for 20

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:44.030
years and two kids and put them
through college, where

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:47.530
are your genes going to be in
five generations from now?

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:49.190
Are your genes going to stay
in evolution's chain?

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:51.810
I think this is the
better way.

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:55.020
OK, I'll close it with
by the numbers.

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.500
Average lifetime number of
sexual partners by gender--

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.200
this is a new study for Centers
for Disease Control

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.960
that came out in 2009.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.200
Now, here's what you
should know.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.630
AUDIENCE: This must be median.

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:05.080
WENDY WALSH: I'm sorry?

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.330
AUDIENCE: The mean
has to be equal.

00:42:08.736 --> 00:42:09.102
WENDY WALSH: No.

00:42:09.102 --> 00:42:10.410
Here's why.

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:12.446
I love having bright
people in the room.

00:42:12.446 --> 00:42:13.280
[LAUGHING]

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.940
WENDY WALSH: Even on anonymous
sexual surveys, men lie up and

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.775
women lie down.

00:42:16.775 --> 00:42:17.964
AUDIENCE: Oh, so
these are lies.

00:42:17.964 --> 00:42:18.790
These aren't actual--

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:19.115
AUDIENCE: Reported.

00:42:19.115 --> 00:42:20.600
WENDY WALSH: These
are reported.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:28.130
OK, yes, so your mean answer
is five, right?

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:29.750
It's probably five.

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:32.210
This is a Centers for Disease
Control study of more than

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:33.430
6,000 people.

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:35.730
And this is age 18 to 44.

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:37.000
So it's not over--

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.510
middle age is not encompassed
there.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:42.800
And by the way, anything I've
talked about today, please

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.660
feel free to contact me.

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.372
I've got all the references and
the studies if you want to

00:42:45.372 --> 00:42:46.200
look into them a
little further.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:47.130
And they're all in my reference

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:47.970
section of my book, too.

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:50.470
I think some of you are going
to get a copy of the book.

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:53.700
OK, so now I want you to
understand that if the mean is

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:57.220
5, the number of people who have
had sex with more than 15

00:42:57.220 --> 00:43:00.660
people is 27% men
and 10% women.

00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:04.350
Again, men lie up and brag,
women lie down.

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:06.660
So I don't know, maybe
it's 15%, 17%.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:07.320
Yeah.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:11.730
So that's also pulling that
number, that 6 and 4.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:15.050
That still brings in that 27%
of men who have 15 or more.

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:17.940
So even to say that the average
lifetime partners is 5

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:20.878
for men is even a little high.

00:43:20.878 --> 00:43:22.774
AUDIENCE: Do you think the men
with a lot of sexual partners

00:43:22.774 --> 00:43:24.196
actually lie down, and
the average lie up?

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.600
WENDY WALSH: That's
a good point.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:32.110
But in general, the way our
culture is, men tend to over--

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:33.600
yeah, but you're right.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.660
So you're saying, once they hit
a certain point, even they

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.510
know that, culturally, having
300 partners is not cool.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:41.510
[LAUGHING]

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:45.770
WENDY WALSH: So they'll start
to take it to 30, right?

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:48.290
But my favorite study is the
number of men who would prefer

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:51.550
a romantic date over
a hook up is 75%.

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:54.270
Women are always surprised
by this number.

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:57.090
Is there any man in this room
who can help explain to the

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:58.700
women why this number
is this number?

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.650
Is there any man who would
prefer a romantic date to a

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:02.234
hook-up in this room?

00:44:02.234 --> 00:44:03.202
AUDIENCE: One is very--

00:44:03.202 --> 00:44:06.590
it's over, and that's it.

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:11.042
WENDY WALSH: And so a romantic
date could lead to--

00:44:11.042 --> 00:44:12.800
[LAUGHING]

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.800
WENDY WALSH: --well consistent,
frequent sex.

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.460
It also could lead to all the
other things-- a relationship.

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:19.650
Oh, God forbid.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:21.680
It could actually lead to all
the social support that you

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:24.260
need, that accumulation of
wealth, the better health, and

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.520
everything else.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:29.470
So even men like romance
and like slow love.

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:32.060
But women feel that somehow--

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:35.290
in fact, when that population
of women who've adopted the

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:37.930
male model of sexuality, they're
actually not adopting

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:39.470
a male model of sexuality.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.590
They're adopting the
three-percenter.

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:42.540
Because that's what they know.

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:45.260
That's been the most
obvious to them.

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:48.840
So if you love better, you
can actually live better.

00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.440
And there's all my contact.

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:51.730
And let's start with
some questions.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:45:00.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:02.100
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much
for this talk.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.490
It was very, very interesting.

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:05.330
Thanks, Marty, for putting
this together.

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:08.550
I had one comment and
one question.

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:12.540
My comment is I used to teach
sex health in college.

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.060
And I feel like so many students
would benefit from

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:17.550
seeing these numbers when they
first enter into college.

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:20.435
Because as you said, the
media's totally off.

00:45:20.435 --> 00:45:22.840
And I grew up watching "Friends"
before going to

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.870
college, and I was like, oh,
everybody's just in bed with

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:25.850
each other all the time.

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:27.714
[LAUGHS]

00:45:27.714 --> 00:45:29.640
WENDY WALSH: I actually have an
answer of how you all can

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.330
help me with that.

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:34.070
Marty very kindly has a camera
here for a reason.

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.480
I'm going to use part of this as
an audition tape for NACA,

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.570
National Association of Campus
Activities, to audition to get

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:40.760
on the college circuit.

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.670
So I should put a link up.

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:46.360
If anyone emails me any quote
about this talk that's

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.000
positive, I'll put
it on my flyer.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.180
Yeah, I'll put anything you
can give me positive.

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.440
And you're always welcome to
go and refer me for a TED

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.670
Talk, just saying.

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:54.960
[LAUGHING]

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.670
WENDY WALSH: It's online.

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:57.236
You just fill it in.

00:45:57.236 --> 00:45:57.600
Go ahead.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.610
What's your question?

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:02.800
AUDIENCE: And then another
thing-- you refer to the whole

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:05.130
economic background of this.

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:08.430
I definitely believe it's an
exchange, and there's lots of

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:10.210
sex economics going on.

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:13.600
But I think a major part of
economics is understanding the

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:16.720
marginal utilities and being
open about your functions.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:20.830
So I feel like everybody might
not be within these numbers or

00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:21.940
these ranges or anything
like that.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:24.872
But I think a very important
thing along with slow love is

00:46:24.872 --> 00:46:27.140
just open and honest love,
like from the beginning--

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:27.520
WENDY WALSH: Exactly!

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.790
AUDIENCE: What you're looking
for, what you want.

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:32.085
Sometimes the men want something
that traditionally a

00:46:32.085 --> 00:46:32.705
woman would want.

00:46:32.705 --> 00:46:33.990
Sometimes the woman
wants something--

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:36.260
WENDY WALSH: Yeah, I think there
are as many men who are

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:38.010
afraid to say, I want
a relationship.

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:38.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:42.060
Yeah, and I think you can have
completely healthy hook-up

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.050
relationships where a woman gets
what she needs because

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:46.275
that's what she needs
at that given time.

00:46:46.275 --> 00:46:48.920
But what she needs might
change later on.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.230
WENDY WALSH: And then,
unfortunately, it sometimes

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:53.540
biologically changes because of
the biological changes that

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:55.810
happen-- either she's
starting to feel

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:57.510
bonded because of the--

00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:59.300
I interviewed so many people
for this book.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.310
And some of them said, here's
the thing about hook-ups.

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:04.710
It always starts out fun, until
somebody gets hurt.

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:07.780
Because eventually, one person
likes the other person more.

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:08.012
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:08.012 --> 00:47:10.790
And that's, I think, when maybe
you're not being honest

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:13.540
to yourself about how your
utility function has changed.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:14.450
WENDY WALSH: Yeah, the
first person to be

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:15.740
honest with is yourself.

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:16.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:20.580
Yeah, so I think it would be
really cool, how you built the

00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:24.350
basic economic thing, if you
extrapolate out to how

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:26.260
people's functions can be
different and how they change

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.900
over a lifetime, and how what
you look for is different, and

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:30.665
that might lead to serial
monogamy and

00:47:30.665 --> 00:47:31.330
that kind of thing.

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:34.750
WENDY WALSH: The two times where
men and women need each

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:37.950
other the most are when they are
raising offspring who are

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:42.310
very small children, the zero
to 10, or zero to to 12, and

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:43.840
my age, as we get older,
and we're looking for

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.200
companionship to settle
down with, as health

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:48.290
problems start to happen.

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:48.920
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:49.720
WENDY WALSH: Thanks.

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:50.970
AUDIENCE: Any other questions?

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.770
AUDIENCE: What effect do you
think STDs had in early human

00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:58.020
sexual development?

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:02.900
WENDY WALSH: Well, I'm only
guessing, but I would say that

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.750
in the early sexual development,
STDs--

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:08.110
because, again, these are small
populations of people.

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:10.490
So if they came like any other
disease, if they came through,

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:11.910
they wiped out a group.

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:14.830
Remember, at one point there
were 27 humanoid species

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:17.930
living together, and some of
them mixing and mating even.

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:19.570
So that's even separate
from the other

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:21.100
four primate species.

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.170
So plenty of them got knocked
out along the way as we zeroed

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:25.100
down into one.

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.020
And STDs were one way.

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:28.482
Lots of other diseases, too.

00:48:28.482 --> 00:48:32.550
AUDIENCE: So how did that affect
how people are now?

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:34.590
WENDY WALSH: So you're thinking
it might have most

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:38.050
knocked out the people who were
the most promiscuous?

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:39.140
Is that your guess?

00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:39.470
AUDIENCE: I don't know
if that's true.

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.856
Maybe.

00:48:39.856 --> 00:48:40.750
WENDY WALSH: I don't know.

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:43.410
Does that sound like
it could have been?

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:47.130
I think that if we stayed
too 100% monogamous--

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:50.010
although, there are plenty
of species that are 100%

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:52.860
monogamous, and they tend to
procreate and do just fine.

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:55.040
But I think what was important
for humans is that we had the

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:58.180
three-percenter who wandered
so that we could mix up the

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.040
gene pool as much as possible.

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.410
You know about the Swiss
t-shirt study, right?

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:03.620
The smelling of pheromones?

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:07.920
OK, so the Swiss t-shirt study
is where they put a bunch of

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.850
men and asked them to
sleep in the same--

00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:11.260
they each had their own--

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:13.190
t-shirt every night
for 14 nights.

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:15.960
And then they put it in a Ziploc
bag every morning to

00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:16.545
lock in the freshness.

00:49:16.545 --> 00:49:18.590
And at the end of a couple
weeks, they had a panel of

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:20.440
women just smell the t-shirts.

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:23.340
And what they found is, the
pheromones that the women

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:26.520
found most attractive were
those that had the most

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:27.920
disparate immune systems.

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:31.280
Because when you mate with
somebody, you take one gene

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:33.530
from another and another from
another, so that you've got

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:35.670
blue eyes from one, and long
legs from another, and brown

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:36.480
hair from another, et cetera.

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.820
Except immune systems--
they combine.

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:42.280
So we can actually sniff out
when people have immune

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.600
systems that are too
similar to us.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.370
That's why our brothers
smell so nasty to us.

00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:47.360
Honestly, they do.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.080
I remember growing up, thinking,
guys, take a shower.

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.490
But I didn't notice it
with other guys.

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.360
And what else was I going
to say about STDs?

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:59.400
So in the same sense, I think
along the way, people have

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:04.630
been using all kinds of ways to
attract mates separate and

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:06.370
aside from just visual.

00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:08.280
Visual's a big one for men.

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:10.660
And women most vote for
intelligence and kindness over

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:11.580
looks, by the way, you guys.

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:12.995
So don't worry about your
hair or worry about

00:50:12.995 --> 00:50:14.230
how funny you are.

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:16.438
Because it's connected
to intelligence, too.

00:50:16.438 --> 00:50:17.782
AUDIENCE: You could
have funny hair.

00:50:17.782 --> 00:50:18.650
WENDY WALSH: You could
have funny hair.

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:19.684
That would be great.

00:50:19.684 --> 00:50:21.010
[LAUGHING]

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:22.330
WENDY WALSH: Anyway--

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:24.780
AUDIENCE: Any other questions?

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:27.180
AUDIENCE: You said that a lot
of the stuff that you say is

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:30.811
not politically correct, which
is probably like the

00:50:30.811 --> 00:50:31.969
understatement of the--

00:50:31.969 --> 00:50:33.890
WENDY WALSH: [LAUGHS]

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:38.680
AUDIENCE: Do you have the
Women's Studies department

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:42.540
parked out across your office
with torches and forks.

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:46.670
WENDY WALSH: The true feminists
understand that true

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:50.820
feminine, female sexual freedom
is to have choice.

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:53.630
And I don't actually
say there's one

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:55.280
right way to do anything.

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.770
I can give you statistical
probabilities.

00:50:57.770 --> 00:51:00.170
I can tell you a little bit
about your biology.

00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:03.470
By the way, the more sexual
partners a man has had, the

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:06.630
more likely he is to perceive
diminished attractiveness in

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:07.590
each new mate.

00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:09.050
So it's a race to the
bottom for him.

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:11.240
Every new woman rolls over
easy, it disappoints him.

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.310
This was a big study
out of UCLA.

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:15.760
The more sexual partners a woman
has had, the more likely

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.750
she is to be on an
antidepressant.

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:19.770
Now, it could be working
in reverse.

00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:22.270
Depressed women could be using
sex to self-medicate.

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:24.730
We don't necessarily assume
causality there.

00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:27.150
But we look at all this, and
we look at the picture of

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:30.810
what's going on, and we listen
to our own bodies, our own

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:33.320
souls, and we ask for what
nutrition is out there.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.860
I wrote a blog a couple--

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:36.790
and you're all welcome to
subscribe to my blog.

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:38.820
I send out a weekly
newsletter.

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:39.730
AUDIENCE: Or your
YouTube channel.

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:42.151
WENDY WALSH: My YouTube
channel, of course!

00:51:42.151 --> 00:51:44.990
I wrote a blog about how
I really have this new,

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:49.060
enlightened thinking that the
Muslim hijab is actually a

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:52.330
great act of female
sexual freedom.

00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:53.920
Because I spent a
month in London.

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:58.110
I talked to a lot of Muslim
women, these young, hot girls

00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:00.130
working at Starbucks
with their hijab.

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:02.760
And I would just talk to
them about who they

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:03.990
were, and very modern.

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:06.560
And they said, listen, you guys
think you've got female

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:09.190
sexual freedom, and you are
doing Brazilian waxes,

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:11.950
vajazziling, bleaching your
anus, all to please men and

00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:13.010
the porn industry?

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:15.300
Like, that's female
sexual freedom?

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.050
And I looked at them, and I
thought, you know what?

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:20.900
This whole idea of choosing to
be modest, nothing put on

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:24.210
them-- nobody says on Oxford
Street, you've got to wear a

00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:24.980
hijab, right?

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:27.705
So the choice to be
modest is power.

00:52:27.705 --> 00:52:30.080
It's female power.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:33.900
And there was a feminist who I
quoted in my blog who said,

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:36.810
bearing your breasts on YouTube
isn't necessarily

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:37.950
female power.

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:39.270
Neither is wearing a hijab.

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:42.000
What's female power is being
able to have the choice.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.350
And that's freedom, to
understand all the various

00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:48.500
choices available to you.

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:52.640
AUDIENCE: So you answered the
question of why it is that

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:55.270
feminists should not
be angry with you.

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:57.152
WENDY WALSH: Oh, but are
some of them angry?

00:52:57.152 --> 00:52:58.550
AUDIENCE: I don't think you're
politically incorrect.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:00.880
I think, from a woman's
standpoint,

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.135
you're spot on, actually.

00:53:02.135 --> 00:53:04.250
WENDY WALSH: I think teaching
women to understand their

00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:07.090
biology and respect it and
empower them to live out their

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:09.190
biology is good.

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:13.320
I do have a few women, usually
the undergraduates at the

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.500
university level who are
very pro-fem, they'll

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:16.330
walk out the back.

00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:17.975
I'll watch them go, [SIGHS],
close their

00:53:17.975 --> 00:53:19.920
books, and walk out.

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:21.760
And then there'll be a few
that'll stay later for the

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.080
chitchat who will be like, so
I've been hooking up with this

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:25.910
guy for a while, thought
he was my boyfriend.

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:27.740
And I just saw on Facebook
that my friend

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:27.950
slept with him, and--

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:29.318
[PRETENDS TO CRY]

00:53:29.318 --> 00:53:30.230
[LAUGHING]

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:31.650
WENDY WALSH: I'm like, did you
ever have a talk with him

00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:33.830
about exclusivity?

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:36.910
So it's just a matter of being
authentic with ourselves and

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:39.860
our feelings and being able
to talk to people.

00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:42.570
I know you guys are in the tech
business, and it's all

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:43.730
about [TYPING NOISES]

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:44.400
now.

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.560
But I do say that when you
have a relationship with

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:49.790
somebody by text, whether
it's business, whatever

00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:52.500
relationship, it's like
listening to your favorite

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:55.710
band without the drummer
or the lead singer.

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:57.180
So you're missing a lot.

00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:58.925
When we communicate,
we have visual.

00:53:58.925 --> 00:54:00.390
We have body language.

00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:01.390
You've got vocal tone.

00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:02.230
You're smelling me.

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:03.590
We've got pheromones.

00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:06.970
Your brain is taking in so much
information right now.

00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:08.760
But when you're [TYPING NOISES],
you're

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:11.590
actually putting yourself on.

00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:13.340
That's why people fall
into catfishes.

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:16.800
Because they are projecting
their own needs, loves, and

00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.370
desires on to the computer.

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:22.450
And they get just enough back
that they think it's real.

00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:24.430
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a
little bit more about--

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:26.162
you were saying women
aren't allowing

00:54:26.162 --> 00:54:27.400
themselves to be mothers.

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.050
I think that's a
very complex--

00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:31.292
so there's socially
we've changed.

00:54:31.292 --> 00:54:33.310
Biologically we haven't
changed.

00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:36.734
All the women who are graduating
ahead of men, we go

00:54:36.734 --> 00:54:39.160
for our careers, and then--

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.090
WENDY WALSH: I know exactly
what you're saying.

00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:42.910
OK, right now, there's a book
you have to read that I love

00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:46.910
called "Reshaping the
Work Family Debate--

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:49.870
Why Men and Social Class
Matter." It's by Joan--

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:50.630
ah--

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:52.790
up at UC Hastings law school.

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:57.540
OK, she wrote this amazing book,
saying, our problem is

00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.820
right now we are not preparing
women for motherhood.

00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:05.070
We have failed them in our push
to push girls forward and

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:06.580
push girls into higher
education.

00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:07.860
I have a high school-age girl.

00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:10.690
In ninth grade, they sent them
out a college application,

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:13.110
told the kids to fill it out,
look for the holes, and start

00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:14.670
filling them in in the
next three years.

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:16.400
My kid is 15 years old.

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.350
She has no interest in going
to hang out in the mall and

00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:19.170
pick out boys.

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:22.240
She wants to go tour colleges
on every vacation we take.

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:23.400
I'm like, you've got to stop.

00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:24.210
You've got to have fun.

00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:25.520
You've got to be a teenager.

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:26.440
AUDIENCE: And globalization--

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:28.400
WENDY WALSH: Right, they're
pushing these girls, pushing

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.430
these girls like crazy.

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:32.710
She's all concerned about her
GPA, and she's crying in the

00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:33.940
bathtub if it's not 4.0.

00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:34.770
And I'm like, stop.

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:35.490
AUDIENCE: And boys, too.

00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:37.680
WENDY WALSH: Go smoke some
weed and meet a boy.

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:38.305
Yeah, exactly.

00:55:38.305 --> 00:55:38.710
[LAUGHING]

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:42.430
WENDY WALSH: But honestly, I
never thought as a mother that

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:44.190
I'd be thinking that
to my daughter.

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:44.925
I didn't say it.

00:55:44.925 --> 00:55:46.590
I'm thinking it.

00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:50.070
I've also said to my daughter,
listen, I know you watch "Teen

00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:53.990
Mom" on MTV-- and by the way, my
friend Jared in the back--

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:56.590
Jared and Jordan,
the two J's--

00:55:56.590 --> 00:55:57.470
produce for MTV.

00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:58.440
They do the VMAs.

00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.440
and they produce "Teen Mom." and
I was like, listen, to my

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.950
daughter, if you watch teen mom,
and you have a teenage

00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:06.200
pregnancy, you are so going
to be grounded.

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.950
And I'm so going to
take that baby.

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:08.880
Because I'm afraid--

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:09.720
the whole problem here is--

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:10.790
I'm not going to get to
be a grandmother.

00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:13.370
That's really what
it's about, OK?

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:16.720
So the answer is, if you look
at more developed countries

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.160
like us, like Sweden and
Iceland, they have very

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.140
powerful women.

00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:23.020
They have more babies
born out of wedlock.

00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:26.130
But what they have are the
social supports that

00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:28.230
we don't have here.

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:29.640
The problem is this--

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:31.260
the single mother walk--

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:33.480
we don't have the social
supports advanced enough.

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.680
So the single mother
walk is a hard one.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:36.190
I'm in it.

00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:38.300
I've been single for eight
years; I've got two kids.

00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:41.150
Let me tell you, single mothers
in America today have

00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:44.010
their own worse mental health,
worse physical health.

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:45.240
Their kids have worse
physical health.

00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:47.540
Their kids have lower academic
grades, earlier onset of

00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:50.020
sexual behavior, and more sex,
drugs, rock and roll,

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:51.680
basically, OK?

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.330
We do not have any
social support.

00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:56.930
So when I see the government
trying to push this whole bill

00:56:56.930 --> 00:57:00.320
to provide preschools, at least
that's some child care.

00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:04.820
14 million single mothers are
raising one in four American

00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:06.010
children right now--

00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:07.090
one in four.

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:09.920
And it's only going up, because
women are not choosing

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.590
marriage, or men are not using
marriage, or their children

00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:13.370
have divorced, themselves.

00:57:13.370 --> 00:57:15.630
We have a second generation now
of divorced people who are

00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:16.880
terrified of it.

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:20.270
So the answer is a very
complicated one that has to

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:23.170
not only involve personal
decision, not only in how we

00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:25.530
raise our girls, but also in
looking at our culture as a

00:57:25.530 --> 00:57:28.490
whole, and what we can do
to support single parent

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:31.850
families, whether it be a man
or a woman raising the kids.

00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:32.150
Yeah?

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.245
AUDIENCE: It's tough.

00:57:32.245 --> 00:57:35.814
You know, you're asking women
to basically look to try to

00:57:35.814 --> 00:57:38.842
have babies at 25, 26, 27, 28.

00:57:38.842 --> 00:57:41.680
But for men who are ready,
who are genetically--

00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.670
WENDY WALSH: Interestingly
enough, research shows that a

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:47.050
girl who has a baby during
college or right after college

00:57:47.050 --> 00:57:49.190
takes less of a financial
hit than if she takes a

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:51.040
big time off at 35.

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:53.090
Because she's not making
much then.

00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:56.070
And she's young enough to hop
back on the treadmill.

00:57:56.070 --> 00:57:59.320
When you're 35 and you're making
$250,000 a year and you

00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:01.920
take two years off to stay with
the baby, it's a whole

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:04.500
different thing.

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:07.020
AUDIENCE: And also you're
commitments--

00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:08.986
you're paying a much higher
mortgage at that point.

00:58:08.986 --> 00:58:09.740
WENDY WALSH: Everything, yeah.

00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:11.490
It's so much harder.

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:12.190
Exactly.

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:14.440
AUDIENCE: But then coming back
into it at the age--

00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:16.170
WENDY WALSH: I'll tell you, one
of the changes we can make

00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:17.270
right away--

00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:20.360
everybody in this culture stop
using the word "maternity

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:22.200
leave." It's paternal leave.

00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:22.990
It's paternity--

00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:24.760
or sorry, it's parental leave.

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:25.270
Sorry.

00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:27.940
As soon as we call it parental
leave and men get into the

00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:30.340
game and think they have
equal access to

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.730
these benefits, then--

00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:36.540
AUDIENCE: Google has a great
maternity leave.

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:38.170
WENDY WALSH: But what about the
guy who wants to stay home

00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:39.000
and take care of the kids?

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.720
And what if she wants
to charge back?

00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:44.400
Until it becomes gender equal,
until the care of children

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:48.070
becomes gender equal and it's
instituted at the corporate

00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:50.950
level, then--

00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:51.650
I'm Canadian.

00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:55.670
So in Canada, you get a year
off, father or mother, paid at

00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:57.010
80% of your salary.

00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:59.060
Because they have socialized
medicine, and they've learned

00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:01.080
that if you breastfeed those
babies, you reduce your health

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:03.135
care costs by so much.

00:59:03.135 --> 00:59:04.160
AUDIENCE: I know, but that
makes sense, you see.

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.050
WENDY WALSH: Yeah,
there's a number.

00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:07.606
AUDIENCE: That makes sense, so
we're not going to do it.

00:59:07.606 --> 00:59:09.030
You're trying to make sense--

00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.930
WENDY WALSH: Oh, of course!

00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:11.450
We don't want to make sense.

00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:13.010
OK.

00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:15.820
Sorry?

00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:17.800
AUDIENCE: I just don't see
Americans ever getting there.

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:19.990
Drug companies alone.

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:21.350
WENDY WALSH: But you guys
have the power.

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:22.540
You're our future.

00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:23.920
You're young Americans
who have a

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:25.896
voice, you're out there.

00:59:25.896 --> 00:59:27.678
[LAUGHING]

00:59:27.678 --> 00:59:28.630
WENDY WALSH: [LAUGHS]

00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:30.040
OK, I got a peer over here.

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:32.015
I'm still older than
you, I promise.

00:59:32.015 --> 00:59:33.290
AUDIENCE: I wouldn't bet.

00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:34.360
WENDY WALSH: I would bet.

00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:35.395
How old are you?

00:59:35.395 --> 00:59:35.890
AUDIENCE: 51.

00:59:35.890 --> 00:59:37.235
WENDY WALSH: Oh, we're peers.

00:59:37.235 --> 00:59:38.550
I'm 51, too.

00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:40.230
[LAUGHING]

00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.890
AUDIENCE: We'll hook up later.

00:59:40.890 --> 00:59:41.369
WENDY WALSH: OK.

00:59:41.369 --> 00:59:42.806
[LAUGHING]

00:59:42.806 --> 00:59:44.056
WENDY WALSH: Exactly.

00:59:46.638 --> 00:59:50.373
AUDIENCE: Dr. Walsh, thank you
so much for being here today.

00:59:50.373 --> 00:59:53.780
That's for you.

00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:56.330
And guys, if you want your
book signed, we have some

00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:57.550
Sharpies in the back.

00:59:57.550 --> 01:00:00.280
I think we might have
run out of books.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.490
But thank you guys so
much for coming.

01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:01.630
And thanks for joining us.

01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:04.630
WENDY WALSH: Do I get
a Google t-shirt?

01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.930
Oh, yay!

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:08.240
[APPLAUSE]
