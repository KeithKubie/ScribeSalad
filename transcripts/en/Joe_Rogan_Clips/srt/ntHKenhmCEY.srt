1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,350
The Joe Rogan experience.
What essentially was hacking Dharma?

2
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:05,850
Like what was the motivation behind it?

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,140
Was it for a person like
me or was it for everyone?

4
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:13,020
Like as far as for everyone.
And so what I really wanted to do,

5
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:14,850
so the background's going to be gift.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,110
I can give you just a
little bit of background.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,770
So more than 20 years ago I was working
on the National Security Council and my

8
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:22,740
then boss, um, Richard Clark,

9
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:27,000
who was then this obscure White House
official who is jumping up and down saying

10
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:31,620
we need to be focusing on terrorism
and al Qaeda and bin Laden.

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,460
And he was trying to tell everybody
and nobody was paying attention to is

12
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:38,100
totally marginalized.
And when nine 11 happened,

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,290
I'm Dick's memo was on George Bush's
desk saying exactly that we need to focus

14
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,930
on [inaudible].
Here's what's going to happen to,

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,540
and Dick even before then would always
tell me that if everyone in Washington

16
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:49,710
was focusing on one thing,

17
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:52,680
you could be sure there was something
much more important that was being missed.

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,240
And so more than 20 years ago,

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,050
I was looking around and I saw these
little pieces of disparate information and

20
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:00,480
I came to the conclusion that the
genetics revolution was going to change

21
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:04,980
everything. So I educated myself.
Um, I started writing articles.

22
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:09,840
I was invited to testify before Congress
and then to try to get that story out.

23
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:14,310
I was, I started, I wrote my, my two
most recent, um, near term Scifi novels,

24
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:15,990
Genesis Code and Eternal Sonata.

25
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,040
And when I was on book tours for
those and I explained the science, uh,

26
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:23,920
to people the way I kind of a self
educated citizen scientist, um,

27
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,210
and a novelist would explain the science,
all of a sudden people got it.

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,440
And that was when I realized I needed
to write a book about the genetics

29
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:34,350
revolution that people could
absorb that wouldn't scare people.

30
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:39,060
But my mission for the book is that
this stuff, as we've talked about,

31
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:43,380
it's so important that everybody
needs to be part of the conversation.

32
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,460
We have this brief window and what I'm
calling for is this species wide dialogue

33
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:49,830
on the future of human genetic
and genetic engineering.

34
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:53,850
And I have a whole game plan, uh, in
the book about what people can do,

35
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:58,440
how they can get involved,
a people individually on a national level.

36
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:01,410
We have to put a lot of pressure
on our elected leaders and say,

37
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,420
stop focusing on the crap.

38
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:07,470
There is really important stuff that
needs to be addressed and we need

39
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:11,730
leadership. I'm going to, I'm speaking
on, uh, in, uh, in Congress, um,

40
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,870
and we can a half from now
talking about about these issues.

41
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:18,330
So we need to have an them
on an international level.

42
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,930
We have to have some kind
of international system.

43
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:23,880
We're so far away from
being able to do that.

44
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:27,180
We don't even know what the standards are,
but we have to be pushing it.

45
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,020
So I know you think of it in terms of
like the same way we have with nuclear

46
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:33,180
weapons. Yeah. In a way.
And in many ways. Yeah.

47
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,390
But the thing is with nuclear weapons,
a lot of that happened at the state level,

48
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,690
at the country level. This needs to
happen at a popular level and at a, uh,

49
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,481
at a government level.

50
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:46,170
So the only way that those that's going
to happen effectively as we need, um,

51
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,360
real comprehensive
education on the subject.

52
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:51,060
It's not something that
people can just guess. Right.

53
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,960
And need to know what's the consequences,
what where we're at right now. Yeah.

54
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,760
Right. Yeah. And that's, and
that's like Sanjay Gupta, um,

55
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,740
had a wonderful quote that's
actually on the cover of my book,

56
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:02,950
which is if you can read one book on
the future of our species, this is it.

57
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,960
So what I've tried to do is to say like,

58
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,870
if you just want to go to one place
to understand what's happening,

59
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:08,704
what's at stake,

60
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,270
what it means for you and what you can
do now if you want to get involved.

61
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:17,320
I've tried to do that, but then
ironically I'm now like, as I mentioned,

62
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:20,440
being asked to speak to thousands of
doctors and scientists because they're all

63
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:24,490
reading this book and they're saying
this is, this is positioning my work in,

64
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:25,510
in a much bigger content.

65
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,350
Sanjay Gupta is a very interesting cat
because he was very anti marijuana and

66
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:34,370
then started doing research on it and
then totally flipped 180 degrees. Yeah.

67
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,970
Which to me is a great sign of
both humility and intelligence.

68
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,350
I recognize that the data was different
than his presuppositions. Yeah.

69
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,880
He had these prejudices that were
very common. Yeah. Yeah. Now,

70
00:03:46,881 --> 00:03:49,940
when you speak to Congress,
yeah. What do you,

71
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,840
do they brief you in terms of like what
they would like specifically for you to

72
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:54,620
address?
No.

73
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,020
So this one, um, it's, uh,

74
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,110
I've been asked to go and speak into a
lot of members of congress who were going

75
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:02,930
to be invited. And what I'm
going to tell them is, look,

76
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:05,360
this is really important.

77
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,830
Our congress is not doing enough and
here are the things that we need to do.

78
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:13,190
And what are you going to say to try
to really get it into their head?

79
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,040
What I'm going to say is that
the genetics revolution is here.

80
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,130
If we don't have a system,

81
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:23,060
if you don't have a rational system to
manage it, if we don't have a system.

82
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:24,560
You talked about public education.

83
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,950
The challenge that we face in the United
States is we traditionally have had a

84
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:31,910
representative democracy and now we're
transitioning from a representative

85
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:36,890
democracy to a popular democracy.
So Switzerland has a popular democracy,

86
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:39,560
but they have like really well
educated people who are able,

87
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:42,200
who have enough information
to make smart decisions.

88
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,120
We haven't educated our public and yet
the public is making big decisions and a

89
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,890
lot of it is happening
just on a gut feeling.

90
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:51,710
That's what's happening with trade
agreements where people just have,

91
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:55,660
I have a feeling it's bad
without the ability to, to,

92
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,720
to really get into the, into the details.
And so we are having that transition,

93
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:03,140
which means there's a lot
of responsibility on us
to educate our public.

94
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:06,020
And it's just, it's a tragedy.
We treat people in this country.

95
00:05:06,021 --> 00:05:08,270
Like you can just throw
people away like you somebody,

96
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:12,710
if you're in some crappy school
system and you know your, your,

97
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,190
your chances of success are so minimized,

98
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,550
not because of anything that you've
done just because of your circumstances.

99
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:20,420
And it's unacceptable.

100
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,580
It is only, sorry. I mean
the equal opportunities,

101
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,130
what we really should all strive for us,

102
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:27,950
and I think some people
conflate that with, uh,

103
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,780
op equal success.
Right?

104
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,030
And you're not going to get
the same equality of outcome.

105
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:35,140
You're going to get different,

106
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,790
different amounts of effort and different
people are qualified or more talented

107
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:44,110
at different things. But what I'm
worried about is what I said initially,

108
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:48,010
that some people are going to get a hold
of this stuff quickly and it's going to

109
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:52,490
give them an a massive advantage.
Yes. Sort of like, I mean,

110
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,980
if you, the first person that has
the ability to go forward in time,

111
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,280
five minutes,

112
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,930
right. Is going to be able to
manipulate the stock market and yeah.

113
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,760
Unprecedented way.
Yeah.

114
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,300
I don't think that that's
really possible in our lifetime,

115
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,070
but that's the kind of
thing I'm talking about.

116
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:10,460
You could get so far ahead that if
we're talking about competition,

117
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,440
that will be no catching up.
They'd be,

118
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,410
you don't have to travel
in time to do that. Right.

119
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,280
But I'm saying that if it was,

120
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,560
but there's real technologies
that are likely to happen,

121
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,770
which are going to confer billions,
tens,

122
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,720
hundreds of billions of dollars
of benefit of advantage. Yeah.

123
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,740
And that stuff is happening now.

124
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,280
And this is the concern with
getting behind countries like China,

125
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,830
cause if they get ahead of us and
something like that when they were already

126
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,930
moving in this direction in
terms of technology. Yeah.

127
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:44,720
So I am a proud American. My father
and grandparents came here as refugees.

128
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,960
I believe in what this country
at our best dance floor.

129
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:52,790
I want us to continue to be the country
that setting an example for the rest of

130
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:57,791
the world that is articulating what our
ideals of responsibility and governance,

131
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,390
good governance and accountability and
all these things that we have championed.

132
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,290
And because of that, I want us to
get our act together politically.

133
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,300
And I want us to be the leading
technological country in the world.

134
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,010
Um, and so I think that's what's what's
at stake and we're losing so much time

135
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:19,580
because there was a time in the period
after the Second World War where we

136
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:23,570
recognize that technological leadership
was the foundation for everything else

137
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:27,500
we were, we had recreated the world
out of the ashes of the, of the war.

138
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,960
But we realized that we needed
to have the economic growth.

139
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:33,470
We needed to have the competition,
we needed to have these technologies,

140
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,320
and we've, it was a miracle.
What we've, what we've done,

141
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:39,620
and now we've lost our focus
and we have to regain it.
