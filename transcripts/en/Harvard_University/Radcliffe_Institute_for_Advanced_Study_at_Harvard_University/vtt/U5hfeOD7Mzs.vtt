00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.990
- So as you can see, my topic
today is the right to strike.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.450
And strikes have been on
people's minds lately,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.910
although there has been this
great decrease in strike

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:16.420
activity.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.890
There's been the Day
Without Immigrants.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.650
There has been the
women's strike.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.720
There was the taxi
driver strike in New York

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.170
during the protests against
Trump's immigration ban.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.890
We're near May
1-- in a few days,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.860
we're May 1, which is
International Labor Day,

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.420
and hundreds of
thousands of workers

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.670
have said that they're going
to go on strike that day.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.500
Hopefully that's true.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.015
And we've seen wider
protests here and abroad

00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:41.140
that have taken the form
of various kinds of strike

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.490
activity.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.050
Which has all
raised the question,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.012
why do workers have
the right to strike?

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:48.970
And there are different
accounts, for instance.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.950
Some say that
workers have a right

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.850
to strike because they enjoy a
kind of freedom of association

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.320
in the economy,
and that's the way

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.270
to understand their
right to strike.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.920
Others say that
workers have a right

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.680
to strike because it's necessary
to make their bargaining

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.344
power roughly equal
with their employers,

00:01:05.344 --> 00:01:06.760
and that's what
allows us to think

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.650
of the labor contract as fair.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.530
And then others, like me,
think that the right to strike

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.370
is better understood as a
right to resist oppression.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.100
Now what I really want to
argue today is two things,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.940
or that argument
really has two parts.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.050
The first is just to get
across and communicate

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.426
why it matters how we
justify the right to strike.

00:01:26.426 --> 00:01:28.300
There are these different
accounts available,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.720
and it really matters how we
justify the right to strike.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.110
And I'll spend about the
first half of the talk giving

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.280
an account of why it matters how
we justify the right to strike.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.960
And then in the second
half of the talk,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.200
I will explain why I
think the right to strike

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.060
is best understood as a
right to resist oppression.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.790
So here is a way to--

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.600
here's a kind of
dilemma that I think

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.920
illustrates why it matters how
we justify the right to strike.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.920
In one sector of
the labor market,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.610
we have relatively high-skilled
or specialized workers

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.810
who are pretty hard to
replace, so doctors or sports

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.639
players or professors.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.500
Specialized-- I didn't
say high-skilled,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.370
I just said specialized,
hard to replace.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.580
Or the 40,000 Verizon workers
who went on strike last year,

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.090
the ones who install and
service the fiber optic cables.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.280
They turned out to be
pretty hard to replace.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.120
Now for workers like this to go
on strike, all they have to do

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.640
is refuse to work.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.600
It requires a bit of
organization, discipline,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.010
solidarity.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.600
But if they want
to go on a strike

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.210
and have some reasonable
chance of success,

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.860
then they can
simply stop working.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.720
And because they're
hard to replace,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.690
they have a pretty good chance
of significantly slowing

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.530
down or stopping production and
winning some of their demands.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.470
Now these are workers who tend
to be pretty well compensated,

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.380
enjoy pretty good benefits,
have pretty good or relatively

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.170
better job security.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.390
Now compare them
with the majority

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.280
of workers in other sectors
of the labor market--

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.440
so service, agriculture, basic
industry, transportation.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.890
I'm talking like Wal-Mart
workers or Amazon warehouse

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.050
workers or poultry processors
or restaurant workers.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.350
These tend to be workers who
enjoy relatively low wages,

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.660
longer hours, work
in worse conditions,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.940
enjoy less job security.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.960
And they tend to be
much easier to replace.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.210
The relatively
lower skill, that's

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.510
usually why they're
relatively easy to replace.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.580
Now for workers like
this to go on strike

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.160
and have some reasonable
chance of success,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.060
it's not enough for them
simply to refuse to work.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.040
They have to also
in some way either

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.220
prevent their bosses
from hiring replacements,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.860
or prevent replacements
from taking those jobs

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.350
and crossing a picket
line, or in some other way

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.900
prevent work from happening.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.830
To do that, they have to resort
to much more coercive strike

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.090
tactics.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.220
I'm talking about
things like sit-downs,

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.230
which are occupations
of a workplace,

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.420
or mass pickets, which
involve surrounding

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.790
a workplace with a
kind of wall of workers

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.630
so that no managers or employers
or suppliers can get in or out.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.290
Or even sometimes sabotage,
disabling or destroying

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.495
some piece of machinery
or the relevant objects

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:24.980
so that work can't take place.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.310
And just to give you a sense
of what this looks like,

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.810
I've got some slides.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.549
So here a sit-downs.

00:04:31.549 --> 00:04:33.340
I should say I'm taking
most of my examples

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.650
from the American
labor experience,

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.490
but it's not because the
United States is some kind

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.960
of an exception in this case.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.460
The argument I'm
developing applies

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.850
to all liberal capitalist
societies in particular.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.560
I just know the
American case the best.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.435
In some ways, it's a
little bit more extreme,

00:04:49.435 --> 00:04:51.010
but it's not exceptional.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.920
So sit-downs-- the heyday of
sit-down strikes in the United

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.930
States was the 1930s.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.900
These were Woolworth waitresses
who were sitting down

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.470
in the kind of cafes in
Woolworth's where they worked,

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.144
and they occupied
Woolworth's demanding

00:05:06.144 --> 00:05:07.810
I think it was union
recognition, better

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.761
wages, and better hours.

00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:12.010
These were the same counters
that 30 years later would

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.800
become quite famous when they
were the subject of the sit-ins

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.470
during the civil rights
movement in the South.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.670
We have women cigar rollers
occupying a factory--

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.380
I think this is Chicago--

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.080
occupying a cigar-rolling
factor, demanding better pay,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.110
recognition, and also not having
to breathe in such toxic fumes

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.170
from all of the tobacco
in the warehouse.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.110
And they had been inspired
by the very successful Flint

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.290
sit-down strike, which
was a strike against auto

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.230
manufacturing company
in Flint, Michigan.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.030
And this is a somewhat
misleading picture

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.238
because it gives the impression
that sit-down strikes

00:05:48.238 --> 00:05:50.680
for these very peaceful,
leisurely affairs.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.180
But you get a feel
for how it works.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.520
You occupy the factory.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.054
By the end of the 1930s, this
tactic was declared illegal.

00:05:59.054 --> 00:06:00.970
Workers had a right to
strike, but this tactic

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.101
was declared illegal--

00:06:02.101 --> 00:06:03.850
outside the bounds of
the right to strike.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.890
And so the tactic
somewhat faded from view.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.290
But occasionally it reappears.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.790
So during the financial
crisis of 2008,

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.630
Chicago-based company
Republic Windows and Steel

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.950
was the subject of a strike.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.040
There had been a
financial scandal,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.190
and it was going to close.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.930
And I think the mostly Latino
workforce occupied the building

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.480
until they forced
the company basically

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.970
to sell it to an employer that
would continue to employ them.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.310
And so it was a successful
incident of a sit-down strike.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.020
So that's what
sit-downs look like.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.750
You also have mass pickets.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.980
These are actually Japanese
miners from I think 1960.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.310
I like this one just because
it's a really intense mass

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.610
picket.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.984
I mean, that's
layers upon layers

00:06:46.984 --> 00:06:48.820
of workers completely
obstructing

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.810
any access to the work site.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.530
But in the United States,
the heyday of mass pickets

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.020
was also the 1930s and 1940s.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.760
So this is a mass picket during
the longshoreman's strike,

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.360
which was a West Coast strike
that extended from Los Angeles

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.695
through San Francisco,
Portland, and this is Seattle.

00:07:12.881 --> 00:07:15.380
Mass pickets were also declared
illegal in the United States

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.220
by 1940, but they still
did reappear on occasion.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.980
So this is the famous
sanitation worker strike

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.220
in Memphis, Tennessee, which is
the strike that Martin Luther

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.174
King was supporting when
he was assassinated.

00:07:28.174 --> 00:07:29.590
And this is one
where they engaged

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.380
in a mass picket that shut
down commerce in the streets.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.890
And during the Verizon
strike last year,

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.110
there was a mass
picket for a day

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.200
in New York that shut down some
commerce entering the city.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.980
It was a one-day mass picket.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.859
Now part of the reason I'm
showing you these images--

00:07:47.859 --> 00:07:50.150
besides I think they're kind
of objectively interesting

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.441
and they give you a feel for
what it's like to actually

00:07:52.441 --> 00:07:54.370
engage in these sort of
mass strike tactics--

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.900
is to illustrate the dilemma.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.610
And the dilemma is this.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.070
These kinds of strike tactics--

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.010
sit-downs, mass
pickets, sabotage--

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.520
are on the one hand necessary
for these easily-replaced

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.860
workers to use if
they're going to engage

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.440
in a strike that has some
reasonable chance of success.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.750
But they're extremely coercive.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.550
And they're not just
generally coercive.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.910
They involve violating some of
the basic economic and civil

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.360
liberties that every liberal
capitalist society protects.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.520
Violates the property
rights of owners.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.830
And it violates by extension
the managerial authority

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.450
of those owners' managers.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.790
It also violates the freedom
of contract and freedom

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.789
of association of replacement
workers, who normally

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:37.850
are considered to be free to
take jobs that are offered

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.440
to them and can't
just be blocked

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.839
from accepting those jobs.

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:43.880
And in general, they also
tend to kind of disrupt

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.580
the general public
sense of law and order

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.886
because that's usually equated
with the free flow of commerce.

00:08:51.886 --> 00:08:53.010
And so the problem is this.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.190
In a liberal capitalist
society, usually the kind

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.680
of basic principle
of political morality

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.350
is that we extend basic
economic, civil, and political

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.210
liberties to
everyone on condition

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.770
that nobody
interferes with anyone

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.940
else and their exercise of those
same basic economic liberties.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.070
But if that's the
principle, then it's

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.380
unclear on what basis
you could justify

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.260
the use of these highly-coercive
tactics by strikers.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.490
And so there's a question.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.880
What has priority--
these basic economic

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.400
and civil liberties that every
liberal capitalist society

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.480
endorses, or the
right to strike?

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.590
So this is the dilemma.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.370
And I bring it up because
it shows why we really

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.253
have to decide what we think
the justification of the right

00:09:35.253 --> 00:09:35.940
to strike is.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.950
Because depending on
how we justify it,

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.680
we'll either think that the
right to strike has priority

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.860
or we'll think that these basic
economic and civil liberties

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.045
have priority.

00:09:45.045 --> 00:09:46.920
But let me turn the heat
up a little bit more

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.680
and show you that the
stakes are even higher.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.100
You might end up with blackouts.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.340
The stakes are even higher
because if you decide

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:01.030
that the basic economic and
civil liberties have priority,

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.610
then you also think
the state is authorized

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.910
or it is acting rightly
when it goes and represses

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:12.100
the use of these coercive
strike tactics by strikers.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.180
If a mass picket or sit-down
is an unjust, illegitimate

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.430
violation of property
rights or contract rights,

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.950
then it is right
for the state to use

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.640
its coercive legal authority
to go and break up strikes.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.730
And by far and away,
most of the violence

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.470
that is associated
with strikes has

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.260
to do with these kinds
of mass strike tactics

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.410
and with the state going in
and deciding to break them up.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.380
And here is just a quick,
completely inadequate

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.590
visual history of
that experience

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.240
of strike repression.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.150
And it begins in
the 19th century.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.397
1886 is a major strike
wave in the United States.

00:10:49.397 --> 00:10:51.730
Most of the images of strike
repression from that period

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.550
is in etchings and sketches
because you didn't have

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.170
on-the-scene photographers.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:00.580
And this is the police breaking
up a mass picket during that

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:06.040
a kind of a march during
striking streetcar workers.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.930
And I raise this in
particular because this

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.590
is the period in which
police became militarized.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:12.460
The origins of
the militarization

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.800
of the police in the
United States and elsewhere

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.870
is when they acquire the
role of strikebreakers.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.060
They get weapons, military
training, uniforms,

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.970
professional training.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.890
Here's the Lawrence textile
strike, one hour north

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.061
in Lawrence, Massachusetts.

00:11:28.061 --> 00:11:29.560
When the police
were inadequate, you

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.090
brought in the National Guard.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.130
And Harvard students
got time off

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.300
to go serve as strikebreakers
during that strike.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.050
Not accidentally, the
president of Harvard

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:42.620
was one Lowell from a
famous textile family.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.740
Sometimes the National
Guard brought machine guns.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.119
And this is a
strike in Colorado,

00:11:48.119 --> 00:11:49.660
which later ended
in massive violence

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.370
against the Ludlow strikers.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.040
About 20 of them
died when the camp

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.340
was attacked by the National
Guard and set aflame.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.950
And this is San Francisco
during that dockworker strike.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.190
It is interesting how
frequently in the archives

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.500
one finds photographs of
tanks occupying cities

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.840
during strikes.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.000
Probably the most
frequent use of tanks

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.540
until the American
involvement in World War II,

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.690
that would be my guess.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.750
I'm not sure anyone's
documented it.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.100
This is a street battle
during the general strike

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:18.820
in Minneapolis.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.060
And you see kind of a picket
line set up there with the use

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.832
of stalled automobiles.

00:12:23.832 --> 00:12:26.290
And this is fighting with the
police during the battle of--

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.260
I think it was the
battle of the overpass.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.120
There are also private
security forces.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.420
So every major business had
its own private sort of army.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.570
A congressional
inquiry in '39 found

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:44.260
that GM had a private security
force of 1,200 armed contract

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.190
servicemen.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.170
And this is the Ford
so-called service department.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.750
That's how they
called these guys.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.930
But their only job was to beat
up labor organizers and strike

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.790
organizers.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:59.860
And this is police who shot
on an unarmed mass picket

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.850
during a steel strike in '37.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.184
This is the Memphis strike.

00:13:04.184 --> 00:13:06.600
So in the Memphis strike they
brought in armored personnel

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.099
carriers--

00:13:07.099 --> 00:13:08.520
I think it's the
National Guard--

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.600
to restore and
maintain public order.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.990
That's the police beating
up some of the strikers.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.212
This is a strike in
Charleston, South Carolina.

00:13:18.212 --> 00:13:19.170
This is just a random--

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.430
I could have pick out any old--

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.080
I mean, there's a million
photographs like this.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.829
There's nothing special
about this strike.

00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:26.730
It's just another strike with
mass pickets and the police

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:27.990
breaking it up.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.840
This is janitors
striking in LA in 1990.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.660
And this is Harvard
Square in 2013.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.680
Not a mass strike just a
small strike by about--

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.965
how many was it, Joe--
eight, 10 employees.

00:13:38.965 --> 00:13:42.090
It was a small picket 20?

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.600
And this is the police
suppressing this very small

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.640
little strike violently.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.950
And the police are being sued--

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.700
I think that's the
person who's suing them

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.060
for brutality during
the suppression

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.430
of this particular strike.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:00.540
So the reason I've put
these images on display

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.650
is they remind us of sort
of the stakes of deciding

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.042
why we think workers
have the right to strike

00:14:07.042 --> 00:14:08.250
and how we come down on this.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.800
Because if we end up
deciding that workers are not

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.940
justified in using these sort
of more coercive strike tactics

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:16.860
like mass pickets
and sit-downs, then

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.430
whenever they get
it in their mind,

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.510
or even when they use slightly
less coercive tactics,

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:26.220
then we end up saying that
the state has the authority

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.006
to coercively enforce
the laws, which

00:14:29.006 --> 00:14:30.630
means breaking up
these strikes and use

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.046
a great deal of violence.

00:14:32.046 --> 00:14:34.170
But if you end up thinking
that the right to strike

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.580
has a degree of priority,
then we not only think--

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.580
or we might end up
deciding-- not only

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.630
that these uses of force are
severely unjust and oppressive,

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.820
but that workers sometimes
have a right to resist

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.430
this use of coercive authority.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.410
And things like the
battle of the overpass

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.540
were reasonable
responses by workers

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.580
in the face of this
oppressive use of force.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.984
So that's hopefully
a convincing version

00:14:58.984 --> 00:15:01.650
of my first point, which is that
it matters why we think workers

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.330
have the right to strike.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.420
So why do I say that the
best account is the right

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.450
to strike as a right
to resist oppression?

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.536
Well, to give a persuasive
account of that,

00:15:12.536 --> 00:15:14.410
I think I have to convince
you of two things.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:16.860
First, that there really
is systematic oppression

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.210
in the economy.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.280
And then that the right
to strike as a right

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.230
to resist oppression
is the best way

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.640
of responding to those facts.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.370
So what do I mean by oppression?

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:30.040
Well, by oppression, I just mean
the systematic and organized

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.390
unfair limitation
of people's freedom.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:38.350
Not accidental or occasional,
but systematic and organized

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.810
unfair limitation
on people's freedom.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.330
So why do I say the
economy is oppressive?

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.820
Let me give you some
examples and then step back

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.520
and say what I think
these are examples of.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.720
And again, my examples
are from the American case

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.590
because I know it best, but I've
been educated by my research

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:58.090
assistants on the way in which
this is true of other economies

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.671
as well.

00:15:59.671 --> 00:16:01.670
So let's take the example
of Wal-Mart employees.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.150
Wal-Mart-- I think the
largest private employer

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.220
and something like 16 states.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:11.500
So Wal-Mart employees, when they
were working the night shift

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.650
restocking shelves and
cleaning the premises,

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.506
can be locked in
the store overnight.

00:16:17.506 --> 00:16:18.880
And if they need
to get out, they

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.400
have to call their managers,
hopefully wake someone up,

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.954
have them come unlock the door,
and only then can they leave.

00:16:24.954 --> 00:16:26.620
Regardless of whatever
the emergency is,

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.720
they can be locked indoors.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.170
Amazon warehouse employees-- the
people who were like packaging

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.600
the stuff that shows
up on your door--

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.640
in the summer
months, they are made

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.400
to work in warehouses that are
so hot that Amazon has been

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.250
known to park emergency
vehicles outside the warehouse

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.390
to rush anyone who succumbs
to heat exhaustion to the ER.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.580
And Amazon keeps it hot
because it reduces their air

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.350
conditioning costs.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.200
Moreover, it turns out that
it's a legal power for Amazon

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.440
to keep its employees
in security lines for up

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.570
to an hour after the
workers are off the clock--

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:02.420
so they've punched out,
they're not getting paid--

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.240
to check to see if they've
been stealing anything

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.829
from the warehouse.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:08.390
And this is a job requirement.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:09.800
So they're required to do
it as part of their job,

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.758
but they're not paid for
it because they're not

00:17:11.758 --> 00:17:13.910
said to be doing any work.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.250
A recent report-- I
think it was by Oxfam--

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:19.910
found that poultry workers
in poultry processing--

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.569
major poultry processing
plants in the United States--

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:24.605
were coming to work
wearing diapers.

00:17:24.605 --> 00:17:26.480
And the reason that they
were wearing diapers

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.970
was because they
didn't have enough time

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.250
during their personal
breaks to take care of all

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.379
of their personal business.

00:17:32.379 --> 00:17:34.670
And if they asked for any
further break like a bathroom

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.010
break, their managers
regularly denied their request,

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:40.600
regardless of whether they
were sick or pregnant--

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.500
in some cases, they
were pregnant women--

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.765
or just any human being we
need to use the bathroom

00:17:44.765 --> 00:17:46.640
because they didn't
happen to go the bathroom

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.400
during the personal break.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.010
And if you think this is
only a feature of a poultry

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.960
processing, one
of the grievances

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.750
of some of the workers
during the Verizon strike

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:01.070
was that if they were up on
a upon a pole or on a roof

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.290
installing some fiber optic
cable and it was summer

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.060
and they were hot and they
needed to use the bathroom

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.759
or get a glass of
water, they were first

00:18:06.759 --> 00:18:08.300
being required to
call their manager,

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.670
get approval from their
manager to go to the bathroom.

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.610
And if they didn't
get that approval

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:16.850
and went to the bathroom
anyway or got the drink anyway,

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.340
they would end up in
disciplinary proceedings, dock

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.210
of pay, or limitation of hours.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.390
And if they did this more than
once, they could be fired.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.380
Now the point about all
of these-- oh sorry,

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.667
I forgot one that I think
is particularly important.

00:18:28.667 --> 00:18:31.000
For many of these workers--
especially Wal-Mart workers,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.550
people in restaurant
work, retail--

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.160
they have no idea week to
week what exactly their hours

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.719
are going to be.

00:18:37.719 --> 00:18:39.010
They might work the same hours.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.740
They make work fewer.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.940
They might be more hours
but different hours

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.830
than the week before.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.080
So extremely difficult
for any of them

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.920
to organize their lives on any
rational, predictable basis.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.014
For those of you with
children, imagine.

00:18:54.014 --> 00:18:55.180
Without children, I imagine.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.565
I mean, you don't have
to have children, but--

00:18:57.565 --> 00:18:58.940
I was home yesterday
with my kid.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.642
That's why that
one's on my mind.

00:19:00.642 --> 00:19:02.350
Imagine that you have
no idea what you're

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.970
going to do week to week.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.310
Now the important feature
of all these examples

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.620
is that they are all
examples of legal powers

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.680
that managers have exercised
over their employees.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.530
None of these were examples
of something that was illegal.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.360
They are all forms
of legal authority

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:21.590
that managers exercise in the
workplace over their employees.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:25.270
And in fact, it's a general
fact of the typical workplace

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.180
in any liberal
capitalist society

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.840
that managers enjoy a wide
swath of uncontrolled authority

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.970
over their employees-- to
control hours and scheduling,

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.360
to control the introduction
of new technologies

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.120
or the definition of
tasks, to determine who

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.480
gets what kinds of breaks,
to determine various hiring

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:49.414
and firing practices, and other
aspects of working conditions.

00:19:49.414 --> 00:19:50.830
Once we become
aware of that fact,

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.350
it's fair to say that the
workplace is best understood

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:55.035
as a site of government.

00:19:55.035 --> 00:19:58.900
A workplace isn't just a kind
of place of free exchange

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.790
or private relationships.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.510
It is a site of government.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.480
But it's not just any
old site of government.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.624
It's an extremely hierarchical,
somewhat despotic form

00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:10.540
of government, because
it's one in which those

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.360
who are subject to commands
by the people who govern them

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:18.136
have very little formal legal
control over those commands.

00:20:18.136 --> 00:20:19.510
And to kind of
put a point on it,

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.210
in other essential
social institutions,

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.700
we don't accept this
kind of authority.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.580
For instance, the family is
no longer organized legally

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.900
as a patriarchy.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:32.110
One person isn't just
formally subject to the will

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:36.760
of one of the other adults who
are party to that relationship.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:41.860
The state is also not a monarchy
or an enlightened despotism.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.410
We think that the only
legitimate form of state

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.080
is one in which those who
are subject to its authority

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.220
have roughly equal control over
its commands and directives.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.770
But the workplace,
I think, is fairly

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.140
said to be highly
oppressive because it's

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.480
a site of arbitrary
authority over which workers

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.600
have very limited formal
and legal control.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.080
It's deeply hierarchical,
and it involves authority

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.940
over many of the
intimate details

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.755
of the way in which people use
their time on a daily basis.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:18.180
So that's one aspect of the
oppression of the economy.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.280
But it's unfortunately
even worse than that.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.860
Because why do people end up
in these kinds of workplaces

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.930
and these types of authoritarian
relationships in the workplace?

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.080
Well, this is where
we have to appreciate

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.780
the broader structural
sources of oppression.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.780
The reason that people end
up in workplaces like this

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.000
is because of the
deeply unequal,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.560
legally-protected control
over property and wealth.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.020
There are some people
in the economy who

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.170
have no reasonable
alternative but to find a job

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.220
and earn money.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.678
They have no
reasonable alternative

00:21:48.678 --> 00:21:51.180
because they have no other way
of meeting their basic needs.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:53.250
The only way in which they can
get a reliable source of income

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:54.300
is by getting a job.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.229
So those people are
forced to work right.

00:21:57.229 --> 00:21:58.770
While there's another
group of people

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.600
who in virtue of
the wealth that they

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.570
have accumulated or inherited
are not forced to work.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.540
They might, but they're
not forced to work.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.430
And so the basic
structure of the economy

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:11.640
is one in which you have
a deeply unequal system

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.312
of forcing some to work while
others are not forced to work.

00:22:14.312 --> 00:22:16.770
But it's not just that some
are forced to work while others

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:17.520
aren't.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.140
But those who are
forced to work have

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.240
to work for those who control
employment and investment.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.952
So some work for others.

00:22:23.952 --> 00:22:25.410
And in the typical
case, this means

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.120
that those who
are forced to work

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.540
are forced to enter these
workplaces that are typically

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:34.200
characterized by these
deeply hierarchical relations

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.480
of authority.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.850
Which then ends up meaning,
because of the broader

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:43.764
structure of dependence of those
who work on those who employ--

00:22:43.764 --> 00:22:45.930
it ends up meaning that
employers and their managers

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.810
even enjoy certain
kinds of material power

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.370
that go beyond the
legal power they enjoy.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.670
So just to give you
one headline example.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.830
I was reading the other
day a recent study

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.350
which showed that
American workers are

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.200
subject to between
$8 and $14 billion

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.100
worth of wage theft a year.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.760
And they just have to take it.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.500
And this wage theft
is concentrated

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.790
almost entirely in the service
sector and in agriculture,

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:13.650
in the kind of worst
jobs where workers

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.777
and have the worst
economic opportunities.

00:23:16.777 --> 00:23:18.360
So this is an example
of another layer

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.240
of the oppression in so far
as managers can often get away

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.630
with a lot of things when
it comes to workers who

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:30.930
have the least amount of
power in the economy, over

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:34.180
and above the legally protected
authority that they have.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.970
So this is why I
think it makes sense

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.480
to say that the economy isn't
just somewhere where wealth is

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.630
produced, where people's
standards of living

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.090
are determined, but is
in fact best understood

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.250
as a structure of
power and authority

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.440
that places enormous
restraints on some people's

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.940
freedom and much less restraint
on other people's freedom--

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.730
and that this is
deeply unjustified

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:57.270
and is therefore oppressive.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.832
So that's step one
of the argument

00:23:58.832 --> 00:24:00.540
for seeing the right
to strike as a right

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.720
to resist oppression.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:08.490
The second step, then, with
these facts in mind, we can--

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.110
yeah, stop showing
pretty pictures

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.984
because this is the part
that isn't like fun,

00:24:11.984 --> 00:24:13.109
about the argument I guess.

00:24:13.109 --> 00:24:15.317
I sort of thought, how do
I show pictures about this,

00:24:15.317 --> 00:24:16.500
but I've already done it.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.357
So the second step
is, then, what

00:24:18.357 --> 00:24:20.190
do we do with these
facts about the economy,

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:25.530
and how does this help us
evaluate the different accounts

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:28.170
of the right to strike?

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:30.210
Well, one account of
the right to strike--

00:24:32.907 --> 00:24:33.990
which we can call liberal.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.990
The labels don't matter.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:36.960
It's just to fix ideas--

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.960
which is the liberal view, which
is that workers have a right

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.045
to strike because they already
enjoy freedom of association.

00:24:43.045 --> 00:24:44.670
And the right to
strike is just the way

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.890
in which you exercise your
freedom of association

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:48.870
in the economy.

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:51.420
Now there are two really simple
problems with this account.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.790
First, it doesn't
connect the right

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.520
to strike to any
economic injustice.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.270
It doesn't say workers
are right to strike

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:59.530
because there's something
unjust about any economy.

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.050
In fact, it assumes that
there's something fair

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:03.300
about the economy where we
protect this civil liberty,

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.740
and here's one way in
which it can be exercised.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.350
But what this
further means, then,

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:09.780
is that the right to
strike has to be limited

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.480
by the normal
limitations that apply

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.250
to the economic and
civil liberties.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.980
So workers who exercise the
right to strike in this sense

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.390
can associate together.

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:20.520
They can try and go on strike.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.890
But they have to
respect everybody else's

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:26.372
basic economic and civil
liberties because that just

00:25:26.372 --> 00:25:28.080
goes hand-in-hand with
thinking that this

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.820
is an exercise of
freedom of association.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.660
So on this account, workers
have a right to strike,

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.150
but it's one that could only
be meaningfully exercised

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:38.940
by the hardest to replace
workers since those are really

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.250
the only ones who could
possibly carry off

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.820
a strike in such a peaceful
and non-coercive manner.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.280
So this seem to me a
deeply inadequate way

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.470
of thinking about
the right to strike.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.200
Another version-- which
we call social democratic,

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.430
but again doesn't
matter the label--

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:02.460
is to say well, no,
the right to strike

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.340
does address an injustice,
which is that workers sometimes

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:08.529
have somewhat unequal
bargaining power in the economy.

00:26:08.529 --> 00:26:11.070
And it's only when we protect
labor rights, including a right

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.310
to strike, that we can say
that the contracts that workers

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:20.640
strike with their employers
are truly free or really fair.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.055
So in this sense, it's a
way of really realizing

00:26:23.055 --> 00:26:24.930
one of the civil liberties
that are nominally

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:30.750
protected in a standard liberal
capitalist constitution.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:31.627
This is reasonable.

00:26:31.627 --> 00:26:33.210
This seems to me a
reasonable account.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:34.950
Certainly gets us some truth.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:39.450
There is an important economic
injustice that it identifies.

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:43.140
But the problem with the account
is that it's far too narrow.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.090
It represents the
problem of power

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.180
as just a question of
the bargaining power

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.510
that employees have with
their employers at the moment

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.070
of making the contract.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:56.130
It says nothing directly either
about the background structure

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.650
of oppression that involves
forcing some people to work

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:02.250
and not others, the background
control over property,

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.110
and investment in
employment that

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:06.687
is its own independent
source of oppression.

00:27:06.687 --> 00:27:08.520
So it has nothing to
say directly about that

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.310
and just assumes that that
structure remains in place.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:14.910
And has nothing directly to
say about the relationships

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.530
of domination in the
workplace itself.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:19.110
Those are incidental questions.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.420
So it's far too narrow
an understanding

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:26.280
of the kind of injustice that
we can see a right to strike to,

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.140
and ends up narrowing
the kinds of things

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.030
that workers may
legitimately strike over.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.480
It usually tends to be about
wages and benefits rather than

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.180
any of these other
broader questions of power

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:40.860
and authority in the economy.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.910
So what's distinct, then,
about seeing the right

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:46.970
to strike as a right
to resist oppression?

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:48.980
Well, I think the
first point is to say

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.229
that when we understand the
right to strike as a right

00:27:51.229 --> 00:27:53.930
to resist oppression, we're
saying that strikes can

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:58.790
be about the full array
of unjust limitations

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:01.880
on workers' freedom.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.090
Strikes can be about things
like particular policies that

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:07.250
affect the
distribution of control

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:09.170
over property and investment.

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.710
Or strikes can be about various
grievances and exercises

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:14.450
of managerial authority.

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:17.110
So if we see it as a right
to resist oppression,

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.400
then it's a way of
arguing for the right

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.490
to strike in a way that's
responsive to the entirety

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:25.970
of the injustices that I'm
saying exist in the economy.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.040
And I should just add
that you might not

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.970
agree with every aspect
of my characterization

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.122
of the economy.

00:28:33.122 --> 00:28:34.580
But so long as you
agree that there

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.840
are some deep and systematic
injustices in the economy that

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.300
can't just be resolved by
altering the terms of a labor

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:47.180
contract, then I think this
particular view should still

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:48.650
be persuasive to you.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:51.200
Because the point is
that you don't assume

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.950
that the only moment or site
at which this oppression exists

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.480
is at the moment
when workers make

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.340
contracts with their employers.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.172
It also extends past the
time of contract and prior,

00:29:01.172 --> 00:29:03.380
to the fact that they're
forced into the labor market

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:06.542
on an equal terms
in the first place.

00:29:06.542 --> 00:29:08.000
So that's the first
point about why

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.220
I think seeing it as a
right to resist oppression

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:15.260
is more responsive to
the kinds of injustices

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.540
and the concern
for freedom that I

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.620
think animates the best argument
for the right to strike.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.390
Just emphasize,
the point is to say

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.430
that what really
drives this argument is

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.510
to say that what
workers are demanding

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:29.600
or what workers should
be free to demand

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.680
isn't just higher levels of
income or better benefits,

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.710
but greater freedom and
therefore resistance

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:38.930
to the wide array of
forms of unfreedom

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.460
that they face in the economy.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:44.390
The second advantage that
I think this view has

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:48.200
is that it means that
the right to strike

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.380
is shaped in a way that
allows it to actually protect

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:54.280
the interest that justifies it.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.410
I know that sort of an
obscure way of saying it.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:00.410
So by shape, I just mean
that the shape of a right

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.840
is what kinds of
permissions and restrictions

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.110
there are on it's exercise.

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:07.880
Now we saw in the
other two cases

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.540
the shape of their version
of the right to strike

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.130
was limited by the
need to respect

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:14.750
the basic economic
and civil liberties

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.910
because that way of
thinking derived the right

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:19.400
to strike from those basic
economic and civil liberties.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.364
But this way of thinking--

00:30:21.364 --> 00:30:23.030
the right to strike
as a right to resist

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.700
oppression-- just begins
from the basic interest

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.430
that workers have in
exercising their freedom,

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.770
exercising their
collective capacity

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.700
to reduce the oppression
to which they're subject.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:40.130
Which means that the right
must include permission

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:42.830
to use some kinds of
means that gives them

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:46.080
a reasonable chance of actually
resisting that oppression.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.460
It won't just import these
restrictions that normally

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.584
apply to basic civil liberties.

00:30:52.584 --> 00:30:54.125
So I think that's
a further advantage

00:30:54.125 --> 00:30:56.450
is it's more suitably tailored
to the aim is supposed

00:30:56.450 --> 00:31:00.410
to promote, which is to give
workers the actual capacity

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:04.360
to use their own agency to
resist the oppression they

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.980
face.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.720
The third and I think
final superiority

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.250
of this particular
way of thinking

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.680
is that it also explains
why the right to strike

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.550
enjoys priority over these basic
economic and civil liberties

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:21.770
in the case of labor disputes,
which is the following.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:24.110
If the right to strike is a
right to resist oppression

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:27.350
and the oppression that
workers are resisting

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:31.190
is a product of the way
in which the law protects

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:33.800
these basic economic
and civil liberties,

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.260
then those basic economic and
civil liberties-- at least

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.330
when it comes to the
economy-- are not

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:40.430
worthy of very much respect.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:43.820
Because it's the protection
of those particular liberties

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.170
that creates the oppression
in the first place.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.050
And in fact, whatever
claim to respect

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:50.840
those liberties have
is actually a claim

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:51.967
for the right to strike.

00:31:51.967 --> 00:31:54.050
Because it's actually in
the exercise of the right

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:57.350
to strike that workers
come closer to demanding

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:59.870
the kind of equal
freedom that is the basis

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:02.570
for any reasonable
account of just economic

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.560
and social relationships.

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:09.800
So this way of thinking
about the right to strike

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.939
answers the question in a
way that's both coherent

00:32:12.939 --> 00:32:14.480
and establishes it's
own limitations.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.060
It's just an argument about
why the right to strike

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:20.420
would have priority over basic
economic and civil liberties

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:23.360
like property rights,
freedom of contract,

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.100
freedom of association
in the economy,

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.380
and even general counts
of law and order.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.210
Because when the law
protects those rights,

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:30.890
it actually creates
the very oppression

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:33.290
that the right to
strike is a response to.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:36.230
Since the normal justification
of those basic economic and

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:38.990
civil liberties is
that they create

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.230
a kind of fair or just
system of social cooperation,

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:45.080
but they in fact just create
this highly unequal system

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.336
of forcing coercion
and domination,

00:32:47.336 --> 00:32:49.460
it's actually the right to
strike that has a better

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.974
claim to having priority.

00:32:51.974 --> 00:32:54.140
So we can see then how, if
you think about the right

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.990
to strike this way, we resolve
the dilemma that I began

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:59.130
with in a very different way.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.850
We say that as a feature
of their right to strike it

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:04.340
is permissible,
perhaps even good,

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:09.170
that workers don't respect the
property rights of employers

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:12.440
and the authority of
managers, and instead

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.500
demand better terms by using
some of these coercive tactics.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:24.480
Now let me just conclude
with two thoughts.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.910
I'm sure at this
point some of you

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:29.900
are thinking, well, sounds like
you think strikers can do just

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.090
whatever they want.

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:34.130
And that's not what I'm arguing.

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:35.960
I'm arguing something narrower.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.320
I'm saying that this central
dilemma about whether strikers

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:42.560
have the permission to violate
certain property rights

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.930
and other basic economic
and civil liberties

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:46.820
in the context of
labor disputes,

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:49.160
whether that's permitted.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.640
I'm saying that particular--

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:54.350
the normal respect we accord
to basic economic and civil

00:33:54.350 --> 00:34:00.080
liberties isn't required
because what strikers are doing

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.750
are actually demanding fairer
terms of social cooperation.

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:07.550
They're demanding more freedom
than they currently enjoy.

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:10.600
But that doesn't mean that they
can just do anything they want.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.830
It doesn't mean all moral
rules on human behavior

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:13.520
are suspended.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.260
It just means our normal respect
for these basic liberties

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:19.170
isn't as strong.

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:23.190
Secondly, I imagine some of
you are also wondering or maybe

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:25.620
saying yourselves,
well, OK, it's

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.960
true that the economy
is deeply unjust.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:30.480
But why bother with
the right to strike?

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:35.260
Why not just argue for something
else, like a fairer economy?

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.409
Now I'm seeing all the nods.

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:43.679
Well, the reason is because
I think that's a complete non

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:47.639
sequitur So the
question is, what

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:50.219
may those who suffer
oppression do to resist

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:51.929
the oppression they face?

00:34:51.929 --> 00:34:54.600
The answer is not, well, we
should have a non-oppressive

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.740
economy because that's
telling people--

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.520
in light of an ideal that
is incredibly unfeasible

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.230
and unbelievably remote--

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.700
they shouldn't try and resist
the oppression where they are.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.594
It's a kind of
apology for quietism.

00:35:11.594 --> 00:35:13.010
There are good
reasons for wanting

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:17.420
to know what an ideal or much
more just or more or less just

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:21.722
economy is, but to say in
response to my argument--

00:35:21.722 --> 00:35:23.180
oh no, we shouldn't
argue for right

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.100
to strike, surely
what we should argue

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:29.290
for, sort of in the
abstract, is a just economy--

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:32.660
is I think in the context
argument just to say,

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.670
when you ask the question
what may actually

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:38.540
existing workers do to resist
the oppression that they faced,

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.650
your answer is nothing.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:43.980
Or argue for an incredibly
remote political ideal

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.620
that has little to no
chance of being realized

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:51.870
any time in the short or medium
term within the currently

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:54.490
existing institutions.

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:57.880
So I'm not saying it
isn't worth contemplating

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.900
these questions about better
social policies and so on.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:05.860
But it's a separate question and
not a response to what I think

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:07.960
is the most immediate--
the more immediate--

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.310
social and political question.

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:12.910
Which is, when people face a
kind of systematic limitation

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:15.460
on their freedom what
may they do to resist it?

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.520
I think the right to strike is
one very important way which

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:21.650
in workers in the economy
can resist that oppression.

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:23.960
So thank you very much.
