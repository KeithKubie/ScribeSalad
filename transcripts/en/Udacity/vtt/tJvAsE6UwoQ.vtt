All right, we just went through the process of turning the

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:06.440
HTML into the Document Object Model. As an exercise, I want you

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.520
to head into the forum and describe these steps, or if

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.900
you can't get to the forums, find a friend and explain it

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.340
to them. As a hint, you should have at least three

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.690
steps. And while you're at it, describe what information the DOM tree

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.650
stores within it. Cameron and I will periodically check the forum and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.380
respond to the answers. That`s it. Don`t be shy about helping other

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.880
students as well. Good luck.
