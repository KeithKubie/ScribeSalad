00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.980
Hello, I'm Hank Green and I want to teach
you chemistry.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.009
But please, do not run away screaming.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.320
If you give me five minutes to try to convince
you that chemistry is not torture,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.159
but instead the amazing and beautiful science
of stuff,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.980
and if you give it a chance it will not only blow your mind but also give you a deeper understanding of your world.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.540
This is just my opinion here,

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.070
but I think that understanding the world leads
to greater ability to enjoy the world

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.070
and there's nothing that helps you understand
the world better than chemistry.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.360
Chemistry holds the secrets to how life first
formed, how cancers are cured,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.579
how iPhones have bigger hard drives than 5
year old laptops,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.880
and how life on this planet might just be able to continue thriving, even ours, if we play our cards right.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.960
Chemistry is the science of how three tiny particles, the proton, the neutron, and the electron,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.180
came together in trillions of combinations
to form, get this, everything.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.000
Now chemistry is a peculiar science,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.219
sometimes talked about as a bridge between
the ultra abstract world of particle physics

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.919
and the more visible sciences like biology.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.420
But calling chemistry a bridge is like calling
Eurasia an island.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.320
Chemistry has it all, mad scientists, world
changing revelations, the practical, the impractical,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.740
medicine, bombs, food, beauty, destruction, life and death, answers to questions you never knew you had.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.460
I love chemistry, and I hope I can give you
a glimpse into why.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.210
So today, let's start out with maybe the biggest
idea of all time, and move on from there:

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.660
stuff is made from atoms.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:44.140
[Theme Music]

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.500
I know, you aren't shocked, you aren't awed,
you might not even be paying attention any more,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.680
but when atomic theory was first proposed,
it sounded pretty crazy.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.320
And yes, we call it 'Atomic Theory', using
the scientific definition of theory,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.560
which is "a well-tested set of ideas that
explains many disparate observations",

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.660
not the colloquial definition of theory, which
is "a guess."

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.540
But luckily there's no-one running around
any more saying "atoms are just a theory."

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.340
But it wasn't that long ago that people were
running around saying that.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.860
You wanna know who settled it for good?
Einstein!

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.099
Atoms had been postulated for a long time
by the 20th century,

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:25.099
but it wasn't until Einstein mathematically proved the existence of atoms and molecules in 1905

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.840
that the matter was truly settled.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.420
And you thought Einstein was all about relativity
and E=mc2, he also proved atoms exist!

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.860
Here's how it happened:

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.160
In 1827, a botanist named Robert Brown was looking at pollen grains in water through a microscope

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.960
and he noticed that they jiggled randomly even when there was no movement to cause the jiggling.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.520
It was a mystery for a long time.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.660
Until 1905 when Einstein theorized that this
phenomenon was caused by

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.890
as-yet-unproven atomic particles actually
smacking into the grains of pollen.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.190
He wrote up some fancy math, showing that
his theory predicted this motion almost perfectly,

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.900
and everyone had to concede that yes, tiny discrete bits of matter were indeed smacking into the pollen,

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.920
and thus molecules, and by extension atoms,
must exist.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.860
Today, we remember this botanist and his discovery by calling the motion he observed Brownian motion.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.420
It's kinda crazy that every physical thing you've ever interacted with is made up of little ball thingies.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.200
It started with people wondering what would happen if you just kept slicing something in half forever.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.480
Eventually, and of course it turns out that
there's no knife sharp enough to do this,

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.009
you end up with one, pure, unbreakable bit
of that substance.

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:40.279
The word "atom", indeed, is from the Greek
for "indivisible",

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:45.379
though, of course, as we learned in World
War II, atoms can be broken as well.

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.799
So all the stuff that we think of as stuff is made of atoms, tiny discrete particles that have specific properties,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.820
depending on the arrangement of three simple
subatomic particles.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.220
There's the proton, heavy and positively charged, the neutron, about the same size as the proton but neutral,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.800
and the electron, which has the same amount
of charge as the proton, just opposite,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.160
and very nearly has no mass at all, about 1800 times less massive than the proton or neutron.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.020
Protons and neutrons hang out in the nucleus,
and thus are the nuclear components or nucleons;

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.760
electrons hang out around the nucleus and are the parts of the atom that do all the interesting chemical stuff.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.560
But before we get to the chemistry of the electrons, we first have got to understand the properties of the nucleus.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.820
Okay, this is pretty important, so pay attention
here.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.050
The number of protons in an atom determines
what element it is.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.780
79 protons: always gold.
59 protons: always praseodymium.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.660
The number of protons in an element is its
atomic number.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.940
It sits right on top of the box in the periodic table because that is the element's defining trait.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.000
So an atom of silver with 47 protons in its
nucleus is always an atom of silver.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.780
Depending on what its electrons are doing
and what it's bonded to,

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.800
it might be part of a chemical that's silver-colored or black or blue or shiny or poisonous or a cure for disease,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.040
but whatever it is, that atom is still silver and will remain an atom of silver probably forever,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.200
because that core number is very, very difficult
to change.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.720
Now you might have noticed something weird
about silver here:

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.210
it's chemical symbol, the one- or two-letter
short code that tells you what it is, is Ag,

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:26.160
not Si, which is silicon, or Sv which is perfectly
available, but Ag. Why? To torture you? No.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.180
Silver, of course, because we've known about it for a long time, was one of the first elements added to the periodic table,

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.810
and back then it was called "argentum", Latin
for "shiny gray stuff."

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.490
Also, the root of the word "Argentina",

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.790
where Spanish explorers heard rumors of mountains
made of silver, which of course did not exist.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.130
The name "Argentina", just like the chemical
symbol "Ag", stuck,

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.350
despite neither of them being particularly
representative of reality. Now, back to science.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.370
Nuclei, which is the plural of nucleus, are
boring.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.940
They're thousands of times smaller than the
atom as a whole,

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.260
and they mostly just sit around being exactly
the same as they were when they were first

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.120
created billions of years ago,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.960
held together by the strongest of the four fundamental forces of physics, the strong nuclear force.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.440
The fact that nuclei are so boring is the very reason they're the defining characteristic of elements.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.560
While electrons can jump from atom to atom
whenever it's convenient,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.960
the number of protons is almost always extremely
stable.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.520
So that core of the atom, the nucleus, always
comes out of chemical reactions unscathed.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.500
It's the bit that we can bump around from
reaction to reaction,

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.320
but always remains pure and behaves the same way as any other atom with that number of protons.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.600
The atomic number is the soul of the atom.
It's what makes it it.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.940
Neutrons are important too, of course, in their own way, but they don't change what element an atom is.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:48.040
One of the two keys to all things chemical
is charge, we'll discuss that in another episode,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.980
and since neutrons don't have any charge, they mostly don't change the properties of an atom.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.900
But they are, nonetheless, vital.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.220
We all know that like charges repel each other.
Neutrons serve as a kind of buffer between the protons.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:03.460
You couldn't pack silver's 47 protons together
in the nucleus by themselves.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.010
They couldn't handle it; they'd rip themselves
apart.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.130
So nuclei only clump together permanently when the right number of protons and neutrons get together.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:17.170
Silver needs about 60 neutrons to space out the 47 protons correctly. But it doesn't have to be 60.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.610
In fact, silver nuclei are also very stable
with 62 neutrons.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:27.040
61 though, that doesn't work, and the reasons for that, I don't know, you would have to talk to a nuclear physicist.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.820
The atomic number of silver doesn't change
as the number of neutrons changes

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.360
because the number of protons stays the same.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.060
But the relative atomic mass does change.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.780
Relative atomic mass, which used to be called
atomic weight back when I was in school,

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:45.000
is basically the number of protons plus the number of neutrons averaged across all the silver on Earth.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.520
Because silver has two different stable isotopes,
each with a different number of neutrons,

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.580
its relative atomic mass ends up not being
a whole number.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:57.520
About 52% of silver has 60 neutrons and about
48% has 62.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:04.500
The relative atomic mass, then, ends up being
about halfway between 107 and 109, 107.8682.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.040
You'll note that I said these two different
sorts of silver are called isotopes,

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.960
they have different masses but the same chemical
properties,

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.130
and are the same element and so belong in
the same place on the periodic table.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.360
In fact, the word "isotope" means "same place".

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.060
And different isotopes have different mass
numbers.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:26.660
The mass number is just the total number of nucleons in the nucleus, which is different from atomic mass.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:33.340
It's simple addition for a single atom, rather than an average of all the relative atomic masses of all the silver atoms on Earth.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:39.240
So silver has two stable isotopes, one with
a mass number of 107, which we'd call silver-107,

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.540
and one with a mass number of 109, silver-109.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.720
There's an easy way to write all this out,
of course, to keep your information straight.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.249
The chemical symbol, with the atomic number
or number of protons here,

00:08:49.249 --> 00:08:52.629
the mass number, or number of protons and
neutrons here,

00:08:52.629 --> 00:08:57.940
and the charge out here, which tells you by simple addition or subtraction how many electrons there are.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.720
Finally, before we conclude this first episode
of Crash Course Chemistry,

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:07.280
and thus, our discussion of the atomic nucleus,
a note on the pronunciation of "nucleus".

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.220
You are welcome to say "nuculus", it is an
accepted pronunciation of that word,

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:17.220
but if you can find it in you, it's probably best to switch over to "nucleus", which is, after all, how it's spelled.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.560
And that is all for today's episode of Crash Course Chemistry, if you were paying attention, you now know:

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.020
More about atoms than anyone did in 1900,

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.080
like that they were finally confirmed when
Einstein mathematically defined Brownian motion;

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.560
That elements are chemically pure substances,

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:38.140
and the type of element an atom is is defined by how many protons it has in its nucleus, or its atomic number;

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.519
That neutrons stabilize nuclei for their proton
friends;

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.580
That different isotopes of the same element are the reason relative atomic masses are never whole numbers;

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.820
and you know that nuclei are the uninteresting,
boring bits of the atom,

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.660
and the electrons are where all the interesting
chemical-ly stuff happens.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.880
