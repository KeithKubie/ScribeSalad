00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:03.934
BACTERIA ARE TINY ONE-CELLED
ORGANISMS WITH THEIR OWN DNA.

00:00:03.934 --> 00:00:06.801
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY
TO DIVIDE, GROW,

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:11.133
AND, AS IS BEAUTIFULLY AND
TERRIFYINGLY SHOWN HERE, EVOLVE.

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.901
Narrator:
BECAUSE WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE

00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:15.234
IS HOW THE PETRI DISH
IS DIVIDED INTO ZONES

00:00:15.234 --> 00:00:18.400
HOLDING INCREASING STRENGTHS
OF ANTIBIOTICS...

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.634
THAT STILL CAN'T STOP
THE BACTERIA.

00:00:22.634 --> 00:00:26.934
DO NOT MESS WITH
SINGLE-CELLED ORGANISMS.

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:29.200
Narrator: THIS IS THE WORK
OF HARVARD MED RESEARCHERS

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.868
MICHAEL BAYM, TAMI LIEBERMAN,
AND ROY KISHONY.

00:00:33.868 --> 00:00:38.334
BUT HOW ARE THEIR BACTERIA
BEATING THE ANTIBIOTIC?

00:00:38.334 --> 00:00:41.133
IN THIS EXPERIMENT,
REGULAR E. COLI BACTERIA

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:44.634
ARE PLACED AT THE VERY ENDS
OF A GIANT PETRI DISH.

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:46.501
NOW, THERE'S NO
ANTIBIOTICS THERE,

00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:48.801
BUT EVERY FEW INCHES,

00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:51.968
INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS
OF ANTIBIOTICS ARE ADDED

00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:53.601
SO THAT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE,

00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:57.367
THERE IS 1,000 TIMES
THE AMOUNT OF ANTIBIOTICS

00:00:57.367 --> 00:00:59.634
REQUIRED TO KILL THE E. COLI.

00:00:59.634 --> 00:01:02.133
THE BACTERIA,
WHICH APPEAR WHITE,

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.033
GROW UNTIL THEY ENCOUNTER

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:06.767
A ZONE OF ANTIBIOTICS
THAT STOPS THEM.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:10.067
BUT THEN YOU SEE ONE
OF THE COLONIES OF BACTERIA

00:01:10.067 --> 00:01:11.934
WILL START GROWING
INTO THAT ZONE

00:01:11.934 --> 00:01:15.901
BECAUSE IT HAS EVOLVED
RESISTANCE TO THAT ANTIBIOTIC.

00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:18.133
Narrator:
HOW DO BACTERIA EVOLVE?

00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:20.667
Krishna-Pillay: THEY REPRODUCE
BY GETTING BIG ENOUGH

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:22.467
TO MAKE A COPY OF THEMSELVES.

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:24.367
THE IDEA IS THAT THAT NEW COPY

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:26.033
IS EXACTLY THE SAME
AS THE FIRST ONE,

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:28.100
BUT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS
WORK LIKE THAT.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.834
THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE
THAT YOU'LL HAVE

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:31.467
SOME KIND OF GENETIC MUTATION

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:32.834
THAT MAKES YOU
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:34.567
TO THE FIRST BACTERIAL CELL.

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:36.801
Ruben: THIS ABILITY
TO MULTIPLY QUICKLY,

00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:40.067
DURING WHICH THEIR OFFSPRING
ARE ESSENTIALLY TRYING OUT

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:43.200
THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE
OF DIFFERENT RANDOM MUTATIONS,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.067
ALLOWS THE BACTERIA
TO EVOLVE VERY FAST.

00:01:46.067 --> 00:01:48.067
THIS IS EVOLUTION IN ACTION.

00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:49.934
WE SEE THIS OVER AND OVER

00:01:49.934 --> 00:01:52.868
AS THE BACTERIA GROW TOWARDS
THE CENTER OF THE PLATE.

00:01:52.868 --> 00:01:54.934
Krishna-Pillay: THIS IS
A FANTASTIC ILLUSTRATION

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:57.868
OF WHY WE SHOULDN'T
OVERUSE ANTIBIOTICS.

00:01:57.868 --> 00:02:01.234
EVERY TIME WE TAKE ANTIBIOTICS,
WE'RE EXPOSING BACTERIA TO THEM.

00:02:01.234 --> 00:02:02.334
AND EVERY TIME WE DO THAT,

00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:04.300
THEY'RE EVOLVING
TO DEAL WITH IT.
