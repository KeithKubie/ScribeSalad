00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.210
For generations, just about everybody in the
United States got vaccinations.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.740
And I’m sure there will be no conversation
about this in the comments.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.740
And as a result, diseases like measles were
all but eradicated.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.610
But in 1998, a study published in a scientific
journal linked vaccines with autism.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.360
Even though that study was later discredited,
ever since then,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.009
a small but vocal subset of parents have refused
to vaccinate their kids.

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.600
Now, measles are back, as is whooping cough, mumps, and other diseases that were nearly wiped out.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.320
Children’s lives are being endangered because
some parents are acting on beliefs that have

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.150
no scientific evidence to support them.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.320
So, why am I talking about this on Crash Course
Philosophy?

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.110
Normally, when we talk about responsibility,
we’re talking about things that you do.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.950
But in philosophy, we sometimes face other
obligations.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.130
Some philosophers have argued that we all
have epistemic responsibility –

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.930
that is, responsibility we have regarding
our beliefs.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.320
Epistemic responsibility is an especially
interesting area of philosophy

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.970
because it’s where many of its sub-disciplines
overlap –

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.790
where epistemology brushes up against philosophy
of religion, which bumps into ethics.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.380
And philosophers might argue that we live in a world that could probably use a lot more epistemic responsibility –

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.100
or at least, more people who understand what
it is.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.999
Anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers, conspiracy
theorists.

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:19.659
The world is full of people who hold beliefs
without any evidence.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.329
And not only that, they – like most of us
– encourage others to share their beliefs.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.719
But over the past 200 years or so, philosophers have developed some pretty compelling responses to this phenomenon.

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.889
A few thinkers have come up with useful ways
of thinking about the beliefs we have,

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:36.630
and the harm they can cause, and what responsibilities
go along with having them.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.370
Meanwhile, others have argued that we can
sometimes hold beliefs without any proof.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.980
Not about vaccines, or global warming, or
the moon landing – but about God.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:54.300
[Theme Music]

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.520
W.K. Clifford lived in England in the mid-1800s, where the only vaccine that existed was for smallpox,

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:03.569
and even that earned its share of scorn and
ridicule at the time.

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.149
But Clifford, who was both a mathematician
and a philosopher,

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.809
would probably have some very strong opinions
about today’s anti-vaxxers.

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:13.769
Because Clifford was one of the leading proponents
of epistemic responsibility of his time.

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.120
He most famously, and bluntly, put it this
way:

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:21.340
“It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.”

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.560
And instead of using vaccinations as an example,
Clifford told the story of a ship owner.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.580
He said, suppose there was a guy who owned a ship that he knew was old and decrepit and hadn’t been inspected in a long time.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.540
That ship was scheduled to make a transatlantic voyage, and the owner worried that it might not make it.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.340
But, overhauling the ship would be pricey
and time-consuming.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.099
In time, the owner talked himself into believing
that the ship was seaworthy.

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.790
The ship set sail. Then it sank.
And hundreds of people drowned.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.900
But, the owner? He collected insurance money from his loss, and no one blamed him for the tragedy.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.720
Now, most people would agree that the shipowner was responsible for the deaths of the ship’s passengers.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.800
But Clifford went even further.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.460
He argued that the owner would have been guilty even if the ship managed to make the trip safely.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.459
Because: He was guilty of accepting a belief
without sufficient evidence,

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.739
and whether that actually leads to harm or not, he has still done wrong, epistemically and morally.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.000
Now, you might argue, “Don’t I have the right to believe whatever I want, as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone?”

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.180
Yeah, good question. Clifford argued that
there’s no such thing as a private belief.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.940
Because: We all talk about our beliefs – some of us do it a lot – and it causes our beliefs to spread.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.360
But even if you never vocalize a belief, it still influences the way you act and the way others perceive you.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.480
So in this way, a belief can spread subtly,
insidiously, without a word being spoken.

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.289
Think about other kinds of beliefs that lack
evidence, for example sexist beliefs.

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.969
Imagine a modern day sexist in an American
university.

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:48.589
Most of these people are gonna know that actually expressing their sexist views isn't going to fly.

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:51.499
But a sexist’s beliefs, even if they’re
never overtly stated,

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:54.579
tend to show through in the ways they interact
with women and speak of them.

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.559
So, no matter what: You know them and you know their views and you know their views subtly influence others,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.139
particularly if they’re a person in position
of authority or respect.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.999
Since our views always have the potential
to harm others, W. K. Clifford argued that

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:11.119
we have an epistemic responsibility only to
believe things for which we have evidence.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.800
And if you don’t have evidence, you’re
morally obligated to refrain from the belief.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.139
Basically, you should withhold judgment until
you investigate the situation.

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.720
Let’s head over to the Thought Bubble to
explore this more with some Flash Philosophy.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.880
It’s Tuesday, and your teacher tells you
that, this week, there will be a pop quiz.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.960
And she’s nice enough to even define for
you what she means by this:

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.960
A pop quiz, she says, is a quiz that you can’t
know is coming in advance.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.700
You reason, however, that such a quiz is impossible,
so you never study for it.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.900
Here’s your reasoning:

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.720
The quiz can’t be on Friday, because if
Wednesday and Thursday go by with no quiz,

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.470
then you would know it was coming on Friday, since that would be the last possible day. So Friday’s out.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.730
But that means it can’t be on Thursday either,
because

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.340
by the end of class on Wednesday, you would
know the quiz would be happening the next day.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.560
But since it can’t be on Thursday or Friday, it also can’t be on Wednesday, because that’s the only day left –

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.360
so you would know in advance that it was coming.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.640
Now, any amount of rationalization that will convince you that you don't have to study might sound pretty sweet.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.890
But, in this case, you’re probably going
to regret it.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.350
Because, after all, if your teacher tells you there’s going to be a quiz, chances are, there is going to be a quiz.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.550
The fact that you’ve constructed a brilliant mind game that proves that it won’t, isn’t going to make that quiz not happen.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.260
So, beliefs about vaccines and shipworthiness may be irresponsible because of the danger they pose to others,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.360
but this case demonstrates that irresponsible
beliefs can be damaging to you, as well.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.560
Thanks,Thought Bubble! Clifford made a pretty
convincing case for epistemic responsibility.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.140
And it’s worth pointing out that his beef wasn’t only with ship owners or kids who didn’t study.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.760
One thing his arguments were meant to show is that religious belief is epistemically irresponsible.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.420
Belief in a God whose existence can’t be
proven was simply “blind faith,” he said.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.500
And blind faith leads a person to ignore other facts and arguments, causing them to live an unexamined,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.140
unthoughtful life that Clifford described
as “one long sin against mankind.”

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.880
Unsurprisingly, this idea was met with some counterarguments.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.720
Let’s hear from one of his interlocutors:

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.810
19th century American philosopher and psychologist
William James took issue with

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.590
Clifford’s thesis that it is immoral to
believe something with insufficient evidence.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.450
James acknowledged that one of his beliefs that was most important to him – his belief in God – lacked evidence.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.040
So he set out to demonstrate that certain
beliefs can be held, morally,

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.600
even if there’s nothing you can really point
to, to back them up.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.300
Now, James recognized that it would be ridiculous to say it’s ok to believe in just anything you wanted.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.370
So he narrowed down his claim to argue that,
when you adopt a belief, you have options.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.320
And the nature of those options can basically determine the moral defensibility of the beliefs you end up holding.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.320
Specifically, he said that the options you face when choosing a belief could be either live or dead;

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.410
forced or unforced;
And momentous or trivial.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.530
You face a live option when you’re considering a belief that you could actually see yourself having.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.000
For instance, maybe you’ve never had a pumpkin
spice latte.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.240
But you love pumpkin, and you love lattes,
and you love spice,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.420
so you hypothesize that you would enjoy a
pumpkin spice latte.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.460
That’s a live option for you – because you can imagine yourself believing that you’d like a pumpkin spice latte.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.590
On the other hand, you probably can’t even
entertain the possibility that you’d enjoy,

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.670
like, a dog food spice latte.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.610
Try as you might, you just can’t imagine
accepting that option as an actual belief.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.360
So, that’s a dead option to you.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.960
Now, a forced option is one in which, whatever you do, you’ve made a choice. You can’t not choose.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.020
‘Stay in or go out,’ is a good example
of a forced option.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.050
You have to do one or the other; you can’t
wait and decide later.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.000
Because, as you wait to decide, you’ve stayed
in and thus, you have made your choice.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.800
But unforced options are those where you can
just opt out of choosing.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.300
If I let you pick peanut butter or ham and cheese, you can always just decide to have neither.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.200
So your choice is an unforced option.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:38.140
A momentous option is one that, if you choose it, stands the chance of radically changing your life for the better.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.080
Accepting an opportunity to go to the International
Space Station, for example, could be momentous.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.170
But the option to have French fries with your
burger would be trivial –

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.420
eat them, don’t eat them, either way –
not gonna make a huge difference in your life.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:53.620
Now, James said that, if you’re considering whether to believe something for which there’s not sufficient evidence,

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:59.320
it’s permissible to still believe it – so long as it’s a live, forced, and momentous option.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.000
And religious belief just happens to fill
all of those criteria.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.040
First, James said, believing in God is a live option for himself and a whole lot of other people.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.490
He also argued that religious belief is a
forced option.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.150
That’s because he didn’t buy the idea
that agnosticism was really a thing.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:18.070
He figured that withholding judgment is the same as not believing – so you either believe in God, or you don’t.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.980
Finally, James thought religious belief is momentous – it has the possibility to greatly improve your life.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:28.420
So, he concluded that we are justified in believing in God in the absence of evidence through faith alone.

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.420
The problem is, if we’re justified in believing
in God in the absence of evidence,

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.990
then we’re also justified in believing that
it’s ok not to vaccinate our kids.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.219
Because that, too, is an option that can be
described as live, forced, and momentous.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.659
So unfortunately, philosophy can’t just make all of the baseless beliefs in the world go away.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.700
But it can help you argue against those ideas
intelligently.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.310
Today we have learned about epistemic responsibility.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:53.180
Clifford says it is always wrong to believe
without sufficient evidence,

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.880
but James says there are some exceptions – namely,
religious belief.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.680
Next time we will consider whether we can
gamble our way to belief in God – stay tuned!
