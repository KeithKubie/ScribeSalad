00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.630
MALE SPEAKER: We're going to
be traveling across the country

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.200
to hear about how the Google
Maps API has helped developers

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.932
to build great apps, and
build their businesses on it.

00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:16.440
FEMALE SPEAKER: Road trip.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.100
FEMALE SPEAKER:
We have a 1959 GM

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.430
bus that's going to be
driving from here, all the way

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.140
to Disney.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.556
MALE SPEAKER: Code
the Road bus is

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:25.210
a rolling museum of really
cool demos of our partners,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.245
using the Maps API.

00:00:32.862 --> 00:00:35.070
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're here
at our first stop, at I/O.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.097
And the developer
feedback has been amazing.

00:00:38.097 --> 00:00:40.430
MALE SPEAKER: Have any of you
used the Maps APIs before?

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.109
MALE SPEAKER: My
entire app runs on it.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.275
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, fantastic.

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:45.517
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Next stop, Logan.

00:00:45.517 --> 00:00:47.100
MALE SPEAKER: I'm
here in Logan, Utah,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.955
at the headquarters of iFit,
the world's first digital five

00:00:49.955 --> 00:00:50.674
kilometer run.

00:00:50.674 --> 00:00:52.840
FEMALE SPEAKER: You're
getting this amazing workout.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.270
It was so fun.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.850
MALE SPEAKER: iFit and Google
have completely changed the way

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.341
that you view fitness.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:14.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: We just
made it to Milwaukee,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.239
to meet with Harley-Davidson.

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:17.071
FEMALE SPEAKER: The
ride planner application

00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:18.280
does a lot for our customers.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.650
And Google Places and Google
Maps, layered on top of that,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.237
really make it
all come together.

00:01:25.237 --> 00:01:26.820
MALE SPEAKER: I got
Patrick, and we're

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.130
getting ready to take
him over to the Code

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.130
the Road Google meet-up.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.796
PATRICK SKOGLUND:
It's good sitting down

00:01:30.796 --> 00:01:32.870
with other developers,
to get behind the scenes.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.370
When you look at
Google Maps, you're

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.527
able to do so many things.

00:01:35.527 --> 00:01:37.652
LARRY OLSZAC: What the
Google tool allowed us to do

00:01:37.652 --> 00:01:40.550
is bring that all together,
then look at these points,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.120
and help the city
save dollars and time.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.248
MALE SPEAKER: We're here today
in New York with our friends

00:01:47.248 --> 00:01:48.039
from Sesame Street.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.892
ELMO: Elmo would go, go,
go with you anywhere.

00:01:51.892 --> 00:01:54.377
FEMALE SPEAKER: All about
location, location, location.

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:07.299
FEMALE SPEAKER: If I
wanted to see my view,

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.520
and I knew a room was right
here, I could just see my view.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.269
And then, that helps
you choose your room.

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.959
I use it every
single time I travel.

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.250
MALE SPEAKER: I'm down here
in lovely Atlanta, Georgia,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.272
with the Weather Channel for
the Code the Road hackathon.

00:02:20.272 --> 00:02:21.730
MALE SPEAKER: Right
now, developers

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.180
are hacking upstairs, coming
up with innovative ideas.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.510
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm here at
EPCOT, in Orlando, Florida,

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.010
to show tech sassy girls
some interesting things

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.932
about coding.

00:02:32.932 --> 00:02:34.390
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Not many people get

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.930
to experience what
we experienced today.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.513
FEMALE SPEAKER: What
better way to end

00:02:38.513 --> 00:02:40.720
a trip than at Disney World?
