There can be no floor without the sky. Blue darkening of the deepest, deepest kind.

Chris Ghaffari:
I'm Chris Ghaffari, and I'm the director of "This is Our Youth." I chose the play for

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.189 position:98%
Chris Ghaffari:
a lot of reasons. First, it's a play about kids our age. And what's really cool about

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.140 position:81%
Chris Ghaffari:
it is that we have actors who are playing their age.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:41.140 position:97%
Lindsey Rose Aguero-Sinclair:
I'm Lindsey Rose. I'm playing Jessica in "This Is Our Youth." Jessica is an aspiring fashion designer.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.750 position:89%
Lindsey Rose Aguero-Sinclair:
She's my age she's living in the city. She goes to F.I.T.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.620 position:97%
Matt Seely:
I'm Matt Seely. I'm playing Warren Straub in "This Is Our Youth." I think it just speaks

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.300 position:98%
Matt Seely:
to what were doing now and what we're doing here at college. We don't have to know what

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.380 position:97%
Matt Seely:
we're going to do. Everything we're doing is building to that.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.570 position:98%
Dan Yawitz:
My name is Dan Yawitz. I'm playing Dennis Ziegler in "This Is Our Youth." Dennis is

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:12.270 position:97%
Dan Yawitz:
a 21-year-old college dropout in 1982, living in a one-bedroom apartment in the Upper West

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:20.000 position:98%
Dan Yawitz:
Side of Manhattan, which his parents pay for, and he just sort of lives off of selling drugs.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.219 position:98%
Dan Yawitz:
His best friend is Warren Straub, who, during the play, comes to crash with him for a little while.

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:32.039 position:98%
Chris Ghaffari:
Rehearsing has been interesting, because we have been able to draw on some of the experiences

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.520
Chris Ghaffari:
of our actors.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.929 position:98%
Lindsey Rose Aguero-Sinclair :
Certain circumstances are very similar. I mean, being from New York, going to a private school.

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.710 position:98%
Dan Yawitz:
He's a white, Jewish, upper-middle-class guy from the Upper West Side of Manhattan,

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.000
Dan Yawitz:
oddly similar to myself.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:57.300 position:98%
Chris Ghaffari:
With the set, we wanted to create a small space. We wanted to give the actors minimal space

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.649 position:77%
Chris Ghaffari:
and force the characters to deal with each other.

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.950 position:98%
Matt Seely:
Because there's usually only two of us on stage at any given time, we can play around

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.569 position:98%
Matt Seely:
with the space that we're given. We don't have to coordinate all of our movements. It's

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:19.170 position:97%
Matt Seely:
nice. It's freeing. Even though it's a small space, it's very freeing to be natural.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.989 position:97%
Dan Yawitz:
I think this play is incredibly relevant to Princeton students. It's a play about kids

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.959 position:97%
Dan Yawitz:
who have come from means but don't really take advantage of what they have, and at Princeton

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.349 position:97%
Dan Yawitz:
we're really in a place where we have so much and so much is at our fingertips, but what

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.329 position:98%
Dan Yawitz:
we choose to do with that and how we choose to use that is really up to us. So, I think

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.819 position:97%
Dan Yawitz:
that the play could be seen as a challenge to Princeton students to use what we have

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.680
Dan Yawitz:
and make the best of what we have.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.590
Lindsey Rose Aguero-Sinclair:
This is our youth.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.720
Matt Seely:
This is our youth.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.870
Dan Yawitz:
This is our youth.
