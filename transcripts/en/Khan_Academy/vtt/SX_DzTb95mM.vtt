00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.668
Voiceover: In Couple A, right over here,

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:07.038
I have 2 individuals
who make $100,000 each

00:00:07.038 --> 00:00:09.072
in taxable income.

00:00:09.072 --> 00:00:10.614
The first thing I want to think about

00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:12.200
is how much they would pay

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.960
if they were taxed as individuals.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.533
Let's look at the individual
tax brackets here,

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:20.457
and get our calculator to
figure out what that would be.

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:24.619
For each of them, the first
8,925 of taxable income

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.291
is going to be taxed at 10%,

00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:29.074
and if we round, that's $893.

00:00:29.074 --> 00:00:31.125
$893.

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:35.621
Then the next increment,
from 8,925 to 36,250,

00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:37.676
is going to be taxed at 15%.

00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:40.205
I pre-calculated what that is.

00:00:40.205 --> 00:00:42.889
That's $4,099, rounding a bit.

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:44.534
4,099.

00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:48.002
Then the increment up to $87,850

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:49.789
is going to be taxed at 25%,

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.076
and that gets us $12,900.

00:00:54.076 --> 00:00:56.808
Then the increment above 87,850,

00:00:56.808 --> 00:00:58.713
this is essentially the
bracket they fall into,

00:00:58.713 --> 00:01:02.404
because they make less than $183,250,

00:01:02.404 --> 00:01:04.737
that's going to be taxed at 28%.

00:01:04.737 --> 00:01:11.225
It's going to be + .28 x the increment

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:17.472
above 87,850, so we have
100,000 of taxable income.

00:01:17.472 --> 00:01:18.737
Do I have the right number of zeros?

00:01:18.737 --> 00:01:20.139
Let me see; 1 ...

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:22.211
That's 100; that's 10,000 right now.

00:01:22.211 --> 00:01:24.666
That is 100,000; did I do that?

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:29.484
Yeah, 100,000 - 87,850.

00:01:29.484 --> 00:01:36.114
87,850, gets us to $21,294.

00:01:36.114 --> 00:01:38.338
This is what they would
each pay as individuals,

00:01:38.338 --> 00:01:39.468
but we're going to look
at them as a couple,

00:01:39.468 --> 00:01:41.341
so as a couple, both of them combined,

00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:44.333
if we multiply by 2, both
of them are combined,

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.117
if they were taxed as individuals,

00:01:46.117 --> 00:01:47.290
or if they had never got married,

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.804
and, I don't know, they
just lived together,

00:01:48.804 --> 00:01:53.934
what their combined taxes
would be, is $42,588.

00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:59.410
So $42,588, combined,
if they're not married.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.956
Now let's think about
how much they would pay

00:02:00.956 --> 00:02:04.139
as a married couple,
where they have $200,000

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:05.984
of combined taxable income.

00:02:05.984 --> 00:02:10.370
Now we would look at the filing
jointly married brackets,

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.753
and even if you're married
and you file as individuals,

00:02:13.753 --> 00:02:15.541
your brackets are essentially going to be

00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:17.471
half of these brackets right over here,

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:19.338
so it comes out economically equivalent,

00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:21.756
or it comes out economically equivalent

00:02:21.756 --> 00:02:23.612
if you make the same incomes.

00:02:23.612 --> 00:02:25.289
We're going to talk about
that a little bit more.

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:26.423
Let's look at this married,

00:02:26.423 --> 00:02:29.469
filing jointly, scenario for Couple A.

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:31.806
Let's get the calculator back out.

00:02:31.806 --> 00:02:33.941
Now we'll look at the married brackets.

00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:39.604
So the first 17,850 is
going to be taxed at 10%.

00:02:39.604 --> 00:02:40.672
You might already notice that,

00:02:40.672 --> 00:02:42.341
at least these first few brackets

00:02:42.341 --> 00:02:44.091
are exactly twice the numbers

00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:45.517
as these brackets right over here,

00:02:45.517 --> 00:02:47.877
and the general idea is
you now have 2 people,

00:02:47.877 --> 00:02:49.952
so they can essentially
have twice the income

00:02:49.952 --> 00:02:52.139
before they fall into another bracket.

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.164
But that keeps on going

00:02:53.164 --> 00:02:55.336
until you get to this
point right over here,

00:02:55.336 --> 00:02:56.812
and that's actually the
whole point of this video;

00:02:56.812 --> 00:02:58.674
to explore whether this results in

00:02:58.674 --> 00:03:03.168
married couples paying
larger or smaller taxes.

00:03:03.168 --> 00:03:05.174
Let's think about how
much this couple's paying.

00:03:05.174 --> 00:03:13.264
The first 17,850, 10%; that's $1,785.

00:03:13.264 --> 00:03:16.628
Then the increment up to 72,500

00:03:16.628 --> 00:03:19.005
is going to be taxed at 15%.

00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:23.205
Pre-calculated, that is
$8,188, right over there.

00:03:23.205 --> 00:03:26.801
Then the increment up to 146,400

00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:29.137
is going to be taxed at 25%.

00:03:29.137 --> 00:03:36.537
Pre-calculated that as $18,475.

00:03:36.537 --> 00:03:38.342
Oh, I don't want to have that.

00:03:38.342 --> 00:03:41.300
Let me delete one of these plus signs.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.622
Then, finally, finally,

00:03:43.622 --> 00:03:45.629
we fall into this bracket right over here.

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.737
It's going to be taxed at 20%.

00:03:47.737 --> 00:03:51.880
The increment above 146,400,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.135
the increment above that

00:03:53.135 --> 00:03:54.959
is going to be taxed at 28%,

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.401
so it's 28% x 200,000.

00:03:58.401 --> 00:04:05.879
200, 1, 2, 3, - 146,400,

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:13.141
and we get combined taxes of 43,456.

00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:17.070
43,456.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.608
Now, what immediately jumps out at you?

00:04:19.608 --> 00:04:22.406
Well, first, these are
not the same number.

00:04:22.406 --> 00:04:24.206
In particular, when they're married,

00:04:24.206 --> 00:04:26.583
they pay higher taxes,

00:04:26.583 --> 00:04:29.489
so this couple, that they
have fairly high income,

00:04:29.489 --> 00:04:31.002
and they both make the same amount,

00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:32.826
they would have actually paid fewer taxes

00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:34.337
if they never got married,

00:04:34.337 --> 00:04:36.168
and if they just filed as individuals.

00:04:36.168 --> 00:04:37.207
Now, when they're married,

00:04:37.207 --> 00:04:38.607
they're paying more taxes,

00:04:38.607 --> 00:04:40.841
and the main idea is, they
fall into this bracket,

00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:42.607
and this bracket came faster

00:04:42.607 --> 00:04:44.681
than twice the rate at
which this bracket came,

00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:46.739
when they were just filing individually,

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:49.207
and so they fell into
the 28% bracket faster,

00:04:49.207 --> 00:04:52.446
so they had to pay 28% on
more of their combined income;

00:04:52.446 --> 00:04:54.805
they ended up having a bigger tax bill.

00:04:54.805 --> 00:04:56.947
When people talk about
the marriage penalty,

00:04:56.947 --> 00:04:58.409
this is what they're talking about.

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:00.200
These people are essentially paying a tax

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.945
because they got married.

00:05:01.945 --> 00:05:07.522
This is the marriage penalty.

00:05:07.522 --> 00:05:10.200
Now, let's explore if there's
always a marriage penalty.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.369
If there's always a case,

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:12.474
that if by getting married,

00:05:12.474 --> 00:05:14.775
you're going to pay more by income taxes.

00:05:14.775 --> 00:05:17.692
Here we have Couple B, and
they have less equal income.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:21.136
They still have a combined
income of $200,000,

00:05:21.136 --> 00:05:25.204
so if you look at the
married filing jointly,

00:05:25.204 --> 00:05:28.536
they're still going to pay 43,456

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:30.110
when they file jointly,

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.472
but let's see how much they would pay

00:05:31.472 --> 00:05:33.201
if they were individuals;

00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:34.394
if they never got married,

00:05:34.394 --> 00:05:37.139
and we combine how much
they would have had to pay.

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.113
Let's get the calculator back out.

00:05:39.113 --> 00:05:40.609
First we're going to think about

00:05:40.609 --> 00:05:42.704
the first member of the couple,

00:05:42.704 --> 00:05:45.474
who makes 180,000 in taxable income.

00:05:45.474 --> 00:05:46.806
They're going to pay 10%

00:05:46.806 --> 00:05:51.695
on the first 8,925, so that's 893,

00:05:51.695 --> 00:05:54.334
and then we can add that to 4,099;

00:05:54.334 --> 00:05:55.467
we've done this already.

00:05:55.467 --> 00:05:56.936
4,099.

00:05:56.936 --> 00:05:59.618
To that we could add 12,900.

00:05:59.618 --> 00:06:02.407
12,900.

00:06:02.407 --> 00:06:03.678
And then, to that,

00:06:03.678 --> 00:06:09.806
we're going to add 28% of
the increment above ...

00:06:09.806 --> 00:06:13.669
so he makes or she makes 180,000.

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:20.208
180, 1, 2, 3, - 87,850.

00:06:20.208 --> 00:06:23.876
87,850.

00:06:23.876 --> 00:06:26.540
So that's the increment above 87,850,

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.407
and we get this spouse,

00:06:28.407 --> 00:06:29.918
this member of the couple,

00:06:29.918 --> 00:06:34.733
is going to pay 43,694.

00:06:34.733 --> 00:06:36.554
Now, to that we're going to have to add

00:06:36.554 --> 00:06:39.281
the amount that the other
member that might pay.

00:06:39.281 --> 00:06:43.921
He is going to pay 893 on the first 8,925,

00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:48.936
so it's going to be 893 plus the 15%

00:06:48.936 --> 00:06:52.094
of the increment above 8,925.

00:06:52.094 --> 00:07:06.334
So, + .15 x 20,000; 1, 2, 3, - 8,925,

00:07:06.334 --> 00:07:09.343
gets us to, this member of the couple

00:07:09.343 --> 00:07:14.138
is going to pay, let's
see, 2,554 in taxes.

00:07:14.138 --> 00:07:16.146
If we add it to the other
member of the couple,

00:07:16.146 --> 00:07:21.010
so we add that answer + 43,694,

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.177
that's what the larger earner

00:07:22.177 --> 00:07:24.271
is going to have to pay in taxes,

00:07:24.271 --> 00:07:28.096
we get 46,248; we'll just round to that.

00:07:28.096 --> 00:07:33.093
46,248.

00:07:33.093 --> 00:07:34.937
So here, all of a
sudden, we see a scenario

00:07:34.937 --> 00:07:36.169
where the opposite thing;

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:38.937
the higher value is if
they don't get married.

00:07:38.937 --> 00:07:43.208
In this situation, they
actually got a marriage benefit.

00:07:43.208 --> 00:07:47.602
They got a marriage benefit.

00:07:47.602 --> 00:07:49.873
Now, why did this happen?

00:07:49.873 --> 00:07:51.272
The thing that might
have jumped out to you,

00:07:51.272 --> 00:07:53.337
both of these people had high incomes,

00:07:53.337 --> 00:07:55.069
and they had very equal incomes,

00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:56.143
while both of these people,

00:07:56.143 --> 00:07:57.883
their combined income was the same,

00:07:57.883 --> 00:07:59.561
but there was less equal,

00:07:59.561 --> 00:08:01.091
and so essentially what happened here,

00:08:01.091 --> 00:08:03.013
this person filed by themselves;

00:08:03.013 --> 00:08:04.538
on the individual tax bracket,

00:08:04.538 --> 00:08:08.752
they go up the brackets very,
very, very, very quickly,

00:08:08.752 --> 00:08:09.884
and then this person,

00:08:09.884 --> 00:08:14.274
well, they're not paying much in taxes,

00:08:14.274 --> 00:08:16.226
but this person is paying the bulk of it.

00:08:16.226 --> 00:08:19.799
By becoming a couple, by getting married,

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:21.469
as a combined entity,

00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:23.409
and pretty much this is
the main beneficiary,

00:08:23.409 --> 00:08:25.347
that 180,000 in taxable income,

00:08:25.347 --> 00:08:26.971
that's most of the 200,000,

00:08:26.971 --> 00:08:29.800
they're able to move up the
tax brackets a lot slower,

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.550
so they're getting taxed at 28%

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.467
on a much smaller
fraction of their income.

00:08:34.467 --> 00:08:35.801
They're getting taxed at 25%

00:08:35.801 --> 00:08:37.468
on a much smaller
fraction of their income.

00:08:37.468 --> 00:08:38.936
They're getting taxed at 10%

00:08:38.936 --> 00:08:40.739
on a larger fraction of the income

00:08:40.739 --> 00:08:43.536
than when, especially this
individual right over here,

00:08:43.536 --> 00:08:45.630
filed as an individual.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.378
In general, if you have a couple

00:08:47.378 --> 00:08:49.800
with very high taxable income,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.141
and they both make roughly equal,

00:08:52.141 --> 00:08:54.878
they both have very high
taxable incomes as individuals,

00:08:54.878 --> 00:08:58.044
they are likely to see a marriage penalty,

00:08:58.044 --> 00:08:59.467
like we saw in scenario 1.

00:08:59.467 --> 00:09:01.043
If you have a couple where their salaries

00:09:01.043 --> 00:09:03.204
are very unequal, even if
their combined salaries

00:09:03.204 --> 00:09:06.141
are quite high, you actually
might get a marriage benefit,

00:09:06.141 --> 00:09:09.467
because they move through
the tax brackets faster.

00:09:09.467 --> 00:09:10.739
Now let's think about Couple C,

00:09:10.739 --> 00:09:12.137
and I'll let you think
about it a little bit.

00:09:12.137 --> 00:09:15.670
You have equal taxable incomes here,

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.803
so it's like Couple A,

00:09:17.803 --> 00:09:20.301
but their total taxable income isn't high.

00:09:20.301 --> 00:09:24.677
In fact, if you look at
the married filing jointly,

00:09:24.677 --> 00:09:27.563
they fall under this tax
bracket right over here.

00:09:27.563 --> 00:09:29.221
And, notice, up to this point,

00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:31.799
all the tax brackets are exactly double

00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:33.543
the individual tax bracket,

00:09:33.543 --> 00:09:35.416
so it goes exactly twice as slow.

00:09:35.416 --> 00:09:36.627
I guess you could think about it as

00:09:36.627 --> 00:09:38.009
a fraction of income,

00:09:38.009 --> 00:09:39.678
when you have 2 people making the same,

00:09:39.678 --> 00:09:41.137
you're having the same fraction taxed

00:09:41.137 --> 00:09:44.073
at 20% or at 15% or at 25%.

00:09:44.073 --> 00:09:45.536
I encourage you to do the math here.

00:09:45.536 --> 00:09:46.871
It's just good practice,

00:09:46.871 --> 00:09:47.624
but what you're going to see,

00:09:47.624 --> 00:09:50.058
is these people are going
to pay the same taxes.

00:09:50.058 --> 00:09:52.120
This is going to be the same

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.945
whether or not they are
married or not married,

00:09:54.945 --> 00:09:56.855
because they're not making
enough combined income

00:09:56.855 --> 00:09:58.369
to get the penalty, where the brackets

00:09:58.369 --> 00:10:01.051
start accelerating a little bit faster.

00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:03.700
Anyway, hopefully that
clarifies things a little bit.
