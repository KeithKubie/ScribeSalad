00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.760
Just like there are different
ways to express multiplication,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.300
there are also different
ways to express division.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.510
You may have used this
division sign before.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:17.230
We can also denote division with this
box, or by using a slash like this

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.620
You should note that the quotient is
what we call the result of division.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.760
So which of these does not mean
the same thing as the others?

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.390
Please pick one.
