00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:01.779
- [Voiceover] Many economists believe

00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:03.203
that since resources are scarce

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:06.259
and since human desires
cannot all be blank,

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.592
a method of blank is needed.

00:00:10.592 --> 00:00:11.822
So, let's see.

00:00:11.822 --> 00:00:12.999
So let's look at the first choice.

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.619
Many economists believe that
since resources are scarce.

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.479
So there's only so many resources.

00:00:17.479 --> 00:00:19.665
We don't have an infinite
amount of resources.

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:23.766
And since human desires
cannot all be indulged,

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:27.534
a method of apportionment is needed.

00:00:27.534 --> 00:00:29.380
That actually feels pretty good.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.163
To indulge means to kind of allow yourself

00:00:33.163 --> 00:00:34.688
or allow someone else
to have the pleasure,

00:00:34.688 --> 00:00:36.946
any pleasure that they want.

00:00:36.946 --> 00:00:40.919
And so, you can't indulge
all human desires.

00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:43.339
That means allowing everyone
to do anything they want,

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:45.202
use as many resources as they want.

00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:47.999
We cannot do that, because
we have scarce resources.

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.151
So indulge is feeling pretty good.

00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:52.259
A method of apportionment is needed.

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:53.791
Well that also makes sense.

00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:56.239
You can't indulge everybody.

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.300
You only have so many resources.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.920
So we need some way to
split those resources,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.260
to apportion those
resources amongst people,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.639
and so this one actually feels,

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:09.253
this one is feeling pretty good,

00:01:09.253 --> 00:01:12.856
but let's just verify,
I just used this word,

00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:16.239
that these other choices right
over here aren't as good.

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:17.981
So since many economists believe

00:01:17.981 --> 00:01:19.479
that since resources are scarce

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.603
and since human desires
cannot all be verified.

00:01:23.603 --> 00:01:25.379
So verified means validating,

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:29.265
proving that someone has some desire,

00:01:29.265 --> 00:01:30.639
so that's already feeling weird.

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:32.703
A method of distribution is needed.

00:01:32.703 --> 00:01:35.618
So distribution isn't
bad for the second one,

00:01:35.618 --> 00:01:37.679
but verifying human desires.

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.368
This one feels a little bit off.

00:01:39.368 --> 00:01:42.669
And remember, we always want
to pick the best choice.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:45.199
And so, A is definitely
a much better choice.

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:46.950
We're not talking about verifying,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.840
making sure that we know
the actual human desires

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.710
and then distributing based on it.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.710
I would rule this one right over here,

00:01:59.756 --> 00:02:03.379
this one right over
here seems a little off.

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:07.231
Since human desires cannot all be usurped.

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:10.793
That means you're kind of ignoring them

00:02:10.793 --> 00:02:14.498
and removing them and putting in place

00:02:14.498 --> 00:02:16.658
different desires somehow.

00:02:16.658 --> 00:02:18.335
A method of expropriation.

00:02:18.335 --> 00:02:21.144
So that's kind of taking from someone.

00:02:21.144 --> 00:02:23.988
A method of kind of
expropriation is needed.

00:02:23.988 --> 00:02:25.334
So once again, we're not talking about

00:02:25.334 --> 00:02:28.679
trying to usurp folks' desires

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:31.760
nor kind of a method of
taking things from folks.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.535
So once again, this
one feels very strange.

00:02:34.535 --> 00:02:36.718
And since human desires
cannot all be expressed,

00:02:36.718 --> 00:02:38.650
a method of reparation is needed.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.258
So it is true, not all human
desires can be expressed,

00:02:43.258 --> 00:02:45.398
but that doesn't seem
to be a counterbalance

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:48.398
to the whole notion of
resources being scarce.

00:02:48.398 --> 00:02:50.017
So this one already feels weird.

00:02:50.017 --> 00:02:51.879
And a method of reparation.

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.156
Reparations are essentially
a payment to someone

00:02:56.156 --> 00:02:58.292
because of injustices
that you've done to them.

00:02:58.292 --> 00:02:59.820
And so, we're not really talking about

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.048
justice and injustice right over here.

00:03:01.048 --> 00:03:03.069
So once again, this also feels weird

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.760
and nowhere near as good as choice A.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.761
Since human desires
cannot all be anticipated,

00:03:07.761 --> 00:03:11.106
that's true, a method of advertising.

00:03:11.106 --> 00:03:13.000
So advertising, once again
we're not talking about

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.987
how do we communicate with people,

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:17.296
what they may or may not want,

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:19.808
or how do we convince people
what they may or may not want.

00:03:19.808 --> 00:03:22.200
We're going against the idea of

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.020
hey, we only have so many resources,

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.313
and we can't give everything to everyone,

00:03:26.313 --> 00:03:29.196
so we need some way of divvying
up those scarce resources.

00:03:29.196 --> 00:03:30.401
So once again, the advertising

00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:33.841
really seems a little bit off.
