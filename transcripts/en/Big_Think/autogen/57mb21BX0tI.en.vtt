he'd been taking note of the work that
 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.729
he'd been taking note of the work that
had been going on at NASA Ames and their

interest in searching for
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.690
interest in searching for
extraterrestrial intelligence and the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700
extraterrestrial intelligence and the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.209
early papers that suggested that radio
telescopes were good tools and he said

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219
telescopes were good tools and he said
 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.959
telescopes were good tools and he said
oh gee UC Berkeley has a radio telescope

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969
oh gee UC Berkeley has a radio telescope
 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.319
oh gee UC Berkeley has a radio telescope
and he understood enough physics to know

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
and he understood enough physics to know
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.600
and he understood enough physics to know
that it's possible to take some of the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610
that it's possible to take some of the
 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.930
that it's possible to take some of the
signal from a radio telescope and

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940
signal from a radio telescope and
 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.340
signal from a radio telescope and
amplify it and do different things with

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
amplify it and do different things with
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.609
amplify it and do different things with
it and you don't hurt the primary

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619
it and you don't hurt the primary
 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.700

observer so he thought well we can just

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710
observer so he thought well we can just
 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.920
observer so he thought well we can just
steal a little of the signal and and we

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
steal a little of the signal and and we
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.170
steal a little of the signal and and we
can look for engineered signals rather

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180
can look for engineered signals rather

guns and things and I thought that was
 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.559
guns and things and I thought that was
spectacular and I suspect that had a lot

years from now it's pretty darn near
impossible in fact there are probably

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449
impossible in fact there are probably
 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.750
impossible in fact there are probably
technologies that we haven't yet

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760
technologies that we haven't yet
 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.990
technologies that we haven't yet
invented which actually might make a lot

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000
invented which actually might make a lot
 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.779
invented which actually might make a lot
of sense for interstellar communication

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789
of sense for interstellar communication
 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.350
of sense for interstellar communication
and so I guess the best plan there is to

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360
and so I guess the best plan there is to
 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.110
and so I guess the best plan there is to
to stick around long enough so that we

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120
to stick around long enough so that we
 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.020
to stick around long enough so that we
get smart enough to invent that and then

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030
get smart enough to invent that and then
 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.520
get smart enough to invent that and then
start using it in our SETI searches

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530
start using it in our SETI searches
 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.760
start using it in our SETI searches
along with keeping the radio and the

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770
along with keeping the radio and the
 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.529
along with keeping the radio and the
optical going because they're not bad

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539
optical going because they're not bad
 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.289
optical going because they're not bad
ideas either
