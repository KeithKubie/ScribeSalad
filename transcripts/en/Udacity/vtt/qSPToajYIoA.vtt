00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And in fact, this general notion is one of the greater glories

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
of context-free grammars.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The grammar is finite.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We can write it down.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But for a non-trivial grammar, the number of possible utterances is infinite.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Just by following simple replacement rules,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I can make bigger and bigger utterances until I get tired and eventually pick terminals.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And in fact, a number of academics, including Chomsky,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
argued that this is one of the ways or one of the reasons

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that our finite human brains--I myself am a bear of very little brain--

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
can produce an infinite number of potential creative ideas.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
A finite amount of matter can produce an infinite number of utterances.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That's a relatively heady notion, so I'm going to skip past it for now.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And it turns out that we're going to be able to see this same sort of infinity

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
of possible utterances in computer languages like Python or JavaScript.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Wow, my infinity symbol needs work.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This gets a label because otherwise you might not be able to tell.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In both of these languages, you can write down arithmetic expressions.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You can imagine them being generated from an arithmetic expression grammar like this.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Exp is just an abbreviation for expression.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And in fact, were your student senses tingling?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's time for a quiz on this.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Given this arithmetic grammar,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
check all of these utterances that are valid exp's, that are valid expressions.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Starting from expression, which of these 5 options can I generate?

00:01:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Check all that apply.
