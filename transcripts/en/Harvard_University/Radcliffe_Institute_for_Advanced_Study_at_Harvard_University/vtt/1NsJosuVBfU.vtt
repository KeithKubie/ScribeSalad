00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.510
-Good morning, everyone.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.180
We're going to start this
morning with a blessing

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.700
by Jonathan Perry.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:43.690
-[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.080
Creator, we want to say thank
you for the great minds that

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.410
have gathered here today
to share their knowledge

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.110
and to help bring indigenous
issues and indigenous

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.160
people to the forefront and
to a great future for all

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.830
of our people, for opportunities
for sharing and opening

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.900
our hearts and our minds, for
understanding and awareness

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.790
and respect.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.810
We want to say thank you
to all of the families

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.830
and all of the
people who sacrificed

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.600
for us to be here today.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.560
We want to say thank
you to our ancestors,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.360
thank you to all the beings
that have helped us to achieve

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.490
our goals, who sustain us,
nourish us, protect us,

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.390
teach us, and care for
us every single day.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.650
We want to send our
blessings and prayers out

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.780
to those who are
sick and who need

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.040
our prayers or our
thoughts or our well

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.710
wishes at this time, all
of those that were not

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.170
able to attend this gathering or
were not able to travel with us

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.530
or are not able to be
here in some fashion.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.450
I'd like to offer an
honor song for all of you

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.650
and all of your
families at this time.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:05:22.970
[NATIVE AMERICAN SINGING]

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.210
I want to say thank you for
coming to our territory.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.030
Thank you for joining
us in what is considered

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.900
to be Wampanoag Nipmuc
Massachusetts territory,

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.610
this area.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.600
This was, of course,
a thoroughfare

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.830
for all of our people
both by the sea and land.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.110
And we have over
12,000 years, anyway,

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.660
scientifically
proven success here.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.590
So we hope to revisit those
many, many years of success.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.930
And I think we'll do well.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.810
I just want to do
one more quick song,

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.540
and I'd like to ask all
of you to help me with it.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.180
This is very specifically
a Wampanoag song.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.880
And normally we
would join hands,

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.250
one hand to the back of the
shoulder on the heart side

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.510
all the way around.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.750
But if you can, if
you can't, you can't.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.570
That's fine.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.170
But I need some
help singing this.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.820
It's very easy.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.280
So just join in as you can.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:07:29.300
[NATIVE AMERICAN SINGING]

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.160
-Thank you so much, Jonathan.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.650
That was a very beautiful
way to start today

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.230
on a very beautiful spring day.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.940
So good morning.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.450
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.870
I'm Dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study,

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.720
and I'm delighted to welcome
you to today's conference,

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.710
Native Peoples, Native Politics.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.150
We are very proud to
co-sponsor this conference

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.670
with the Harvard University
Native American Program, or at

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:59.220
is as it is commonly known
in these parts, HUNAP.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.960
I want to thank Jonathan Perry
for his wonderful opening

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.920
blessing in tribute to
the people who walked

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.880
this ground long before us.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.930
I'd also like to thank
Shelly Lowe, the Executive

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.370
Director of HUNAP, Dan
Carpenter, the Faculty

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:19.380
Director of the Social Sciences
program here at Radcliffe,

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.730
and Maggie McKinley, Climenko
Fellow at the Harvard Law

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.980
School, for their leadership
in planning today's conference.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.760
As Harvard's Institute
for Advanced Study,

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.970
Radcliffe fosters
interdisciplinary inquiry

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.510
into important and
multifaceted subjects.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.640
We bring leading
thinkers together

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.070
to investigate new
questions, and we

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.280
are committed to sharing
that emerging knowledge

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.150
with the broader community
through public events

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.520
like this one today
and many others.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.850
Coming up on Tuesday,
May 10, we will

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.570
launch the Kim and Judy
Davis Lecture Series here

00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.110
in the Knafel Center.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.400
Professor Diana Mutz of the
University of Pennsylvania

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.800
will deliver the
inaugural Davis Lecture

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.450
about public opinion
toward globalization.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.740
And you have a card to
remind you on your seat.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.130
Mutz's talk will
take a sharp look

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.510
at the free trade controversy.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.170
Her topic could
not be more timely

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.410
as we watch
presidential candidates

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.780
in both political
parties grapple

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.100
with this volatile
issue and assess

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.150
its impact on the lives
of American producers

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.450
and consumers.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:33.370
So I hope to see you
here with us on May 10.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.590
We conclude our
academic programming

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.390
for the year with
Radcliffe Day on May 27,

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.580
when we bestow the Radcliffe
Medal on Janet Yellen, Chair

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.430
of the Federal Reserve.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.980
We will celebrate Yellen's
ideals and intellect

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.310
with a morning panel
that's entitled

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:55.820
Building an Economy for
Prosperity and Equality.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.770
A lunchtime program will feature
personal remarks about Yellen

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.750
by former Fed
Chair Ben Bernanke,

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.620
followed by a conversation
between Harvard

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.640
Professor of Economics Greg
Makiw and Yellen herself.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.890
So even if you can't
join us in person,

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:15.760
you can tune in to the live
stream of the whole day

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.090
on our website on May 27,
or you can watch it later

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.420
when it is posted as a
video on our website.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.730
At Radcliffe we also
help focus attention

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.700
on important topics
of broad interest

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.370
that cross many Harvard schools,
fields, and disciplines.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.840
This year, in
partnership with HUNAP,

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.460
we have hosted a
rich set of programs

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.540
centered on native and
indigenous peoples.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.900
Let me give you just
a few examples of what

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.350
our thematic year has produced.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.150
Fellows in our
fellowship program

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.530
have worked on projects related
to Native American history,

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.280
rights, and culture.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.130
The Schlesinger Library
hosted an edit-a-thon

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.270
to improve and increase
Wikipedia entries

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.710
on native an indigenous women.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:05.530
A poet and a playwright
gave public performances.

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.730
And an exhibition of the
photographs of Matika Wilbur

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.370
is currently on display in
the Johnson-Kulukundis Family

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.950
Gallery in Byerly Hall,
which is just two doors down.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.390
It will remain up
until May 28, so please

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:22.860
be sure to visit this wonderful
exhibition during the break

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.476
today at lunch, or in
the short periods we have

00:11:25.476 --> 00:11:26.850
in the morning
and the afternoon,

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.160
or sometime in the next month.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.650
This stimulating and
varied body of work

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.010
related to native and
indigenous peoples

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.870
has benefited the entire
Harvard community.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.050
Next year some of
our programming

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.140
will address another
theme, this time the issue

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.870
of urbanism, historically,
humanistically,

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.010
and as a worldwide phenomenon.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.920
For the following
two years we will

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.550
investigate many different
aspects of citizenship.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.890
The timing will correspond with
one significant anniversary,

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:01.250
the 150th anniversary of
the 14th Amendment, which

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.140
extended citizenship
to African Americans.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.290
And that comes in 2018.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.780
And we will anticipate a
second major milestone,

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.990
the 100th anniversary of the
19th Amendment giving women

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.450
the right to vote.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.980
And that would be 2020.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.160
The Native and Indigenous
Peoples Initiative

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.110
has enjoyed robust support
from Provost Alan Garber

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.470
and has been nurtured by many
Radcliffe staff, especially

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:30.050
Rebecca Wasserman
and her team, as well

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.490
as faculty,
departments, and centers

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.030
all across the university.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.650
Today's conference is
a fitting culmination

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.470
to those collaborative efforts.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:44.100
A quick glance at the
speakers on today's program

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.810
demonstrates the breadth
of partnerships that have

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.770
made this conference possible.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:52.740
Before today is out we will
hear from lawyers, community

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.910
leaders, artists, policymakers,
anthropologists, activists,

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:03.310
the 67th president of the
Seneca Nation, and even a CEO.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.490
This conference has brought
together an even broader range

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.180
of people in today's audience.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.270
That's you.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.900
You are sitting among painters
and public health advocates,

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:17.470
consultants and clergy members,
teachers and tribal members.

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.180
You have come from
all over New England

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:24.840
and as far afield as Quebec,
North Dakota, and Arizona,

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.690
as well as from
Harvard's many schools.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.770
Today's program will bring
together even more people

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:31.800
virtually.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.090
Students in the
state of Washington

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:38.020
and a member of Ontario's
Ministry of Aboriginals

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.990
Affairs, among many
others, have written to us

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:45.350
to say that they plan to tune in
to the simulcast online today.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.470
And I'm sure that
many more viewers

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:51.100
will watch the video on our
website in the months and years

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.700
ahead.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.890
It is fitting that today's
conference on native peoples

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.370
and politics has gathered
so many different people

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.810
in conversation
with one another,

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.300
because the practice
of politics inevitably

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.820
brings vastly
different individuals

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.370
and groups with
multiple priorities

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:14.110
and conflicting agendas
into common conversation,

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.430
and sometimes combat.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:20.110
Given where we are in this
year's election cycle,

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.350
it can seem like
politics consists solely

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:27.400
of delegate counts and
convention countdowns.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.820
But if we reduce
politics to nothing

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.750
more than election
hoopla, we oversimplify

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.890
what it really means.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.400
In fact, the equation
of politics with voting

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:42.080
is a fairly recent phenomenon.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.040
For much of human
existence, voting

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.660
as we understand it today
in our democratic society

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.340
has not existed.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.580
Even when it has,
participation has usually

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.410
been restricted to a very
small minority of the world's

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.740
total population.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.850
In reality, the definition of
politics changes over time,

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.830
and it is shaped in unique
ways by different societies

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.640
and different cultures.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.210
People have acted
politically across the globe

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.610
and throughout human
history, but they

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:20.580
have done so in many other
ways than casting ballots.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.220
I'm an historian of the
20th century United States.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.220
In the time and
place that I study,

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.500
universal suffrage was
officially the law of the land.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.830
But in my research
over the years,

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:37.670
I have found that voting
was not the only or even

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:42.360
the most common way that
Americans acted politically.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.240
Let me remind you of just
a handful of other ways

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.650
that ordinary people
advocated for their rights

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:53.690
and for the kind of just
society that they desired.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.440
In the 1930s, working
class Americans

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.370
organized into
industrial labor unions

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:03.650
to demand a larger share of the
wealth their labor had helped

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.900
to create, to influence
their working conditions,

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.770
and to exert more control
over how they allocated time

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.560
in their own lives.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.640
From the 1940s
through the 1960s,

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.350
household members and
homemakers took to the streets

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.040
to assert their
power as consumers,

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.820
participating in
boycotts and petitioning

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.390
against high
prices, and lobbying

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:31.300
for greater protections
against unsafe and exploitative

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.690
products.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:36.720
In the 1950s and 1960s,
African Americans

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.920
mobilized with strategies
ranging from restaurants

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.480
sit-ins to protest marches
to demand their equal rights

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.570
as citizens, creating a
civil rights movement that

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:50.950
would inspire similar claims by
the American Indian movement,

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.030
feminists, and gay
rights activists.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.160
Beginning in the 1970s,
political activists

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.860
on the conservative
right from anti-taxers

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.950
to anti-abortion demonstrators,
undertook similar actions

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.339
to promote their causes.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:09.740
In all of these cases
and more, Americans

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.890
were acting politically.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:15.980
In sum, today's conference is
part of a broader conception

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:19.200
of political participation
that goes beyond what

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.859
happens in the voting booth.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:24.369
As we dig deeply into
the multiple ways

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.550
that Native Americans
have registered

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.160
their political
will, we will also

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.580
be probing the very
wide range of voices

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.120
speaking within those
native communities.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.800
We will surely see that there
is not one conversation nor one

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.940
uniform point of view.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.870
I personally look forward to
a day of learning and gaining

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.230
new insight and inspiration.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.890
So let me tell you a little
bit about how today will work.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.930
This morning we
will have two panels

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.970
before we break for lunch.

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:59.010
After lunch there'll be a
keynote address and then

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.560
a final panel.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.550
Each panel will conclude with
a question and answer session.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.550
If you would like
to ask a question,

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.990
please step into
the center aisle,

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.370
where we will have
set up a microphone,

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.580
and when you come
to the mic, we ask

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.010
that you identify yourself
and state your question.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.680
And finally, I hope
you will join us

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.220
at a concluding reception which
will be held in Fay House right

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:26.440
next door, where we can
continue our conversations.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.110
Now I'd like to hand things
over to Professor Dan Carpenter.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.810
Dan is the Director of the
Social Sciences Program

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:36.440
here at the Radcliffe Institute,
the Allie S. Freed Professor

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.480
of Government at
Harvard University,

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.540
and a member of the Provost
Advisory Council on Native

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.430
and Indigenous Issues.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.990
He is a political
scientist who specializes

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.740
in public bureaucracies and
governmental regulation.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:54.290
He also studies diverse ways in
which individuals participate

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:58.430
politically, what he calls
the performance of politics.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.890
Dan's research has
focused most intensively

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.950
on petitioning among
groups often marginalized

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.650
and disenfranchised throughout
much of American history,

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:11.170
such as African Americans,
women, and Native Americans.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.440
So please join me
in thanking Dan

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.570
for his hard work organizing
today's conference,

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:18.770
and help me welcome
him to the podium.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.570
Dan.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:25.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.830
-Thank you very much, LIZ.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:34.670
I want to begin following
Jonathan Perry by acknowledging

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.820
the Wampanoag Nipmuc
Massachusetts peoples on whose

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.080
lands we gather today.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:46.040
Today's conference is both a
culmination and a beginning.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.310
Let me start with
the culmination part,

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.680
keeping in mind
tomorrow's HUNAP pow wow

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.900
will continue this
important celebration.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.260
Three years ago
Radcliffe began thinking

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.470
about appropriate themes
for the set of events

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.400
that would occur over
a one to one and 1/2

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:06.300
year period that coincides
with today's conference.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.040
And Radcliffe has embarked upon
this series of conversations

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.310
and events, the
indigenous peoples theme,

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:15.180
not because the Institute
has a particular expertise

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:19.570
in this area, but because
Radcliffe, and Harvard more

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:23.960
generally, have clear needs
and obligations to enrich

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.980
our dialogue on native issues.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:30.310
A university is a
conversation of a sort,

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.550
a highly bureaucratized
conversation,

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:36.860
to be sure, but a vital
dialogue nonetheless.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.600
And it is vital to
the future of Harvard,

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.830
and in deep consistency
with Harvard's native past,

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:46.240
that the voice of Native
American and indigenous peoples

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.120
be amplified and strengthened.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.680
And it is with thanks to HUNAP
and associated Native Studies

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.720
leaders at Harvard at this
process has been renewing.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.700
And we at Radcliffe are
pleased and honored to play

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.980
a collaborative part in
this larger and much longer

00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.010
term dialogue.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:09.080
We started in the fall of 2014
with Anishinabe poet Gerald

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.580
Vizenor, who gave
a poetry reading

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.400
and gave thoughtful remarks
on the meaning and intention

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.230
of his concept of survivance.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:22.190
Professor Angela Riley of
UCLA and a Chief Justice

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:24.170
of the Supreme Court of
the Citizen Potawatomi

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.890
Nation of Oklahoma,
visited Harvard Law School

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:30.320
to give a lecture on
indigeneity and law.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:36.150
Professor Ned Blackhawk of
Yale came in November, 2014

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:37.970
and gave reflections
on the Sand Creek

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:42.350
Massacre and its many cultural
and historical legacies.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.740
This academic year we've
been privileged to be joined

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.010
by two Native American
Radcliffe Fellows, Kristiana

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.816
Kahakauwila, and Alyssa Mt.

00:21:49.816 --> 00:21:51.380
Pleasant.

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.410
Professor Kahakauwila just
this Wednesday afternoon

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:58.304
gave a wonderful reading from
her novel To Weave with Water.

00:21:58.304 --> 00:21:58.845
Professor Mt.

00:21:58.845 --> 00:22:01.303
Pleasant has been working on
her study of the Buffalo Creek

00:22:01.303 --> 00:22:05.200
reservation and gave an
inspiring lecture in the fall.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.280
Alyssa and Tiana
have both honored

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.020
and enriched us with their
daily presence, their meetings

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.430
with students,
staff, and faculty,

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.080
and other Radcliffe Fellows.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.100
A third fellow, Carol
Armitage, has also

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.010
been exploring themes
and indigeneity

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.660
in her choreographic work,
and we thank all of them

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:24.710
for their citizenship.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.070
In January we held a workshop
on the university and indigenous

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.280
dispossession, where we learned
what other universities have

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.320
been doing to confront
their own relationship

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.640
to indigenous peoples, and
we learned of rich models

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.090
for Harvard to emulate.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.810
And I'm proud to announce
that the Radcliffe Institute,

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:44.650
in collaboration with HUNAP,
the Harvard University Native

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.775
American Program, and the
Yale Indian Papers Project,

00:22:47.775 --> 00:22:49.400
and supported by the
Mashpee Wampanoag,

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.550
the Nipmuc, the Wampanoag
tribe of Gay Head Aquinna,

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:57.150
and the Mohegan Tribe,
has received a $275,000

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.830
grant from the Council on
Library and Information

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:04.040
Resources, CLIR, to digitize
more than 4,000 petitions by

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.855
and concerning Native Americans
in the Massachusetts archives

00:23:07.855 --> 00:23:09.620
of the Commonwealth.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.225
Collaborative meetings
with tribes for this work

00:23:12.225 --> 00:23:16.050
are underway this spring, and
digitization will begin soon.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.580
And of course, just
last night Matika Wilbur

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.160
offered a beautiful
presentation,

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.200
opening up her photographic
exhibition, Seeds of Culture:

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.860
The Portraits and Stories
of Native American Women.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.880
What unites so many
of these events

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.640
forms the theme and title
of today's conference,

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.630
Native Peoples, Native Politics.

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:39.740
In the face of
massive dispossession,

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.920
structural racism, how
have native peoples

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.540
performed what Gerald
Vizenor calls survivance?

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:50.340
How have they done
political work in doing so?

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:54.490
How have they endeavored to
tell alternative stories?

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:58.760
How have they drawn upon law,
treaties, and other resources?

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.550
How have they formed
alliances and coalitions

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:04.070
to defend their
sovereignty and dignity

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:07.080
in the face of
institutionalized erosion,

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.900
in the face of
organized assault?

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.110
In talking with Native
American leaders and citizens

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.240
we learn that so much of native
politics and empowerment,

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.040
as Liz Cohen just remarked,
occurs outside the ballot

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.780
box, which is not at all to
say that voting rights are

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.410
unimportant.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.570
Quite the opposite is
they are under attack

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:27.450
throughout the land,
including in Indian country.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.780
But it is to say that
Native Americans have often

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.440
been denied voting rights,
and where they have had them,

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.150
they have often composed
a numerical minority

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:36.950
of the electorate.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:40.400
Tools of law, treaty
making and monitoring,

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.370
retelling and reframing
stories, building alliances

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:47.500
and coalitions, resisting,
blogging, protesting, making

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.780
art and politics, and
yes, voting, all of these

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:55.550
are political and cultural
acts, not just political acts.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.360
But we should never forget the
deeply political dimensions

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.100
of these acts.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.980
And what you will hear
today are four panels

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:05.440
and a keynote address, five
successive conversations,

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.800
if you will, on what
native politics means,

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.490
how it is taking shape, and
how native authors, artists,

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:15.660
filmmakers, actors,
scholars, and others view

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.860
the political and empowerment
dimensions of their work.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.010
On to beginnings.

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:25.970
As we look forward
to Harvard's future

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:29.230
and to Radcliffe's,
it is vital to ensure

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:32.120
that our discussions
include and incorporate

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.610
native and indigenous
perspectives in the themes

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.190
we address, including in
citizenship and urbanism,

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.360
in the years to come,
and that, again, we

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.750
continue to amplify native
presences and native voices

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.270
on Harvard's campus.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:48.200
But let me pause with
a sobering statistic.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.980
Just two weeks ago,
Harvard's Office

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.410
for the Vice Provost of Faculty
Development and Diversity

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.680
released its report
entitled Ten-Year Trends

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.700
in Ladder Faculty.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.610
And in that report, the
office remarks that, quote,

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:07.120
and I quote, "We still
need to make more progress,

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:10.840
as we have only 60 ladder
faculty who are black,

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.260
62 latter faculty
who are Latino,

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.930
and none who are
Native American."

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:19.780
Let me repeat that.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.420
60 African American
ladder faculty,

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:26.730
and by ladder I mean tenure
track, 62 Latino ladder

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:32.310
faculty, zero Native
American ladder faculty.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.110
And this report comes
in the same year

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.020
that Northwestern, Yale,
and other universities

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.950
are moving forward
with plans to hire

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:42.810
several native faculty
each, as well as faculty

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.420
in Native Studies departments,
which of course do not

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.920
exist here.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.870
And it comes at a time when
Harvard's peer Dartmouth, whose

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:52.340
charter dedicates it,
like Harvard's does,

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.110
to the education of
Native American youth,

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:57.590
has native faculty in
several different departments

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.360
across this college.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.020
This report comes
to us in the middle

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:05.940
of a presidential campaign,
one that Dean Cohen alluded to,

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.170
which, among other things,
has given us two competing

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:11.020
aspirations that you've
heard of recently,

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:14.740
one of making
America great again,

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.800
and another of making
America whole again.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:22.260
I'm not going to tip my hand
as to my intended voting

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.010
patterns in the
fall, but I do prefer

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:26.780
the latter of
those formulations,

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.640
making whole to making great.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.480
And just this last week
another round of reverberations

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:35.150
of those phrases, making
whole and making great,

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:39.770
has made me think, what is it
for a university to be great?

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:43.720
And what is it for a
university to be whole?

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.440
On the latter of those
questions, wholeness,

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.360
I would not presume to know
an answer to what adds up,

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.040
to what things jointly
and together suffice

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.760
to make a university whole.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.780
But I can say this.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:01.550
The richness of the dialogue
we have witnessed this year

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:05.160
between HUNAP and Radcliffe
in observing the heroic work

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.310
that Dennis Norman,
Shelly Lowe, Jason

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:11.490
Packineau, and the
whole HUNAP community

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:15.170
and Harvard's native student
community, we can say

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:19.740
that Harvard can never be whole
without its indigenous peoples,

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.710
that Harvard can never be whole
without its indigenous history

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:26.190
fully told and explored,
and that Harvard can never

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:28.750
be whole until its
indigenous family

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:32.720
is included fully on
its ladder faculty.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:42.140
Beyond this, no university
pretending to be great or whole

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.570
can claim to honor diversity
and inclusion while excluding

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:48.760
native peoples, native
peoples who are represented

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.230
in the very charter whose
accompanying funds saved

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:57.470
Harvard from insolvency in 1650,
excluding those native people

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:59.910
from its ladder faculty.

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:01.980
So before turning
to today's panel,

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:06.000
and speaking for myself
only, a white man in alliance

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.020
with my native
sisters and brothers,

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.700
let me outline a vision,
sketched in a petition,

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:15.520
if you will, to make Harvard
whole in the coming years,

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.330
that Harvard bring
Native Americans

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.890
to its tenured
faculty, including

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:22.870
but not limited to scholars of
the indigenous North American

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:27.610
experience, history, culture,
religion, spirituality,

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:32.370
society, and politics, and,
by the way, Federal Indian law

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:35.410
in the United States,
that Harvard draw

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.500
upon its rich intellectual
and material resources

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.230
to examine America's
relationship with indigenous

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:45.360
peoples and the long
history of dispossession,

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.240
forcible guardianship, removal,
and compulsory evangelization

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.840
in boarding schools,
to say nothing

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.080
of institutionalized violence.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.800
And finally, that Harvard do
for its own indigenous history

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.070
what Northwestern has
done, what Dartmouth

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:03.970
has done, what Yale and
Brown are now doing,

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:07.240
or what the University of
British Columbia has done,

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.080
namely that Harvard do for
its own indigenous history

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.420
what Harvard is doing
now, and next year,

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.480
including proudly and
appropriately, here

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.260
at Radcliffe, in its
commemoration of slavery

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.890
and its own relationship
to racial bondage,

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:21.440
to do three things.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:23.510
A, appoint a
committee to examine

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:27.220
Harvard's own relationship to
Native American dispossession,

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:31.270
B, to offer seminars and courses
in which students can join

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:33.660
with faculty in conducting
research on Harvard's

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.480
indigenous history,
painful and even

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.920
embarrassing as that
history may be, and C,

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.610
to hold a conference,
as Radcliffe,

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.400
again, will appropriately
and probably

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.310
do on slavery in the
university in March

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:50.475
of 2017, another
conference in the future

00:30:50.475 --> 00:30:54.990
on indigenous dispossession
and the university.

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:58.050
Making Harvard whole is
something happening today,

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:03.160
Friday, April 29, in native
peoples doing native politics,

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.510
and in the future by
performing native politics

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:09.500
for and by native peoples.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.820
Thank you.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:21.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.760
So I want to introduce
Maggie McKinley, who's

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.210
the moderator of
our first panel.

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:30.500
Maggie McKinley is a
Climenko Fellow and Lecturer

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.710
of Law at Harvard Law School.

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:38.150
She's also from the Fond du Lac
Band of Lake Superior Chippewa.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:41.630
She writes about legislation,
theories of interpretation,

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.420
minority rights
and representation,

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.800
and federal Indian law.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.602
And she is the principal
co-investigator

00:31:48.602 --> 00:31:50.810
of the Language of Lobbying
Project at the University

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.730
of Chicago, and
collaborator with me--

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.490
and I'm honored to say that--
with the North American

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:01.870
Petitions Project at the Harvard
Department of Government.

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:05.380
I rarely describe a paper
and essay as brilliant,

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.640
but I want to alert you
all to her brilliant essay

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.860
coming out in next month's
Stanford Law Review-- it is

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:12.660
next month, right?

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.500
It hasn't been postponed--
entitled "Lobbying

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.220
and the Petition Clause."

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.660
I've been working on
petitioning now for 15 years.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.090
It's the single best
paper in the field.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:26.100
She's also done thoughtful
work on lobbying

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.980
and on federal
Indian law, and she

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:33.250
helped immensely in the
creation of the framework

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:36.220
for this conference.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.500
Having gotten to know her
over the last couple years

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.340
has been a privilege
and pleasure.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.500
As I am a student, a
very amateur student

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.240
of Native American politics and
Native American petitioning,

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.100
it is with frequency but
with patience and kindness

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:56.020
that Maggie often corrects
me on my historical facts

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:59.030
and cultural
misapprehensions, and I

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:01.760
have to admit they are many.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.645
But I am indeed
honored to call her

00:33:03.645 --> 00:33:06.990
a colleague, a
collaborator, and a friend.

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:07.856
Maggie McKinley.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.500
-Good morning.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.346
That introduction, in many
ways, completely oversold

00:33:19.346 --> 00:33:20.470
what's coming this morning.

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:22.770
But thank you so much,
Dan, for overdoing it.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:26.220
I'm always grateful for that.

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.520
So welcome to our first
panel of the morning.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.520
This is on native law
and legal strategy.

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.270
And what you'll notice
first is that we're

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:39.170
missing one of our panelists
to a rogue flu that

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:41.320
hit him this morning.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.970
But we're going to do our
best to muddle through,

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:48.960
and we're grateful for your
patience with the panel.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.930
And we're looking forward
to having more Q&amp;A

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:54.560
with the audience at the end.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.800
So I'd like to start off
by thanking our organizers,

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.890
both at Radcliffe-- so
Dean Cohen Becky, Paul--

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:07.740
and at HUNAP, Dennis,
Shelly, and then

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:10.179
there's also Jason and
Sam, way in the back.

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:13.719
Thank you so much for all
of your energy this year.

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:17.590
It's been a pleasure to work
with all of you, and an honor.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:19.290
I'd like to extend a
very special thanks

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:22.650
to Dan Carpenter, the
political scientist

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:25.489
mastermind behind
our thematic year

00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:30.260
of the Performance of Native
Politics Outside the Vote.

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:33.810
We often envision voting
as the primary mechanism

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:37.040
of representation
in a democracy.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.159
So why exactly did we
focus our thematic year

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:45.010
on participation
outside of the vote?

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:50.280
In 1924, Native Americans
were extended the franchise

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.638
in federal elections.

00:34:52.638 --> 00:34:53.429
You heard me right.

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:55.400
That was 1924.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.520
19.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.400
That was 54 years
after the ratification

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:05.690
of the 15th Amendment, which
outlawed extending the right

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:08.500
to vote on the basis of race.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:13.890
And it wasn't until 1964 that
natives were given the right

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:16.810
to vote in states like Utah.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:19.940
In Minnesota, where
my family is from,

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.020
the Minnesota
constitution contained

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:26.230
an explicit civilization
clause that required natives

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:30.370
to pass a civilization test
before a district judge

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:35.550
before being able to vote
in Minnesota elections.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:39.060
This means that for a majority
of this nation's history,

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:44.190
over 150 years, Native
Americans were excluded

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:46.830
from the primary mechanism
of representation

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.230
in our government.

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:52.380
Our tribal governments
still have no formal means

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:56.570
of representation in our
federal and state systems.

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:59.570
We've had to find ways to
advocate for our sovereignty

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:02.380
elsewhere.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:06.200
Luckily for our communities,
sovereignty is like water,

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.350
and when one channel
is closed, it

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:12.030
flows into whatever
channels are open to it.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:15.090
We'll hear later today about
efforts aimed at Congress

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:17.710
and the Executive
Branch, and also efforts

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:23.060
aimed at the public
through art and mass media.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:26.570
But we'd like to start
first with the courts.

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:28.610
This is the site where
the United States first

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:34.080
articulated the famous words,
domestic dependent nations,

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.640
and in so doing
named what some call

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.930
federal recognition
of tribal sovereignty,

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:41.630
and what others--
not so friendly--

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:45.570
call a legal fiction.

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.810
In many ways, the
story of native America

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:50.730
within the courts
is a familiar one.

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:53.240
Like many other
disenfranchised, discrete,

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.230
and insular minorities,
natives took to the courts

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:58.360
during the Civil
Rights era to bring

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.600
the tools of impact litigation
to bear on the problems

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.140
that the electoral branches
just would not solve.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:09.090
Like Brown v. Board, Roe v.
Wade, and Romer v. Evans,

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:13.150
natives saw some
successes in the courts.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:16.190
But the native story
is also distinctive.

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:19.290
Unlike the traditional liberal
integrationist approach

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.540
of other minority
groups, natives

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.410
enjoyed structural
protection as minorities

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:28.630
through sovereignty and
local self-governments,

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:30.210
and not simply
through the protection

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.890
of constitutional rights.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:36.240
Over time the courts have
become increasingly hostile

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.690
to the structural protection.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:42.440
Not only is it something foreign
to other minority groups,

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.350
the court began to
see native sovereignty

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:47.070
as something that was actually
in tension with the rights

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:50.370
of others, mostly the
rights of non-Indians

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:53.340
within Indian country.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.780
Rather than rights
saving minorities

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.350
from the local
control of federalism,

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.890
as we often hear in our
oversimplified story

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:04.140
of the Warren Court and
the Civil Rights era,

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.590
we've seen a much more
nuanced relationship

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:09.560
between natives and the courts.

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.670
It's this more
nuanced relationship

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:14.590
that our panel explores today.

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:17.080
And to foster that
discussion, we'll

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.730
begin with someone
that I like to think

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:22.080
of as the conductor of the
National Symphony of Indian law

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.830
litigation, Richard Guest, Staff
Attorney the Native American

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:30.510
Rights Fund and head of its
Tribal Supreme Court Project,

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.825
and in full disclosure,
my former boss.

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.030
If there's a single case
in the entire United

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:42.170
States and elsewhere that's
important to Indian country,

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:44.290
I have no doubt that
Richard knows about it

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:48.790
and is organizing everything
around it already.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.350
And we'll also hear from the
Honorable Diane Humetewa,

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:55.810
United States District Judge
for the District of Arizona,

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:59.820
citizen of the Hopi
Nation, and the very first

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.810
Native American woman
appointed to the Federal bench.

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:07.190
Please join me in
welcoming our panel.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:17.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:19.130
-Thank you, Maggie.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:22.530
It is a pleasure to
be with you all today

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:27.500
and to be a part of an
important dialogue that's

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:32.000
been long in coming to
this part of the country.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.400
The conversation has
taken place elsewhere,

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.880
but certainly it's
necessary here.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:45.320
My role today is to come to you
from the Native American Rights

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.650
Fund, NARF, as we
refer to ourselves.

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:50.360
HUNAP, NARF, you
get all the acronyms

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:53.440
once you start coming to
Indian law conferences.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.680
Have to figure this out.

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:04.160
And as has already been alluded
to in the remarks this morning,

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.500
the movements
throughout this century

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.180
ultimately led to the formation
of the Native American Rights

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:10.679
Fund.

00:40:10.679 --> 00:40:13.360
It was really as a part
of the work of the NAACP

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.730
LDF, the Legal Defense Fund,
that the concept came out,

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:20.020
through the California
Indian Legal Services,

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:25.710
for the need for a
National Indian law firm,

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:29.740
that there would be a
nonprofit established that

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:32.410
would undertake the work
of national litigation

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:36.160
on behalf of Indian tribes
and individual Indians.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.400
And so NARF was established.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.300
David Getches, Charles
Wilkinson, John Echo Hawk,

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:50.030
my current executive director,
were all there in 1970.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:53.680
And they decided that the
location for the Native

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.990
American Rights Fund needed
to be at a neutral site,

00:40:56.990 --> 00:41:00.230
because Indian country
out in the West

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.750
is captured by various
interests, much like now,

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:05.480
here in the east and
in the south, where

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:09.050
if you're in the southwest,
you have particular interests

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:11.260
for particular tribes,
if you're in California,

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.340
if you're in the Northwest,
if you're in the plains.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:17.020
And so they made a
conscious decision

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:20.070
to locate in Boulder,
Colorado, just right

00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:22.680
off the campus of the
University of Colorado,

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:26.630
and that was in 1970.

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:28.840
I'm not going to
read my PowerPoint.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.760
I'll let you do that.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:35.030
But when NARF was established
through its indigenous board

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:40.560
of directors, they determined
that there would be five goals,

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:43.110
and it became our
mission statement.

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:45.680
The preservation
of tribal existence

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.850
and the protection of
tribal natural resources

00:41:48.850 --> 00:41:50.710
became paramount.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:54.740
Again, throughout
much of history,

00:41:54.740 --> 00:42:00.160
Native Americans survived by
being invisible to the majority

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.290
population.

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:05.110
That being invisible
meant you didn't even

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:08.920
know they were there,
and that was a survival

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:13.010
tactic, because if you knew
they were there, that they had

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:16.180
lands, that they had
goods, Indians learned,

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:19.170
you'd take them away.

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:25.110
And so they very much
lived life under the radar.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:27.250
The protection of
tribal natural resources

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:29.660
has been a primary
mission of NARF.

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:34.480
We have been involved in almost
every major piece of litigation

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.700
involving water rights and the
protection and preservation

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:42.717
of tribal resources that
mean survival for the tribes.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.580
We're also engaged
in the preservation

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:53.520
of Native American human
rights, the accountability

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:57.140
of governments to
Native Americans,

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:00.090
and one of our major roles
in the past number of years

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:02.210
has been the development
of Indian law

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:05.350
and the education of the public.

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:07.320
So I lay that out there
just as a framework

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:11.760
to do to be thinking that
back in 1970, leaders

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.730
from throughout Indian
country came together

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:17.240
with lawyers to talk about how
best to serve Indian country.

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:24.160
One of my basic
presentations, just about

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.150
the sources of federal
Indian law-- and I

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:28.300
do this at Indian law
conferences with lawyers

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.930
all the time, because we need
to be reminded that there

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:35.250
are sources for
federal Indian law,

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:38.770
for the establishment through
these various mediums.

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:45.820
Under the US Constitution
we have the Treaty Clause

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:48.750
formulated under
international law

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:51.630
with military and
foreign affairs policy.

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:58.000
And for us, we view that
not as a grant of authority,

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.960
but as a reservation of rights
under the US Constitution.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.210
There's the Indian
Commerce Clause,

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:10.710
and much has been written
around this particular clause.

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:12.130
And the Supremacy
Clause, which I

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:15.530
like to read,
Article VI, Clause 2,

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:19.040
"The Constitution and the laws
of the United States which

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:23.055
shall be made in pursuance
thereof, and all treaties made,

00:44:23.055 --> 00:44:25.430
or which shall be made, under
the authority of the United

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:34.250
States, shall be the
Supreme Law of the Land."

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:37.030
So we move from the
Constitution to federal statutes

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:39.220
and regulations.

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:41.330
Many of you may
know or may not know

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:45.760
that there's an entire title
of the US Code dedicated

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:50.590
to the regulation of
Indian people, Title 25.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:54.580
Indian people are perhaps the
most highly regulated people

00:44:54.580 --> 00:45:00.440
on the planet, and
it comes into play

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.386
with our interactions
in the courts

00:45:02.386 --> 00:45:04.010
and through the
administrative agencies

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:07.700
and through Congress, which
you'll hear about later.

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:11.190
Then we have the
development of common law

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:14.350
through the federal courts.

00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:18.290
And I think that that is
a topic that we'll get

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:21.750
into more in my presentation.

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:28.200
And then I like to remind
folks that similar to what

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.250
Dean Cohen talked
about, there were

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:34.850
specific periods in the
development of Indian law

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:37.030
that many Indian law
professors adhere to.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:39.695
And they talk about
the formative years

00:45:39.695 --> 00:45:41.320
from the founding of
the United States.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:45.030
Well, Indian tribes were
here before the formation

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:46.810
of the United
States, but we talk

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:49.330
about those formative years,
and this is a development

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:51.190
of federal Indian law.

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:54.920
We have the Allotment
and Assimilation Era.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.500
And again, this was
an era where there

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:02.670
were many well-meaning
non-Indians who

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:05.250
believed that this
was in the best

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:08.590
interests of Indian
people, that by breaking up

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:12.370
their reservation and giving
lands to individual Indians

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:15.210
and assimilating them
into the mainstream,

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:18.960
that we were doing
right by Indians.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.210
And the exact opposite
was the truth.

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:27.490
And in 1928, there was a
report issued called The Miriam

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:32.710
Report, and it detailed the
poverty and the suffering that

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:34.780
was occurring throughout
Indian country

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.420
as a result of allotment
and assimilation.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:40.010
And thus we come into
the Indian Reorganization

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:43.150
Era with the passage of
the Indian Reorganization

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:51.180
Act in 1934, where the
Congress made a determination

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:56.180
that the future
for Indians meant

00:46:56.180 --> 00:47:01.700
allowing their
governments to reorganize.

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:06.710
They saw them, and again
created constitutions

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:09.910
for tribal governments
in which to govern

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:10.880
on their reservations.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.860
They stopped the
process of allotment

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.760
through the Indian
Reorganization Act.

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.170
The whole idea of
allotment was to break up

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:20.810
the Indian reservations,
destabilize

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:23.750
a central form of
government, and thereby take

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:27.090
care of the Indian problem,
that Indians would just be

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:29.730
absorbed into the mainstream.

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:30.430
But guess what?

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:36.010
Indians didn't want to be
absorbed into the mainstream.

00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:38.740
They wanted to maintain
their identity.

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:42.320
They wanted to maintain their
culture and their traditions.

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:47.720
They wanted to maintain their
traditional ways of life,

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.970
because that's who they were.

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:53.820
So we enter into an era where
there's a real conflict,

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:58.840
where again, well-meaning,
well-intentioned non-Indians

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.480
are saying, here's
a solution for you,

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:04.340
instead of looking to the
tribes, to the Indians,

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:09.480
and saying, what do you want?

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:12.880
So we have this era of
self-determination, the Indian

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.800
Reorganization Act.

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.350
I'm getting ahead of
myself, but there was also

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:24.700
that same force that existed
within the United States

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:30.490
government that continued
to see Indians as a problem,

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:35.310
and they continued to seek
that the best way to help

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:38.760
Indians was to terminate
the federal relationship

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.890
with the tribes.

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:44.620
And there are examples from
around Indian country of that

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.210
occurring, and again,
the devastating

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:49.780
impacts, where tribes
had been successful

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.230
in the use of the
natural resources.

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:55.910
One of NARF's clients is the
Klamath Tribes in Oregon,

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:58.560
and they were one
of the leaders.

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:02.650
They had huge timber resources.

00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:07.660
They were living a high quality
of life on their reservation,

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:12.700
engaged with the non-Indian
communities around them,

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.760
with the state of Oregon.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.230
And in the 19050s,
the federal government

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:20.910
saw them as a success, that they
didn't need federal supervision

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:26.210
anymore, cut the ties,
broke up the reservation,

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:32.150
and the tribe almost
immediately fell off a cliff

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:36.140
to where they experienced
the loss of who

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:39.080
they were as a people.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:44.080
They were no longer
successful economically,

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:50.470
that again, it was an area
where we could talk and do

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:52.179
an entire conference
on the termination

00:49:52.179 --> 00:49:53.220
policies and its impacts.

00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:00.220
As we move forward,
there's the famous speech

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:03.060
in 1972 that
President Nixon gave,

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.940
The Indian
Self-Determination Act, where

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:10.690
he recognized and Congress
ultimately passed-- I never

00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:13.720
get the name right anymore,
The Indian Education

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:17.270
Self-Determination, or Indian
Self-Determination Education

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:19.630
Assistance Act.

00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:22.440
We refer to it as
630A contracting

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:26.280
of opening up opportunities
for tribal governments

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:30.520
to take on programs that
were once administered

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:33.620
by the federal government
on behalf of the tribes,

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:36.330
and give them the
financial resources

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:40.240
to run those government
programs themselves

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:44.534
in all different kinds of
areas regarding governance.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:50.990
Now we come to talk
about the work that I do,

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:54.180
the Supreme Court Project, and
my colleague, John Dossett, who

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:56.810
you hear from later from The
National Congress of American

00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:57.310
Indians.

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:09.540
Prior to 1978, and
really into the 1980s,

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:14.030
Indian tribes were having
great success in the courts.

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:17.390
When NARF was founded
in 1970, we immediately

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:21.790
brought a number of
pieces of litigation,

00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:23.340
in particular,
under the treaties.

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:24.950
There were the
great fishing wars

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:26.470
that were taking
place in Washington

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:28.990
and Oregon and Michigan.

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:31.520
And fishing rights
and hunting rights

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.300
were one of those rights
expressly preserved

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.920
under the treaties
with the United States.

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:41.920
There were land claims happening
here in the east coast.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:47.240
And NARF was, along with
others, bringing those claims

00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:51.750
into the federal courts and
having levels of success.

00:51:54.360 --> 00:52:00.070
But back in 1978, there was
a justice, at that time,

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:02.640
on the Supreme Court,
William Rehnquist,

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:07.110
who had a different
vision for Indian tribes,

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:11.290
who really was a deeply
committed states'

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:18.050
rights activist, who
really is committed to,

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:22.630
or was committed to, an ideal
that no one has special rights.

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:24.460
No one in this country
has special rights.

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:27.260
We're all the same.

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.360
So again, I don't believe
that it was necessarily

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:33.960
started as animus
against Indian people,

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.530
but his own commitment
to his own ideals,

00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:40.110
that he crafted the
opinion in Oliphant, which

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:42.700
was an Indian law case
involving criminal jurisdiction

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:46.160
over non-Indians
on the reservation.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.410
And the rule came out
of Oliphant, something

00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:54.010
known as implicit divestiture.

00:52:54.010 --> 00:52:57.634
And what that means is
although it's not explicit,

00:52:57.634 --> 00:53:00.050
there's no way that the United
States would have bargained

00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:03.241
for Indian tribes having
authority over non-Indians

00:53:03.241 --> 00:53:05.740
and being able to criminally
prosecute them even though they

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:08.260
commit crimes
within their lands,

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:09.960
and even though
under the treaties

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:15.070
that the United States had
entered into with tribes,

00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:17.410
that they actually
say that tribes

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:20.060
would have this authority.

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:23.480
So implicitly, the
Indian tribes were

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.190
divested of that authority.

00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:28.640
William Rehnquist went on
to become Chief Justice.

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.490
And then we start
seeing the period,

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:35.310
now, what I described
in the earlier slide

00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:39.650
as possibly the period
of judicial termination,

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:43.660
where through the courts, the
United States is achieving,

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:48.240
or opponents to Indian
country in the exercise

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:51.250
of inherent tribal
authority are achieving

00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:53.160
a level of success
of terminating

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:57.860
those rights and the
exercise of those rights.

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:02.782
So during the October term 2000,
there were a number of cases--

00:54:02.782 --> 00:54:03.740
and please let me know.

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:07.530
Write it down if
I'm taking too long.

00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:09.960
In 2000, there were
a number of cases

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:13.430
that came down, in
particular, Atkinson Trading,

00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:15.450
dealing with a
tax on non-Indians

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:18.180
in a hotel situated
on the Navajo Indian

00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:22.970
reservation located on fee
land owned by the hotel,

00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:27.040
but surrounded by
reservation trust land,

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:30.530
receiving services
from the Navajo Nation,

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:35.130
but feeling that they should
not be subject to the hotel tax.

00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:36.940
And then we also
had Nevada v. Hicks,

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:40.050
which involved state officials
coming onto the reservation

00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:47.220
to execute search warrants for
the illegal hunting of big horn

00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:53.990
sheep off reservation,
but within the hunting

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:55.920
grounds of the tribe.

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:59.690
We were successful in both
cases in the lower courts.

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:03.490
We had won judgments in
favor of no state authority

00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:07.950
in Hicks, yes to tribal
authority in Atkinson Trading.

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:10.400
We end up in front of
the US Supreme Court,

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:17.060
and we get two decisions
adverse to Indian country.

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:21.580
And it shook up a number of
leaders, because at that time,

00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:25.960
there were a number of other
efforts underway in the media,

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:28.610
at Congress, that were
truly anti-Indian.

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:35.240
And so a meeting was
called in Washington, DC,

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.900
on September 11, 2001.

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:39.700
And the National
Tribal Leadership all

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:43.660
came in on that day to meet.

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:46.410
Senator Inouye was
there, and as you know,

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:51.060
had to excuse himself
because planes had just flown

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:53.780
into the World Trade Center.

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:55.846
And then a plane flew
into the Pentagon.

00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:02.000
The silver lining to
that very dark cloud

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.470
was the fact that we
had a captive audience

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:07.950
of tribal leaders
in Washington, DC.

00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:12.630
And so through that came what
was known as The Sovereignty

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:15.570
Protection Initiative,
initiative by the National

00:56:15.570 --> 00:56:21.910
Tribal Leadership to preserve
tribal sovereignty in all

00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:22.870
respects.

00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:25.280
And there were four projects
that were formulated out

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.340
of that meeting.

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:32.160
There was the
legislative project

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:36.940
to undo what the court had done
in Oliphant, and subsequently

00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:39.770
in the Montana case with
respect to civil jurisdiction,

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:44.010
to address tribal authority
over non-Indians legislatively.

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:47.270
There were also efforts underway
at that time in the Congress

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:50.660
with respect to the
immunity of tribes,

00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:54.380
and trying to waive that
immunity so that non-Indians

00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:57.580
could sue Indian
tribal governments,

00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:00.630
and a host of others.

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:02.400
So those were
initiatives underway,

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:05.500
and there was a
project established

00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:11.050
to address legislative fixes,
to ensure full expression

00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:12.730
of tribal sovereignty.

00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:15.940
Then there was the
media public relations,

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:21.550
addressing it through educating
the public with respect

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:25.960
to that the tribes are here,
they haven't gone anywhere,

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:30.130
they will continue to be here,
and that it's a good thing

00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:33.460
that the tribes are still here.

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:36.260
There was the Judicial
Nominations Project, now known

00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:39.320
as the NCAI Project
on the Judiciary,

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:42.560
where we worked extremely
hard on identifying

00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:47.320
native candidates who were
qualified to serve as judges

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:53.030
on the federal courts prior to
Judge Humetewa'a appointment,

00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:55.310
there had only been
two-- in the history

00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:58.520
of the federal
bench-- two judges

00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:01.890
who were of Native
descent on the bench.

00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:05.200
One of them didn't know
he was Native at the time,

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.100
that he was appointed
by President Carter.

00:58:08.100 --> 00:58:10.880
The other had resigned
his seat shortly

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:13.010
after he was appointed
by President Clinton

00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:16.020
to return to private practice.

00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:20.760
So for a long period of time,
we had no Native American judges

00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.075
on the Federal bench.

00:58:22.075 --> 00:58:23.450
And we're working
to change that,

00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:25.533
and we're working at the
level of the state courts

00:58:25.533 --> 00:58:28.520
as well to change
the dynamic there

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:31.370
to make sure that Natives
have an opportunity to serve

00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:33.800
on state court benches.

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:36.090
So along with those
three projects,

00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:39.220
the Tribal Supreme
Court Project,

00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:43.900
a real effort by the
National Tribal Leadership

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:46.080
to address what was
happening in the court, what

00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:48.830
they were witnessing
in terms of the erosion

00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:51.170
of tribal sovereignty
through the courts.

00:58:59.820 --> 00:59:01.350
So the purpose of
the project was

00:59:01.350 --> 00:59:07.420
to strengthen tribal
advocacy, do that

00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:11.460
through coordinating resources,
developing specific strategies,

00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:14.970
creating relationships
and networks.

00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:18.240
We have the staff with the
attorneys at the Native

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:19.380
American Rights Fund.

00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:20.350
I say attorneys.

00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:23.750
There are two of us
who do this work,

00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:25.090
and I do it mostly full-time.

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:29.330
Attorneys at the
National Congress

00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:32.790
of American Indians, John
Dossett and his colleague Colby

00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:34.910
Duren.

00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:36.410
And then I now have
a working group.

00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:37.600
I have to update this slide.

00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:41.120
I'm now up over 300
attorneys, tribal leaders,

00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.410
and law professors
on our working group.

00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:50.720
And our role is multifaceted.

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.860
We monitor all the cases
in the lower courts.

00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:55.890
We try to identify
trends that are

00:59:55.890 --> 00:59:58.140
occurring in the lower courts.

00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.430
We're trying to
identify cases that we

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.920
believe are problematic for us.

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:06.700
If you remember,
the NAACP, when it

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:12.670
was envisioning how to
undo racial segregation,

01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:15.640
it brought a series
of targeted cases

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:18.710
that they felt that they
could win all the way up

01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:20.570
through the Supreme
Court, culminating

01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:23.460
in Brown v. Board of Education.

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:26.470
And there was a
strategy behind that.

01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:28.920
The project tries
to emulate that.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:34.450
We oftentimes cannot bring cases
the way that the NAACP would

01:00:34.450 --> 01:00:38.300
bring cases, because cases are
happening all the time without

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:41.300
our input and us being
able to say, bad case,

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.610
please don't bring that.

01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:46.310
Well, the tribe, the people,
the individual allottees, they

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:49.790
need to have their
rights vindicated,

01:00:49.790 --> 01:00:53.310
and they'll use the courts or
whatever sources they have.

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:55.520
So we can't control it.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:00.040
So we move along
very quickly now

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.950
to the role of the work of
the Supreme Court Project.

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:09.230
We keep these cases updated and
we conduct national conference

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:13.046
calls on a regular basis to
talk with the work group members

01:01:13.046 --> 01:01:14.004
throughout the country.

01:01:17.876 --> 01:01:19.750
The normal things that
a project of this sort

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:23.540
would do in consultation
with the Tribal Leadership,

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.230
we work heavily at the search
stage in the Supreme Court,

01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:31.970
where a determination is
made whether to grant or deny

01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:34.210
review of a particular case.

01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:37.420
We have an ongoing relationship
with the United States

01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:39.910
Solicitor General's
Office whenever we're

01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:44.160
not adverse to them in a case.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:48.670
And we coordinate
moot courts, and I've

01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:52.560
had the pleasure of mooting some
of the most well-known Supreme

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.790
Court practitioners who
have been arguing our case,

01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:57.760
including Neal Katyal,
who argued the Bay Mills

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.240
case and the Dollar
General case,

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.985
Paul Clement, who successfully
argued the Nebraska v. Parker

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:04.610
case this term, and
a number of others.

01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:11.410
So in just a couple
of minutes, I just

01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:15.200
want to kind of cover some of
the work that we've tracked

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:19.700
and give you an idea of
just the breadth of work.

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:22.590
In 2011 we published
our Ten Year Report

01:02:22.590 --> 01:02:24.610
for the Supreme Court Project.

01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:26.920
And you can see from
the graph the types

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:32.790
of cases that were at court,
where we were petitioning

01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:35.260
the court or someone was
petitioning the court,

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:36.840
to decide an issue.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:40.590
And civil jurisdiction, criminal
jurisdiction, Indian gaming,

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:42.500
lands sort of led the way.

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.311
The most litigated issue
was sovereign immunity.

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:54.120
Then you look at the cases
that the court granted,

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.860
and you see that
they are dominated

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:58.450
by cases usually brought
by the federal government

01:02:58.450 --> 01:03:01.370
or by state governments
against trials.

01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:05.487
The trust
responsibility, taxation

01:03:05.487 --> 01:03:06.445
were the leading cases.

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:14.990
This graph was to illustrate the
outcomes for tribal interests

01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:16.760
in the lower courts.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.510
We'll talk about the
outcomes real quickly

01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:21.620
in the Supreme Court.

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:23.450
And on average, we are 50-50.

01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:25.770
We win half the time,
we lose half the time

01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:27.094
in the lower appellate courts.

01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:35.800
So to kind of wrap this
up, our win-loss record

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.170
with the Rehnquist court at
the start of the project we

01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:40.694
actually improved.

01:03:40.694 --> 01:03:42.110
In the beginning
there was a slide

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:45.140
that talked about David
Getches and the loss rate,

01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:53.970
that Indian tribes at the
time were winning only 25%

01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:57.020
of their cases, one in four.

01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.420
Our winning percentage
was lower than that

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:03.720
of criminal defendants
in front of the court.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.420
So when we got together
with the Project,

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:09.710
we saw almost immediate success.

01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:11.270
There are varying
reasons for that,

01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:14.050
but we were four wins,
three losses, two draws.

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:17.140
When the Roberts court
came in, and at the time

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:20.200
of the publication of
the Ten Year Report,

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.060
we were zero for seven.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.360
And we had-- partly
because of the retirement

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.780
of Justice O'Connor,
Chief Justice Roberts

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:34.780
coming on the court to replace
Chief Justice Rehnquist, Samuel

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:37.830
Alito, who until the
Nebraska v. Parker case,

01:04:37.830 --> 01:04:40.150
has never voted in favor
of Indian interests

01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.990
in a single case.

01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:50.610
And now we're starting to take
a look at the more recent terms.

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:53.670
We're now-- with no
decision in two of the cases

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:58.540
at the court today--
we're now two and two.

01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:01.790
We had the loss in Patchak,
the win in Ramah Navajo,

01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:04.770
the loss in Baby Girl,
the win in Bay Mills.

01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:07.130
This term we now have
the loss in Menominee

01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:09.720
and the win in
Nebraska v. Parker.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.860
So we're at 50%.

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:15.480
And I haven't had a chance to
break that down and analyze

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:19.880
why, because we were
basically zero for nine,

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.870
and all of a sudden
we're not anymore.

01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:25.680
So I have to start
crunching that data.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.450
But some things we
have noticed is,

01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:31.550
there's been a real decrease
in the number of cert petitions

01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:34.760
in Indian law cases
over the recent terms,

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:38.190
and there's been a huge decline
in the number of Indian law

01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:39.795
cases granted.

01:05:39.795 --> 01:05:41.170
Before the Rehnquist
court, there

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:43.360
was an average of three
to four Indian law cases

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:44.540
heard by the Supreme Court.

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:48.210
During the Rehnquist court,
there was two to three.

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:50.590
With the Roberts court,
it's been one Indian law

01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:52.060
case on average.

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:55.950
Now that's changed, and we'll
be taking a look at that.

01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:58.560
And this term the number
of Indian law petitions

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:04.090
is back up to its
average of 26, 27.

01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:06.330
So there's the presentation.

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:09.110
I hope that there are questions,
and that I did leave time

01:06:09.110 --> 01:06:11.970
for us to have that
interaction to dig down

01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:13.180
a little bit about this.

01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:14.570
Thank you very much.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:21.230
[APPLAUSE]

01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:23.810
-I was happy to yield
time to you, Richard.

01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:26.680
It was very fascinating to me.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:30.660
Well, I want to begin
first by thinking

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:33.870
Councilman Perry for that
wonderful welcome and blessing

01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:37.010
and beautiful song,
and Dean Cohen

01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:40.980
for her encouraging
and kind remarks.

01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:43.380
My remarks were
to have followed,

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:46.520
I think, a foundational
set of remarks

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:49.400
from our absent presenter.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:52.940
So if you will bear with
me, I hope that some of this

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:55.750
isn't too general.

01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:57.640
But in the time
that we have left,

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:02.380
or the time that I hope to
have left on the program,

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.040
we'd love to hear questions.

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.820
And I certainly have
questions of my own

01:07:05.820 --> 01:07:09.550
for Richard that will
probably go beyond the break.

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:14.430
But what I'm actually
going to talk to you about

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:17.190
builds on a little bit of
what Richard talked about,

01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:19.870
but it sort of comes from
a different perspective.

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:24.770
I'm first going to talk about
tribal court systems generally.

01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:28.660
And what I mean in terms
of tribal court systems

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:34.420
is really discussing the
rule of law and custom

01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:39.070
in those systems, and the
federal government's influence

01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:41.550
over those systems.

01:07:41.550 --> 01:07:45.210
And I'm going to use
my own Hopi tribal

01:07:45.210 --> 01:07:48.390
court, the court that I used
to sit on as an appellate court

01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:51.360
judge, as an example.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:57.420
And then I'm going to talk about
judging within the two systems

01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:00.090
that I'm familiar with,
the tribal court system

01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:03.210
and now the federal
court system,

01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:07.830
sort of give you a comparison
and contrast as to what

01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:12.390
I see are similarities and
differences in the role

01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:16.260
of a judge in those
systems, and then talk

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:21.130
about the need for
coordination and consultation,

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:25.140
which sort of goes very
nicely with what Richard just

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:28.319
finished discussing.

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:30.700
And I'm going to try to
do that by first laying

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:34.250
a foundation of where I
come from, the Hopi Tribe,

01:08:34.250 --> 01:08:37.580
because this is going to
be the example that we're

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.140
going to use.

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:43.350
As you can see here,
our reservation area

01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:48.430
was established by
executive order in 1882.

01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:50.689
How many in the
audience have ever

01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:53.560
been to the Hopi Indian Nation?

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:54.939
Oh, gosh.

01:08:54.939 --> 01:08:57.359
Probably a quarter
of the audience.

01:08:57.359 --> 01:09:00.580
Well, if you can
see on the map, we

01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:05.540
are that little brownish area
in Northeastern Arizona that's

01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:09.800
surrounded by the blue, and
the blue is the Navajo Nation.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:13.590
So we are a landlocked
tribe, essentially,

01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:17.050
comprised of 12 villages,
which is important for you

01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:21.010
to remember as we go
through this discussion.

01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:25.420
And you'll see the acreage
in terms of square miles,

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:30.160
and according to our census,
the population of tribally

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:36.149
enrolled members, which, by
the way, has been growing.

01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:41.439
Historically we were and still
are a very traditional tribe,

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:44.680
and we are a
matrilineal society,

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:49.729
which is also very important
for our discussion this morning.

01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:53.870
And so historically,
you were automatically

01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:59.500
a member of the tribe
if your mother was Hopi.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:04.400
And then because of the
sort of advancements

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:09.420
in the rules of enrollment,
now the current criteria

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:13.130
is you have to have a quarter
lineage of Hopi blood.

01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:17.980
And so traditionally,
essentially, we still

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:21.720
follow our mothers' line in
terms of village membership.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.670
Just by notation, the little
small blocks on the map

01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:34.460
denote where the other Indian
nations are in Arizona.

01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:38.020
There are 22 Indian
nations in Arizona,

01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:40.815
two of the largest in
the nation, the Tohono

01:10:40.815 --> 01:10:44.640
O'odham, which is to the
south, adjacent to Tucson,

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.105
and runs into Mexico, and
of course the Navajo Nation.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.710
Those of you who have been to
Hopi recognize this photograph.

01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:58.590
And for some it might be
difficult to make out,

01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:02.980
but this is on 2nd Mesa,
the village of Sipaulovi

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:07.690
and Mishongnovi, which are
both on the bottom of the mesa,

01:11:07.690 --> 01:11:11.700
and the traditional homes are
on the very top of those two

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:12.710
mesas.

01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:15.690
And you can see the
expanse of the homes that

01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:17.230
are below the mesas.

01:11:17.230 --> 01:11:20.790
And then Highway 264
runs adjacent almost

01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:22.250
at the bottom of
this photograph.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:30.400
We are a very
traditional community.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:34.570
There is sort of a
modern village photograph

01:11:34.570 --> 01:11:38.170
down to the left,
the lower left.

01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:42.820
And you can see we still are
a very traditional farming

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:43.990
community.

01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:49.730
Basically our existence
revolves around our farming

01:11:49.730 --> 01:11:53.170
and the growth of corn,
and our crops of corn

01:11:53.170 --> 01:11:58.050
that we use in our ceremonies,
of course, for our sustenance.

01:11:58.050 --> 01:12:04.250
And we follow a very
traditional ceremonial cycle,

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:10.250
and we are very well known for
our kachina ceremonies, which

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:16.930
have now become art in terms
of our kachina carvings,

01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:23.980
which are primarily done
by the men in our villages.

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:28.590
My village affiliation, I am
from the village of Hotevilla,

01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:31.350
which is 3rd Mesa.

01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:35.100
And I am a member
of that village.

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:40.230
My grandmother-- my great
grandmother, I should say--

01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:44.230
was one of the
families who relocated

01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:48.130
from the traditional
village of Old Oraibi, which

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:54.550
the Hopi consider the longest
continuously inhabited

01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:56.580
village in the United States.

01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:00.690
I think we compete with
Acoma for that label.

01:13:00.690 --> 01:13:03.240
But in any event,
my great grandmother

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:05.810
helped to establish--
she was one

01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:10.480
of the so-called traditionalists
who moved away from Old Oraibi

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:16.890
to resettle the traditionalists
to different areas on the mesa.

01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:22.150
And my family, then, is from
the village of Hotevilla,

01:13:22.150 --> 01:13:27.310
which is about six, eight miles
down the road from Mishongnovi.

01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:35.080
And I am of the Tobacco Clan.

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:39.170
We say [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],
which is essentially

01:13:39.170 --> 01:13:45.130
the responsibility of our clan
system is to be caretakers

01:13:45.130 --> 01:13:48.210
and provide the tobacco for
all of the ceremonies that are

01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:50.648
necessary in our society.

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:57.820
So I want to begin by talking
a little bit about some

01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:00.870
of the influences
that Richard mentioned

01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:04.990
in terms of our history with
Indian tribes and the Federal

01:14:04.990 --> 01:14:06.530
government.

01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:09.720
This is how our
constitution looks today.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:13.410
It is our Constitution
of the Hopi Tribe.

01:14:13.410 --> 01:14:24.220
And essentially, this
was enacted in 1936.

01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:28.570
And I want to point out the
preamble of our constitution.

01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:35.510
As you can read there, it
recognizes the village autonomy

01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:37.740
of the Hopi people.

01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:42.450
And whenever I
read this preamble,

01:14:42.450 --> 01:14:46.510
that the Constitution is adopted
by the self-governing Hopi

01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:52.150
and Tewa villages, I
think about what happened

01:14:52.150 --> 01:14:53.986
in enacting this Constitution.

01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:58.980
First, let me go
to the next slide.

01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:01.460
And if you'll see the
first bullet point,

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:05.350
it talks about the Indian
Reorganization Act.

01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:09.950
Of these eras that Richard
talked about, we, of course,

01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:14.400
were influenced by these eras
in the federal government.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:19.910
There was a period of time
where the original Spaniards who

01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:24.170
came-- the Hopi people
along with the other Pueblo

01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:28.260
people in New Mexico fought
off the Spaniard influences,

01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:30.180
and that stood for a while.

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:32.520
And then came the
federal government

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:36.140
with all of the
policies of assimilation

01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:40.290
and taking the children off
to boarding school and so on,

01:15:40.290 --> 01:15:43.770
and then the influx of the
federal officials, the BIA

01:15:43.770 --> 01:15:50.510
officials, if you will, who
came into the community.

01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:53.940
And then there was
this era of time

01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:55.920
where the federal
government said, well,

01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.690
look, if we just give them
rules or structure of rules,

01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:05.570
then they can start
governing themselves.

01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:09.460
And so there was this
movement on the Hopi villages.

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:13.090
And if you can imagine
back in the 1930s,

01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:19.650
there was still a very
traditional Hopi language

01:16:19.650 --> 01:16:24.450
that was predominantly
the language there.

01:16:24.450 --> 01:16:27.480
These officials would go
into the kiva chambers,

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:30.760
our ceremonial chambers,
and try to convince

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:37.840
the leaders of our villages
to adopt this Constitution.

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:40.550
And there was a
large back and forth,

01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:44.460
and it was a two-year process
of going village to village,

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:48.370
going into the kivas, talking to
the men, getting them to go out

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:52.800
to the communities to say, this
Constitution is a good thing.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:58.660
And at the end of the day,
when you think about it,

01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:06.210
this Constitution was actually
passed by a vote of 104

01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:11.980
to the 651 eligible
members to vote.

01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:14.190
And so we still
have this struggle

01:17:14.190 --> 01:17:18.270
in our community about the
legitimacy of this Constitution

01:17:18.270 --> 01:17:24.310
because of the number of people
that actually voted to pass it.

01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:26.420
But in any event, what
I think about when

01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:28.810
I look at this
preamble is really

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:34.040
the foresight of some of
the elders who participated

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:37.340
in those discussions
to really point out

01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:41.850
the autonomy of the very
villages from which they came

01:17:41.850 --> 01:17:45.102
and the role of the villages
in Hopi society generally.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:52.220
This Constitution establishes
the tribal government.

01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:57.100
It essentially is a
one-branch government.

01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:02.020
And that's necessary
to also remember

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:08.990
because it does not establish,
like our Constitution,

01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:13.030
a three-tiered
branch of government.

01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:15.390
Oh, I'm going backwards.

01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:19.290
So moving forward
to our establishment

01:18:19.290 --> 01:18:20.990
of our tribal court systems.

01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:24.790
You can see there that
we also fell influence

01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:28.260
to the code of federal offenses.

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:33.990
Essentially what
occurred-- how many of

01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:37.871
you know where the
Bureau of Indian Affairs

01:18:37.871 --> 01:18:39.314
developed out of?

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.780
War Department.

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:51.280
So during these various
eras of assimilation,

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:55.430
you did have the necessity
for these Indian agents

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:59.430
to do something to bring
these native people in line.

01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:03.460
And so what happened was,
they established these courts.

01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:08.400
And the courts were really
made up of ad hoc rules.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.600
And the ad hoc
rules of punishing

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:13.770
Indians who weren't coming
in line with what the desired

01:19:13.770 --> 01:19:16.680
federal policy of
the day was, ad hoc

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:20.170
rules to deal with the
traditionalists, in our case,

01:19:20.170 --> 01:19:24.020
at Hopi, who refused to
have their children taken

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:25.360
to boarding school.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.590
How do you deal
with these folks who

01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:35.120
are disrupting the forward
movement of the government?

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:37.440
And so oftentimes
what would happen is,

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:40.300
the BIA superintendent
would appoint

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:45.010
a person, a friendly Indian,
to be a judge on these courts.

01:19:45.010 --> 01:19:49.130
And in our case, you can see
here that the CFR court in Hopi

01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:51.690
was established in 1940.

01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:54.290
It was essentially
the BIA superintendent

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:59.430
who told an individual, here's
the code of federal rules.

01:19:59.430 --> 01:20:03.320
Read this book and apply it to
the cases that come before you.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:06.850
And in many instances,
a lot of the cases

01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:11.970
that were first heard in the CFR
courts were criminal matters.

01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:16.270
And if it was interesting.

01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:18.460
I was reading some of
the former documents,

01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:22.700
and the judge, the
first CFR judge,

01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:26.680
basically said, well,
I'll read this book,

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:29.700
and I'll just apply it
until the Hopi people know

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.160
what this court is about.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:32.910
SO I thought that was
kind of interesting.

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:43.670
So jumping forward, the CFR
court, then, was in operation.

01:20:43.670 --> 01:20:49.390
And again, it only predominantly
worked on criminal matters.

01:20:49.390 --> 01:20:53.440
And there was an
assumption in the community

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:57.330
that the other matters, the more
civil matters, the things that

01:20:57.330 --> 01:21:02.500
involved family,
were all being taken

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:03.976
care of at the local level.

01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:12.660
And when I was an
appellate court judge,

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:17.000
I found it very, very
interesting to learn

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:23.100
that our Hopi court
was established almost

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:26.490
in an ad hoc
manner, if you will.

01:21:26.490 --> 01:21:29.400
There was a lawsuit
that was brought

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:34.010
by a Navajo man
against the Hopi tribe

01:21:34.010 --> 01:21:38.110
because his livestock
had been taken.

01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:46.010
They had gone over into
a Hopi land grazing area.

01:21:46.010 --> 01:21:49.970
And the non-Indian
lawyer at the time

01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:54.070
convened a meeting of the
existing tribal council.

01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:56.890
And there was a discussion
about what do we do?

01:21:56.890 --> 01:22:00.340
How do we address this issue?

01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:03.740
And there was only
a small paragraph

01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:08.300
that then describes a
vote to establish a court

01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:12.610
system in 1972.

01:22:12.610 --> 01:22:16.670
And so out of this
sort of reaction, then,

01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:20.990
comes this is what we call
Ordinance 21, which is,

01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:25.935
today, our ordinance that
establishes our Hopi court.

01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:35.310
One of the interesting things
that occurred a couple years

01:22:35.310 --> 01:22:42.520
later is that the Hopi
council, in their wisdom,

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:50.420
passed a resolution, H-1276,
that requires the tribal court

01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:57.300
to apply custom, tradition,
and culture in deciding matters

01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:00.610
of both substance and procedure.

01:23:00.610 --> 01:23:07.400
And that resolution actually
establishes the foundations

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:12.330
of how the Hopi
appellate court applies

01:23:12.330 --> 01:23:18.320
custom and law in current cases
that come before it today.

01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:25.610
I also wanted to point
out this provision.

01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:29.210
And I don't know if you
can read that up there.

01:23:29.210 --> 01:23:34.410
But this is actually a
section of the Constitution,

01:23:34.410 --> 01:23:39.190
Article III, that talks
about the organization,

01:23:39.190 --> 01:23:41.200
the acknowledgement
of the villages

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.450
that were established
at the time.

01:23:43.450 --> 01:23:47.620
But what I wanted to point
out here is Section 2.

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:50.400
It basically reserves
to those villages

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:54.620
certain types of decision
making to appoint guardians

01:23:54.620 --> 01:23:58.370
for orphan children, to
adjust family disputes

01:23:58.370 --> 01:24:00.720
and regulate family
relationships,

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:06.070
to assign farming land and
property and inheritance.

01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:13.950
Again, another very thoughtful
and deliberate statement

01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:17.550
that basically says, we
preserve these rights

01:24:17.550 --> 01:24:20.500
to our individual villages.

01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:24.660
And so this, actually,
also provides

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:29.430
a basis for our tribal courts.

01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:35.890
When primarily
addressing civil issues,

01:24:35.890 --> 01:24:38.795
many of these civil issues--
in particular, property

01:24:38.795 --> 01:24:43.590
and inheritance-- are
sent back to the villages

01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:46.710
for a first decision.

01:24:46.710 --> 01:24:49.510
And if the village doesn't
want to get involved

01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:51.560
in that decision,
they have to certify

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:56.980
that to go up to the court
to let the court exercise

01:24:56.980 --> 01:24:58.995
its jurisdiction
over that matter.

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:03.550
But what has happened
over time is,

01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:06.400
those various provisions
that I pointed out

01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:12.640
have established a very
interesting practice

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.580
and procedure in the Hopi court.

01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:21.370
That is, because tradition
and custom oftentimes

01:25:21.370 --> 01:25:25.220
aren't known and may never be
known by certain individuals,

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:30.210
especially if you're not in a
particular society that needs

01:25:30.210 --> 01:25:34.100
to know, it created a quandary.

01:25:34.100 --> 01:25:37.840
So in the late
'90s, early 2000s,

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:41.190
the Hopi appellate court,
before I was on it,

01:25:41.190 --> 01:25:46.700
established a system to
develop that customary law.

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:53.350
And the way that was created
was sort of happenstance.

01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:56.900
It resulted as a
property dispute,

01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:59.200
and the tribal judge
took it upon himself

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:01.860
to go to the village,
hear from elders

01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:05.290
about how property
was distributed

01:26:05.290 --> 01:26:09.890
in that particular
village and in that clan,

01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:11.870
and then heard from
elders in the family,

01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:14.890
and they developed
this body of law.

01:26:14.890 --> 01:26:19.790
And it was through that system
that that became precedent

01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:21.560
and process and procedure.

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:25.650
And again, those
procedures are used today.

01:26:25.650 --> 01:26:30.140
What that has developed,
however, is a tension.

01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:35.130
Because I've talked primarily
about the custom and tradition

01:26:35.130 --> 01:26:40.160
in civil types of
cases, family cases.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:43.750
But we still have
essentially a reversion back

01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:47.250
to the CFR courts in
criminal practice.

01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:51.550
And there it's very difficult,
because you have individuals

01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:55.050
who are asserting due
process rights that

01:26:55.050 --> 01:26:58.070
flow from the United
States Constitution

01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:59.700
and the Bill of Rights.

01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:04.170
And you have an adversarial
system on the one hand.

01:27:04.170 --> 01:27:09.160
And oftentimes, that adversarial
system in the criminal process

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:12.030
flows into the civil process.

01:27:12.030 --> 01:27:16.650
It does that in particular
situations where

01:27:16.650 --> 01:27:20.300
you have individual
judges, frankly,

01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:22.620
who are used to
that sort of system.

01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:26.110
They revert back to the
systems that they're used to.

01:27:26.110 --> 01:27:29.340
Oftentimes they come
from state courts,

01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:33.600
or county courts, city courts,
who come out to practice law.

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.180
And so there's this
tension between how

01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:41.120
do you adhere to the
common practices of custom

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:46.620
and tradition in resolving
interfamily disputes,

01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:51.540
and still pay attention
to the individual right?

01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:55.130
So I will tell you that
there are these tensions that

01:27:55.130 --> 01:28:00.460
have developed, because
of course our societies,

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:04.790
like many tribal
societies, are changing.

01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:09.020
And so people value their goods,
people value their property.

01:28:12.030 --> 01:28:15.950
And one of the
areas that started

01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:20.150
to emerge when I left
the court back in 2007

01:28:20.150 --> 01:28:23.730
was the introduction of
the concept of wills.

01:28:23.730 --> 01:28:29.490
Well, if you have this body of
traditional and customary law

01:28:29.490 --> 01:28:35.220
that addresses property
distribution, especially

01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:40.810
homesteads, agricultural,
farming land, livestock grazing

01:28:40.810 --> 01:28:47.020
areas, and you have
individuals who have grown up

01:28:47.020 --> 01:28:52.840
in today's society who have
been taught that ownership,

01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:56.970
property, possession
is a valued thing,

01:28:56.970 --> 01:29:00.872
the two are always going
to come in tension.

01:29:00.872 --> 01:29:02.580
There's this tension
that's automatically

01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:05.350
built in to the argument.

01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:07.800
So those are some
of the struggles

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:11.810
that I think the modern day
courts are going to deal with.

01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:14.520
I want to move really
quickly and sort of talk

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.700
about the role of judging.

01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:19.620
As you can see here, in
the Hopi tribal court,

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:24.130
it is a unilateral
system of government.

01:29:24.130 --> 01:29:27.260
There are only two court
systems, the trial court

01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:29.710
and the appellate court, and
the ultimate decision maker

01:29:29.710 --> 01:29:31.290
is the Tribal Council.

01:29:31.290 --> 01:29:35.180
But I have yet to see the
tribal council overturn

01:29:35.180 --> 01:29:39.190
an appellate court decision.

01:29:39.190 --> 01:29:42.020
The tribes, like many tribes
throughout the United States,

01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:43.920
they have broad
civil jurisdiction

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:48.610
to address things that
occur to the extent

01:29:48.610 --> 01:29:53.110
that it hasn't been eroded,
as Richard well knows.

01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:56.330
There is still limited
criminal jurisdiction

01:29:56.330 --> 01:29:59.950
as a result of the Major Crimes
Act, the Assimilative Crimes

01:29:59.950 --> 01:30:04.980
Act, Oliphant, Duro
versus Reina decisions.

01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:08.490
And tribal judges primarily,
on the Hopi court,

01:30:08.490 --> 01:30:13.320
have to wear the hat of a
mediator, an arbitrator,

01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:18.210
and ultimately a decision
maker, in many instances.

01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:21.210
But in the US Court
system, as you know,

01:30:21.210 --> 01:30:24.630
it's very circumscribed.

01:30:24.630 --> 01:30:27.900
We have the Supreme
Court precedent

01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:28.990
that we have to apply.

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:32.490
We have, in my case, the
Ninth Circuit precedent

01:30:32.490 --> 01:30:35.210
that you have to apply.

01:30:35.210 --> 01:30:37.680
We are limited
jurisdiction courts,

01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:41.170
so we only can hear
matters of diversity

01:30:41.170 --> 01:30:45.770
over a particular amount,
a constitutional question.

01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:49.640
We are very rule-
and process-oriented.

01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:52.860
And of course, we are always
subject to appellate review,

01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:55.600
whereas in the Hopi
instance, as I mentioned,

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:59.880
the ultimate decision maker
is the Hopi Tribal Council.

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:07.320
And so the issues in
being a tribal court

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:10.310
judge versus a
federal court judge

01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:13.480
are really very different.

01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:16.870
In the tribal court systems,
when I was an appellate court

01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:21.880
judge, you really had
to balance thinking

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:28.710
about the preservation of
custom and tradition because

01:31:28.710 --> 01:31:36.620
of its impact not just to
the individual case, or even

01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:42.200
the individual claim, but
beyond that, the impact

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:46.870
to the society in the
particular village or the clan,

01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:52.120
and the existence of the
Hopi tribe as a whole.

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:55.310
In the federal courts, I
would say, in many instances,

01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:58.690
it's much easier,
because you're only

01:31:58.690 --> 01:32:00.740
focused on the case
in front of you,

01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:04.640
only focused on the
individual's rights and claims.

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:10.100
And the law, for the
most part, will guide you

01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:13.750
as to how the outcome should be.

01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:18.540
And so in some very real
ways, tribal judging

01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:23.690
is very difficult in
comparison to judging

01:32:23.690 --> 01:32:26.680
in state or federal courts.

01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:33.980
I want to end by talking about
some of what Richard mentioned.

01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:37.020
And this has to do with
the coordinated need

01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:44.550
for examining, consulting,
and coordinating discussions

01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:48.720
and understanding of the
role of federal courts

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:50.790
in Indian communities.

01:32:50.790 --> 01:32:57.720
I think back to my experiences
as both a lawyer in the Senate

01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:03.800
Indian Affairs Committee, as
a US attorney for the District

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:07.210
of Arizona, and now as a judge.

01:33:07.210 --> 01:33:10.840
And one of the observations
I have always made--

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:14.890
and I'm glad to see that
the tide has changed

01:33:14.890 --> 01:33:20.970
with organizations such as NARF
and the Supreme Court Project.

01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:25.240
But for the longest time,
and as a very young lawyer,

01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:27.940
I was always in federal court.

01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:31.950
And I knew in our
courthouse there

01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:36.350
were a variety of issues being
discussed that directly impact

01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:43.710
if not an Indian family, but
activity in Indian communities.

01:33:43.710 --> 01:33:50.430
And frankly, there
were very few times

01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:55.040
when I would see tribal
leaders, Indian individuals,

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:58.730
organizations, appearing
at those arguments.

01:33:58.730 --> 01:34:01.330
And it always dawned
on me that there

01:34:01.330 --> 01:34:04.740
needed to be some
attention paid to what

01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:07.460
was going on in these courts.

01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:10.080
And so as the US Attorney,
one of the policies

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:14.830
that I implemented in my office
was that every Indian country

01:34:14.830 --> 01:34:20.260
case, we were going to transmit
the outcome in a short press

01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:25.190
release to the tribal
nation that it involved.

01:34:25.190 --> 01:34:28.960
And it was an
interesting comment

01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:31.680
that I received from one
of the tribal leaders

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:36.461
that we were meeting with
shortly after the policy began.

01:34:36.461 --> 01:34:37.960
And he said, you
know, you've really

01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:40.240
created a dilemma for us.

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:41.960
And I said, well,
I don't understand.

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:44.670
He goes, you know those press
releases that you send out?

01:34:44.670 --> 01:34:46.840
He said, we really don't
know what to do with them.

01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:50.000
The tribal council sometimes
wants to put them out

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.780
to the community, and
sometimes they don't.

01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:54.520
And so we're debating that.

01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:57.430
And I thought, well, at
least they're debating it.

01:34:57.430 --> 01:35:01.240
So they understood the
reach of the federal court

01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:02.320
in their community.

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.610
That was my goal.

01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:07.200
And I don't know that
that's being done today.

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:11.960
But one of the things
I think about often,

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:14.280
on the federal
bench, every day we

01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:18.020
receive a bulletin from the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:21.620
And it's remarkable
the number of cases

01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:23.340
involving Indian community.

01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:26.690
I, of course, am in the Ninth
Circuit, Arizona, California,

01:35:26.690 --> 01:35:32.010
Alaska, Washington, Idaho,
all along that western edge

01:35:32.010 --> 01:35:34.040
of the United States.

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.970
And our federal
court systems today

01:35:36.970 --> 01:35:40.630
are being asked
to examine what it

01:35:40.630 --> 01:35:44.550
means to be an Indian,
in the Bryant case just

01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:50.440
argued in the Supreme Court
about a week and a half ago.

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:54.060
I'm seeing decisions from
the Ninth Circuit courts,

01:35:54.060 --> 01:36:00.550
district courts in California,
about claims of disenrollment

01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:02.720
in various tribes.

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:06.370
Federal courts are being asked
to answer those questions.

01:36:06.370 --> 01:36:09.690
Federal courts are being
involved in disputes

01:36:09.690 --> 01:36:15.200
about gaming between tribes.

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:16.510
It just goes on and on.

01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:20.240
Water rights, breach
of contract when

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:22.370
tribal governments
enter into contracts

01:36:22.370 --> 01:36:24.720
with non-Indian entities.

01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:37.650
So I think that in future,
these cases will only increase.

01:36:37.650 --> 01:36:41.750
And the need to at least
talk about and understand

01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:44.970
the reach of federal courts
in Indian communities,

01:36:44.970 --> 01:36:49.870
and the impact to tribal
members, is really important.

01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:52.280
And so I want to applaud
NARF and the work

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:55.810
that Richard and John and
others are doing on that level.

01:36:55.810 --> 01:36:57.800
So I think I've
gone over my time,

01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:00.308
and I'd like to just end there.

01:37:00.308 --> 01:37:06.880
[APPLAUSE]

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:11.300
-Thank you so very much to our
panelists for THAT incredibly

01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:14.360
rich discussion of
tribal courts, state

01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:18.400
courts, federal courts,
and Indian law generally.

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:22.840
I'd like to open it up for
audience questions now.

01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:27.710
And as Dean Cohen mentioned,
though, the custom at Radcliffe

01:37:27.710 --> 01:37:30.950
is there is a microphone
positioned in that center

01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:31.970
aisle.

01:37:31.970 --> 01:37:35.800
So if you have a question,
please collect your thoughts

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:38.450
and bring yourself up
to that microphone.

01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:40.870
And I can see a line is forming.

01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:43.580
And if you could start
by-- oh, a wonderful line.

01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:46.380
If you could start by
introducing yourself

01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:49.460
and then by asking
your question.

01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:55.430
And all panelists here will
try and take a swing at it.

01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:58.310
But thank you so much for all
of this amazing participation.

01:37:58.310 --> 01:38:02.460
I'm so glad to see this has
generated so many questions.

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:03.400
-Hello.

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:05.620
My name is Kelly Dennis.

01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:08.620
I'm from the Shinnecock
tribe across the water.

01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:11.450
I'm actually here with my
cousin [? Tiala ?] and Matt.

01:38:11.450 --> 01:38:15.070
We drove all night to get
here, also a tribe member.

01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:19.790
And also my cousin
[INAUDIBLE] is also here,

01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:23.470
and she's more fortunate
that she's more local.

01:38:23.470 --> 01:38:28.650
And we're also from
the [INAUDIBLE] tribe

01:38:28.650 --> 01:38:32.480
out here in Grafton,
Massachusetts.

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:35.210
So on behalf of all us, we want
to say [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

01:38:35.210 --> 01:38:41.480
to the panelists and to you,
and also [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],

01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:43.460
welcome everyone.

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:47.200
And [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH], hello.

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:52.336
So my question's, I
guess, to Richard Guest.

01:38:52.336 --> 01:38:53.960
Well, first of all,
thank you, Richard,

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:59.480
so much for being the counsel
of record on our land claim

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:02.210
petition to the Supreme Court.

01:39:02.210 --> 01:39:04.990
It's been a huge endeavor
and we definitely

01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:09.910
couldn't have done it
without NARF helping us.

01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:12.434
My cousin and I
also, we're attorneys

01:39:12.434 --> 01:39:13.850
working for the
tribe, and then we

01:39:13.850 --> 01:39:16.110
have our nonprofit
that we're continuing

01:39:16.110 --> 01:39:19.460
to do work for the tribe.

01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:24.400
And so my question,
first, is, I don't

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:28.410
know if you really
touched on current events

01:39:28.410 --> 01:39:30.600
with the passing
of Justice Scalia

01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:36.040
and how that may affect
the current court

01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:38.970
decisions at the
Supreme Court level

01:39:38.970 --> 01:39:43.700
with potential Native
American cases.

01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:51.630
And also in the case that
President Obama, his nominee

01:39:51.630 --> 01:39:54.980
Judge Garland is able to get
placed in the Supreme Court,

01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:58.690
if you see any potential
impacts happening there.

01:39:58.690 --> 01:40:06.130
And then also another question
is, I really appreciate

01:40:06.130 --> 01:40:10.670
the overview of the
Indian Reorganization Act

01:40:10.670 --> 01:40:15.490
and the Constitution
that has pretty much been

01:40:15.490 --> 01:40:16.810
imposed on tribes.

01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:22.300
And what's kind of
been the unfortunate

01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:28.550
trend is that we do, with
the native communities,

01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:33.980
want to be able to still
reflect our traditional values.

01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:37.230
And yet we tend
to still, anyway,

01:40:37.230 --> 01:40:40.610
adopt these IRA-looking
constitutions with just one

01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:42.700
tribal council because
that just seems to be

01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:45.560
the thing that everyone has.

01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:52.850
But I was wondering if you might
be able to give some insight as

01:40:52.850 --> 01:40:56.110
to a path to constitutional
reform for IRA Constitution

01:40:56.110 --> 01:40:58.541
tribes, to Diane.

01:40:58.541 --> 01:41:00.040
Thank you so much
for your question.

01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:01.581
I just want to make
a quick executive

01:41:01.581 --> 01:41:03.080
decision because
we're low on time

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:04.660
and there is quite the line.

01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:07.430
I'm wondering if we could
collect a few questions,

01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:13.470
and then the panel will address
them en masse, or selectively.

01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:14.790
So thank you very much.

01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:17.570
If the next person
could come on.

01:41:17.570 --> 01:41:19.650
-Hello, my name is Irene Bedard.

01:41:19.650 --> 01:41:22.910
I'm President CEO of Sleeping
Lady Films, Waking Giants

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:27.860
Productions, and I'm going
to be on a panel later.

01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:32.710
I actually have two questions.

01:41:32.710 --> 01:41:42.890
The recent VAWA reauthorization
also included some, I guess,

01:41:42.890 --> 01:41:47.450
jurisdictional rights over
non-Native individuals.

01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:52.300
And I wondered how that is
playing out in the Tribal Law

01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:56.730
and Order Act, along with
another question I have

01:41:56.730 --> 01:41:59.450
about our international
sovereignty

01:41:59.450 --> 01:42:03.700
rights that came up with
the World Indigenous Forum

01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:08.770
semi-recently, and how
that is affecting some

01:42:08.770 --> 01:42:10.030
of our international status.

01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:10.530
Thank you.

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:15.880
-Good morning.

01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:17.180
My name is Rosalind LaPier.

01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:19.210
I teach at the
University of Montana

01:42:19.210 --> 01:42:21.410
in the Environmental
Studies department.

01:42:21.410 --> 01:42:24.080
But I've also worked
for the past 25 plus

01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:27.230
years with Native
language revitalization.

01:42:27.230 --> 01:42:31.016
So my question is
related to NALA.

01:42:31.016 --> 01:42:32.640
So that's the Native
American Languages

01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:35.710
Act that was passed in 1990.

01:42:35.710 --> 01:42:37.340
Part of the
provisions of NALA was

01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:41.650
to allow for native children
to basically do three things.

01:42:41.650 --> 01:42:44.310
One is to express themselves
in their native languages,

01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:46.160
to be educated in
their native languages,

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:49.110
and to also be assessed
in their native languages.

01:42:49.110 --> 01:42:51.380
So the past 25
plus years there's

01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:53.950
been a group of native
language schools

01:42:53.950 --> 01:42:56.590
that has been working on
the third piece, which is

01:42:56.590 --> 01:42:58.020
assessment, and that's testing.

01:43:00.990 --> 01:43:03.346
People who are part
of the native language

01:43:03.346 --> 01:43:04.720
revitalization
movement have been

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:10.940
working towards having the
federal government allow

01:43:10.940 --> 01:43:13.700
tribes and communities
to assess or test

01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:15.100
in their own native languages.

01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:17.130
So the question
is, how can we get

01:43:17.130 --> 01:43:19.440
NALA, which is a policy
that already exists,

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:22.330
it's already on the books, don't
need to create a new policy.

01:43:22.330 --> 01:43:25.720
How can we get it implemented,
fully implemented,

01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:26.640
across the board?

01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:34.190
And how do we get the USDE--
USDE to implement that policy?

01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:38.840
-Hi.

01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:41.040
My name is Leland [INAUDIBLE].

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:44.590
I'm a community member
in Los Angeles County.

01:43:44.590 --> 01:43:47.540
And I'm also part of
the ICWA Task Force

01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:50.650
there, the Indian Child
Welfare Act task force there.

01:43:50.650 --> 01:43:54.320
And I also was part of
the Baby Veronica case,

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:58.020
an adult adoptee, the
amicus brief there.

01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:02.500
And I'm also Navajo in
Santo Domingo pueblo.

01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:08.110
And my question is regarding
more along the adoption

01:44:08.110 --> 01:44:12.050
line and the foster care
line, such as the Lexi

01:44:12.050 --> 01:44:15.690
case, the Alexandria P. Case
that happened in Los Angeles

01:44:15.690 --> 01:44:17.110
County recently.

01:44:17.110 --> 01:44:22.940
And I would like, I guess,
from a judge's perspective--

01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:26.320
so this is more
for you-- what you

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:29.060
think about these cases
coming within your district

01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:32.160
since you are part of
the Ninth District.

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:40.210
And also, I guess, the
gentleman's, his perspective

01:44:40.210 --> 01:44:45.500
as far as how they
kind of go along there.

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:48.715
So that's kind of my
wonderment, I guess.

01:44:48.715 --> 01:44:50.750
Thank you.

01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:52.760
-So we're going to--
that was quite the list.

01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:55.070
We're going to try and give
a few answers to these,

01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:57.236
and hopefully we'll have a
bit more time at the end.

01:45:01.650 --> 01:45:03.281
I think they might just be on.

01:45:03.281 --> 01:45:04.030
-They might be on.

01:45:04.030 --> 01:45:10.520
Why don't you go ahead,
Judge, and talk about ICWA,

01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:11.840
or any of them.

01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:15.990
-Well, I did want to mention,
and I failed to mention,

01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:20.125
that I am aware of the
provisions in the Tribal Law

01:45:20.125 --> 01:45:22.500
and Order Act and the
Violence Against Women Act.

01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:24.750
And the Tribal Law
and Order Act provides

01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:27.320
an opportunity for
tribes to expand

01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:31.080
into having federal
criminal authorities up

01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:34.730
to a certain extent,
essentially doing

01:45:34.730 --> 01:45:37.820
a bit more beyond the
Indian Civil Rights

01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:41.830
Act, which requires
tribes only to implement

01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:45.530
a one-year penalty.

01:45:45.530 --> 01:45:49.190
And the Tribal Law and
Order Act provides tribes,

01:45:49.190 --> 01:45:52.120
if they meet certain
criteria, which

01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:58.680
are predominantly due
process, right to be heard,

01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:01.730
the right to be represented
by legal counsel,

01:46:01.730 --> 01:46:09.310
and judges who are law
trained, and a number

01:46:09.310 --> 01:46:16.170
of other certifications, if
you will, or requirements.

01:46:16.170 --> 01:46:20.700
And about, which I'm not
all that familiar with,

01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:28.820
also provides an opportunity for
tribes to essentially-- well,

01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:32.170
I should say, for the
federal government

01:46:32.170 --> 01:46:39.020
to use tribal convictions
related to domestic violence

01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:40.880
or partner abuse.

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:43.310
It's essentially a
three strikes provision

01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:51.080
that the federal prosecutor
can use those prior convictions

01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:56.990
as a basis for a federal
charge of domestic violence.

01:46:56.990 --> 01:47:01.950
And that is currently one of the
cases that is being considered

01:47:01.950 --> 01:47:06.590
by the Supreme Court is what
those prior tribal court

01:47:06.590 --> 01:47:08.500
convictions have to look like.

01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:14.430
And so I do know that there
are a couple of tribes,

01:47:14.430 --> 01:47:17.560
one particular in Arizona,
the Pascua Yaqui Tribe,

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:22.560
which is a quote, VAWA certified
tribe, which essentially--

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:27.330
basically it operates like
a municipal court or a city

01:47:27.330 --> 01:47:30.270
court.

01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:33.680
Everything looks like if you
walked into the Pasqua Yaqui,

01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:38.070
except that you're on
the tribe's nation land--

01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:40.490
it looks like a city court.

01:47:40.490 --> 01:47:44.570
So they're exercising
that jurisdiction.

01:47:44.570 --> 01:47:52.785
I know that Hopi, back in 2011,
voted to adopt the Tribal Law

01:47:52.785 --> 01:47:55.580
and Order provisions.

01:47:55.580 --> 01:48:00.540
And what that did, really,
was it created some tension,

01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:06.620
because the Hopi tribe
used to have the ability

01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:09.850
to have non-lawyer
judges who spoke

01:48:09.850 --> 01:48:15.080
Hopi, who were well-versed
in custom and tradition.

01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:18.390
And now a number of
those individuals

01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:22.940
have to be replaced
by law trained judges.

01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:27.240
And of course, being
as small as we are,

01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:29.790
there aren't a whole
lot of law trained

01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:35.140
Hopi who are willing to
be judges in Hopi court.

01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:37.750
And so there's a bit
of a tension going on.

01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:43.410
And so I think that, depending
on what type of court

01:48:43.410 --> 01:48:46.500
you come from or what kind
of community you come from,

01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:50.550
those communities do have
to make the decision whether

01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:55.030
or not to change
their existing models

01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:59.400
to meet the requirements of
[? Taloa ?] and the Violence

01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:01.050
Against Women Act.

01:49:01.050 --> 01:49:03.050
That's the only thing
I'll say about that,

01:49:03.050 --> 01:49:06.510
and maybe Richard has
something to say about it.

01:49:06.510 --> 01:49:08.711
-Well, I would start
with the first questions

01:49:08.711 --> 01:49:09.460
that were put out.

01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:13.575
Scalia not being on the
court, a good thing.

01:49:13.575 --> 01:49:15.200
I won't say his death
was a good thing.

01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:19.130
I was nowhere Near West
Texas on February 13.

01:49:19.130 --> 01:49:20.630
But it was a good thing.

01:49:20.630 --> 01:49:23.180
We're hoping what would
have been potentially

01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:27.060
a landmark Indian law case
in the Dollar General case

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:31.390
would have fundamentally changed
the way in which tribes have

01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:33.800
authority over
non-Indians who do

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:37.660
harm on Indian reservations
to Indian people

01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:39.910
would've changed with
Scalia on the court.

01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:41.300
I firmly believe that.

01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:44.430
With his absence, were
hoping for a four-four split

01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:48.740
and an affirmance of the
lower appellate court.

01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:51.880
With respect to Garland,
jury's still out.

01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:56.140
He was not good for us at the
DC Circuit, generally speaking,

01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:58.800
a specific case in particular
I won't get into, but one that

01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:01.770
an issue that's going to be up
at the Supreme Court next year

01:50:01.770 --> 01:50:02.900
more than likely.

01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:08.040
Two cert petitions
pending on those issues.

01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.160
And there is a whole effort.

01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:12.960
Although a tribe maybe
under an IRA constitution,

01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:14.590
there are opportunities today.

01:50:14.590 --> 01:50:17.919
Tribes can reform
their constitutions.

01:50:17.919 --> 01:50:18.960
They have that authority.

01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:21.510
They don't need to
rely on the BIA.

01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:24.965
The BIA has actually, I
believe, removed that provision

01:50:24.965 --> 01:50:27.340
that requires tribes to go
seek their approval if they've

01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:29.360
adopted an IRA constitution.

01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:32.220
However, it's very difficult
to do in the community

01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:36.700
because there are vested rights
now in particular families

01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:39.650
within the tribal
communities with respect

01:50:39.650 --> 01:50:40.730
to making any changes.

01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:46.440
With WAWA authorization
and native languages,

01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:49.810
I would defer to John
Dossett in the next panel

01:50:49.810 --> 01:50:51.990
to revisit those
questions in terms

01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:57.930
of where we are with the
implementation of both

01:50:57.930 --> 01:50:58.700
of those.

01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:02.780
I would tell you that during
the Dollar General argument,

01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:05.910
Justice Kennedy was very
forceful in his questions

01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:10.580
slash remarks, where he
was asking the advocates,

01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:13.570
where does Congress
get this authority?

01:51:13.570 --> 01:51:15.530
He wasn't asking, where
do Indian tribes get

01:51:15.530 --> 01:51:18.390
this authority to exercise
jurisdiction over non-Indians,

01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:20.350
but where would Congress
get this authority

01:51:20.350 --> 01:51:23.020
to extend jurisdiction,
whether it

01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:26.370
be criminal or civil or other?

01:51:26.370 --> 01:51:29.430
So it's something
we're exploring,

01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:32.570
we're examining to see where
it might be going with that.

01:51:32.570 --> 01:51:36.020
And then thank you
for your contribution

01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:37.930
with the Baby Veronica case.

01:51:37.930 --> 01:51:41.900
That had to be one of the
most disappointing outcomes.

01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:43.360
The statute was clear.

01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:45.550
The discussion by
Justice Alito of blood

01:51:45.550 --> 01:51:48.900
quantum in the very first
paragraph of his opinion,

01:51:48.900 --> 01:51:50.230
very, very disturbing.

01:51:50.230 --> 01:51:54.470
As Judge Humetewa said,
what we're seeing now

01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:57.650
in the courts is, we're
getting back to a place

01:51:57.650 --> 01:52:03.630
where the discussion is about
who's an Indian, you know?

01:52:03.630 --> 01:52:08.670
This was what the discussion
was back in the 1930s and 1940s.

01:52:08.670 --> 01:52:11.190
Who are Indian tribes?

01:52:11.190 --> 01:52:14.130
We had a disturbing decision
at the Supreme Court

01:52:14.130 --> 01:52:18.160
in the Carcieri case, after
Governor Carcieri Rhode Island,

01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:23.510
that may influence
outcomes down the line

01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:26.840
if we don't get a
legislative fix, that

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:28.490
really addressed that question.

01:52:28.490 --> 01:52:29.590
Who's an Indian?

01:52:29.590 --> 01:52:31.390
Who gets to decide
who's an Indian?

01:52:31.390 --> 01:52:33.000
What's an Indian tribes?

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.040
Are those Indian
tribes really sovereign

01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:38.620
if they're put together of
different groups of Indians

01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:42.890
onto a reservation, and we call
it a confederation of tribes?

01:52:42.890 --> 01:52:44.260
What real authority is there?

01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:47.560
And there's been this dynamic
within the United States

01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:50.470
government, like I said before,
between self-determination

01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:52.010
and termination.

01:52:52.010 --> 01:52:54.310
It still exists inside
the federal government.

01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:56.440
It hasn't gone anywhere.

01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:59.130
It's just underneath
the surface.

01:52:59.130 --> 01:53:01.440
-So we are incredibly
grateful for all

01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:03.400
of the audience
participation and interest,

01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:05.710
but we are out of time.

01:53:05.710 --> 01:53:08.760
So join me in thanking our
panelist, and thanks again.

01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:10.310
[APPLAUSE]
