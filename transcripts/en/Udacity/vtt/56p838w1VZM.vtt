00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
We've put lots of effort into our algorithm to make it 10 times faster

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.710
and we have gained only very little in terms of input size that we can handle.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.650
Now, what if we were even bolder and had an algorithm that was a 100 times faster.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.010
Imagine a 100 times--imagine your computer booting up a 100 times faster that it does today

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.610
or your computer game not running at 30 frames per second but at 3000 frames per second,

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.810
so 100 times faster--shoot speedup.

00:00:27.810 --> 99:59:59.000
What input size can we handle now?
