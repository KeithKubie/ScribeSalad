00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For this problem, imagine that we have a skier on this really steep slope

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that's 90 meters tall and he comes to this ramp of height 10 meters

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that makes an angle α with the ground.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I want you to tell me using your knowledge of energy and two dimensional motion

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
how far away from the ramp will the skier land--what's this distance d?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Measured from where the skier lands to the bottom of the of ramp when he took off.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Put your answer here and use 30 degrees for α and use 10 m/s²  for g

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
rather than 9.8 just so we're all in the same page.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now, you may end up having to use the quadratic equation in this problem.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If you're out of practice with this or maybe you never learned it,

00:00:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
check for links in the description for help on how to use the quadratic equation to solve this problem.
