00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.560
All right, awesome,
I get to tell you about coco values.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.070
So coco stands for
cooperative-competitive values.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.110
&gt;&gt; Coco stands for that?

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.320
&gt;&gt; Well, the coco part of coco value
stands for cooperative-competitive.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.868
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:13.031
&gt;&gt; And this is an idea due to Kalai and

00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:16.430
Kalai because you need as
many of those as you can get.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.220
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.760
&gt;&gt; Here is an example
of coco values that

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.220
feature some people
that you may recognize.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.650
So this is Curly and
Smooth and the bananas.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.500
So Curly and
Smooth would like to get bananas,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.850
turns out Curly is too
short to get any bananas.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.580
&gt;&gt; So true.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.010
&gt;&gt; And Smooth is tall
enough to get two bananas.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.718
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's very.

00:00:35.718 --> 00:00:39.550
&gt;&gt; But if Smooth stood on top of Curly's
head, then he could actually get four

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.130
bananas, he could reach these
two additional high bananas.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.120
&gt;&gt; So it's like a Tuesday.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.200
&gt;&gt; So
let's set this up as a matrix game.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.510
Here's a matrix version of the game.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.470
So this is suggest to you and
you have two choices.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.454
You can just reach for
the bananas yourself, or

00:00:52.454 --> 00:00:55.325
you could stand on the top of my
head and reach the other bananas.

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:56.520
&gt;&gt; So you're my friend in this.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.160
&gt;&gt; Sorry, Curly,
you can stand on the top of Curly.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.985
Not you, I mean Smooth can
stand on top of Curly's head.

00:01:00.985 --> 00:01:02.324
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:02.324 --> 00:01:07.409
&gt;&gt; And Curly has the choice of either
[LAUGH] allowing that to happen or

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.680
not, okay.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.750
&gt;&gt; I like this game.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.959
Believe it or not, I did not make this
up for the purposes of this class.

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:17.020
And so
we can ask some questions about this.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.486
So for example, what's the nash?

00:01:19.486 --> 00:01:21.070
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, you're actually
asking me [LAUGH] what the nash is?

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.030
I guess I should-
&gt;&gt; It's a rhetorical question,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.320
except it's not rhetorical.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.860
It's just a question.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.480
&gt;&gt; Pure nash?

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.810
&gt;&gt; If you can find one, sure.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.080
&gt;&gt; Okay, well, is there a pure nash?

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.470
I mean, I've just seen these numbers for
the first time.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you shouldn't.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.670
Okay, sure.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.250
&gt;&gt; So I can just ask the question,
all right so, if we do don't boost and

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.640
reach, would either want to move?

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.490
Well, it doesn't really matter
if you go from reach to climb.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.550
You get the same value.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.080
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.410
it doesn't matter if-
&gt;&gt; No, wait.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.494
No, you, sorry, you, right, you, Smooth.

00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:54.484
It doesn't matter to Smooth-
&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter to Smooth once if

00:01:54.484 --> 00:01:58.437
you're in don't boost, reach, and
if you're in don't boost, reach,

00:01:58.437 --> 00:02:00.220
it also doesn't, wait.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.260
No, I'm sorry, I take that back.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.940
&gt;&gt; It does matter.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.810
&gt;&gt; It does matter,
I'm reading the numbers backwards.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.020
So, the first one is for Curly, and
the second number's for Smooth.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.500
&gt;&gt; See, I put them in the same order
as there, where they're standing.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.509
&gt;&gt; That makes perfect sense.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.670
So if you have 0,2, so then if we're
stuck on don't boost and Smooth can move

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.860
from reach to climb, Smooth would not do
that because you're going from 2 to 0.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.725
Meanwhile, if we're in don't boost,
reach, and Curly can change,

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:24.700
then Curly would go from 0 to 0.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.310
And it doesn't really make a difference.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.500
I guess don't boost and
reach is a Nash equilibrium.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.841
So, let's see, I think there's probably
there's a symmetry thing there.

00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:38.122
So we know don't boost and
climb is not a Nash equilibrium.

00:02:38.122 --> 00:02:40.995
For the same reason that 0,
2 is one, 0, 0 is not,

00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:43.910
because I'd be going from
0 to 2 if I were Smooth.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.976
So there's no point in
worrying about that.

00:02:44.976 --> 00:02:46.460
What about boost and reach?

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.398
Well, let's see.

00:02:47.398 --> 00:02:51.370
That's 0, 2, and so
Curly doesn't need to move,

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.370
doesn't have an advantage to
moving from boost to don't boost.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.720
But Smooth would want to move because
you'd be going from 2 to 4, so

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.732
that is not Nash equilibrium.

00:02:59.732 --> 00:03:01.490
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Now let's look at boost and climb, so

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.060
boost and climb, let's see, it's 0, 4.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.800
So if I went from boost to don't boost,
I would still stay at 0, and

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.430
so that doesn't help Curly any.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.500
And I wouldn't move from climb to reach
because I'd be going from 4 to 2, and

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.110
so therefore, that is also a Nash.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.970
&gt;&gt; All right, now,

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.230
which Nash equilibrium do you
think would be more beneficial?

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.040
&gt;&gt; Well for Smooth,
it would definitely be boost and climb.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
What about for like the society of these

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.710
two people, like if you just add
up the total retrieved bananas?

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.100
&gt;&gt; So that would be 2 versus 4.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So in fact again, boost and

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.240
climb would be,
on average, more benefit.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.360
&gt;&gt; On average.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.490
&gt;&gt; Or the sum for the society.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.
&gt;&gt; So on average is all the same thing.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.760
&gt;&gt; Right, but it sort of doesn't matter
to Curly, but it would matter to Smooth,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.550
and it's also the case that to Nash,
it doesn't really matter.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.850
Both of these are Nash equilibrium, so

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.248
they're both perfectly acceptable from a
Nash equilibrium sort of point of view.

00:03:55.248 --> 00:03:57.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is like the example
that I did with chicken,

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.476
where you have two Nash equilibrium, and

00:03:59.476 --> 00:04:02.228
they're both kind of equally
good from Nash's point of view.

00:04:02.228 --> 00:04:03.428
Although in that case,

00:04:03.428 --> 00:04:07.290
they're very different from
the two players' point of view.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.600
Here, I suppose either way,
Curly gets nothing.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.570
So really,
it's just about making Smooth happy.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.669
I like this game.

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.420
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So okay, sure, fine.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.180
So that being said, can we see
anything about correlated equilibria?

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.269
&gt;&gt; I mean, I'm sure we can, right?

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.647
We can, any makes Nash equilibrium
is a correlated equilibrium, but

00:04:24.647 --> 00:04:27.520
I think this one's a little
different right here, right?

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.820
Because no matter what happens,
Curly gets 0.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.800
&gt;&gt; So that means that anything's
going to be equally okay to Curly.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.660
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So Curly is not really

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.020
going to participate in
the equilibriumness or lack thereof.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.020
&gt;&gt; Right, so really, this is all about
getting to boosting and climbing.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.889
&gt;&gt; Yeah, though I think you said that
any convex combination of a Nash

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.710
is a correlated equilibrium.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.251
&gt;&gt; That's right.
&gt;&gt; So it should be everything like 0, 2,

00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:59.410
0 to 1, 0 to 2, 0 to 3, 0 to 4, 0 to 5,
0 to 6, all the way up to 0, 3, 0,4.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.342
We know that all those have to be Nash,
correlated, they have to be a value of

00:05:04.342 --> 00:05:08.600
some correlated equilibrium
that is like 0, 3, for example.
