do the things we know it would do I
 

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:18.719
do the things we know it would do I
think that's particularly dangerous and

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729
think that's particularly dangerous and
 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.849
think that's particularly dangerous and
I think that it's difficult I mean I

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:20.859
I think that it's difficult I mean I
 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:22.230
I think that it's difficult I mean I
don't think that there's any coincidence

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240
don't think that there's any coincidence
 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.300
don't think that there's any coincidence
and the fact that our press freedoms are

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310
and the fact that our press freedoms are
 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.469
and the fact that our press freedoms are
one of the first things that our

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479
one of the first things that our
 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.239
one of the first things that our
founders enshrined in our Constitution I

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:27.249
founders enshrined in our Constitution I
 

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:28.649
founders enshrined in our Constitution I
think there's a reason for that because

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659
think there's a reason for that because
 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.539
think there's a reason for that because
what they saw through their own

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549
what they saw through their own
 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.029
what they saw through their own
experiences with their ability to tell

through the penny press or 0 through
 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.989
through the penny press or 0 through
spoken word what was what sparked their

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:39.999
spoken word what was what sparked their
 

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.639
spoken word what was what sparked their
revolution and they knew that

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649
revolution and they knew that
 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.609
revolution and they knew that
safeguarding that that potential in

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619
safeguarding that that potential in
 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.769
safeguarding that that potential in
those outlets were what would but one

00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:46.779
those outlets were what would but one
 

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:48.359
those outlets were what would but one
day give the United States of America

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369
day give the United States of America
 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.809
day give the United States of America
the capacity to deal with an existential

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819
the capacity to deal with an existential
 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.849
the capacity to deal with an existential
threat and I think that that's what we

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859
threat and I think that that's what we
 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.190
threat and I think that that's what we
face now is is the potential of having

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200
face now is is the potential of having
 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.709
face now is is the potential of having
our press so undermined then it can no

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719
our press so undermined then it can no
 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:59.929
our press so undermined then it can no

and we've seen this right we see then we
 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.069
and we've seen this right we see then we
seen this going back several years this

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079
seen this going back several years this
 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.529
seen this going back several years this
idea that somehow the media must be held

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539
idea that somehow the media must be held
 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.289
idea that somehow the media must be held
accountable instead of the elected

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299
accountable instead of the elected
 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:11.520
accountable instead of the elected
officials being held accountable we saw

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530
officials being held accountable we saw
 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.110

culture to attack messengers when the

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019
culture to attack messengers when the
 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.199
culture to attack messengers when the
message is something that makes us feel

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209
message is something that makes us feel
 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.839
message is something that makes us feel
uncomfortable so reporters who reported

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849
uncomfortable so reporters who reported
 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.250
uncomfortable so reporters who reported
on things like police shootings and race

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260
on things like police shootings and race
 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.500
on things like police shootings and race
and justice became the targets because

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510
and justice became the targets because
 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.030
and justice became the targets because
if only you could discredit them if you

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040
if only you could discredit them if you
 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.559
if only you could discredit them if you
could prove they had some vendetta or

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569
could prove they had some vendetta or
 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.360
could prove they had some vendetta or
some bias that they were they were

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370
some bias that they were they were
 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.640
some bias that they were they were
really just some liberal operative then

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650
really just some liberal operative then
 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.199
really just some liberal operative then
you didn't have to engage at all with

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209
you didn't have to engage at all with
 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.420
you didn't have to engage at all with
what they were saying and so what we've

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430
what they were saying and so what we've
 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.670
what they were saying and so what we've
seen is reporters being attacked

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680
seen is reporters being attacked
 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.050
seen is reporters being attacked
personally whether it be through threats

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060
personally whether it be through threats
 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.910
personally whether it be through threats
whether it be through their address is

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920
whether it be through their address is
 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.150
whether it be through their address is
being published whether it be through

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160
being published whether it be through
 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.619
being published whether it be through
smear campaigns trying to undermine

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629
smear campaigns trying to undermine
 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.229
smear campaigns trying to undermine
things people not approaching their work

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239
things people not approaching their work
 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.150
things people not approaching their work
or their correspondences in good faith

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160
or their correspondences in good faith
 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.979
or their correspondences in good faith
and again I think this is particularly

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989
and again I think this is particularly
 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.339
and again I think this is particularly
dangerous because it allows this

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349
dangerous because it allows this
 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.550
dangerous because it allows this
undermining of the norm of journalists

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560
undermining of the norm of journalists
 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.740
undermining of the norm of journalists
by and large being good people trying to

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750
by and large being good people trying to
 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.330
by and large being good people trying to
do good work who get it right more often

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340
do good work who get it right more often
 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.680
do good work who get it right more often
they get it wrong and that is the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690
they get it wrong and that is the
 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.360
they get it wrong and that is the
reality but when the public stops

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370
reality but when the public stops
 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.250
reality but when the public stops
believing that it's the reality it

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260
believing that it's the reality it
 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.780
believing that it's the reality it
raises real questions about our ability

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790
raises real questions about our ability
 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.850
raises real questions about our ability
to do our job
