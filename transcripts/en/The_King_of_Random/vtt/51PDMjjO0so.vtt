00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.489
After 2 solid weeks of hard labor, I created
this brand new workbench, King of random style.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.639
Blood and sweat went into making this bad
boy, so come along on my guided tour of how

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.519
I made it, and what it can do.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.500
I previously built a workbench prototype to
see what features I liked before I built,

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:31.019
the real deal. This upgraded version has easy
access electrical power, a built in router

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.320
station, high pressure air, and emergency
fire equipment. It's also got a huge surface

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.260
area for working on larger projects, and helps
guard against electrical ground faults.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.110
And did I mention the remote
controlled mood lighting? I needed a solid

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.360
work-bench, with built in power for electrical
experiments, and a router station, for wood

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.420
working projects. I couldn't find anything
like this at the local hardware store, so

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.530
I had to make one myself. I began by running
a 20 amp electrical cable underneath the floor

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.540
to power the bench from the underside, then
got started on building the frame out of 2x4's.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.660
I made some simple doors for the front and
back, screwed together a "torsion resistant"

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.680
table frame, then wired up the electrical
system with 20amp cable. Next, I reclaimed

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.110
the table top from my previous bench, and
chose to paint the whole thing "onyx black"

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.250
with a flat matt finish. The last steps were
to wire up the electrical for the different

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.200
lighting systems, then cut and bend some aluminum
trim for the edges. Now that it's all put

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.940
together, let me show you some of the extra
features. The electrical power starts with

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.720
this surge protected power bar. This is the
master switch for the entire project bench,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.159
and helps protect sensitive electronics from
power spikes. When the switch is off, there's

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.130
absolutely no power whatsoever. But with the
switch on, you can see that anything plugged

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.740
in, is fully functional. However, the power
stations all around the bench only work, if

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.330
this 20 amp cable is plugged in, and turned
on You can see the cable runs directly to

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.369
a secondary master switch which is activated
on a timer. This way, if the station is left

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.530
unattended, the power shuts off automatically
when the time runs out. The secondary switch

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.530
feeds power to a 20 amp GFCI. This monitors
for faults in all of the accessory outlets,

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.819
and can trip off the power instantly, if a
ground fault occurs. The GFCI runs in series

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.120
with 8 paralleled power outlets around the
bench. 6 of which are fitted with diamond

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.709
plated aluminum trim. I checked each connection
to make sure they were properly connected

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.170
and grounded, and you can see, the outlets
turn on or off with the flip of a switch.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.519
Now if you looked closely, you may have noticed
a hidden outlet on the underside of the table.

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.279
This one doesn't have a switch because it's
constantly hot, as long as the timer switch

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:43.379
is powered up. You probably saw that the edges,
are finished with diamond plated aluminum as well,

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.290
and secured in place with hundreds, of truss-head
screws. All of this aluminum trim was cut

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.139
from a 4x8 piece of sheet metal, using nothing
but a humble jigsaw. I fashioned a little

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:58.029
form for bending them to 90ยบ angles, out
of a length of 2x8 and an old door hinge.

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:02.939
As you can see, it did a pretty good job.
I built cabinet doors on the front and back,

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:07.849
which allow easy access to plenty of cabinet
space. The magnetic catches on the sides help

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.469
hold the doors securely in place, and you
might have noticed that I sanded the edges

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:16.109
to give them a slightly distressed look. Now,
if we take a look inside the cabinet areas,

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.989
you can see I lined the bottom with a plastic
runner. That's to make it look a little more

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.230
finished, and a bit easier to clean. I used
the built in router station from my last workbench,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.430
but this time I enclosed it in a wooden box,
and ran the router's power cable down through

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.680
the bottom, and into another outlet tucked
away at the top of the cabinet. This outlet

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.269
is controlled by a switch that you might be
able to see if you look to the top right of

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.329
the sign. The guarded switch operates the
router safely, and from a distance, and snaps

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.799
back to the off position to power down the
system on demand. The other switch operates

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.189
the backlighting, and you can see the forward
position turns one light on, while moving

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.229
the toggle switch to the back position will
activate them both, effectively doubling the

00:03:55.229 --> 00:04:00.140
light. I finished up by painting my bench
vise yellow, bolting it down with 4 inch lag

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.029
screws, and as you can tell, this isn't going
anywhere. I'm pretty excited about this work

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:11.129
space because it's over 6.5 feet long, 4 feet
wide, and just over 3 feet tall. A few other

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.939
features to see, are this plastic grommet
on the side of the bench, which gives easy

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:20.479
access to my air compressor, a fire extinguisher
station, and a custom lighted sign for effect.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.460
The back of the bench

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.360
is where I hid the dimmer switch, that gives
control of the LED sign lighting.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.480
The sign is simply bolted on hand tight. And fastened in place at each of the corners,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.600
with a decorative cap nut. This makes it easy to switch out at any time.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.360
Each inside  compartment has 2 puck lights hidden at the top, that light up the interior with the flick

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.099
of a finger. There's one last switch, between
the other two, that operates the LED strips

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.590
hidden behind the table trim. You can see
they cycle through 7 different colors, and

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.000
these lights are fully dimmable as well. The
coolest part is that they come with a remote

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.389
control. Well there you have it. The new "King
of Random" project station, which should make

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.400
dangerous experiments a little bit safer,
and hopefully do it in style. That's it for

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.380
now. If you liked this project, perhaps you'll
like some of my others. Check them out
