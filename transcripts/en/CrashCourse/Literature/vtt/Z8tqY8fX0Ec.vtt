Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature, and today we’re going to be

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.450
talking about Charlotte Bronte’s “Jane Eyre.”
It’s a classic! It says so right on the spine.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.590
Mr. Green! Mr. Green!
You sound like Dirty Harry.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.200
Yup, I got a cold, Me From the Past.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.920
Plus, it was just kind of a tubercular era, so I thought I
would try to capture it by bringing you my husky voice.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.280
Mr. Green! Mr. Green!
You sound like the voice of Death Itself.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.360
You know what, Me From the Past? I know that
you skipped school when you skinned your knee,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.280
but some of us are committed to learning.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.700
So “Jane Eyre” is full of wisdom, but
here’s an important lesson, all you Crash

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.259
Course viewers: If any of you decide to embark
on a career as a governess and you end up,

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.430
like, working for a mysterious stranger at
an isolated house tutoring his sexually precocious

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.170
illegitimate daughter and this mysterious
employer proposes marriage, take a walk up

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.120
to the attic. Because it is quite likely that
you are going to find an insane syphilitic

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.530
arsonist spouse locked up there. And that’s
going to be bad for your relationship.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:02.280
[Theme Music]

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.500
So “Jane Eyre” was one of the great successes

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.110
and scandals of the Victorian age, and as
soon as it was published in 1847, people began

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.210
trying to identify the author who wrote under
the alias Currer Bell.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.330
Ugly men of fashion gave themselves “Rochester
airs,” ladies adopted “Jane Eyre graces.”

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.920
Some critics decried the novel as dangerous and
anti-religious owing to its outspoken heroine.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.500
But no less a reader than Queen Victoria called it,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.520
“really a wonderful book, very peculiar in
parts, but so powerfully and admirably written.”

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.420
Stan, I can’t believe you gave
Queen Victoria that voice.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.540
It’s totally unfair to her.
She was a lovely monarch!

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.810
So Charlotte Brontë was born in 1816 into
a typical English family, except that pretty

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.409
much everyone was a literary genius and died
tragically young from tuberculosis and opium

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.429
and repressed desire. You know, it was Victorian
England.

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.100
As a child, Charlotte Brontë was sent away
to school with three of her sisters, two of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.340
whom died while in attendance. So Brontë
returned home and she and her surviving siblings

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.909
created the elaborate fictional worlds of
Gondal and Angria, full of intrigue and passion

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.310
and ridiculous names. Basically Harry Potter.
No, it wasn’t really like Harry Potter.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.729
It was more like all that extra Lord of the
Rings stuff, you know, like the Elvish dictionaries.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.069
Then Brontë became a schoolteacher and eventually
a governess, experiences that she drew on

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.790
while writing “Jane Eyre,” which she published
just after her sister Emily brought out “Wuthering

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.280
Heights” and just before her sister Anne
published “Agnes Grey,” all under male

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.810
pseudonyms of course.
Lest you think all Brontës were brilliant,

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.310
for the record, their brother Patrick was
a terrible writer. I feel a little bad saying

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.480
that because he died of tuberculosis and opium
overdose when he was just 31, but he had no

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.700
potential.
Anyway, Charlotte’s pseudonym was Currer

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.680
Bell and as she wrote to the novelist Elizabeth
Gaskell, she felt that the alias gave her

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.660
daring. If she relinquished it, she said,
“strength and courage would leave her and

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.020
she should ever after shrink from writing
the plain truth.”

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.660
Brontë lived long enough to publish three
more books and get married before dying at

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.709
the age of 38 from tuberculosis and complications
associated with pregnancy. Did everyone have

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.209
tuberculosis in 19th century England?
So, what actually happens in the story? Well,

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.379
let’s go to the Thought Bubble:
Sad orphan Jane Eyre is raised by her mean

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.590
aunt, who neither likes nor loves her. Jane
leaves this miserable situation for a charity

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.319
school (very much like the one that Brontë
attended) at which many of the girls die of

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.019
typhus. She completes her schooling, teaches
at the school for a while, and then decides

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.870
she wants a wider experience of the world,
so she takes a job as governess at Thornfield

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.980
Hall, the country estate of the gentleman
Mr. Rochester. Despite many red flags, including

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.099
an episode in which Mr. Rochester disguises
himself as a fortune telling gypsy woman in

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.519
an attempt to find out how Jane feels about
him, they fall in love

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.260
Just when they’re about to marry. Jane learns
that Mr. Rochester is actually already married

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.030
— to an insane woman that he keeps locked
in the attic. Jane flees and after nearly

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.099
dying from cold and hunger, she’s rescued
by the Rivers siblings who conveniently turn

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.629
out to be her long lost cousins. She’s at
the point of being bullied into marrying one

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:50.890
of these cousins when she senses that Mr.
Rochester calling her. He lost an eye and

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.090
a hand when his wife burned down Thornfield
Hall, but on the upside, his wife died in

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.950
the fire, so he is now an eligible bachelor.
Jane is free to marry him and his sight is

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.320
miraculously restored, and everyone not already
dead lives happily ever after.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.459
Thanks, Thought Bubble. Now that plot summary
may not make it sound like a terribly sophisticated

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.979
novel, but in fact, I think it’s one of the most
sophisticated novels of the 19th century.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.980
Like as with a lot of great works of literature,

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.529
it’s pretty hard to assign “Jane Eyre”
to just one genre. I mean, to get things off

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:22.210
to a complicated start, the subtitle calls
the book an autobiography. But clearly it

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.979
isn’t, because it has an author’s name
that isn’t Jane Eyre.

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.619
But then again, in a more abstract sense,
maybe it is. Like one of the book’s first

00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:32.849
admirers, George Henry Lewes wrote, “It
is an autobiography, — not, perhaps, in

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:37.719
the naked facts and circumstances, but in
the actual suffering and experience—it is

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:42.909
soul speaking to soul; it’s an utterance
from the depths of a struggling, suffering,

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:46.369
much- enduring spirit.”
Lewes’s companion, the novelist George Eliot

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:51.240
(another female writer who used a male name)
described Brontë almost exactly as Brontë

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.800
would describe Jane Eyre, as “a little,
plain, provincial, sickly-looking old maid.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.619
Yet what passion, what fire in her!”
And that really gets at something at the heart

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:05.839
of “Jane Eyre,” like people assume that
women who are plain and provincial and sickly-looking

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.660
didn’t have the rich inner lives and the
fire and the passion that we find in Jane Eyre.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.820
And that’s part of what made the novel so
revolutionary and so popular with female readers.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.080
I mean, any reader who learns even a little of Brontë’s biography will notice a lot of overlap between her

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.300
experiences and Jane Eyre’s, like, particularly in the
descriptions of Jane’s time at the charity school and

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:30.740
also her sense of the intermediate position
between servant and lady that a governess occupies.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.240
But whether you choose to read “Jane Eyre” as a fictionalized autobiography, it is certainly a great bildungsroman.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.460
A bildungsroman is a fancy German term that we use to
describe a novel about a young person’s education

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.960
or coming of age.
So at the beginning of the book, Jane has

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.330
no education and is punished whenever she
tries to think for herself or defend her independence.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.800
But then in each subsequent section of the
novel—the school, Thornfield, her escape,

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.389
her return —Jane learns something that helps her
make her way in the world and to assert herself.

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.490
And it’s only at the end of the novel, when
she can approach Mr. Rochester as an equal

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.879
partner rather than a dependent, her education
is complete.

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:10.610
“Jane Eyre,” like Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein,”
borrows from the traditions of the Romantic

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.129
and gothic novels, like from Romanticism we
get the radical focus on the individual and

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:18.969
some of Jane’s interest in dreams and intuition
and the supernatural.

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:23.009
And from the gothic tradition, we get the
fun page-turner stuff: the mysterious house

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.710
with the person you don’t expect to be there,
the mad wife, the arson, the stabbing, the

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.169
shock of the interrupted marriage ceremony.
These days we associate so-called “genre

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:36.499
novels” with a lack of seriousness, but
what makes “Jane Eyre” special is its

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:40.080
seriousness and its psychological realism.
It’s also, and I think this is something

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.340
that goes underappreciated a lot when we talk about
books, really good writing sentence to sentence.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.300
I mean, this book came out more than 160 years ago but the writing is so clear and so precise that it often feels contemporary.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.380
The poet and critic Adrienne Rich wrote of
“Jane Eyre,” “It takes its place…between

00:06:55.389 --> 00:07:00.549
the realm of the given, that which is changeable
by human activity, and the realm of the fated,

00:07:00.549 --> 00:07:04.780
that which lies outside human control: between
realism and poetry.”

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.600
And we noted earlier how for most of the novel,
Jane is between servant and lady, Mr. Rochester

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.719
is between married and unmarried, and Bertha,
the mad woman in the attic, is portrayed as

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:17.800
being between an animal and human.
So all kind of like crazy - oh it must be

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.240
time for the open letter.
Oh look, it’s Funshine Bear. We can’t

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.820
all be as happy as you are, buddy. An open
letter to Psychotropic Drugs.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.580
Dear Psychotropic Drugs, there’s this whole
thing about how, like, artists need to be

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.900
mentally ill and, need to, like, wallow in
their illness in order to create things.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.380
But when I read about the way that mental
illness was dealt with in Victorian England,

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.919
I feel profoundly grateful to you.
In the end, Psychotropic Drugs, you don’t

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:43.899
make me less creative, you make it possible
for me to create.

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:48.279
Long story short, Psychotropic Drugs, I am
very grateful that I don’t live in a 19th

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:53.719
century English attic. Best wishes, John Green.
Crazy, horrifying, very gothic things keep

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:57.959
happening to Jane, but she reacts to most
of them in her level-headed governess way.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.759
Someone tries to burn Mr. Rochester in his
bed? Someone bites his houseguest? She stops

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:07.869
to ask herself, “What crime was this that
lived incarnate in this sequestered mansion,

00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:12.669
and could neither be expelled nor subdued
by the owner?—what mystery, that broke out

00:08:12.669 --> 00:08:16.929
now in fire and now in blood, at the deadest
hours of night?”

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:20.539
Jane has these terrible disturbing dreams
the night before her wedding and a horrible

00:08:20.539 --> 00:08:26.080
lady monster thing appears in her room and
rips her bridal veil in two? But Jane manages

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.739
to just put it all aside, and goes through
with the ceremony.

00:08:28.739 --> 00:08:33.599
It’s not until a man stands up in church
and reads out a notarized document explaining

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:38.440
everything that Jane admits there’s definitely
something suspicious going on. And it takes

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.360
her another day to decide to leave Thornfield.
So we know that “Jane Eyre” isn’t a

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.949
detective novel, right? Let’s just take
a moment to acknowledge that while Jane is

00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:49.769
a feisty and very appealing heroine, she is
no Sherlock.

00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:53.839
So why does Jane keep failing to recognize
what seems to the reader so obvious? Well,

00:08:53.839 --> 00:08:57.329
if you’ve ever been in love, then you might
have noticed you have an astonishing ability

00:08:57.329 --> 00:09:00.879
to ignore red flags.
For instance, Meredith used to date a ginger

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:05.129
(red flag #1), who kept hitting on her roommate
(red flag #2), and eventually, of course,

00:09:05.129 --> 00:09:07.930
you know, it happened.
By “it,” I of course mean that he burned

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.399
her bed.
I’m sorry gingers, that was a cheap joke,

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:14.819
but I do dislike Meredith’s ex-boyfriend.
Anyway, more importantly than any of that,

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.139
in the middle of the novel, Jane’s education
is still ongoing. She hasn’t yet achieved

00:09:19.139 --> 00:09:23.420
financial independence or independent thought,
she hasn’t yet found the strength to give

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.769
up Mr. Rochester when he proposes that she
live with him as his mistress.

00:09:26.769 --> 00:09:30.399
And by the end of the novel, she’s much
better at reading clues. Like when she hears

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:34.910
Mr. Rochester’s voice calling out to her
from clear across the country, she doesn’t

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.830
think, “Wow, that seems improbable.” She
goes!

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.160
And when she finds him, he’s lost his sight,
but of course, Jane has finally learned how

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:46.139
to see, to pay attention not just to what’s
in front of her, but also what’s happening

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:50.220
beyond and beneath the visible world.
So when Charlotte Brontë was young, she wrote

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:55.500
to the poet Robert Southey hoping for encouragement.
He acknowledged her talent, but told her not

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:01.569
to waste any more time at it because, “Literature
cannot be the business of a woman's life,

00:10:01.569 --> 00:10:04.750
and it ought not to be.”
Now Jane seems perfectly happy to give up

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.970
writing her autobiography in favor of having
all of Mr. Rochester’s babies and her declaration,

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.540
“Reader, I married him” is probably the
most famous sentence in the book. But it’s

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:17.500
important to remember that Jane doesn’t
marry Mr. Rochester until she can meet him

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.009
on an equal, if not superior footing.
Like earlier in the book he has all the money

00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:26.469
and all the power and all the secrets, right?
By the end of the novel, she has money, and

00:10:26.469 --> 00:10:31.360
also vision, both literal and metaphorical.
Jane consistently rejects men who try to control

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.439
her and she shows a lot of perceptive critiques
of gender dynamics, like a passage in which

00:10:35.439 --> 00:10:38.470
she declares:
“Women are supposed to be very calm generally:

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:43.689
but women feel just as men feel; they need
exercise for their faculties, and a field

00:10:43.689 --> 00:10:47.310
for their efforts as much as their brothers
do…and it is narrow-minded in their more

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.589
privileged fellow-creatures to say that they
ought to confine themselves to making puddings

00:10:51.589 --> 00:10:55.139
and knitting stockings.”
Sorry, pudding lovers but this novel clearly

00:10:55.139 --> 00:11:00.110
says to heck with pudding! I’m only making
pudding when I can make pudding on my own

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.439
terms! Also, who would want to wear knitted
stockings?

00:11:02.439 --> 00:11:07.410
So I think you can read the novel as striking
at least a soft blow for gender equality,

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.470
but many feminist critics, like Sandra Gilbert,
sense that there’s something a little more

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:16.750
disturbing going on in Jane’s journey from
abused child to perfect Victorian wife.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:21.680
Gilbert focuses where very little of the actual
novel does, on that mad woman in the attic,

00:11:21.689 --> 00:11:25.930
Mr. Rochester’s first wife, Bertha Mason.
I mean, was Bertha really the fallen woman

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:30.300
that Rochester describes? Let’s remember
that Mr. Rochester freely admits to keeping

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.940
a lot of mistresses, but the novel never really
scolds his sexual behavior.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.779
Meanwhile, keeping mentally ill, inconvenient
wives chained to the attic, which, by the

00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:41.389
way, really happened in Brontë’s day, is
more or less approved of.

00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:45.810
Now some read Bertha, who hails from a tropical
island and has dark skin, as a commentary

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.470
on Britain’s treatment of its colonies.
But my favorite reading is to see Bertha as

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:54.680
a kind of dark mirror for Jane, of all the
feelings and desires that Jane has to repress

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.930
in order to fit the mold of Victorian womanhood,
a creature who “snatched and growled like

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:04.410
some strange wild animal” while Jane sews
and teaches geography.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:09.180
I mean, every time that Jane gets upset—like
when Mr. Rochester talks about all of his

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.580
mistresses or fools her with that weird gypsy
thing— it’s Bertha who acts out.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:18.460
And when Jane feels anxious about her marriage,
Bertha comes to her room and rips the veil.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:24.100
And let’s not forget that it’s Bertha—wild,
untamed, sexual Bertha—who has to die in

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.279
order for Jane and Mr. Rochester to finally
get married.

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:31.569
Jane has to lose part of her nature to fit
into the expectations of her social order

00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:37.120
and in that sense at least, this happily ever
after ending isn’t entirely happily ever after.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.340
