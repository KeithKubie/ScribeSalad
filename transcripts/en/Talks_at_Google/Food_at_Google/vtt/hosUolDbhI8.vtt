[Applause]
[Cheering]

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.620
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: I, I never know if I'm allowed
to clap for myself or not.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.970
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: You can totally "woo hoo".

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.530
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]:Yay me. Yay me.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.510
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: We do it all the time. [Audience
chuckles] Um,so I googled you...

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.550
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir] I love a room where everyone has
their computers.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.770
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Yeah, [audience chuckles]
they're all tweeting and

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.770
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: I would love to work here.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.780
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: We're hiring...

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.970
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]:Okay, I'll fill out an application.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.640
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: I feel like we could make
that happen. Uh, what would you do here?

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.640
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]:Just...search.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.070
[Crowd and speakers laugh]

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.750
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Just [chuckle] answer search
queries..

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.250
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Well I don't know..after the Lego
room. How does anyone keep a job where

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.250
where there's a Lego room?

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.980
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: I don't know. That’s a
good question...it's fun right?

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.200
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: I would stay there forever. I don't
think I'd make it long here.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.320
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: You probably would actually
because that's part of what we do.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.320
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Oh, okay.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.030
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: It would work. Um, so, I
googled you, obviously.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.030
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Thank you.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.829
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Yeah. And, uh, there are
over 1.6 million results that come up.

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:06.829
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: That's scary.

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.090
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Yeah. There's, it’s not
as many as Kim Kardashian though, just so

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.750
you know.
If that makes you feel better or worse, I

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.750
don't know. But....

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.750
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]:Thank goodness, thank goodness.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.439
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]:I thought we'd just go through
all of them one by one.

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.439
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]:Okay.

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:18.439
[Someone in audience giggles in a high pitch]

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.929
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]:You've got nowhere to be.
The show doesn't start for hours, I think

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:20.959
you're
Okay.

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:21.990
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]:I'm safe.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.399
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]:So first thing that came up
is music, obviously. And you're seen as one

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.579
of the
most inspiring, influential people in music,

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.029
having worked with everyone from D'Angelo
to Eminem to JayZ; and so I was wondering

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:39.020
who was the most unlikely musical inspiration
we’d find in your library.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.890
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]:Um, most unlikely?

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.289
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]:Yeah, something that might
surprise me.

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:45.289
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]:Urh....

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.369
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: If you were to invite me
over to look at your music collection..

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.990
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: I don't know. 'Cause the thing
is, I think that, in the past twenty years,

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.219
I've made a career out of
doing the exact opposite of what was expected

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:05.679
of me, so I would almost think that
for me to do something normal or expected

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.810
would be like the new shock. Like, would just
be like Madonna

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.920
just wore you know, did a non-controversial
project or something. I don't know. Um, who

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.540
would people
be shocked that I'm working with?

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.750
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Well, what's an unconventional
place that you find music inspiration from?

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.310
Or just inspiration in general? You have your
fingers in so many pots, and what

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.860
sort of drives you?

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.200
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: See, it's really hard for me, because
I don't treat music as like a separate entity.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.890
Like, oh, there's oxygen, and there's work,
and there's food, and oh here's music.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:45.050
Like, music is just ..it's so...it's so ubiquitous
to me, like blood flow, I can't do

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:54.610
anything without sound. Um, you know, people
that follow me on Google have been

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.180
having the field day watching me curse out
Time Warner. [Audience laughs, Ahmir laughs]

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.820
And trying to court court Fios at the same
time because, uh, there's been dead silence

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.600
in my house for like the last four days and
it's, like killing me that, you know,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:20.650
my cable's off but, um, I don't know. Uh,
let's see, uh, right now I'm, I'm

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:29.230
just discovering Tom T. Hall, uh, a country
singers, a country singer from 50's, 60's,

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:38.600
well I meant, once you do something it's forever,
but his era was between uh, between the 50's

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:47.270
and the 70's. I'll say that bluegrass is like
the one area, which I'm not well versed in,

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:57.100
so because I'm known to do unorthodox things
in my deejay set, you know. My niche in deejaying

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.209
is the whole
"Oh my god, he actually played that!?!" so

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:07.930
um I'm, I'm trying to search for a lot of
bluegrass

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.480
and country music that's like between 106
beats per minute and 120, so that way

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.480
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Is there a lot in there?

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.879
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: I can mix and match them and shock
people. So, probably in the next month or

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.379
so.
Like I absorb it first before I do it. I don't

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:23.389
play a song blind like okay well I think this
works.

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.199
Like I gotta plan it, and test it and make
sure it works first.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.020
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: So where do you buy your
records? or your CD's?

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.580
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]:um...no...I still buy records. uh
[takes sharp breath] uh, um..it's it’s it's

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.199
kind of
different for me now. Um, you know, in the

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.800
beginning, there there were a lot of mom and
pop stores

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:52.500
that I went to in Philadelphia and then when
you start touring. Mike D's the one,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:00.629
Mike D. from the Beastie Boys, um, like my
first adult, four figure record shopping spree

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:05.110
purchase
was due to like a record store that he recommended

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.590
to me in Portland. At first I was like
Portland, Oregon? But then he taught, he told

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.639
me like the most unlikely cities are the best
places to get

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.469
you know, because, you know, they might not
treasure it as, you know, you go to New York

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:21.710
City,
you're going to pay uh, three thousand dollars

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.939
for like uh, the original Beatles "Yesterday,
Today, Forever"

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:32.780
where they had like the uh blood on their
smocks. There was a controversial Beatles

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.390
cover like with them in
butchers’ outfits and headless dolls. That's

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.090
very expensive. [interviewer chuckles] Um,
whereas you can go to you know

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.819
Kalamazoo, Michigan and the person might not
know the value of it so you can get away with

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:46.819
it, so I mean.

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:48.849
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: So just the flight cost of
getting there...but

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:50.240
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]:Well yeah, I meant

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.710
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: so the thrill of the hunt?
It's alright.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:06:00.139
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]:Well you get my point.[chuckles]
Um, but now I mostly, I have a broker who

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:10.289
will let me know when estates, have things
for sale. So, in other words, if a

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:16.210
disgruntled wife wants to, [audience laughs]
no like I hate to say this,

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.919
I hate to really generalize it like this but,seriously
like uh jazz collections come

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:28.449
from divorced women who like inherit everything
and just want to get rid of the stuff.

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:31.319
[soft laughter from audience and other speaker]

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:40.020
Um, a lot of my, again this is like [stammers
slightly] it's generalizing but

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.919
it's it's how it is like, mothers' whose sons
have passed away untimely or whatever,

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.870
Like I'll inherit "Here are these 800 hip
hop records..what do you do with it?"

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:57.550
Or I've had to purchase records from uh, club
deejays, from the 80's who might have

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.259
to pay their hospital bills, and that sort
of stuff.

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:05.129
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: A lot of depressing stories
here, divorce, death.

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:10.639
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]:That's like right now I'm, I'm,
I'm trying to, I guess the biggest record

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:18.439
collection story now is, um, a hero of mine,
uh, J Dilla, um, when he made his

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:26.819
move to Los Angeles, he just put all his stuff
in storage, he was from Detroit, Michigan,

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:31.229
so he put his stuff in storage but of course,
now that he's gone, and his bills are sort

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:36.729
of neglected,
uh, the owner of the uh, the warehouse, or

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:39.330
where his stuff was stored, discovered, that
he had

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:46.610
J Dilla's record collection so, I'm trying
to... I don't, I don't want it sourced out

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.249
and separated,
I think that it should be put together, so

00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:56.970
I'm, I'm trying to bid the entire
10,000 record collection so. So again, I just,

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.610
I buy people's collections that have had some
sort

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.080
of misfortune with it. [Audience chuckles]

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.969
I'll tell you a very interesting one I got.
Um, Levi Stubbs, the late lead singer of the

00:08:08.969 --> 00:08:12.580
Four Tops,
his daughter just sold me his entire record

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.879
collection...shh,man, like he has like

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:16.879
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: everything?

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:22.990
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]:His is more like historical a lot
of his stuff are acetates from like old Motown

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.979
sessions,
and things like that. Like it was like eighteen

00:08:25.979 --> 00:08:28.779
boxes. I only opened up three of them, but
I'm sure like the

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:34.160
rest of them have historical artifacts in
them, so right now I'm just sitting on like

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.160
70,000 records.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.720
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Where do you store all this?

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:46.400
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Before I bought my first house,
I, well I'll just say that my business manager's

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.090
probably one
of the smartest people on earth, you know

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.220
if, when my record collection was like kissing
20,000,

00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:00.070
it was in my house, and then a friend of mine,
Q-tip,

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:06.720
lost his entire 40,000 records and and a lot
of Tribe Called Quest artifacts

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:13.360
in uh, uh, a fire in 1999. So that freaked
me out,

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.610
because at this point, when you were coming
into my house, there was nothing but records,

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:22.430
so you could just hear the theme from Indiana
Jones [hums theme from Indiana Jones] like,

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:28.390
and you were like, trying to jump over like
trying to figure out ways to not crush records

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:36.760
'cause they were just everywhere.
Um, so I built my my fantasy, my version of

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.650
the Library of Congress room.
It's like, you know, I told them like, you

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:47.270
know, cherry wood floors and sliding ladders.
And it's cataloged and it's beautiful. But

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:52.640
now it's in Philadelphia,
and I'm here so I gotta figure out what my

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:57.120
next move is gonna to be.
Like how to transfer that up to up to New

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.120
York.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.120
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Right. Well.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.120
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Sorry for that long answer.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.120
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]:Yeah it's pretty.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.120
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]:We gotta go, good-bye.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.120
[laughter]

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.120
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Thank you. Enjoy the chicken.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.120
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Thank you

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.470
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: It's, speaking of the chicken,
so people have been wondering

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.400
why is ?uestlove coming in under the guise
of the Chefs at Google...

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.450
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir, chuckling]: I know, like people...

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.450
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: like what?

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.190
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Who's head scratching like? [People
laughing] Rawr?

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:19.030
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: That was the sound that
they made actually. Explaining that road,

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.760
from the Grammy's to the kitchen.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:31.520
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Um, I guess the short story is
that uh, um, doing two hundred shows at night,

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:38.120
um, with the Roots, means doing an additional
two hundred deejay gigs. Two hundred shows

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.120
a night?

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.120
[Interviewer chuckles]

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.120
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: That's a lot of shows...

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.120
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Yeah, we all...

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.120
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: We weren't going to correct
you...

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.750
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Thank you, but that dismays me
that you guys weren't going to correct me.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:53.790
[Interviewer chuckles]
Um, doing two hundred shows a year also means

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.950
that I have to do two hundred deejay gigs
a year.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:08.340
And I've noticed in the northwestern part
of the United States: Seattle, Portland, Utah,

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.180
those
places have very interesting presentation

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.700
set ups. Sort of like how you guys have a
truck

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:22.590
inside your cafeteria. I'll say that food
truck culture, which is a very big thing

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:30.930
in Philadelphia really hit its creative, at
least in my eyes, its stride in like 2002

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:35.030
where
you know, two in the morning, these guys were

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.610
selling any and every thing.
Like the first time I ever saw an all grilled

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:43.640
cheese truck was outside of a deejay gig in
Portland.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:50.410
And then one guy had a real specialty truck,
it was like, was nothing but corn, and I thought,

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.190
but no,
people would lined up like it was...

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.190
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: They were all drunk. That’s
why...[chuckles] we want corn...

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.330
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: But no, it was like he was from
the 50's "hear ye, hear ye, get your corn!

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.210
Get your corn! Get your corn!"
And I was like, what the hell is he selling?

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:07.660
But he sold like a vast array of corn.
So cut to like me, no, uh one was like dipped

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.180
in honey, one was Mexican corn.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.360
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Honey corn?

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.180
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Yo, it was honey, it was dipped
in honey and then coconut, like...

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.430
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: That sounds awfully disgusting.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:17.430
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: like chocolate covered..

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:18.520
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Chocolate covered corn?

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.390
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Wait, where's Darryl at?

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:21.390
&gt;&gt;[Man yells] Over here.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:22.390
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Shut up man, that's a trick.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:26.870
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: That's his trainer who's
here. He's not happy about the chocolate covered

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:27.870
corn.

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:32.930
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Anyway, no, it was like really
creative how they did it. And I always wanted

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:39.220
to have
like my soul food version of a like Mr. Softees

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:45.130
truck. Back then, I thought, Okay, I'm gonna
have this thing called "Soul on a Roll".[laughter]

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:50.760
And you know, but I couldn't
execute half of these ideas because we had

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:55.710
to commit to you know two hundred nights.
When you're only in your hometown for three

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:59.620
months out of the year, there's really no
stability,

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:06.200
not domestically or anything so once, once
the Jimmy Fallon show came along, and offered

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.730
us
normalcy, for the, like we started the Roots

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:16.810
as nineteen and twenty year olds. Now, we're
forty. So imagine, just going from high school

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:20.660
and then now is the second year that I know
what normal life is like.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:26.250
Or at least a semblance of what like an every
day routine is like. So this very new to me,

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:30.530
so I feel like I'm that
twenty year older that's dreaming about, let

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.820
me try this and let me, I'm just wanting to
try new ideas out, so

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:42.800
I guess with the Drumstick, that was the most
obvious choice to develop it.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.860
We developed it for like, I guess a year.
Having a lot of taste tests.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.940
I put it out on Twitter that I was looking
for a chef,

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.480
and I guess people assumed I just wanted a
personal

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.480
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Right

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:58.730
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Like I have some sort of kingdom
and [Ahmir chuckles] so a lot of people

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:05.010
submitted, over nine hundred people submitted
videos, and I , uh, and then we

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:12.660
somehow managed to do a lot of focus groups
and taste test and contests,

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:19.810
not contests but you know trying out a bunch
of dishes and then we were

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:24.420
finally satisfied, I guess, a year later enough
to start our venture.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:29.740
And this is a very slow, I don't believe in
that whole skipping the bank line,

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:34.830
and just going instantly to Boardwalk and
Park Place, without having

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:39.731
to go through Oriental Avenue, Virginia States,
and Marvin's Gardens. Like I want

00:14:39.731 --> 00:14:44.710
to slowly travel it, so you know you start,
you start with the blogosphere first,

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.740
and then you cook for other chefs, and then
you come to places like Google

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:53.529
and other conglomerates and then you slowly
build your way up. And so this is.

00:14:53.529 --> 00:14:57.610
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: I was telling you, the James
Beard Awards were just announced last night,

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.470
and I have to say, we've done a pretty good
job of curating Chefs at Google,

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:04.280
if I do say so myself, because half the people
that we've had in the last year

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.440
were winners last night, so no pressure.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.440
[audience chuckles]

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.470
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Who won last night?

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.630
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Hugh Atchison, um

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.630
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Okay, okay...

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.150
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Daniel Hung was outstanding
chef, so no pressure but

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:15.323
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Ah, it's no pressure.

00:15:15.323 --> 00:15:16.323
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: It's within your reach.

00:15:16.323 --> 00:15:22.920
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: I mean the, the fact that renown
seven times winner James Beard Award winning

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.840
chef tries
to challenge me, like he's an MC.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.510
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Yeah so let's talk about
that. How did, what, how did happen?

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.950
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: That's as big an honor.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.810
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: David Chang challenged him
to a fried chicken battle...

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:39.000
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Yeah, David Chang. Yeah, at first
I thought "ha ha that Chang, he's, he's cute"

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.070
you know, but then, it was like everyone kept
asking:Yo, why has Chang been pickin' on you?

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:50.650
Like, I mean, we just, we created such a buzz
and I guess that people were just,

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:55.960
I don't know, maybe the best way to go through
life is to be, I love being underestimated,

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:03.240
you know?
And I guess that his thoughts were like, really,

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:09.360
I'm tired of hearing people rave about about
your food or whatever, and so then, you know,

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:22.240
I was forced to just say bring it on.
So, my show got involved by "staging" "a battle."

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.250
I'm being very "diplomatic" now.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:27.160
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Do you feel like it was rigged,
just a little bit?

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:35.050
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: NO comment. Uh, he was nervous
though. Yeah, and so he, uh, he really put

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:40.020
a lot of preparation
into it so I mean the fact, I mean in a way

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:45.480
I'm glad I, I'm glad I kinda lost because
I think that if the news

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:52.400
got out that you know, a drummer from West
Philly beats a seven time James Beard Award

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.630
winning chef, then, you know

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.250
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Let's kill an industry.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:17:01.050
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: The world would have been, every
chef nobody would have touched me so.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:05.970
Uh, no, I consider it an honor, and you know,
he's a friend and I

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.770
believe that
[speaking to someone off stage] Alexis when

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.079
does it go into uh,

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.329
&gt;&gt;[someone off stage]: May 20th

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:17.710
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Yeah, he's agreed to serve the
Drumsticks at Momofuku on May 20th.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.170
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: On May 20th, in case you
didn't get one here.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.170
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Yeah.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.170
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Um, so we're at a tech company
obviously, and I would love to know what's

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:29.240
the most profound way
technology has changed your life? If you were

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.150
starting out, if the Roots were starting today..

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.410
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: You you know something ..

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:34.510
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Would things be different
for you?

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:39.440
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: I'll honestly say that we were
the last, I believe, honestly believe, that

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:46.340
we were the last group to really
get on the caboose of what the old standard

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.890
was. 'Cause I think that, back then there
was

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.890
there was visions of technology and, remember,
there was talk of the super information highway

00:17:54.890 --> 00:18:02.440
and that type of stuff. Like we came right
in on the caboose, which was, you know, I

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.370
guess the world
knew of us in '94, I mean we started in '92,

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:12.600
but the world became aware of us in '94.
But, I, too, wonder what would happen, because

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.940
I think the thing that made us work hard and
made us

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:27.180
so resilient was the fact that there was absolutely
no outlets. We, what's the term English people

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:31.790
use,
when you...Busking. We were busking, the term

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:35.860
busking is when you put the shoe box on the
street,

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:41.390
and you play on buckets and people throw money
in there. That's the route that we went to.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:45.770
Now, if we started twenty years later, we
would just have made a whole bunch of YouTube

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:50.040
videos.
I don't think we would have worked as hard

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.800
if we had the technology that's available
to us today.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:19:04.300
So, I'm almost glad that we came right before
the technology age really started to, to grow.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:10.400
Because a lot of people always ask,well, how
are you able to work at Fallon, produce this

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.970
record,
score this film, do these shoes, and now fried

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:21.740
chicken, da da da duh. Like all these things,
there's just a work ethic that we've had,

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:27.960
like a sink or swim thing that I don't think
we'd have had had we grown up in the technology

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.960
era.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.960
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: So now...

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.960
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: BUT it's helped us.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:41.510
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Yeah [chuckles] so you are
one of the most prolific Tweeters as many

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:42.700
of us know who do follow you.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:43.700
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Thank you.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.730
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Um, why is connecting to
your audience through social media in that

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.420
way so important to you?

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.980
[Ahmir chuckles softly]

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.140
I don't know why that's a funny question.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:59.760
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: No, well, 'cause you know, this
is the point of the day where I, you know,

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.120
take the pin and I take the balloon,
and ssss...and deflate it. 'Cause people ask,

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.910
how do you tweet so much, how do you da da
da duh.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:13.230
First of all, I mean tweeting is just a, it's
just a running dialog, and it takes me literally

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:16.321
ten seconds to get a
thought out. I think people think it's like

00:20:16.321 --> 00:20:19.510
some rocket science thing where I have to
sit and

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:26.090
take, take an hour out to think of something,
but you know, I can easily, you know, drum

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.830
on.
All the time at Fallon, yesterday, when the

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.750
Beach Boys were on, I mean I was playing music
and

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:32.750
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Tweeting...

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:40.040
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: and tweeting at the same time.
I don't know. I just see it as ongoing communication,

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:46.630
I mean it started
with my, when, when I developed our website

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:53.110
Okayplayer.com I wanted, I noticed that no
one hip hop was really,

00:20:53.110 --> 00:21:01.250
with the exception of, the exception of the
Beastie Boys, sometimes with with with, on

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:09.020
Hole's website, Courtney Love's
group Hole, and maybe with REM's website,

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:18.080
in the mid, in the late 90's, those were the
only artists I saw kind of above the radar

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:24.800
that were actively communicating with their
fan base. Then the artists that I really loved,

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.510
like A Tribe Called Quest,
the only personal thing you knew about them

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:37.140
was Q-tips favorite spaghetti recipe or Lauryn
Hill loves Jamaican food mon.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:45.030
Like that was on her website. And yes, the
word "mon" was in there like "mon". You know

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:55.040
so, back in 98, I wanted to
revolutionize, or think I was revolutionizing,

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:59.900
that velvet rope, in cutting it. So maybe
like the first year,

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:05.450
of that website, you know, you had to get
over the whole novelty of "Oh my God, it's

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:10.860
really you ?uestlove" and that type
of thing. So after doing Okayplayer for twelve

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.440
years in which I've absolutely spilled everything,
like

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.770
there's no need to write a book, you just
need to go to the history of all my postings

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:22.150
on that website.
Something like Twitter comes along, it just

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:27.690
forces you to give concise answers, as opposed
to long, drawn out answers

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:30.461
like I'm doing right now to you, so

00:22:30.461 --> 00:22:36.769
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Can you compose a Tweet
for me? about the last meal you had?

00:22:36.769 --> 00:22:44.350
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Shut up Darryl. Ha ha. I had salad,
end Tweet.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.020
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Okay, so can we do a word
association?

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.560
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Sure.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:55.110
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Alright, I want you to just
tell me whatever comes to mind when I say

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.770
the following words. Ready?

00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:01.860
[laughter from audience]
I haven't even started yet.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.440
Okay, food trucks?

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.070
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: The future.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:07.160
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Prince?

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.250
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: God.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:11.350
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Cupcakes.

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:15.530
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Darryl.
[audience laughs]

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.670
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Jimmy Fallon?

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.760
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Genuine.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.860
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Little nervous too right?
A little sweaty?

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.240
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: No. He, he...

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.330
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: I'm just kidding...I'm totally
messing with you. Chicken?

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:32.610
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: That was first year Jimmy. Now
he's he's cool as a cucumber.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:36.299
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Chicken?

00:23:36.299 --> 00:23:41.830
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Hmm...uh, profit.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:47.370
[audience laughs. Applause]

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:49.930
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: David Chang?

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.660
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Revenge. [Ahmir chuckles]
[Audience laugh loudly]

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.867
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Alright, just a couple more
questions for you, then we'll open it up to

00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:56.867
Q and A.

00:23:56.867 --> 00:23:57.867
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Sure.

00:23:57.867 --> 00:24:02.330
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: If you could request any
Google Doodle, what would it be?

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:15.130
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: My, I've, I've been stalking Google
to do a Commemorative Soul Train Doodle for

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:23.800
the longest, well, I I don't know that people
who follow me on Twitter know that I'm religious

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:29.820
with Google Doodles
'cause I don't know, it's just fun and you

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.679
know, it's like looking at a puzzle and I'm
trying

00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:35.830
to figure out, okay, how's it amalgamated
and inside the "O" and the "O" and where's

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:42.220
the "L", I enjoy it. A lot.
Like, when I wake up, that's the first thing

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:45.610
I look to see, if anything has happened.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:50.049
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: There's a new one everyday.

00:24:50.049 --> 00:24:55.540
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: I'm a geek, I'm sorry. Yeah, so
that would, would be that's my favorite, and

00:24:55.540 --> 00:25:02.200
now that it's interactive,
more than ever, I've been Tweeting profusely

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.230
about a Soul Train Doodle.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:09.280
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Okay, well. I don't have
a Soul Train Doodle for you. However, when

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.940
the team in California found out, look at
that smile,

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:16.830
when they found out you were coming, one of
our Doodlers is a huge fan, Ryan Germick,

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.700
and it happens to be his birthday today,
by coincidence. And..

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.700
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Happy birthday

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.840
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: he's on VC somewhere, hopefully.
Hi, Ryan. He sent a little present over for

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.840
you.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.900
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: That's so awesome man.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:32.160
[clapping and laughter from audience]

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.270
Thank you!

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:40.710
Ha haa..this is like everything that I love
in this one thing, like I'm wearing a Prince

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:45.850
t-shirt, I'm playing drums,
I have a drumstick in one hand and Lego heart,

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:49.059
and I'm holding the letter "L". That is awesome.

00:25:49.059 --> 00:25:50.600
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: You like it? It's pretty
good right?

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.640
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Wait, can I Tweet that?

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.900
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: You can Tweet that.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.580
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: I'm allowed to?

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.870
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: But we're going to move
onto the next question, because I know you

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:57.870
have to move on.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.039
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: I can tweet and talk to you at
the same time.

00:26:00.039 --> 00:26:05.620
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Alright, so you can Tweet
and talk. So you told me earlier that the

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:09.600
last thing you searched for
Bruce Almighty. There's a story there, and

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.450
we'll explain it at some point, but I was
wondering if you

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.110
could slow down the search results for me?

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:18.049
[audience chuckles]

00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:19.390
No pressure, I'm going to look it up right
now.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:20.850
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Okay, you're going to look up
Bruce Almighty?

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:21.850
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Bruce Almighty.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:22.850
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Mm hmm.

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:26.910
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Bear with me, we're going
to this while you Tweet, if I have a cell

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:28.669
signal. Alright, you ready?

00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:29.669
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Yes.

00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:31.419
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Are you still Tweeting or
..

00:26:31.419 --> 00:26:34.020
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Do we get...uh, no. I sent twelve
out already.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.020
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: During the, during the talk?

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.020
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Yeah.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.610
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: You were just doing it in
your pocket? Are you ready?

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.380
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Is the mike here? Okay.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.870
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Alright, okay. Bruce Almighty,
2003, IMDB.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:55.880
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir whispers]: Okay
[normal voice] Wait. Can we get more ambiance?

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.880
Can we turn the lights down?

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.080
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Do we need a beat? We need
mood lighting?

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:02.510
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Do we have any music? Any slow
music? Shut up Darryl.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:05.120
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Are we throwing down a beat?

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:11.380
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Wait, they're turning down all
the lights over ...[laughs loudly]

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.870
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: They turned the lights over
there.

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.070
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Okay, this is already a fail.
Okay.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:19.130
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: We're going to start again.
We're going to do it again.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:20.350
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir whispers]okay.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.179
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: You ready?

00:27:22.179 --> 00:27:24.610
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir whispers]: I'm ready

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.660
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Bruce Almighty, 2003, IMDB

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:36.050
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir,low voice] Oh, yeah. She loves Jimmy
Cary. This is gonna be a fail.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:41.210
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Bruce Almighty, Wikipedia,
the free encyclopedia.

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:50.190
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: [breathes heavily] She's trusting
enough to go to an unreliable source of encyclopedia...

00:27:50.190 --> 00:28:00.700
Wait, can I just say that I don't agree that
Wikipedia is all that revisionist. Anyway.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.289
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Images for Bruce Almighty.

00:28:04.289 --> 00:28:07.400
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: I forgot why I searched Bruce
Almighty.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:14.570
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: We were talking about um,
Bill Gates being the Moses of the Silicon

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:15.889
Valley and uh..

00:28:15.889 --> 00:28:18.980
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: We just got super non-sequitered
now.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:25.280
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: and then he went into Bruce
Almighty. I don't know why. I just went with

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.280
it.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.640
Bruce Almighty, Rotten Tomatoes.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.710
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Can we talk about Bruce Almighty
two?

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.129
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Sure.

00:28:33.129 --> 00:28:37.120
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Such a shame baby that you only
got a 27 rating.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:41.590
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Awesome, thank you [claps]
You're a good sport.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:48.950
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Steve Carrell has no future. Nah,
I'm playing. [laughs] I'm bad at slow Jamming.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:49.950
I'm sorry.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:50.950
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: Nah, that's pretty good.

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:51.950
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Thank you.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:55.331
&gt;&gt; [Interviewer]: That wasn't bad. We're going
to open it up to Q and A. And if you guys

00:28:55.331 --> 00:28:58.640
have any questions, if you can
go to one of the two standing mikes, because

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.410
we're recording this for YouTube.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:04.740
&gt;&gt;[male audience member]: Hi [clears throat]

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:05.840
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Howdy

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:13.980
&gt;&gt;[male audience member]: Hi, my name is Jesus.
I'm an engineer, uh, you started around '92

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:18.419
with the Roots,
a time where like, mostly, uh, you should

00:29:18.419 --> 00:29:23.110
go through a, a record company to get your
album out there. Nowadays,

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:28.059
any kiddo can buy like a three thousand dollar
computer, have a studio at home, and then

00:29:28.059 --> 00:29:33.350
like release an album. What is
your point of view from an era, from a time

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:37.540
era where you had to like get put out there,
to a time era where

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.870
there's so much out there, that it's very
difficult to find things?

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:47.271
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: It's, it's funny you say that,
because um, a friend of mine, a fellow Philadelphian,

00:29:47.271 --> 00:29:54.910
a rapper, Meek Mills, whose
down with Rick Ross, just released his mix

00:29:54.910 --> 00:30:02.480
tape yesterday. 2.5 million downloads in one
day, which, you know,

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:09.799
in layman’s terms, he just went almost triple
platinum in a 24 hour period. So it's kinda

00:30:09.799 --> 00:30:16.970
hard to determine,
I know like RIAA sales determine what success

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:21.760
is, well like 500,000 people will purchase
this then you get a gold plaque, but

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:28.850
what does that say about the three million
people that now have his music as well? Which,

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:34.090
you know,
I know that RIAA, and a few artists are arguing

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:38.350
that well, you know, that's doing a disservice
to the industry,

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:43.760
because the artists aren't getting paid, but,
you know, I'm almost certain that if he's

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:50.030
able to go triple platinum
in a twenty four hour period, then that means,

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:56.540
if he were to do a show or a concert in the
next week or so, it would instantly sell out,

00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:00.870
or could do a bigger venue and somehow, like
that to me is like the

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:05.610
monetary reward that he would get, probably
more than, like, I've never depended on record

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:09.940
sales for any type
of money, like a lot of my money is based

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:13.080
on everything but making records. Like, I
consider

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:18.450
making records sorta like the person outside
the club that hands you fliers at the end

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:22.130
of the night to let you know
when another club is open, or who's there

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:27.720
next week. Like that's what I use records
for. So, I mean yeah,

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:38.870
the industry has changed, whether or not the
RIAA continues its mission, especially with,

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:45.890
you know, the Sopa controversy,
Like it remains to be seen, but you know,

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:48.770
I think that there's going to have to be a
changing of the guards.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:54.990
And you know, the recording industry in America
is holding on to dear life, you know, and

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:59.180
it's so obvious that a new system
has to start.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:03.860
&gt;&gt;[Jesus]: If you Tweet the link to the album
and he has a PayPal, I'm sure that, I mean

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.670
if I like the music, I'd put some money there
too, so.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.730
&gt;&gt;He's rich enough.
[Laughter]

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:09.760
Who's up?

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.330
&gt;&gt;[female audience member]: Hi, um...

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:13.880
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Oh, wow,

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.450
&gt;&gt;[female audience member]: My turn?

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:19.200
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: You guys are good...it's like
magic . Wee ooo...

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.850
&gt;&gt;[female audience member]: Hi, um, I used
to live in Philly, and I was hoping

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:27.110
you could talk about some of your favorite
Philly restaurants.

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:28.110
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Yeah

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:30.153
&gt;&gt;[female audience member]: and just favorite
restaurants in general. And also I work in

00:32:30.153 --> 00:32:31.153
Sigad,

00:32:31.153 --> 00:32:32.153
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Oh nice.

00:32:32.153 --> 00:32:33.153
&gt;&gt;[female audience member]..up on the ninth
floor and you could stop by later and you

00:32:33.153 --> 00:32:34.153
know, visit there..

00:32:34.153 --> 00:32:35.153
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Sure.

00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:36.179
&gt;&gt;[female audience member]: we could just
sorta hang out.

00:32:36.179 --> 00:32:37.179
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: What part of Philly?

00:32:37.179 --> 00:32:38.850
&gt;&gt;[female audience member]: I lived in Northern
Liberties...

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:43.530
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Oh, that's where I live, well,
that's where my home is, my current home is.

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:46.540
&gt;&gt;[female audience member]: Yeah, I saw you
at Honey's once actually, at brunch.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:50.040
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir uses sing song voice]: Stalking me....
[laughter bursts from the crowd]

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:57.160
[Ahmir in normal voice]: Uh, I'll be honest
with you, close your ears Darryl, I chose

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.210
my house because
it was in walking distance to Honey's,

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:01.210
[crowd laughs]

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:06.400
&gt;&gt;[female audience member]: I love Honey's,
that's a good reason to choose to live there.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:18.919
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Um, no actually, um, Philadelphia
is probably the last easily affordable cosmopolitan

00:33:18.919 --> 00:33:24.290
city,
in the United States. In the terms of, you

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:29.390
know, property, and and resources, and you
know,

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:36.470
I still miss it a lot, I mean, I'm not saying
that I'm a 100% New Yorker, but I'll just

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:39.390
say
that, you know, last time I was in Philadelphia

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:47.700
was like a long time ago. But, um,
you know, I, I , I like that area of Northern

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.630
Liberties, because it's it's like our version
of

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:51.630
maybe Williamsburg.

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:52.630
&gt;&gt;[female audience member]: yeah

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:58.610
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: You know, a lot of like mom and
pop, well, what would you call a mom and pop

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:00.490
store
that's not a mom and pop store? Mom and pop

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:05.289
makes it sound so country like. It's it's
just a lot

00:34:05.289 --> 00:34:06.730
of non-corporate businesses.

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:07.730
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Local

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:12.480
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Local, there you go. That's, that's
what I was searching for. There's a lot of

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.990
local
restaurants so, that whole area. Yeah, I love

00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:16.470
it, and I'll keep that house forever.

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:18.770
&gt;&gt;[female audience member]: Come to Sigad.

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:19.770
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Okay.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:24.090
&gt;&gt;[male audience member]: What's up ?uest?
My name is Jilani, and I'm a tech consultant

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:26.310
here,
and also a long time okayplayer.

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:27.310
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir] Oh, alright.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:31.099
&gt;&gt;[Jilani]: And, I was thinking back to what
you said earlier about when the Roots came

00:34:31.099 --> 00:34:34.419
out,
uh, I remember back to "Do You Want More,"

00:34:34.419 --> 00:34:37.351
and just thinking about how things have changed
now,

00:34:37.351 --> 00:34:41.690
and you said you felt like it might be a little
easier for people with Internet to get their

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:45.659
message out.
But I wonder if it's, if you think it's also

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:49.340
more challenging just because there's so much
material and the number of videos?

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:59.820
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: My manager told me that he had
a precise number, that there are...in existence

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:02.740
I think right now,
there's there's a site in which you actually

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:08.470
know the amount of unique mp3's that are on,
as far as songs on the Internet, and the,

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:15.130
the number was close to, I think he said,
like seventeen million unique songs created

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:26.000
on the Internet, of which only 29%, a very
small percent, even get heard. Like a lot

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.780
of kids create it,
put in on the Internet, and no downloads whatsoever.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:42.820
Um yeah, I think that the the floodgates,
and sort of the overabundance of information,

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:47.440
that sort of makes it harder to, like there's
so much

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:53.580
information out there as far as music is concerned,
and you know, it becomes overwhelming. Like

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:58.420
there's a record store
that I shop at in Pittsburgh called Jerry's,

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:02.820
you literally, you have to plan a four day
trek out there, because,

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:08.280
I'll start at ten, when I go there I'll go
there at like ten in the morning, by the time

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:13.590
he closes at eight, I might
get to the letter "C". That's how large, it's

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:19.810
like the largest warehouse of records ever.
So, I mean it's problematic,

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:25.990
which is why you sorta have to supplement
what you do with other forms to promote, you

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:28.599
know, what you do. So.

00:36:28.599 --> 00:36:30.880
&gt;&gt;[Jilani]: Just one quick follow up also,

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.880
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Sure.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.290
&gt;&gt;[Jilani]: can you talk a little about how
your own website has helped

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:39.210
launch a few careers? Like I remember Little
Brother, and Tonya Morgan, and etc.

00:36:39.210 --> 00:36:47.010
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Yeah, um, you know, I mean the
whole idea of okayplayer was to just, I guess,

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:55.210
provide a playground, for like mind, I wanted,
I wanted to just talk music with a bunch of

00:36:55.210 --> 00:37:04.230
people that I felt spoke my language. And
so, you know of course, under the guise of

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:08.180
the Roots albums then you know, I figured
that's where our fan base was,

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:15.990
and then, after about a year or so of of getting
through that whole awkwardness "Is this really

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:18.830
you, ?uest?"
Now, you know, two years into it, they felt

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:23.250
like they knew me and then we could,
like, some of those guys I really consider,

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:26.790
like, you know, I'm. I'm the student and they're
the teachers.

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:32.800
You know there's at least five or six guys
on there to whom, they're like my cabinet

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:36.390
members, even with my
walk on songs for Fallon, they're the ones,

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:39.320
you know, "Why don't ya try this one?" or
"Why don't ya try this one?"

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:48.310
You know, like, that site's very necessary.
It's like a music geek's, uh, haven.

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:53.109
I mean some of them are shock posters of course,
you know, it's like, well, you know, "Prince

00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:58.760
has seen his heyday back in 1992, after" You
know, they'll do shock posting, but, for the

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:04.500
most part, um, it's still to me
a very credible source of ..it's like a, it's

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.070
like a nice Pitchfork.
[laughter]

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:07.210
Sorry Pitchfork.

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:14.780
&gt;&gt;[male audience member]: Alright, ?uest,
again I'm like a huge fan of yours, going

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:19.200
way back. I'm old enough to
be like organic style, but I followed you

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.760
through uh, you know Betty Wright, and Philadelphia
Experiment, and

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:23.760
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Oh, thanks.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.510
&gt;&gt;[male audience member]: Soul Power Mix Tape,
and all that good stuff. Uh, I can remember

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:29.720
when the Roots first
were really getting a buzz, I was happy because

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.400
I thought ya know, hip hop was gonna all of
a sudden, go in this more instrumental,

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:40.220
musical direction and, you know, y’all are,
obviously, ubiquitous and have, you know,

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:44.250
changed the industry as much as it would
be possible to do. But I wondered whether

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:48.140
you thought towards the future, you know,
not now, you got a lot of stuff going on,

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:52.240
but towards like education, cause I've been
exposed to a lot of music from being a fan

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:56.670
of yours and following you, and, and I think
that you've got a lot of, uh, steam behind

00:38:56.670 --> 00:39:01.400
you to, to encourage people to broaden their
musical horizons and take a more historical

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.400
view.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.630
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Yeah, I thought that we would
spawn, and I think that speculation was like,

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:16.540
okay, we'll, we'll, we'll spawn a lot of bands.
Not the case, I think mostly because, again,

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:25.570
with us being the last band that was allowed,
not even allowed. I mean I'll, I guess I could

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:32.970
be, be honest. Because of the bidding war
situation that we were in with our record

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:38.420
label, we negotiate, instead of like, you
know, a lot of people like, when they're in

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:44.060
a bidding war, when like, labels are fighting
over each other, um, mostly people go for

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:52.610
the money. And my managers and lawyers decided
to go for the longevity. So, because, because

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:56.540
music was so disposable at the time, whereas,
like, okay, you're only good for your one

00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:04.050
hit, and then later for you, they organized
it so that we could never get dropped for

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:09.630
a long period of time. Like, cause really,
there's really no reason, like if you look

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:15.850
at it, I mean we've had two, well, I meant
and we had two very, we had like four slow

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:21.220
Gold Records, but, I mean most people see
it as, okay, Things Fall Apart and Phrenology,

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:26.780
our fourth and fifth album, as like our success
story. But there's really no reason why a

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:33.650
group with like not one dance hit, like we
never had like a hip hop jam, has lasted for

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:39.530
twenty years, this long with fifteen albums
under its belt, you know, surpassing the time,

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:47.440
time line of people I consider, like, you
know, like major hip hop contributors, um,

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:52.990
like there's just no logical reason for us
to have been here. A big part of it was that,

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:57.360
the way our contract was built, artist development
was a very important thing, and that's, that's

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:04.490
the problem with the industry now, like, they
don't believe in the long run of, okay, we'll

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:09.550
place you here now and then maybe by album
number five, you know, you'll have a following,

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:13.349
they don't believe in that, it's still, just,
it's very disposable. We need it now, we need

00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:17.790
it quick-fast, in a hurry, just add water,
poof, uh, no, see you later, goodbye. And

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:24.850
then they dispose of you. So, I'm, I'm, I'm
very thankful that my management and my lawyers,

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:30.800
orchestrated it so that, you know, if we made
album number one, we had to have made two,

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:36.710
three, and four, and then if we got to album
number five, we were forced to do six, seven,

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:40.730
and eight, and if we made it to album number
nine, ten, eleven, twelve. I mean, now we're

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:45.890
golden, but back then they would've easily
dropped us at, before Things Fall Apart, you

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:49.980
know, before we became realized.

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:54.950
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer] So what's the lesson here
?uestlove? Everybody needs a good lawyer is

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:57.203
the lesson? [crowd laughs Important words
for all of us.

00:41:57.203 --> 00:41:58.950
&gt;&gt;[male audience member] I did, I said I was
a lawyer, right?

00:41:58.950 --> 00:42:01.420
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer] Yeah, he is a lawyer.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:02.420
[crowd laughs]

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.890
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir laughs]: Everyone's a lawyer here!

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:05.330
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer] Everybody's a lawyer, everybody's
a lawyer, everybody, yeah.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:07.230
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Even the custodian goes, "yeah,
we're lawyers."

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:08.230
[crowd laughs]

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:10.960
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer] Um, I think we have time for
one more quick question.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.849
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: I don't care if I miss rehearsal.
Go ahead.

00:42:12.849 --> 00:42:13.849
&gt;&gt;[someone offstage] Oooh...

00:42:13.849 --> 00:42:14.849
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer] Alright, then we have time
for two.

00:42:14.849 --> 00:42:16.560
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir] I'm only playing NBC. Go ahead.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.560
[laughter]

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:22.380
&gt;&gt; Hey ?uest, my name is Brian, I do music
research for YouTube, I just have a question.

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:23.530
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir] And you're a lawyer?

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:24.530
&gt;&gt;[Brian] No.

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:25.530
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Okay.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:26.530
&gt;&gt;[Brian] God, no.

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:27.530
[laughter]

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:28.530
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: So I just had a question, just
about, you know, the artists that you've worked

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:33.400
with over the years, like, in particular,
like the Soulquarians, like just working with

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.400
J.D.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.400
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir] Mm-hm.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.320
&gt;&gt; In particular. I'm a huge fan of his, and...

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.320
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir] Thanks.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:45.490
&gt;&gt; So um, and I really hope you get that entire
lot, that'd be amazing. Uh, so uh, yeah, just

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:49.730
about the creative process, and, just, you
know, interacting with the guys, really, you

00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:52.060
know, getting into the nuts and bolts, and
really

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.060
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir] Um...

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:54.640
&gt;&gt; Hashing things out.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:43:01.869
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Well, uh, see, I don't want to
be like the, everyone has theirs, their side

00:43:01.869 --> 00:43:03.430
of the story of how it happened,

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:04.430
&gt;&gt;[Brian] Mm.

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:12.500
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir] Um, I'll just say that I'm probably
the, the, the member of my group, along with

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:18.250
my manager, Richard Nichols, like we, we tended
to see the scientific method of how things

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:24.170
work, and you know in the beginning we were
head scratching because we thought like okay

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:31.170
we're, we're something new and it wasn't just
enough to be like, you know, we would get

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:39.350
a lot of "oh I like you guys, but I don't
like rap but I like you guys" or "I hate Dr.

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:43.330
Dre and Snoop Dog and that's why I like you
guys." I mean I don't want to be the person

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:48.160
that, that's like just liking a girl because
she's beautiful, but then like okay, once

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.570
age catches on, when she's 50 and then you're
done with her because you had nothing else

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:56.370
in common, you don't want to start your relationship
with someone just because they hate the status

00:43:56.370 --> 00:44:03.940
quo. Um, so we were kind of head scratching
on why we really weren't catching on in that

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:09.590
particular market place. I mean a big part
of it had to do with the fact

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:14.589
that with Dr. Dre's The Chronic, you know,
that was the first time that a credible hip

00:44:14.589 --> 00:44:18.970
hop artist actually created a product
that sold in the millions, as opposed to you

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:23.050
know, like the platinum, multi-platinum success
of hip hop had to do

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:27.609
with artists that you were like, eh, well
they're not as good as Rock Em, or you know,

00:44:27.609 --> 00:44:35.370
this was this, The Chronic was like the first
credible album that had massive appeal. And

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:40.460
thus, unfortunately, as with most things in
hip hop, when something has mass appeal, then

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:44.230
everything else has to clone it, and then
it gets over saturated.

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:49.680
Um, so we were kind of odd, we were the odd
man out. Even though we made that caboose,

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:56.330
we kind of missed the front of the train,
which would have been De La Sol, The Jungle

00:44:56.330 --> 00:45:01.220
Brothers, Tribe Called Quest, Arrested Developments,
like a kind of closed with Diggable Planets.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:09.400
We kind of narrowly made it to that caboose
that left the station. And after our third

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:16.680
album, Illadelph Half Life, we were kind of
fearing, cause album number four was coming

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:22.210
up, and you already know our contract structure.
If we didn't make it happen by number four,

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:28.350
then we might not get number five. So we had
to make something happen and because we were

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:34.840
on a label, swimming in money, from the legacy
of Nirvana and Guns and Roses and Aerosmith,

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:43.750
we're on Geffen Records. We did a presentation.
We told them that nobody has success in music

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:51.450
unless it's contextualized with another product.
So in other words, if you look at Motown,

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:56.440
there's Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross and the
Supremes, The Temptations, Marvin Gaye, like

00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:01.670
that's a movement. Even the stuff you feel
indifferent about like let's say the disco

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:09.630
movement, you associate. Let's take Casablanca
Records, like The Village People, The Ritchie

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:14.240
Family. I like the Bee Gees, so I don't want
to say like I consider the Bee Gees like throw

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:19.680
away disco, but you get the point. That post
Saturday Night Fever thing. Like today, like

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:25.820
everyone's grouped you think of diggy music,
you think of oh Puffy, Little Kim, Foxy Brown,

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:31.140
JayZ, So, everything is contextualized and
sort of in a movement and the one thing we

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:37.210
notice that we didn't have was a movement.
We didn't have anybody, so we told them, in

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:42.161
order for you guys, you guys are spending
a lot of money on us. In order for you guys

00:46:42.161 --> 00:46:48.930
to really see the monetary results you want
to see, you're going to have to invest in

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:55.190
a movement. Now you've already invested six
years into us. What do you want to do? And

00:46:55.190 --> 00:47:00.330
they, they decided to, in a rare move, bite
the bullet and that was like a major ten million

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:06.760
dollar investment. They had to buy Common
out of his contract, of Relativity. Then we

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:10.480
just pointed the way. Alright, get Blackstar,
so they bought, they bought [unintelligible]

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:13.089
out of his thing,

00:47:13.089 --> 00:47:19.140
they gave Dilla his own record label with
MCA. We were trying to get Slum Village, but

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:24.910
that time Slum village signed Interscope.
And then the rest of the people we we either

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:34.070
just kidnapped. So, D'Angelo and I were like
two peas in a pod. By that point I had been

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:40.750
on my second year of working on Voodoo which
was a five year process. So being with D'Angelo

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:50.520
pulled in his, his kind of label, made Erica
Badu and working with her, and then pulling

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:57.109
in Palau. Next thing you know, like we're
all just working with each other.

00:47:57.109 --> 00:48:05.890
So, I'll say that at D'angelo's studio on,
on 8th avenue, 6th street, Electric Lady.

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:13.190
That was our epicenter from like 1996 to like
2002. We had that entire building on lock

00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:19.460
down so it was kind of crazy because you know,
we go in in the morning. Usually, like D'Angelo

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:24.160
is the type of person who is like you know
I'll show up at 1 o’clock but you know that

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:31.020
means like 8pm. So in the third week of that
you know Common is like you know I'm doing

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:38.640
my record, so can we work together, so Common
who's extremely responsible and so, like he

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:44.770
would come in from 9 in the morning and leave
around 6pm or 7pm. So we'd work in the same

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:54.950
studio with Common in the morning. And then
D'Angelo from 7pm till mmm, usually [groan]

00:48:54.950 --> 00:49:01.180
I'll say 6 in the morning. Yeah. And this
happened over and over.

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:07.180
And then you know, once it just became like
a big, giant sleepover, it's like college.

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:11.570
Because it wasn't just us working and "okay,
what songs are we going to work on." You come

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:18.780
there, and this is before the age of YouTube,
so a lot of people were sending me video performances

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:23.320
of like, Al Greene in concert and we'd sit
and watch that forever and over analyze it.

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:28.880
Then this Prince concert from 82 and then
you know I started acquiring my Soul Train

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:34.349
collection. And you know, cut to a year later,
we have an entire, like, I was like, I was,

00:49:34.349 --> 00:49:39.170
I was, I was a walking YouTube. Like anything
that you can search on now for YouTube from

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:43.339
old soul clips, I had that stuff. And we would
just watch it and watch it and watch it and

00:49:43.339 --> 00:49:48.369
study and watch it and watch it and watch
and watch it. And then go and create music.

00:49:48.369 --> 00:49:53.910
Eat. And then watch it and watch it and watch
it and watch it and watch it.

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:58.119
And then eventually, you know, after five
years of working, then all of our albums come

00:49:58.119 --> 00:50:04.380
out and then next thing you know, what the
Roots are going platinum? Ergo by Blues comes

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:12.750
out, D'Angelo's album comes out, Common's
album comes out, it just became a family vibe

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:23.020
and, and you know, that's probably one of
the best creative moments of, of, of, of my

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:29.640
career. Just like working in that environment.
And you know, it's sometimes, and you know

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:34.370
every day it wasn't a parade. Like some days
we'd have you know, the, the day that Dilla

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:40.400
discovered Madlib was one of the funniest
moments. Cause I'll say out of all of us,

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:47.150
J Dilla, was like, like he was like our guru.
He'll play like he's the underling, I don't

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:52.710
play drums like you, or I don't play keyboards
like him, but he was, he was like our guru.

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:58.820
Like we patterned our whole movement after
him. And one day he came in and he's like

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:05.820
"Yo, dog, like I don't know man." I'm like
what? "This album came out last week called

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:14.589
Lootpack." Yeah? He's like, "This producer
named Madlib, I don't know, I got to go back

00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:21.000
to Detroit." And like he left for, like he
was really depressed. Like there's some other

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:29.200
guy out there that makes crazy beats, crazier
than me. And like that's how he works. Like

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:34.230
he just works 8 hours a day doing beats, doing
beats and so, I mean eventually they pair

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:39.820
it up and became friends. But before it was
a problem, he just felt like O my god like,

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:44.109
threatened, I met my match. So, sorry for
this long drawn out story. He's enjoying it,

00:51:44.109 --> 00:51:45.109
but, yeah

00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:46.109
&gt;&gt;[Brian]: Thank you, thank you so much.

00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:47.370
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Yeah, you're welcome.

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:49.859
&gt;&gt;[female audience member]: I feel like he's
been waiting a long time. Yeah you're sure?

00:51:49.859 --> 00:51:55.490
I don't want to get you in trouble at NBC.

00:51:55.490 --> 00:52:02.520
&gt;&gt;[male audience member]: My name's Isaiah
I'm an engineer here, big time fan. Same thing.

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:05.950
And that also sounds like the life. Kinda
just chillin', watching soul videos and making

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:10.820
music so that's awesome. But my question is
about, basically, you talked about the mix

00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:14.910
tape culture we've got and also kind of like
the retail culture how those are kind of like

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:18.170
two separate things, and it's a pretty old
conversation to talk about you know, underground

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:23.530
versus mainstream. But why, what is it from
an artists' perspective, like recently you

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:29.160
have Buster signing to MMG, you've got Q-Tip
signing to Good Music. Why do artists feel

00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:33.300
now that they still have to be part of these
movements when someone like Meat can sell

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:38.290
2.5 in a day. Why do artists feel drawn to.

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:48.400
&gt;&gt; [Ahmir]: Independence is probably the scariest
thing. Cause even you know, as far as monetary

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:57.470
terms are concerned, like again, like having
a record deal might be still in my top 10,

00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:03.130
only because I am a record collector, do I
cherish having a record deal. And I enjoy

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:08.040
the fact that I've been on the same label
for the whole time so you know, I, I do have

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:15.360
those moments where I look at my catalog and
I see the same font for every Roots logo and

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:22.470
it's like wow that's really incredible, I
made 15 records, like these are my 15 kids.

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:36.760
I can't speak for those other artists, but
I think for some artists in particular, the

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:44.829
idea of having a plan B is a very frightening
option.

00:53:44.829 --> 00:53:50.350
Like it's almost like getting a needle at
the doctor. Like I used to hate, I used to,

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:57.329
I still hate getting needles. Quick story.
The last time I was at the dentist was like

00:53:57.329 --> 00:54:06.510
maybe 20 years ago. [laughter] Seriously.
And so because I had a really bad Novocaine

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:12.839
experience with like a student dentist in
like 1979 or something. So I stayed away.

00:54:12.839 --> 00:54:18.810
And of course you know you can't last in life
20 years not going to the dentist. And of

00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:22.160
course, people are like Ahmir you don't understand,
technology has changed, they have these things

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:26.320
called butterfly needles, you'll never feel
it. And of course you know my fear of like

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:31.810
"no no" but of course like now I can't eat
food because my teeth are about to fall out.

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:35.780
Of course I go to the dentist and you know,
I'm like closing my eyes and bracing myself.

00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:39.630
Alright let me know when it happens. He's
like "I already put it in." No, seriously!

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:43.720
[Ahmir snores] And then you know it's like
I never felt it.

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:51.230
So it's like the fear of the unknown sometimes
cripples you. And again, because of the time

00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:56.510
that we came out, we had to do five times
the work of the average artist. Like when

00:54:56.510 --> 00:55:01.240
we came out, people weren't rolling out the
red carpet, they weren't welcoming us with

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:07.521
open arms. They were like you guys are corny.
You aren't a real rap group. You don't even

00:55:07.521 --> 00:55:14.280
have a real deejay, literally, you know, you're
doing all this jazz stuff and like whatever,

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:22.190
it took, we, it took us so long to get their
respect. And once an audience did embrace

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:27.430
us who wasn't the prime hip hop audience,
we had to learn how to entertain them. That

00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:35.670
said, I'll say that having a plan B, like
I've done everything under the, I know this

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:41.580
is negative to say, but sort of under the
assumption that this is not going to work,

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:47.440
so let me do something else. You know, even
this Fallon gig. People are like "Oh man,

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:53.970
you guys finally got the exposure you want."
You know what I am thinking about? Conan O'Brien.

00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:55.900
[laughter]

00:55:55.900 --> 00:56:02.339
No, because Conan, Conan, Conan was still
shooting his show across the hall the first

00:56:02.339 --> 00:56:06.140
year and you know, I saw everything, the whole
staff and yeah "So you guys excited for California?"

00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:09.890
Oh my God, oh, I can't wait, I just sold my
house, it's a little risky, but Conan all

00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:13.960
talked to us, took us all out to dinner. I
just sold my house and I can't wait to go

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:20.540
to California it's going to be exciting. You
know, cut to nine months later and that's

00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:29.200
like my worst nightmare. Now, personally me,
I"m always having a plan E, plan F, plan G.

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:34.020
Like I never plan on anything being final.
So that said, and again I'm sorry for the

00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:40.840
long drawn out explanation. I just think that,
you know, that some artists are just set in

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:49.761
their ways and don't have another option.
You know. If this falls I could teach, I got

00:56:49.761 --> 00:56:55.880
a few college offers, I can teach somewhere.
If this falls, maybe I can become you know,

00:56:55.880 --> 00:57:05.869
the new face of food trucks. It will be a
little sad and ironic [laughter]. You know

00:57:05.869 --> 00:57:11.550
the irony is not fallen on me that, wow, I
could actually be, you know, a mega millionaire

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:13.000
off of something that I never.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Like the George Foreman grill?

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:20.109
Like, o my God, this is going to be my legacy?
But I'm not afraid and I think that people

00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:26.690
that aren't not afraid to explore and see
what's out there those are the people that

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:36.290
are going to swim. But I wish those guys luck
with their endeavors, but you know, as an

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:42.710
artist they always ask "What advice do you
have for me?" My new advice is always have

00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:43.710
a plan B.

00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:47.580
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: Well it seems like a good
note to end on. ?uestlove, thank you.

00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:48.580
&gt;&gt;[Ahmir]: Thank you.

00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:49.580
&gt;&gt;[Interviewer]: So much, it was a pleasure.

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:50.580
&gt;&gt;
