changing the Copyright Act to support
the things that Eric's group is doing

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360
the things that Eric's group is doing
 

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.480
the things that Eric's group is doing

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.120
and the other things that universities
and public broadcasters are doing and I

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:10.130
and public broadcasters are doing and I
 

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.930
and public broadcasters are doing and I
think that the critical thing I'm just

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:13.940
think that the critical thing I'm just
 

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.000

looking at some of the other comments I

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:16.010
looking at some of the other comments I
 

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.100
looking at some of the other comments I
had I wanted to really want time for us

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:18.110
had I wanted to really want time for us
 

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.980
had I wanted to really want time for us
to talk about these things I think the

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:20.990
to talk about these things I think the
 

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.860
to talk about these things I think the
critical thing as we look at all this is

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:23.870
critical thing as we look at all this is
 

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.840
critical thing as we look at all this is
to remember that the big mover in the

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:25.850
to remember that the big mover in the
 

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.940
to remember that the big mover in the

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.510
whatever we do is going to have to look
at what are the commercial models and

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:31.520
at what are the commercial models and
 

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.850
at what are the commercial models and
how can we take advantage of those

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:33.860
how can we take advantage of those
 

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.920
how can we take advantage of those
models and how can we find a place among
