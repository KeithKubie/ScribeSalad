on the case of neural networks with
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.120
on the case of neural networks with
what's called a single hidden layer she

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130
what's called a single hidden layer she
 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.250
what's called a single hidden layer she

the input layer of the neural network so

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590
the input layer of the neural network so
 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.709
the input layer of the neural network so
maybe not surprisingly this contains the

maybe not surprisingly this contains the
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.150
maybe not surprisingly this contains the
inputs to the neural network then

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160
inputs to the neural network then
 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.389
inputs to the neural network then
there's another layer of circles and

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
there's another layer of circles and
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.360
there's another layer of circles and
this is called a hidden layer of the

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370
this is called a hidden layer of the
 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.889
this is called a hidden layer of the

but the final layer here is formed by in
 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.180
but the final layer here is formed by in
this case just one note and this single

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190
this case just one note and this single
 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.939
this case just one note and this single
note layer is called the output layer

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949
note layer is called the output layer
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.160
note layer is called the output layer
and it's responsible for generating the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
and it's responsible for generating the
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.040
and it's responsible for generating the
predicted value Y hat in a neural

learning the training set contains

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
learning the training set contains
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.160
learning the training set contains
values of the inputs X as well as the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
values of the inputs X as well as the
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.740
values of the inputs X as well as the
target outputs Y so the term hidden

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
target outputs Y so the term hidden
 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.660

layer refers to the fact that in the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
layer refers to the fact that in the
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.910
layer refers to the fact that in the
training set the true values for these

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
training set the true values for these
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.770
training set the true values for these
nodes in the middle are not observed

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
nodes in the middle are not observed
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.450
nodes in the middle are not observed
that is you don't see what they should

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
that is you don't see what they should
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.039
that is you don't see what they should
be in the training set you see what the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
be in the training set you see what the
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.359
be in the training set you see what the
inputs are you see what the output

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369
inputs are you see what the output
 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.160
inputs are you see what the output
should be for the things in the hidden

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170
should be for the things in the hidden
 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.289
should be for the things in the hidden
layer are not seen in the training set

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299
layer are not seen in the training set
 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.929
layer are not seen in the training set
so that kind of explains the name hidden

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
so that kind of explains the name hidden
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.940
so that kind of explains the name hidden
layer just means you don't see it in the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950
layer just means you don't see it in the
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.710
layer just means you don't see it in the
training set let's introduce a bit more

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
training set let's introduce a bit more
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.840
training set let's introduce a bit more
notation whereas previously we were

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850
notation whereas previously we were
 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.020
notation whereas previously we were
using the vector X to denote the input

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030
using the vector X to denote the input
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.380
using the vector X to denote the input
features an alternative notation for the

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
features an alternative notation for the
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.710
features an alternative notation for the
values of the info features will be a

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720
values of the info features will be a
 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.719
values of the info features will be a
superscript square bracket 0 and the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
superscript square bracket 0 and the
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.569
superscript square bracket 0 and the
term a also stands for activations and

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
term a also stands for activations and
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.780
term a also stands for activations and
it refers to the values that different

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
it refers to the values that different
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.789
it refers to the values that different
layers of the neural network are passing

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
layers of the neural network are passing
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.580
layers of the neural network are passing
on to the subsequent layers so the input

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
on to the subsequent layers so the input
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.219
on to the subsequent layers so the input
layer passes on the value X to the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
layer passes on the value X to the
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.810
layer passes on the value X to the
hidden layer so we're going to call that

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820
hidden layer so we're going to call that
 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.569
hidden layer so we're going to call that
code the activations of the info layer

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579
code the activations of the info layer
 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.149
code the activations of the info layer
in superscript 0 the next layer the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
in superscript 0 the next layer the
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.850
in superscript 0 the next layer the
hidden layer will in turn generate some

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860
hidden layer will in turn generate some
 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.830
hidden layer will in turn generate some
set of activations which I'm going to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840
set of activations which I'm going to
 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.680
set of activations which I'm going to
write as a superscript square bracket 1

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
write as a superscript square bracket 1
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.770
write as a superscript square bracket 1
so particular this first

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780
so particular this first
 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.110
so particular this first
units or this first node will generate a

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120
units or this first node will generate a
 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.720
units or this first node will generate a
value a superscript square bracket 1

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730
value a superscript square bracket 1
 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.809
value a superscript square bracket 1
subscript 1 this second node we generate

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819
subscript 1 this second node we generate
 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.809
subscript 1 this second node we generate
the value now with a subscript 2 and so

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819
the value now with a subscript 2 and so
 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.900
the value now with a subscript 2 and so
on and so a superscript square bracket 1

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910
on and so a superscript square bracket 1
 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.470
on and so a superscript square bracket 1
this is a four dimensional vector or if

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480
this is a four dimensional vector or if
 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.479
this is a four dimensional vector or if
you want in Python occurs this period or

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489
you want in Python occurs this period or
 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.030
you want in Python occurs this period or
by one matrix or four column vector

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040
by one matrix or four column vector
 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.920
by one matrix or four column vector
which looks like this and it's four

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930
which looks like this and it's four
 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.840
which looks like this and it's four
dimensional because in this case we have

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850
dimensional because in this case we have
 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.530
dimensional because in this case we have
four nodes or four units or four hidden

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540
four nodes or four units or four hidden
 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.110
four nodes or four units or four hidden
units in this hidden layer then finally

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120
units in this hidden layer then finally
 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.940
units in this hidden layer then finally
the output layer will generate some

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950
the output layer will generate some
 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.949
the output layer will generate some
value a two which is just a real number

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959
value a two which is just a real number
 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.970
value a two which is just a real number
and so Y hat is going to take on the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980
and so Y hat is going to take on the
 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.400
and so Y hat is going to take on the
value of a 2 so this is analogous to how

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410
value of a 2 so this is analogous to how
 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.530
value of a 2 so this is analogous to how
in logistic regression we have Y hat

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540
in logistic regression we have Y hat
 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.500
in logistic regression we have Y hat
equals a and prolific regression which

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510
equals a and prolific regression which
 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.590
equals a and prolific regression which
we only had that one output layer so we

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600
we only had that one output layer so we
 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.910
we only had that one output layer so we
didn't use the superscript square

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920
didn't use the superscript square
 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.130
didn't use the superscript square
brackets but within your network we're

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140
brackets but within your network we're
 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.870
brackets but within your network we're
now going to use this superscript square

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880
now going to use this superscript square
 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.000
now going to use this superscript square
bracket to explicitly indicate which

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010
bracket to explicitly indicate which
 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.750
bracket to explicitly indicate which
layer it came from one funny thing about

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760
layer it came from one funny thing about
 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.400
layer it came from one funny thing about
notational conventions in your networks

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410
notational conventions in your networks
 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.259
notational conventions in your networks
is that this network that you're seeing

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269
is that this network that you're seeing
 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.840
is that this network that you're seeing
here is called a two layer on your

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850
here is called a two layer on your
 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.900
here is called a two layer on your
network and the reason is that when we

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910
network and the reason is that when we
 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.000
network and the reason is that when we
come layers in your networks we don't

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010
come layers in your networks we don't
 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.190
come layers in your networks we don't
count the input layer so the hidden

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200
count the input layer so the hidden
 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.530
count the input layer so the hidden
layer is layer 1 and your output layer

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540
layer is layer 1 and your output layer
 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.600
layer is layer 1 and your output layer
is layer to another notational

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610
is layer to another notational
 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.310
is layer to another notational
convention we're calling the input layer

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320
convention we're calling the input layer
 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.009
convention we're calling the input layer
layer 0 so technically maybe there are

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019
layer 0 so technically maybe there are
 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.360
layer 0 so technically maybe there are
three layers in this view Network

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370
three layers in this view Network

and lair and three comes from the fact

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480
and lair and three comes from the fact
 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.630
and lair and three comes from the fact
that we have three input features we'll

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640
that we have three input features we'll
 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.580
