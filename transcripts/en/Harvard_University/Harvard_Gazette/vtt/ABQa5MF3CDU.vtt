00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.530
we're in the Japanese galleries on the
second floor of the Metropolitan Museum

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.450
of Art these are the usual galleries of
Japanese art but we have now converted

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:37.080
them to this exhibition of The Tale of
Genji the story is like any masterwork

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.460
of literature when you read it at a
different time in your life it seems

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.920
completely new it always seems like a
wonder a mere court lady could have

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.320
written a thirteen hundred page book
with 54 chapters and some 500 characters

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.370
and one of the most remarkable things
about it is the way that it's written

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.550
how it really it has this uncanny way of
feeling like a modern novel there are

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.670
some wonderful pieces from the Harvard
Art Museum's that haven't really been

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.500
seen very much we have a beautiful
decorated book a prayer for Genji which

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.850
is this beautiful book from the 17th
century which is in a room where we talk

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.670
about the relationship between Buddhism
and the tale of genji there's a legend

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.720
that would Osaka Shikibu wrote The
Tale of Genji at ischium at a temple on

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.400
a moonlit night looking out after its
reflection on the waters of lake view up

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.930
and ever since that legend came about
the temple has been an important site

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.240
for worshipping what Osaka Shikibu for
the first time in the temples history it

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.159
will be headed by a woman why she'll you
Gabe and she agreed to officiate a

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.360
Buddhist ceremony consecrating the space
because these aren't just artworks they

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.369
are Buddhist sacred sculptures that have
a life of their own that need to be

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.000
cared for and venerated properly her
ceremony is going to do that today we

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.100
had not just a once-in-a-lifetime but
sort of a once in an age opportunity to

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.480
witness really an experience that's both
cosmopolitan and global and artistic but

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.900
also extremely Buddhist we were lucky
enough to have eight priests join us on

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.480
in celebrating this and consecrating the
exhibit there are numerous exhibitions

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.020
about Genji in Japan
and we learned a lot from all of those

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.560
and our colleagues work in those
previous exhibitions but we wanted to

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.830
share the full story in artworks outside
of Japan as well harford really opened

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.110
up my eyes in the sense that in Japan
when I was doing my training and when I

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.019
was studying it's a very textual based
and very ritual based and the thing that

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.670
really brings this together over time in
space is actually artistic and literary

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.980
works it's what connects us to the
people who encountered these amazing

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:08.730
ideas amazing places amazing divinities
