00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.210
X equals 2.

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:04.920
Like I mentioned before
this one is complicated and

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.380
I wouldn't be surprised if it took
you several tries to get it but

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.670
this is a great problem to practice on.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.675
All right, let's start by
writing this as 24 x plus -2

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:19.849
times (x+3)026=12.

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.890
That will help us keep
track of this negative

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.090
sign when we distribute
the 2 to the x and to the 3.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.898
All right, after distributing and
simplifying just a bit,

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:37.240
we get 24x+(-2x+-6)-26=12.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.428
I'm going to remove the parenthesis and
combine like terms, so

00:00:42.428 --> 00:00:48.314
to combine like terms I've written
the like terms next to each other,

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:51.605
and 24 x minus 2x becomes 22x, and

00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:57.480
-6 minus 26 becomes -32, so, 22x-32 =12.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.000
Now let's get rid of this 32
by adding 32 to both sides.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.751
And we get 22x + 0 = 12 + 32.

00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:09.186
And then we get 22x = 44.

00:01:09.186 --> 00:01:12.340
We'll divide both sides by 22.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.184
And x equals 44 over 22 which equals 2.
