00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.130
- [Narrator] Have you ever really tried

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.460
to learn something

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.210
and you just couldn't?

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.050
It can make you feel like
you're not so smart, right?

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.950
Well, it's not your fault

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.760
and it's not your teacher's fault,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.520
it's just our traditional
approach to learning.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.227
We go through a school
and we accumulate gaps.

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:20.350
You're a bit shaky on pre-algebra,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.680
but you move on to algebra anyway.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.300
By the time you get to calculus,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.030
you've got lots of gaps.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.510
If enough gaps build up

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.140
you eventually hit a wall.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.650
Calculus makes no sense

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.170
and that can be frustrating.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.640
But what if there were a
different way to learn?

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.200
That's mastery learning.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.600
Unlike traditional learning

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.530
where all students move in lockstep,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.580
with mastery learning
you go at your own pace.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.770
You progress through questions

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.760
at just the right level for you.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.840
If you get 50% right the first time

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.270
it's not a big deal.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.540
Try as many times as you need.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.200
Get feedback as you learn,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.890
and help when you need it.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.750
Teachers can track your progress,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.160
identify any gaps,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.460
and give you one on one attention.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.080
Decades of research shows,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.380
mastery learning works.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.610
Now you have the tools
to make it possible.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.803
Are you ready to learn anything?
