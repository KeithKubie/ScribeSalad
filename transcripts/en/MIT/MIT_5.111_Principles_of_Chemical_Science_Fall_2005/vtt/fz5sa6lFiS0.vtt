00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.727
All right.
Today, in particular the second

00:00:09.727 --> 00:00:14.727
half of the lecture today,
we're going to do some of the

00:00:14.727 --> 00:00:20.181
hardest concepts that we've done
so far, and also some of the

00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:24.363
most important concepts that
we've done so far.

00:00:24.363 --> 00:00:29.000
I just want to give you a
heads-up on that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.082
Last time we had we had solved
the Schrödinger equation for the

00:00:35.082 --> 00:00:39.693
binding energies of the electron
to the nucleus.

00:00:39.693 --> 00:00:45.284
And that means if I write the
generic Schrödinger equation

00:00:45.284 --> 00:00:49.601
down here, what we found was
what this E was.

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:54.212
And we found that it had a nice
analytical form,

00:00:54.212 --> 00:01:00.000
that the allowed binding
energies were quantized.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.586
They were quantized by that
principle quantum number n.

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:11.275
And so we can write those
allowed energies as E sub n is

00:01:11.275 --> 00:01:16.344
minus R sub H over n squared.

00:01:16.344 --> 00:01:21.000
So, n is this principle quantum
number.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.260
And n runs from 1,
2 all the way up to infinity.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.427
Today what we're going to do is
we're going to look at the

00:01:37.427 --> 00:01:41.597
solutions to the Schrödinger
equation for this,

00:01:41.597 --> 00:01:44.770
for the wave function,
for the wave.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.031
And remember we said that the
wave, in some way,

00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:53.926
represents our electron.
And today we are going to talk

00:01:53.926 --> 00:02:00.000
about exactly what is the
meaning of the wave function.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.084
But, before we do that,
I have to tell you that when

00:02:05.084 --> 00:02:11.166
you go to solve the Schrödinger
equation for the wave function

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:17.048
here, what happens is that two
more quantum numbers pop out.

00:02:17.048 --> 00:02:23.229
And one of the quantum numbers
that pop out in the solution for

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:27.915
the wave function is a quantum
number we call l.

00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:33.000
l is the angular momentum
quantum number.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.084
It's called the angular
momentum quantum number because

00:02:38.084 --> 00:02:43.827
it, in fact, determines how much
angular momentum the electron

00:02:43.827 --> 00:02:46.370
has.
It is a quantum number,

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.548
which means it has allowed
values, very specific values.

00:02:51.548 --> 00:02:55.409
The allowed values of l are the
following.

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.363
They are 0.
Unlike n, the lowest value that

00:02:59.363 --> 00:03:04.513
l can have is 0.
0, 1, 2, 3 all the way up,

00:03:04.513 --> 00:03:08.477
but it has got a limit.
l has got a limit.

00:03:08.477 --> 00:03:12.151
The limit is n minus one.

00:03:12.151 --> 00:03:16.114
So l can never be larger than n
minus one.

00:03:16.114 --> 00:03:20.078
It's tied to the principal
quantum number.

00:03:20.078 --> 00:03:24.525
Why is it tied to the principal
quantum number?

00:03:24.525 --> 00:03:29.939
Well, notice that only the
principle quantum number tells

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:36.326
you about the binding energy.
It tells you about the total

00:03:36.326 --> 00:03:40.647
energy of this electron
interacting with the nucleus.

00:03:40.647 --> 00:03:45.467
Whereas, the quantum number l,
the angular momentum quantum

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:50.369
number, it determines how much
angular momentum the electron

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:53.028
has.
And, in a classical picture,

00:03:53.028 --> 00:03:57.848
you may be familiar with the
fact that if something has got

00:03:57.848 --> 00:04:01.338
angular momentum,
it has rotational kinetic

00:04:01.338 --> 00:04:05.409
energy.
And since the total energy is

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.730
that rotational kinetic energy
plus potential energy,

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.636
well, then l is never going to
be as large as n,

00:04:13.636 --> 00:04:17.790
because otherwise then the
electron would only have

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.862
rotational kinetic energy and no
potential energy.

00:04:21.862 --> 00:04:24.272
And that wouldn't work,
right?

00:04:24.272 --> 00:04:29.424
So, that's why there is a limit
here to l that is as large as n

00:04:29.424 --> 00:04:34.980
minus 1.
Because you have to leave some

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.357
energy to be potential energy
here.

00:04:38.357 --> 00:04:42.629
And then, finally,
we have the third quantum

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.205
number.
And that third quantum number

00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:49.781
we call m.
It is the magnetic quantum

00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:52.960
number.
And it is called magnetic

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.629
because, in fact,
it does determine the behavior

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:05.111
of an atom in a magnetic field.
Although, we're actually not

00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:11.444
going to take a look at that.
But more specifically what m

00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:17.000
is, is the z-component of the
angular momentum.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And its allowed values are the
following.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.646
It's allowed values are n
equals 0,

00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:41.163
so just like l,
it can have a value of zero,

00:05:41.163 --> 00:05:46.168
plus 1, plus 2 all the way up
to plus l.

00:05:46.168 --> 00:05:51.685
Look at this.
The magnetic quantum number is

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:57.203
tied to the angular momentum
quantum number.

00:05:57.203 --> 00:06:01.072
Why?
Well, because this is the

00:06:01.072 --> 00:06:05.549
z-component of the angular
momentum, or it dictates the

00:06:05.549 --> 00:06:08.450
z-component of the angular
momentum.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.518
l dictated the total angular
momentum.

00:06:11.518 --> 00:06:16.409
Well, the z-component of the
angular momentum is never going

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:20.056
to be bigger than the total
angular momentum,

00:06:20.056 --> 00:06:23.787
so that is why n is tied to l.
And, of course,

00:06:23.787 --> 00:06:28.927
when we talk about a component,
we're going to have a direction

00:06:28.927 --> 00:06:34.274
here, too.
And so these quantum numbers m

00:06:34.274 --> 00:06:39.950
can be 0 plus or minus 1,
plus or minus 2 all the way

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.207
down to plus or minus l.
So, that is it.

00:06:44.207 --> 00:06:50.866
We've got to have three quantum
numbers here to really explain

00:06:50.866 --> 00:06:54.686
our system.
The reason we have three

00:06:54.686 --> 00:07:02.000
quantum numbers is because we
have a 3-dimensional system.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.376
So it a little bit makes sense
that you've got to have three

00:07:06.376 --> 00:07:10.604
quantum numbers to really
describe the hydrogen atom here.

00:07:10.604 --> 00:07:14.535
And then the consequence of
having these three quantum

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:18.244
numbers, when you solve that
differential equation,

00:07:18.244 --> 00:07:22.695
remember we talked last time
where those quantum numbers come

00:07:22.695 --> 00:07:25.884
from when you solve a
differential equation,

00:07:25.884 --> 00:07:31.632
as you will when you do 18.03.
Those quantum numbers come from

00:07:31.632 --> 00:07:36.219
imposing these boundary
conditions on your differential

00:07:36.219 --> 00:07:39.531
equation.
Those boundary conditions make

00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:43.778
a generic or general
differential equation specific

00:07:43.778 --> 00:07:46.495
to the problem you're working
on.

00:07:46.495 --> 00:07:50.487
And when you do that,
those quantum numbers fall

00:07:50.487 --> 00:07:53.884
right out.
And, again, we believe them to

00:07:53.884 --> 00:08:00.000
be true because they agree with
our observations of nature.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.341
Now we've got to deal with
three quantum numbers that are

00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:10.777
going to have to then describe
these states that we talked

00:08:10.777 --> 00:08:13.447
about last time.
For example,

00:08:13.447 --> 00:08:18.979
we talked about the ground
state, n is equal to 1

00:08:18.979 --> 00:08:22.317
here.
But what I'm saying to you now

00:08:22.317 --> 00:08:27.945
is that there are a few more
quantum numbers that we have to

00:08:27.945 --> 00:08:33.000
add to label that ground state
correctly.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.258
Or, to label it completely.
And, as I just said,

00:08:37.258 --> 00:08:41.608
if n is equal to 1,
well, then we learned about l

00:08:41.608 --> 00:08:44.508
here.
l, the largest value it can

00:08:44.508 --> 00:08:48.948
have, is n minus 1.
So, we have a quantum number l

00:08:48.948 --> 00:08:53.207
that is tied here.
And that quantum number is 0.

00:08:53.207 --> 00:08:57.103
l is equal to 0.
And we just learned that we

00:08:57.103 --> 00:09:01.000
have a third quantum number,
m.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.749
And the greatest value that m
can have is plus l.

00:09:05.749 --> 00:09:10.102
So, if l is 0 then m is 0.
And so, therefore,

00:09:10.102 --> 00:09:14.653
our ground state,
the label that we have got to

00:09:14.653 --> 00:09:19.204
put to our ground state is the
(1, 0, 0) state.

00:09:19.204 --> 00:09:24.547
So, we're expanding our
definition of the label of that

00:09:24.547 --> 00:09:29.000
state.
Last time it was n equals 1.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.722
Now it is (1,
0, 0).

00:09:30.722 --> 00:09:35.345
And, if we have an electron in
that (1, 0, 0) state,

00:09:35.345 --> 00:09:40.692
then we're going to have a wave
function that describes that

00:09:40.692 --> 00:09:44.046
electron.
That electron is going to be

00:09:44.046 --> 00:09:49.394
represented by a wave function.
That wave function is psi(1,

00:09:49.394 --> 00:09:51.932
0, 0).
The energy of that (1,

00:09:51.932 --> 00:09:57.008
0, 0) state is minus the
Rydberg constant over 1 squared.

00:09:57.008 --> 00:10:03.011
Just like we had last time.

00:10:03.011 --> 00:10:07.807
Now, suppose we had the first
excited state,

00:10:07.807 --> 00:10:12.938
which was n equal 2,
as we looked at last time.

00:10:12.938 --> 00:10:18.515
If n is equal to 2,
what is the smallest value that

00:10:18.515 --> 00:10:20.299
l can have?
Zero.

00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:26.100
And if l is equal to 0,
what is the only value that m

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.000
can have?
Zero.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.032
We have now a state that is the
(2, 0, 0) state.

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:37.407
And, if you have an electron in
the (2, 0, 0) state,

00:10:37.407 --> 00:10:42.554
we're going to describe that
electron by a wave function that

00:10:42.554 --> 00:10:45.471
we're going to label psi (2,
0, 0).

00:10:45.471 --> 00:10:49.418
And the energy of that state,
we saw last time,

00:10:49.418 --> 00:10:52.249
minus the Rydberg constant over
4.

00:10:52.249 --> 00:10:56.367
But if n is equal to 2,
we also just saw that the

00:10:56.367 --> 00:11:01.000
quantum number l can have
another value.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.278
And that is one.
And if l is equal to 1,

00:11:04.278 --> 00:11:07.724
what is the largest value that
m can have?

00:11:07.724 --> 00:11:10.582
One.
And so we've got another state

00:11:10.582 --> 00:11:12.011
here.
It's the (2,

00:11:12.011 --> 00:11:15.542
1, 1) state.
And, if you've got an electron

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:18.820
in the (2, 1,
1) state, that electron is

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.779
going to be described by a wave
function that we're going to

00:11:23.779 --> 00:11:26.049
call the psi(2,
1, 1) state,

00:11:26.049 --> 00:11:30.000
the psi(2, 1,
1) wave function.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.950
Notice that the energy of this
state is still minus the Rydberg

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:40.077
constant over 4.
It is the

00:11:40.077 --> 00:11:42.668
same as the (2,
0, 0) state.

00:11:42.668 --> 00:11:46.699
These two states are said to be
degenerate.

00:11:46.699 --> 00:11:50.250
Degenerate means have the same
energy.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.857
If n is equal to 2,
then l of course can be equal

00:11:54.857 --> 00:11:58.120
to 1.
What's the next smaller value

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.431
that m can have?
Zero.

00:12:01.431 --> 00:12:03.931
So, we have a (2,
1, 0) state.

00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:08.155
If an electron is in that
state, the wave function

00:12:08.155 --> 00:12:11.344
describing that electron is (2,
1, 0).

00:12:11.344 --> 00:12:16.431
Again, the energy here is minus
the Rydberg constant over 4.

00:12:16.431 --> 00:12:21.172
Same energy because the energy
is only dictated by the n

00:12:21.172 --> 00:12:24.017
quantum number.
And then, finally,

00:12:24.017 --> 00:12:28.844
what's the smallest value m can
be if you have n equal 2,

00:12:28.844 --> 00:12:32.140
l equal 1?
Negative 1.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.251
So, we have a (2,
1, -1) state.

00:12:35.251 --> 00:12:41.266
The wave function describing
that electron in that state is

00:12:41.266 --> 00:12:44.481
the psi(2, 1,
-1) wave function.

00:12:44.481 --> 00:12:50.600
Now, I described the electrons
in these states by these wave

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.162
functions psi.
But there is another language,

00:12:55.162 --> 00:13:01.545
as I alluded to last time.
Another language that is used

00:13:01.545 --> 00:13:06.460
to describe the wave functions.
And that language is this

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:10.234
orbital language.
We talked last time how an

00:13:10.234 --> 00:13:14.183
orbital is nothing other than a
wave function.

00:13:14.183 --> 00:13:18.835
It is the solution to the
Schrödinger equation for the

00:13:18.835 --> 00:13:22.784
hydrogen atom.
It is actually the spatial part

00:13:22.784 --> 00:13:27.172
of the wave function,
meaning there is another part

00:13:27.172 --> 00:13:32.000
of the wave function called the
spin part.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.368
But we will look at that a
little bit later.

00:13:35.368 --> 00:13:39.754
And how are we going to label
these wave functions in the

00:13:39.754 --> 00:13:43.514
orbital language?
Well, we're going to label them

00:13:43.514 --> 00:13:46.099
by the principle quantum number
n.

00:13:46.099 --> 00:13:49.467
And, of course,
the angular momentum quantum

00:13:49.467 --> 00:13:54.167
number l and then a subscript
here m for the magnetic quantum

00:13:54.167 --> 00:13:56.908
number.
But what we do is instead of

00:13:56.908 --> 00:14:02.000
using the actual value of l,
we have a letter code.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.872
For example,
if l is equal to 0,

00:14:04.872 --> 00:14:09.412
we call that the s orbital.
In the case of the (1,

00:14:09.412 --> 00:14:13.396
0, 0) state,
if you have an electron in that

00:14:13.396 --> 00:14:18.862
state, the wave function that
describes that electron is the

00:14:18.862 --> 00:14:22.939
1s orbital or the psi(1,
0, 0) wave function.

00:14:22.939 --> 00:14:26.274
This is the principal quantum
number.

00:14:26.274 --> 00:14:31.000
This is the code s for l is
equal to 0.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.211
And then, likewise,
in the (2, 0,

00:14:34.211 --> 00:14:39.730
0) state, the wave function
that describes that electron

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:43.844
will be 2s.
Because here is the n equals 2

00:14:43.844 --> 00:14:47.557
and then our code for l equals 0
is s.

00:14:47.557 --> 00:14:52.975
Now, when l is equal 1,
again, we don't use l equals 1,

00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:56.287
we use a letter.
That letter is p.

00:14:56.287 --> 00:15:01.581
We call that a p orbital.
This state here,

00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:06.822
the (2, 1, 1) state is going to
be a 2p wave function,

00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:12.556
or the electron in it is going
to be represented by this 2p

00:15:12.556 --> 00:15:16.906
wave function.
The same thing for this state.

00:15:16.906 --> 00:15:22.740
They're all 2p's because l is
equal to 1 for all these three

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:28.276
states and n is equal to 2.
Now, if I had here an angular

00:15:28.276 --> 00:15:35.000
momentum quantum number of 2,
we'd call that a d orbital.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.179
If I had one that l equals 3,
I would call that an f orbital,

00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:44.582
and so on and so forth.
But now, what I haven't said

00:15:44.582 --> 00:15:48.726
anything about yet,
is the m quantum number here.

00:15:48.726 --> 00:15:51.489
Again, we've got a code for
this.

00:15:51.489 --> 00:15:55.287
We're actually not going to use
the number m.

00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:59.000
We are going to use some
letters.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.140
And the code is that when m is
equal to 0 we are going to put a

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:09.696
z subscript here on this p
orbital designation,

00:16:09.696 --> 00:16:14.351
when m is equal to 0.
When m is equal to 1 we're

00:16:14.351 --> 00:16:19.897
going to be an x subscript on
this p orbital designation,

00:16:19.897 --> 00:16:26.038
and when m is equal to minus 1
we're going to put a y subscript

00:16:26.038 --> 00:16:32.545
on this p orbital designation.
Now, I should tell you that

00:16:32.545 --> 00:16:36.693
what I just did here is not
actually correct.

00:16:36.693 --> 00:16:40.747
In other words,
m is equal to 1 isn't really

00:16:40.747 --> 00:16:46.309
the x subscript and m is equal
to minus 1 isn't really the y

00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:50.175
subscript.
The reason is because these two

00:16:50.175 --> 00:16:54.511
p wave functions,
when m is 1 and m is minus 1,

00:16:54.511 --> 00:17:00.169
they're complex functions.
And what we do is we do some

00:17:00.169 --> 00:17:04.509
linear combination of the m
equals 1 and m equals minus 1

00:17:04.509 --> 00:17:09.005
wave functions to get what we
call the px wave function and

00:17:09.005 --> 00:17:12.182
the py wave function.
One is a plus linear

00:17:12.182 --> 00:17:14.972
combination.
One is a negative linear

00:17:14.972 --> 00:17:17.917
combination.
You're not responsible for

00:17:17.917 --> 00:17:20.009
that.
Therefore, you are not

00:17:20.009 --> 00:17:23.420
responsible for knowing when m
is equal to 1,

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.752
we have an x and when m is
equal to minus 1,

00:17:26.752 --> 00:17:31.685
we have a y.
You are responsible for knowing

00:17:31.685 --> 00:17:35.929
when m is equal to 0,
you have a z subscript here.

00:17:35.929 --> 00:17:39.307
Now, I should make one other
point here.

00:17:39.307 --> 00:17:42.251
And that is,
you see I don't have a

00:17:42.251 --> 00:17:45.543
subscript here for m on the s
orbitals.

00:17:45.543 --> 00:17:49.094
Well, in an s state,
when l is equal to 0,

00:17:49.094 --> 00:17:53.598
there is only one possible
value of m, which is zero.

00:17:53.598 --> 00:17:56.976
And so we just leave out that
subscript.

00:17:56.976 --> 00:18:02.000
We don't put a z here on the s
designation.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.322
What does this mean,
the fact that we've got these

00:18:07.322 --> 00:18:12.753
extra quantum numbers?
Well, it means we have extra

00:18:12.753 --> 00:18:15.361
states.
And these states,

00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:21.987
actually, though have the same
energies that we saw last time.

00:18:21.987 --> 00:18:28.396
But let's try to expand that a
little bit and draw an energy

00:18:28.396 --> 00:18:36.000
level diagram so that we really
understand what is going on.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.867
Here is my energy level
diagram, energy going up this

00:18:41.867 --> 00:18:45.140
way.
And when n is equal to 1,

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:51.346
then, our quantum numbers,
the most complete description

00:18:51.346 --> 00:18:54.392
here is the (1,
0, 0) state.

00:18:54.392 --> 00:19:01.050
And the electron in that state
has the wave function that is

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:07.970
represents that electron.
We call that the 1s wave

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:11.435
function.
That is the energy.

00:19:11.435 --> 00:19:17.500
When n is equal to 2,
you see now we have now four

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:23.069
different states that are all
the same energy,

00:19:23.069 --> 00:19:25.173
2s, 2py, 2pz,
2px.

00:19:25.173 --> 00:19:31.818
They have all the same energy.
They are degenerate.

00:19:31.818 --> 00:19:36.000
Again, degenerate means having
the same energy.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.909
And, in general,
what we've got is n squared

00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:45.090
degenerate states at each end.
So, these have all the same

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.545
energy.
They differ in how much angular

00:19:48.545 --> 00:19:53.818
momentum the electron has and
how much angular momentum the

00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:59.454
electron has in the z direction
if it were in the presence of a

00:19:59.454 --> 00:20:05.123
magnetic field.
But they have the same energy

00:20:05.123 --> 00:20:11.046
because energy is only dictated
by the n quantum number.

00:20:11.046 --> 00:20:16.969
Now, when n is equal to 3,
how many degenerate states do

00:20:16.969 --> 00:20:18.369
we have?
Nine.

00:20:18.369 --> 00:20:23.215
Here they are.
The energy is minus 1 ninth the

00:20:23.215 --> 00:20:28.061
Rydberg constant.
Here are the nine degenerate

00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:31.695
states.
3s, 3py, 3pz,

00:20:31.695 --> 00:20:35.869
3px.
That pattern just reproduces

00:20:35.869 --> 00:20:41.086
2s, 2py, 2pz,
2px, so we won't go through

00:20:41.086 --> 00:20:45.521
those.
But now we've got some extra

00:20:45.521 --> 00:20:50.739
states here.
Again, their quantum numbers

00:20:50.739 --> 00:20:54.913
are all 3 for n,
but when n is 3,

00:20:54.913 --> 00:21:03.606
the largest value of l is 2.
And so all of these states here

00:21:03.606 --> 00:21:09.540
have l is equal to 2.
And our code for l is equal to

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:15.125
2 were these d states.
If you have an electron in

00:21:15.125 --> 00:21:20.012
those states,
it's represented by a 3d wave

00:21:20.012 --> 00:21:24.317
function.
But now, the reason these 3d

00:21:24.317 --> 00:21:31.531
wave functions differ is because
they have different amounts of

00:21:31.531 --> 00:21:37.000
angular momentum in the z
component.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.856
They have different values of
m.

00:21:40.856 --> 00:21:44.837
If n is equal to 3,
l is equal 2.

00:21:44.837 --> 00:21:50.559
This smallest value that m can
have is minus 2,

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:54.665
right?
And then I am going to just

00:21:54.665 --> 00:22:03.000
call, when m is equal to minus
2, xy here in the subscript.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.948
When m is equal to minus 1,
I am going to put yz in this

00:22:07.948 --> 00:22:10.737
subscript.
When m is equal to 0,

00:22:10.737 --> 00:22:14.785
I am going to put z squared in
this subscript.

00:22:14.785 --> 00:22:19.013
That is going to be my code for
m is equal to 0.

00:22:19.013 --> 00:22:23.782
In the case of the 3d orbitals,
the 3d wave functions,

00:22:23.782 --> 00:22:29.000
I am going to put a z squared
in that subscript.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.299
Then when m is equal to 1,
I am putting an xz.

00:22:33.299 --> 00:22:38.363
And when m is equal to 2,
an x squared minus y squared.

00:22:38.363 --> 00:22:42.566
Again, you are now responsible

00:22:42.566 --> 00:22:48.299
for knowing when m is minus 2,
this is xy, when m is minus 1,

00:22:48.299 --> 00:22:52.789
this is yz, because that isn't
strictly correct.

00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:59.000
Again, we've complex functions.
We're making them real.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.424
And we're taking linear
combinations.

00:23:02.424 --> 00:23:08.226
You are responsible for knowing
that when m is equal to 0 in a

00:23:08.226 --> 00:23:12.221
3d state, this subscript here is
z squared.

00:23:12.221 --> 00:23:17.548
When m is equal to 0 in a 2p
state, that's a z subscript.

00:23:17.548 --> 00:23:22.590
When m is equal to 0 in a 3d
state, that's a z squared

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.919
subscript.
You will look at these 3d

00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:31.626
states more in detail when we
talk about transition metals in

00:23:31.626 --> 00:23:38.000
the second half of the course
with Professor Drennan.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.987
So, that's our energy level
diagram.

00:23:41.987 --> 00:23:45.974
Everybody okay with this?
Questions?

00:23:45.974 --> 00:23:47.000
Okay.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.526
We've found these two other
quantum numbers.

00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:07.789
We've got three quantum
numbers.

00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:13.684
We know how to label the
states, and we know how to label

00:24:13.684 --> 00:24:20.210
the wave functions that describe
the electrons in these states,

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:26.315
but now it's time to talk about
what a wave function really

00:24:26.315 --> 00:24:32.210
means, or how exactly does a
wave function represent this

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:39.857
particle, this electron.
How do you interpret the wave

00:24:39.857 --> 00:24:43.449
function?
And the answer is,

00:24:43.449 --> 00:24:48.504
you don't.
The answer is that that wave

00:24:48.504 --> 00:24:56.087
function is the wave function.
It is one of these concepts

00:24:56.087 --> 00:25:05.000
that you cannot or you don't
have a ready classical analogy.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.941
It's one of these concepts that
you don't experience in your

00:25:11.941 --> 00:25:17.235
everyday life,
and so you cannot say it's like

00:25:17.235 --> 00:25:23.823
this, because within your
everyday world there is nothing

00:25:23.823 --> 00:25:30.294
to draw a correct analogy to.
However, the wave function

00:25:30.294 --> 00:25:36.176
squared does have a physical
interpretation that is

00:25:36.176 --> 00:25:43.454
meaningful in your environment.
And that is that this wave

00:25:43.454 --> 00:25:47.703
function squared,
and let me just write it out

00:25:47.703 --> 00:25:52.991
here now in its full glory.
Remember, this wave function,

00:25:52.991 --> 00:25:57.334
we're going to denote by three
quantum numbers,

00:25:57.334 --> 00:26:03.000
n, l and m, and it's a function
of r, theta, and phi.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.540
If I take this wave function
and I square it,

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:16.222
the interpretation of that wave
function squared is that it is

00:26:16.222 --> 00:26:20.000
the probability density --

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000
-- that is it is a probability
per unit volume.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.141
A density is always per unit
volume.

00:26:36.141 --> 00:26:40.637
So, it's a probability per unit
volume.

00:26:40.637 --> 00:26:45.251
Where did that come from?
Good question.

00:26:45.251 --> 00:26:51.404
Soon after Schrödinger wrote
down his wave equations,

00:26:51.404 --> 00:26:58.030
there was a lot of discussion
in the scientific community

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:06.211
about what does psi really mean.
What is the interpretation of

00:27:06.211 --> 00:27:09.201
psi?
And there were a lot of

00:27:09.201 --> 00:27:14.739
interpretations given,
a lot of explanations given,

00:27:14.739 --> 00:27:19.280
but finally,
one very cleaver scientist by

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:25.482
the name of Max Born said,
if I think of psi squared as a

00:27:25.482 --> 00:27:30.465
probability density,
then I can understand the

00:27:30.465 --> 00:27:37.000
predictions that the Schrödinger
equation makes.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.970
So, psi squared is an
interpretation.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:47.147
He said, if I think of psi
squared as the probability per

00:27:47.147 --> 00:27:53.544
unit volume and then I go and
analyze all of the results of

00:27:53.544 --> 00:27:59.830
solving the Schrödinger equation
in terms of that concept,

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:07.000
that it is a probability
density, then things make sense.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.031
And those predictions agree
with my observations.

00:28:13.031 --> 00:28:16.047
You know what?
That's it.

00:28:16.047 --> 00:28:21.324
There is no derivation here of
psi squared.

00:28:21.324 --> 00:28:26.979
Psi squared is just that.
It is an assumption.

00:28:26.979 --> 00:28:32.711
It is an interpretation.
But, you know what,

00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:37.934
you use that interpretation and
that makes predictions that

00:28:37.934 --> 00:28:43.068
agree with our observations.
And there are no observations

00:28:43.068 --> 00:28:47.841
that even hint that that
interpretation isn't correct.

00:28:47.841 --> 00:28:51.444
But that is it.
You don't go any further.

00:28:51.444 --> 00:28:56.487
There's no derivation of this.
This is an interpretation.

00:28:56.487 --> 00:29:02.138
It is a probability density.
Well, this gentleman,

00:29:02.138 --> 00:29:06.109
Max Born, was a really clever
scientist.

00:29:06.109 --> 00:29:10.996
Max Born is the same Born of
something called the

00:29:10.996 --> 00:29:16.799
Born-Oppenheimer approximation
that maybe some of you know

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:20.058
about.
It is the same Born of the

00:29:20.058 --> 00:29:23.418
Distorted-Wave Born
Approximation,

00:29:23.418 --> 00:29:28.000
which probably nobody knows
about.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.273
But I've got to tell you that
despite the fact that Max Born

00:29:33.273 --> 00:29:36.134
has all of these
accomplishments,

00:29:36.134 --> 00:29:40.513
the interpretation of psi
squared is a probability

00:29:40.513 --> 00:29:44.357
density, the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation,

00:29:44.357 --> 00:29:47.664
the Distorted-Wave Born
Approximation,

00:29:47.664 --> 00:29:50.882
despite all of those
accomplishments,

00:29:50.882 --> 00:29:55.441
he is best known for being the
grandfather of Olivia

00:29:55.441 --> 00:30:00.000
Newton-John.
[LAUGHTER] That is true.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.766
Actually, a couple of weeks ago
in the Boston Globe,

00:30:04.766 --> 00:30:10.000
and I guess papers throughout
the country, has a magazine

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.953
called Parade Magazine.
And it actually had an article

00:30:14.953 --> 00:30:19.719
about Olivia Newton-John,
if somebody is going who's

00:30:19.719 --> 00:30:24.112
Olivia Newton-John,
that's just an indication of

00:30:24.112 --> 00:30:28.224
how old I am.
Olivia Newton-John is a singer.

00:30:28.224 --> 00:30:30.000
Grease.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.418
It was interesting.
The Boston Globe a few weeks

00:30:38.418 --> 00:30:42.127
ago in Parade Magazine,
there was an article on her.

00:30:42.127 --> 00:30:45.763
And it mentioned that her
grandfather was Max Born.

00:30:45.763 --> 00:30:49.036
Didn't say anything about Max
Born after that,

00:30:49.036 --> 00:30:51.290
but did mention that.
All right.

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:53.618
Now you know what psi squared
is.

00:30:53.618 --> 00:30:57.618
It's a probability density.
You and I, we can understand

00:30:57.618 --> 00:31:00.188
that.
Psi squared,

00:31:00.188 --> 00:31:05.142
we can understand that.
It's a probability density.

00:31:05.142 --> 00:31:10.591
But what I want to really
emphasize here is that it is a

00:31:10.591 --> 00:31:14.752
probability density.
It is not probability.

00:31:14.752 --> 00:31:18.021
It is probability per unit
volume.

00:31:18.021 --> 00:31:20.894
That's important.
In a moment,

00:31:20.894 --> 00:31:26.343
we're going to look at a
quantity that is a probability.

00:31:26.343 --> 00:31:31.000
But this is a probability
density.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.338
You've got to get the units
correct here.

00:31:37.338 --> 00:31:45.896
How can we use that to
understand something about where

00:31:45.896 --> 00:31:54.295
the electron is in an atom?
Well, let's do that on the

00:31:54.295 --> 00:32:00.000
slide here.
Kill those lights.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.074
Probability density.
What I am going to do is I am

00:32:06.074 --> 00:32:12.396
going to represent the
probability density here by a

00:32:12.396 --> 00:32:17.851
density dot diagram.
I am going to take my 1s

00:32:17.851 --> 00:32:22.933
orbital, my 1s wave function,
or my psi(1,

00:32:22.933 --> 00:32:30.000
0, 0) wave function,
and I am going to square it.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.758
And then I'm going to take the
results of that squared function

00:32:35.758 --> 00:32:41.238
and plot it as a dot diagram,
here, where the density of the

00:32:41.238 --> 00:32:45.603
dots is proportional to the
probability density.

00:32:45.603 --> 00:32:50.154
So the darker the dots,
the higher the probability

00:32:50.154 --> 00:32:53.591
density.
And, as the dots get more and

00:32:53.591 --> 00:32:57.399
more dispersed,
the probability density is

00:32:57.399 --> 00:33:02.196
getting smaller.
I did that for my 1s wave

00:33:02.196 --> 00:33:07.469
function, squared the 1s wave
function and plotted it here on

00:33:07.469 --> 00:33:10.369
x, y, z.
Oh, I got the x and the y

00:33:10.369 --> 00:33:13.093
turned around.
That's all right.

00:33:13.093 --> 00:33:17.136
I plotted it here.
What you can see is that the

00:33:17.136 --> 00:33:21.178
probability density is a maximum
at the origin,

00:33:21.178 --> 00:33:25.045
at the nucleus,
and that it decays equally in

00:33:25.045 --> 00:33:29.000
all directions.
It is isotropic.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.361
There is no angular dependence.
It's spherically symmetric.

00:33:34.361 --> 00:33:39.075
And that you can also see
nicely, if you look at the

00:33:39.075 --> 00:33:42.033
actual plot of the wave
function.

00:33:42.033 --> 00:33:45.546
Not psi squared now.
The wave function,

00:33:45.546 --> 00:33:50.722
which I am plotting here.
This is the wave function and I

00:33:50.722 --> 00:33:55.806
am plotting it versus r.
Actually, what I am plotting it

00:33:55.806 --> 00:34:02.000
here is as r over this something
called the "a nought."

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.779
a nought is a constant.
a nought is called the Bohr

00:34:06.779 --> 00:34:09.630
radius.
a nought is about a half an

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:12.816
angstrom.
I will explain to you where a

00:34:12.816 --> 00:34:17.763
nought comes from in a little
bit, but right now it's just a

00:34:17.763 --> 00:34:21.118
constant.
Here is the actual form of that

00:34:21.118 --> 00:34:23.885
wave function.
It's pretty simple.

00:34:23.885 --> 00:34:29.000
This stuff right in here,
this is all a constant.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.515
Just one over pi a nought
cubed.

00:34:31.515 --> 00:34:36.384
**1 / (pi (a0)^3)** I said this
was about a half an angstrom.

00:34:36.384 --> 00:34:39.712
And then the important part is
right here.

00:34:39.712 --> 00:34:44.256
It's a decaying exponential in
r, e to the minus r over a

00:34:44.256 --> 00:34:47.340
nought.
And so the wave

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:52.452
function starts out at some high
finite value at r is equal to 0

00:34:52.452 --> 00:34:56.672
and it drops off exponentially
as r goes to infinity.

00:34:56.672 --> 00:35:02.599
That's what we're plotting.
And you can see that reflected

00:35:02.599 --> 00:35:05.460
here.
When you square this you can

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:09.446
see that reflected in that
probability density.

00:35:09.446 --> 00:35:13.000
What does it tell me?
It tells me that the

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.286
probability density is highest
at the nucleus and drops off in

00:35:18.286 --> 00:35:22.446
an exponential fashion equally
in all directions.

00:35:22.446 --> 00:35:28.933
This is spherically symmetric.
We're going to say some more

00:35:28.933 --> 00:35:35.428
about where is the electron in a
moment after we go through not

00:35:35.428 --> 00:35:40.561
only 1s, but 2s and 3s.
Here I plotted the 2s wave

00:35:40.561 --> 00:35:44.438
function.
I took the 2s wave function,

00:35:44.438 --> 00:35:48.838
I squared it,
so I got values as a function

00:35:48.838 --> 00:35:52.504
of r.
And, again, the density of the

00:35:52.504 --> 00:35:59.000
dots is proportional to that
wave function squared.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.451
And, again, what do you see?
You see that the probability

00:36:03.451 --> 00:36:05.994
density is largest at the
origin.

00:36:05.994 --> 00:36:09.889
And that it decays again
equally in all directions

00:36:09.889 --> 00:36:12.592
because it's spherically
symmetric.

00:36:12.592 --> 00:36:17.123
And it decays so much that all
of a sudden you get to some

00:36:17.123 --> 00:36:20.858
value of r, and there is no
probability density.

00:36:20.858 --> 00:36:24.356
And then, as you get to the
large value of r,

00:36:24.356 --> 00:36:30.000
well, the probability density
increases again right here.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.869
And then it finally decays as
you get to larger values of r.

00:36:36.869 --> 00:36:43.972
What this wave function has in
it, here, is something called a

00:36:43.972 --> 00:36:48.047
node.
There is a value of r right in

00:36:48.047 --> 00:36:52.938
here where there is no
probability density.

00:36:52.938 --> 00:36:57.828
That value of r,
in terms of this constant,

00:36:57.828 --> 00:37:04.000
a nought, is 2 times a nought.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.692
We call that a radial node.
You can see that radial node

00:37:08.692 --> 00:37:13.044
very easily if you look at a
plot of the actual wave

00:37:13.044 --> 00:37:16.201
function.
We're not squaring the wave.

00:37:16.201 --> 00:37:19.358
This is the wave function.
Here it is.

00:37:19.358 --> 00:37:23.709
Here is the form for it.
At r is equal to zero

00:37:23.709 --> 00:37:29.000
it's some finite large
value, and it decreases.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:36.662
It decreases until we get to a
value of zero,

00:37:36.662 --> 00:37:44.848
psi is equal to 0.
Let me just draw that here on

00:37:44.848 --> 00:37:51.640
the board.
I am plotting here the psi(2,

00:37:51.640 --> 00:38:00.000
0, 0) wave function,
the 2s wave function.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.327
I am plotting it as a function
of r.

00:38:03.327 --> 00:38:07.606
What it looks like is that at r
is equal to 0,

00:38:07.606 --> 00:38:12.550
it starts out as some high
finite value and it drops.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:15.878
And it actually goes through a
zero.

00:38:15.878 --> 00:38:21.013
And it drops and it keeps
dropping until some point and

00:38:21.013 --> 00:38:25.577
becomes negative.
And then it turns around and it

00:38:25.577 --> 00:38:32.484
approaches a zero again.
And so at very large r the wave

00:38:32.484 --> 00:38:37.430
function is zero.
right here, where this wave

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:43.050
function becomes zero,
that's what we call a radial

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:47.321
node, r equals 2 a nought.

00:38:47.321 --> 00:38:53.054
This is a radial node.
It is a value of r that makes

00:38:53.054 --> 00:38:58.000
the wave function be equal to
zero.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.116
If you wanted to solve for the
radial node, you'd simply take

00:39:03.116 --> 00:39:07.976
the functional form for 2s,
which is 1 over 4 (1 over 2 pi

00:39:07.976 --> 00:39:12.666
a nought cubed) to the one half
times (2 minus (r over a

00:39:12.666 --> 00:39:16.844
nought)) times e to the (minus r
over 2 a nought).

00:39:16.844 --> 00:39:22.046
If you wanted to solve 

00:39:22.046 --> 00:39:27.162
for the value of
r at which this node occurs,

00:39:27.162 --> 00:39:31.000
you set everything equal to
zero.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.057
You solve for r.
This goes away.

00:39:34.057 --> 00:39:38.299
This stuff is just a constant.
It goes away.

00:39:38.299 --> 00:39:42.738
You have 2 minus r over a
nought,

00:39:42.738 --> 00:39:46.387
and that's equal to zero.
You can see,

00:39:46.387 --> 00:39:51.221
when you solve this,
that r is equal to 2 a nought.

00:39:51.221 --> 00:39:55.462
That is the value of r at which

00:39:55.462 --> 00:40:00.000
you have a node.
Now, notice this.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.124
At r equal to a nought,
the wave function changes

00:40:06.124 --> 00:40:09.134
sign.
It was positive up here.

00:40:09.134 --> 00:40:13.494
It is negative down here.
That is a general

00:40:13.494 --> 00:40:17.854
characteristic.
When the wave function goes

00:40:17.854 --> 00:40:22.629
through a node,
the wave function changes sign.

00:40:22.629 --> 00:40:27.820
Why is that important?
Well, have you maybe in high

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:32.167
school --
We haven't talked about p

00:40:32.167 --> 00:40:35.895
orbitals yet.
But remember you put sometimes

00:40:35.895 --> 00:40:40.924
a plus sign on a p orbital and a
minus sign on a p orbital?

00:40:40.924 --> 00:40:42.745
Did you do that?
Yeah?

00:40:42.745 --> 00:40:47.601
Well, that plus and the minus
represented the sign of the

00:40:47.601 --> 00:40:52.716
amplitude of the wave function.
Plus meant it had a positive

00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:56.098
amplitude.
Minus meant it had a negative

00:40:56.098 --> 00:41:00.000
amplitude.
That's what it meant.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.554
Sometimes you may have called
it the phase of the wave

00:41:04.554 --> 00:41:07.906
function.
You know why that's important,

00:41:07.906 --> 00:41:13.234
the phase of the wave function?
It's important because when you

00:41:13.234 --> 00:41:18.132
go to do chemical bonding,
when you bring up two atoms and

00:41:18.132 --> 00:41:23.375
you are overlapping two atoms,
and you're overlapping the wave

00:41:23.375 --> 00:41:28.273
functions that have the same
sign, you've got constructive

00:41:28.273 --> 00:41:33.000
interference and you have
chemical bonding.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.715
If you come in and you overlap
two wave functions that have

00:41:38.715 --> 00:41:42.361
opposite signs,
you've got destructive

00:41:42.361 --> 00:41:46.992
interference and you've got no
chemical bonding.

00:41:46.992 --> 00:41:52.313
We're going to see that later,
but that's why that's so

00:41:52.313 --> 00:41:58.423
important, is the amplitude of
the wave function here and these

00:41:58.423 --> 00:42:02.835
nodes.
Let's look at the 3s wave

00:42:02.835 --> 00:42:06.690
function.
Here we are back up here.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:13.381
Plotted the 3s wave function.
The probability density of the

00:42:13.381 --> 00:42:17.917
3s wave function.
Again, what do you see?

00:42:17.917 --> 00:42:24.041
You see right in the center,
probability density is the

00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:27.783
largest.
And then, as r increases,

00:42:27.783 --> 00:42:33.000
that probability density drops
off.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.743
However, you get to a value of
r, right here.

00:42:37.743 --> 00:42:44.104
where you've got another node,
another value of r that makes

00:42:44.104 --> 00:42:47.769
the wave function be equal to
zero.

00:42:47.769 --> 00:42:53.375
And then, as you increase r,
the wave function again,

00:42:53.375 --> 00:42:56.933
the probability density
increases.

00:42:56.933 --> 00:43:02.000
It increases because look right
here.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.313
You're getting a more and more
negative value.

00:43:05.313 --> 00:43:09.510
If you square a negative value
you're going to get a large

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:12.235
positive value.
That is what this high

00:43:12.235 --> 00:43:16.505
probability density reflects.
It reflects the fact that the

00:43:16.505 --> 00:43:20.850
wave function right in this area
has a large negative value.

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:23.869
You square it.
You're going to get a large

00:43:23.869 --> 00:43:26.961
positive value.
And then, as you increase r

00:43:26.961 --> 00:43:30.938
again, well, again you get
another value of r where you

00:43:30.938 --> 00:43:35.561
have a node.
The wave function goes to zero.

00:43:35.561 --> 00:43:39.774
Here's that point right there.
Here is psi equals 0.

00:43:39.774 --> 00:43:43.658
Wave function zero.
And then, as you increase r,

00:43:43.658 --> 00:43:48.450
well, again as you increase r,
the probability density goes

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:49.028
up.
Why?

00:43:49.028 --> 00:43:52.829
Because the wave function
increased right here.

00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:54.398
See that?
Square it.

00:43:54.398 --> 00:43:58.364
It's going to go up.
And then it turns around and

00:43:58.364 --> 00:44:05.167
goes to zero and this decays.
If you wanted to solve for this

00:44:05.167 --> 00:44:10.992
radial node and this radial
node, which I will let you do,

00:44:10.992 --> 00:44:17.021
you take the functional form,
set it equal to zero and solve

00:44:17.021 --> 00:44:18.963
for r.
That is easy.

00:44:18.963 --> 00:44:22.131
All of this stuff is a
constant.

00:44:22.131 --> 00:44:26.627
This goes away.
It's the quadratic and you're

00:44:26.627 --> 00:44:33.144
solving for the roots.
So what have we learned?

00:44:33.144 --> 00:44:40.611
We've learned the that 1s wave
function, 2s wave function,

00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:45.720
3s wave function,
and in fact all s wave

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:53.449
functions or l=0 wave functions,
all of them are spherically

00:44:53.449 --> 00:44:57.379
symmetric.
They have no angular

00:44:57.379 --> 00:45:02.459
dependence.
Remember, we said that in

00:45:02.459 --> 00:45:06.196
general the wave function
depends on r,

00:45:06.196 --> 00:45:10.524
theta and phi.
s wave functions have no theta

00:45:10.524 --> 00:45:15.540
and phi dependence in them,
unlike p wave functions,

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:18.590
which we will look at very
soon.

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:24.098
Also, very important here,
the probability density of all

00:45:24.098 --> 00:45:30.000
s wave functions is a finite
value at r equals 0.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.327
Those are the two important
things.

00:45:33.327 --> 00:45:37.926
And you know how to solve now
for a radial node.

00:45:37.926 --> 00:45:43.993
You set the wave function equal
to zero, solve for the value of

00:45:43.993 --> 00:45:47.418
r that makes the wave function
zero.

00:45:47.418 --> 00:45:53.094
Now, we have to continue this
discussion so we can start to

00:45:53.094 --> 00:45:58.281
talk about the probability of
finding an electron some

00:45:58.281 --> 00:46:04.035
distance from the nucleus.
We just talked about

00:46:04.035 --> 00:46:08.413
probability density.
We haven't talked about

00:46:08.413 --> 00:46:12.790
probability yet.
And here comes probability.

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:18.694
We're going to plot something
and we're going to talk about

00:46:18.694 --> 00:46:23.988
something called the radial
probability distribution.

00:46:23.988 --> 00:46:28.161
What is that?
Well, the radial probability

00:46:28.161 --> 00:46:34.065
distribution is the probability
of finding an electron in a

00:46:34.065 --> 00:46:39.095
shell.
You know what a shell is.

00:46:39.095 --> 00:46:44.666
A shell is a sphere,
but the sphere is hollow,

00:46:44.666 --> 00:46:50.980
except that at the diameter or
at the circumference,

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:57.542
you have a thin coating.
That thinness has got a dr to

00:46:57.542 --> 00:47:02.000
it.
It has a thickness to it.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.622
I'm sorry.
It's a probability.

00:47:04.622 --> 00:47:09.506
This radial probability
distribution is the probability

00:47:09.506 --> 00:47:14.028
of finding an electron in a
shell of radius r and a

00:47:14.028 --> 00:47:18.007
thickness dr.
Let me try to explain that some

00:47:18.007 --> 00:47:20.540
more.
Here is this gray part.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:24.881
That's my probability density
that I drew before,

00:47:24.881 --> 00:47:28.770
the dot diagram.
This is a 1s wave function.

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:33.653
This is a probability density
for the 1s wave function,

00:47:33.653 --> 00:47:39.951
psi(1, 0, 0) squared.
This blue thing here is a

00:47:39.951 --> 00:47:44.673
spherical shell.
It has some radius here,

00:47:44.673 --> 00:47:48.097
r.
It also has some thickness,

00:47:48.097 --> 00:47:51.284
dr.
You see I cut away here,

00:47:51.284 --> 00:47:56.006
this thickness dr?
The radial probability

00:47:56.006 --> 00:48:03.444
distribution is the probability
of finding this electron in this

00:48:03.444 --> 00:48:11.000
spherical shell that is of
radius r and thickness dr.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.960
So, it's the probability of
finding the electron at some

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:22.704
distance r to r plus dr.
That's the radial probability

00:48:22.704 --> 00:48:26.931
distribution.
Now, I want you to notice,

00:48:26.931 --> 00:48:33.000
what is the volume,
here, of this spherical shell?

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:39.646
Well, that volume is just 4 pi
r squared, the surface area of

00:48:39.646 --> 00:48:45.407
that spherical shell,
times the thickness which we're

00:48:45.407 --> 00:48:50.724
going to call dr.
That is the

00:48:50.724 --> 00:48:54.823
volume.
Now, if I wanted a probability

00:48:54.823 --> 00:49:01.691
of finding my electron in an s
wave function some distance from

00:49:01.691 --> 00:49:08.338
the nucleus, some distance r to
r plus dr, what am I going to

00:49:08.338 --> 00:49:12.693
do?
Well, I'm going to take my

00:49:12.693 --> 00:49:17.665
probability density,
which I said was psi squared

00:49:17.665 --> 00:49:23.673
probability per unit volume.
I am going to multiply it by a

00:49:23.673 --> 00:49:26.884
volume.
Then I am going to get a

00:49:26.884 --> 00:49:32.478
probability of finding my
electron some distance r to r

00:49:32.478 --> 00:49:39.195
plus dr from the nucleus.
And that is what we're going to

00:49:39.195 --> 00:49:44.247
talk about on Monday,
is the actual probability of

00:49:44.247 --> 00:49:48.061
finding the electron from the
nucleus.

00:49:48.061 --> 00:49:49.261
See you on Monday.
