00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.638
First of all,
the way a nonlinear autonomous

00:00:11.638 --> 00:00:15.361
system looks,
you have had some practice with

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:17.730
it by now.
This is nonlinear.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.384
The right-hand side are no
longer simple combinations ax

00:00:22.384 --> 00:00:26.192
plus by.
Nonlinear and autonomous,

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:30.000
these are function just of x
and y.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.789
There is no t on the right-hand
side.

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.578
Now, most of today will be
geometric.

00:00:37.578 --> 00:00:43.157
The way to get a geometric
picture of that is first by

00:00:43.157 --> 00:00:48.947
constructing the velocity field
whose components are the

00:00:48.947 --> 00:00:53.894
functions f and g.
This is a velocity field that

00:00:53.894 --> 00:01:00.000
gives a picture of the system
and has solutions.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.120
The solutions to the system,
from the point of view of

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.950
functions, they would look like
pairs of functions,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.751
x of t, y of t.

00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:18.644
But, from the point of view of
geometry, when you plot them as

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:23.668
parametric equations,
they are called trajectories of

00:01:23.668 --> 00:01:29.657
the field F, which simply means
that they are curves everywhere

00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:34.971
having the right velocity.
So a typical curve would look

00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:38.497
like --
There is a trajectory.

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:42.715
And we know it is a trajectory
because at each point the vector

00:01:42.715 --> 00:01:45.505
on it has, of course,
the right direction,

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:48.295
the tangent direction,
but more than that,

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:51.494
it has the right velocity.
So here, for example,

00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:53.807
the point is traveling more
slowly.

00:01:53.807 --> 00:01:57.414
Here it is traveling more
rapidly because the velocity

00:01:57.414 --> 00:02:00.000
vector is bigger,
longer.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.955
So this is a picture of a
typical trajectory.

00:02:03.955 --> 00:02:09.258
The only other things that I
should mention are the critical

00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:12.674
points.
If you have worked the problems

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:16.539
for this week,
the first couple of problems,

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:21.303
you have already seen the
significance of the critical

00:02:21.303 --> 00:02:24.719
points.
Well, from Monday's lecture you

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:29.842
know from the point of view of
solutions they are constant

00:02:29.842 --> 00:02:32.000
solutions.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.224
From the point of view of the
field they are where the field

00:02:41.224 --> 00:02:43.801
is zero.
There is no velocity vector,

00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:46.880
in other words.
The velocity vector is zero.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.816
And, therefore,
a point being there has no

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:53.252
reason to go anywhere else.
And, spelling it out,

00:02:53.252 --> 00:02:57.119
it's where the partial
derivatives, where the values of

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:01.057
the functions on the right-hand
side, which give the two

00:03:01.057 --> 00:03:04.422
components, the i and j
components of the field,

00:03:04.422 --> 00:03:07.000
where they are zero.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.645
That is all I will need by way
of a recall today.

00:03:14.645 --> 00:03:17.607
I don't think I will need
anything else.

00:03:17.607 --> 00:03:22.164
The topic for today is another
kind of behavior that you have

00:03:22.164 --> 00:03:26.873
not yet observed at the computer
screen, unless you have worked

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:31.278
ahead, and that is there are
trajectories which go along to

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:35.000
infinity or end up at a critical
point.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.631
They are the critical points
that just sit there all the

00:03:39.631 --> 00:03:42.410
time.
But there is a third type of

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.463
behavior that a trajectory can
have where it neither sits for

00:03:47.463 --> 00:03:50.326
all time nor goes off for all
time.

00:03:50.326 --> 00:03:55.210
Instead, it repeats itself.
Such a thing is called a closed

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.000
trajectory.
What does it look like?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.051
Well, it is a closed curve in
the plane that at every point,

00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:10.179
it is a trajectory,
i.e., the arrows at each point,

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:15.205
let's say it is traced in the
clockwise direction.

00:04:15.205 --> 00:04:20.128
And so the arrows of the field
will go like this.

00:04:20.128 --> 00:04:25.564
Here it is going slowly,
here it is very slow and here

00:04:25.564 --> 00:04:31.000
it picks up a little speed again
and so on.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.938
Now, for such a trajectory what
is happening?

00:04:35.938 --> 00:04:42.561
Well, it goes around in finite
time and then repeats itself.

00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:48.734
It just goes round and round
forever if you land on that

00:04:48.734 --> 00:04:53.000
trajectory.
It represents a system that

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.714
returns to its original state
periodically.

00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:04.000
It represents periodic behavior
of the system.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.651
Now, we have seen one example
of that, a simple example where

00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:29.644
this simple system,
x prime equals y,

00:05:29.644 --> 00:05:35.000
y prime equals negative x.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.521
We could write down the
solutions to that directly,

00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:47.253
but if you want to do
eigenvalues and eigenvectors the

00:05:47.253 --> 00:05:51.056
matrix will look like this.
The equation will be lambda

00:05:51.056 --> 00:05:55.070
squared plus zero lambda plus
one equals zero,

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.521
so the eigenvalues will be plus

00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:02.084
or minus i.
In fact, from then on you could

00:06:02.084 --> 00:06:04.976
work out in the usual ways the
eigenvectors,

00:06:04.976 --> 00:06:07.531
complex eigenvectors and
separate them.

00:06:07.531 --> 00:06:11.364
But, look, you can avoid all
that just by writing down the

00:06:11.364 --> 00:06:13.785
solution.
The solutions are sines and

00:06:13.785 --> 00:06:16.206
cosines.
One basic solution will be x

00:06:16.206 --> 00:06:19.904
equals cosine t,
in which case what is y?

00:06:19.904 --> 00:06:22.123
Well, y is the derivative of
that.

00:06:22.123 --> 00:06:24.880
That will be minus sine t.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.242
Another basic solution,
we will start with x equals

00:06:28.242 --> 00:06:33.861
sine t.
In which case y will be cosine

00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:36.914
t, its derivative.

00:06:36.914 --> 00:06:41.779
Now, if you do that,
what do these things look like?

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:47.598
Well, either of these two basic
solutions looks like a circle,

00:06:47.598 --> 00:06:52.463
not traced in the usual way but
in the opposite way.

00:06:52.463 --> 00:06:56.088
For example,
when t is equal to zero it

00:06:56.088 --> 00:07:00.000
starts at the point one,
zero.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.224
Now, if the minus sign were not
there this would be x equals

00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:08.162
cosine t,
y equals sine t,

00:07:08.162 --> 00:07:11.169
which is the usual
counterclockwise circle.

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:15.465
But if I change y from sine t
to negative sine t

00:07:15.465 --> 00:07:18.472
it is going around the
other way.

00:07:18.472 --> 00:07:20.835
So this circle is traced that
way.

00:07:20.835 --> 00:07:24.773
And this is a family of
circles, according to the values

00:07:24.773 --> 00:07:27.637
of c1 and c2,
concentric, all of which go

00:07:27.637 --> 00:07:31.330
around clockwise.
So those are closed

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.921
trajectories.
Those are the solutions.

00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:36.792
They are trajectories of the
vector field.

00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:39.663
They are closed.
They come around and they

00:07:39.663 --> 00:07:42.815
repeat in finite time.
Now, these are no good.

00:07:42.815 --> 00:07:45.686
These are the kind I am not
interested in.

00:07:45.686 --> 00:07:49.257
These are commonplace,
and we are interested in good

00:07:49.257 --> 00:07:51.848
stuff today.
And the good stuff we are

00:07:51.848 --> 00:07:55.000
interested in is limit cycles.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.185
A limit cycle is a closed
trajectory with a couple of

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:10.472
extra hypotheses.
It is a closed trajectory,

00:08:10.472 --> 00:08:15.658
just like those guys,
but it has something they don't

00:08:15.658 --> 00:08:19.347
have, namely,
it is king of the roost.

00:08:19.347 --> 00:08:23.934
They have to be isolated,
no other guys nearby.

00:08:23.934 --> 00:08:27.025
And they also have to be
stable.

00:08:27.025 --> 00:08:32.809
See, the problem here is that
none of these stands out from

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:37.406
any of the others.
In other words,

00:08:37.406 --> 00:08:40.125
there must be,
isolated means,

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:42.000
no others nearby.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.506
That is just what goes wrong
here.

00:08:51.506 --> 00:08:55.759
Arbitrarily close to each of
these circles is yet another

00:08:55.759 --> 00:08:58.417
circle doing exactly the same
thing.

00:08:58.417 --> 00:09:03.050
That means that there are some
that are only of mild interest.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:07.531
What is much more interesting
is to find a cycle where there

00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:10.493
is nothing nearby.
Something, therefore,

00:09:10.493 --> 00:09:13.000
that looks like this.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.405
Here is our pink guy.
Let's make this one go

00:09:25.405 --> 00:09:28.495
counterclockwise.
Here is a limit cycle,

00:09:28.495 --> 00:09:33.089
it seems to be.
And now what do nearby guys do?

00:09:33.089 --> 00:09:38.870
Well, they should approach it.
Somebody here like that does

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:44.950
this, spirals in and gets ever
and every closer to that thing.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:50.531
Now, it can never join it
because, if it joined it at the

00:09:50.531 --> 00:09:54.518
joining point,
I would have two solutions

00:09:54.518 --> 00:10:00.000
going through this point.
And that is illegal.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.727
All it can do is get
arbitrarily close.

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:06.818
On the computer screen it will
look as if it joins it but,

00:10:06.818 --> 00:10:10.191
of course, it cannot.
It is just the resolution,

00:10:10.191 --> 00:10:12.272
the pixels.
Not enough pixels.

00:10:12.272 --> 00:10:14.569
The resolution isn't good
enough.

00:10:14.569 --> 00:10:18.875
And the ones that start further
away will take longer to find

00:10:18.875 --> 00:10:23.468
their way to the limit cycle and
they will always stay outside of

00:10:23.468 --> 00:10:26.770
the earlier guys,
but they will get arbitrarily

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:30.000
close, too.
How about inside?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.517
Inside, well,
it starts somewhere and does

00:10:33.517 --> 00:10:37.378
the same thing.
It starts here and will try to

00:10:37.378 --> 00:10:41.067
join the limit cycle.
That is what I mean by

00:10:41.067 --> 00:10:44.241
stability.
Stability means that nearby

00:10:44.241 --> 00:10:48.530
guys, the guys that start
somewhere else eventually

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.906
approach the limit cycle,
regardless of whether they

00:10:52.906 --> 00:10:56.938
start from the outside or start
from the inside.

00:10:56.938 --> 00:11:02.000
So that is stable.
An unstable limit cycle --

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.078
But I am not calling it a limit
cycle if it is unstable.

00:11:06.078 --> 00:11:10.454
I am just calling it a closed
trajectory, but let's draw one

00:11:10.454 --> 00:11:14.088
which is unstable.
Here is the way we will look if

00:11:14.088 --> 00:11:17.425
it is unstable.
Guys that start nearby will be

00:11:17.425 --> 00:11:21.504
repelled, driven somewhere else.
Or, if they start here,

00:11:21.504 --> 00:11:25.583
they will go away from the
thing instead of going toward

00:11:25.583 --> 00:11:27.066
it.
This is unstable.

00:11:27.066 --> 00:11:29.514
And I don't call it a limit
cycle.

00:11:29.514 --> 00:11:33.000
It is just a closed trajectory.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.902
Cycle because it cycles round
and round.

00:11:40.902 --> 00:11:44.624
Limit because it is the limit
of the nearby curves.

00:11:44.624 --> 00:11:48.495
The other case where it is
unstable is not the limit.

00:11:48.495 --> 00:11:52.440
Of course, you could have a
case also where the curves

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:57.129
outside spiral in toward it but
the ones inside are repelled and

00:11:57.129 --> 00:11:59.213
do this.
That would be called

00:11:59.213 --> 00:12:03.261
semi-stable.
And you can make up all sorts

00:12:03.261 --> 00:12:05.055
of cases.
And I think I,

00:12:05.055 --> 00:12:07.863
at one point,
drew them in the notes,

00:12:07.863 --> 00:12:11.529
but I am not going to.
The only interesting one,

00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:14.727
of permanent importance that
people study,

00:12:14.727 --> 00:12:19.094
are the actual limit cycles.
No, it was the stable closed

00:12:19.094 --> 00:12:21.590
trajectories.
Notice, by the way,

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:25.022
a closed trajectory is always a
simple curve.

00:12:25.022 --> 00:12:29.000
Remember what that means from
18.02?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.335
Simple means it doesn't cross
itself.

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:37.801
Why doesn't it cross itself?
It cannot cross itself because,

00:12:37.801 --> 00:12:41.970
if it tried to,
what is wrong with that point?

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:46.416
At that point which way does
the vector field go,

00:12:46.416 --> 00:12:50.678
that way or that way?
Why the interest of limit

00:12:50.678 --> 00:12:54.198
cycles?
Well, because there are systems

00:12:54.198 --> 00:12:58.367
in nature in which just this
type of behavior,

00:12:58.367 --> 00:13:03.000
they have a certain periodic
motion.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.128
And, if you disturb it,
gradually it returns to its

00:13:07.128 --> 00:13:11.587
original periodic state.
A simple example is breathing.

00:13:11.587 --> 00:13:14.724
Now I have made you all
self-conscious.

00:13:14.724 --> 00:13:18.688
All of you are breathing.
If you are here you are

00:13:18.688 --> 00:13:22.073
breathing.
At what rate are you breathing?

00:13:22.073 --> 00:13:26.201
Well, you are unaware of it,
of course, except now.

00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:30.000
If you are sitting here
listening.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.248
There is a certain temperature
and a certain air circulation in

00:13:34.248 --> 00:13:36.441
the room.
You are not thinking of

00:13:36.441 --> 00:13:40.621
anything, certainly not of the
lecture, and the lecture is not

00:13:40.621 --> 00:13:43.705
unduly exciting,
you will breathe at a certain

00:13:43.705 --> 00:13:47.748
steady rate which is a little
different for every person but

00:13:47.748 --> 00:13:50.695
that is your rate.
Now, you can artificially

00:13:50.695 --> 00:13:53.642
change that.
You could say now I am going to

00:13:53.642 --> 00:13:57.000
breathe faster.
And indeed you can.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.917
But, as soon as you stop being
aware of what you are doing,

00:14:01.917 --> 00:14:06.665
the levels of various hormones
and carbon dioxide in your

00:14:06.665 --> 00:14:11.244
bloodstream and so on will
return your breathing to its

00:14:11.244 --> 00:14:13.703
natural state.
In other words,

00:14:13.703 --> 00:14:18.790
that system of your breathing,
which is controlled by various

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:23.962
chemicals and hormones in the
body, is exhibiting exactly this

00:14:23.962 --> 00:14:27.438
type of behavior.
It has a certain regular

00:14:27.438 --> 00:14:32.120
periodic motion as a system.
And, if disturbed,

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.921
if artificially you set it out
somewhere else,

00:14:34.921 --> 00:14:37.785
it will gradually return to its
original state.

00:14:37.785 --> 00:14:40.337
Now, of course,
if I am running it will be

00:14:40.337 --> 00:14:41.271
different.
Sure.

00:14:41.271 --> 00:14:45.068
If you are running you breathe
faster, but that is because the

00:14:45.068 --> 00:14:48.242
parameters in the system,
the a's and the b's in the

00:14:48.242 --> 00:14:50.546
equation, the f of (x,
y) and g of (x,

00:14:50.546 --> 00:14:53.658
y), the parameters in those

00:14:53.658 --> 00:14:56.210
functions will be set at
different levels.

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.572
You will have different
hormones, a different of carbon

00:14:59.572 --> 00:15:04.056
dioxide and so on.
Now, I am not saying that

00:15:04.056 --> 00:15:07.100
breathing is modeled by a limit
cycle.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:11.624
It is the sort of thing which
one might look for a limit

00:15:11.624 --> 00:15:13.681
cycle.
That is, of course,

00:15:13.681 --> 00:15:17.136
a question for biologists.
And, in general,

00:15:17.136 --> 00:15:22.071
any type of periodic behavior
in nature, people try to see if

00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:26.267
there is some system of
differential equations which

00:15:26.267 --> 00:15:30.380
governs it in which perhaps
there is a limit cycle,

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:36.467
which contains a limit cycle.
Well, what are the problems?

00:15:36.467 --> 00:15:41.755
In a sense, limit cycles are
easy to lecture about because so

00:15:41.755 --> 00:15:46.338
little is known about them.
At the end of the period,

00:15:46.338 --> 00:15:49.776
if I have time,
I will show you that the

00:15:49.776 --> 00:15:55.064
simplest possible question you
could ask, the answer to it is

00:15:55.064 --> 00:16:00.000
totally known after 120 years of
steady trying.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.163
But let's first talk about what
sorts of problems people address

00:16:05.163 --> 00:16:09.016
with limit cycles.
First of all is the existence

00:16:09.016 --> 00:16:10.000
problem.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.436
If I give you a system,
you know, the right-hand side

00:16:19.436 --> 00:16:23.202
is x squared plus 2y cubed minus
3xy,

00:16:23.202 --> 00:16:26.969
and the g is something similar.
I say does this have limit

00:16:26.969 --> 00:16:29.414
cycles?
Well, you know how to find its

00:16:29.414 --> 00:16:34.797
critical points.
But how do you find out if it

00:16:34.797 --> 00:16:40.690
has limit cycles?
The answer to that is nobody

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.095
has any idea.
This problem,

00:16:44.095 --> 00:16:50.904
in general, there are not much
in the way of methods.

00:16:50.904 --> 00:16:53.000
Not much.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.660
Not much is known.
There is one theorem that you

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:07.555
will find in the notes,
a simple theorem called the

00:17:07.555 --> 00:17:11.994
Poincare-Bendixson theorem
which, for about 60 or 70 years

00:17:11.994 --> 00:17:16.590
was about the only result known
which enabled people to find

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:19.783
limit cycles.
Nowadays the theorem is used

00:17:19.783 --> 00:17:24.379
relatively little because people
try to find limit cycles by

00:17:24.379 --> 00:17:27.494
computer.
Now, the difficulty is you have

00:17:27.494 --> 00:17:32.062
to know where to look for them.
In other words,

00:17:32.062 --> 00:17:36.454
the computer screen shows that
much and you set the axes and it

00:17:36.454 --> 00:17:40.775
doesn't show any limit cycles.
That doesn't mean there are not

00:17:40.775 --> 00:17:43.254
any.
That means they are over there,

00:17:43.254 --> 00:17:46.158
or it means there is a big one
like there.

00:17:46.158 --> 00:17:50.125
And you are looking in the
middle of it and don't see it.

00:17:50.125 --> 00:17:53.099
So, in general,
people don't look for limit

00:17:53.099 --> 00:17:56.924
cycles unless the physical
system that gave rise to the

00:17:56.924 --> 00:18:01.316
pair of differential equations
suggests that there is something

00:18:01.316 --> 00:18:05.000
repetitive going on like
breathing.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.281
And, if it tells you that,
then it often gives you

00:18:09.281 --> 00:18:14.174
approximate values of the
parameters and the variables so

00:18:14.174 --> 00:18:18.368
you know where to look.
Basically this is done by

00:18:18.368 --> 00:18:23.000
computer search guided by the
physical problem.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.495
Therefore, I cannot say much
more about it today.

00:18:35.495 --> 00:18:40.740
Instead I am going to focus my
attention on nonexistence.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:46.078
When can you be sure that a
system will not have any limit

00:18:46.078 --> 00:18:49.262
cycles?
And there are two theorems.

00:18:49.262 --> 00:18:54.788
One, again, due to Bendixson
who was a Swedish mathematician

00:18:54.788 --> 00:18:59.939
who lived around 1900 or so.
There is a criterion due to

00:18:59.939 --> 00:19:04.277
Bendixson.
And there is one involving

00:19:04.277 --> 00:19:08.131
critical points.
And I would like to describe

00:19:08.131 --> 00:19:11.635
both of them for you today.
First of all,

00:19:11.635 --> 00:19:14.000
Bendixson's criterion.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.418
It is very simply stated and
has a marvelous proof,

00:19:25.418 --> 00:19:29.316
which I am going to give you.
We have D as a region of the

00:19:29.316 --> 00:19:30.000
plane.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.080
And what Bendixson's criterion
tells you to do is take your

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.671
vector field and calculate its
divergence.

00:19:43.671 --> 00:19:48.313
We are set back in 1802,
and this proof is going to be

00:19:48.313 --> 00:19:51.204
straight 18.02.
You will enjoy it.

00:19:51.204 --> 00:19:55.759
Calculate the divergence.
Now, I am talking about the

00:19:55.759 --> 00:20:00.671
two-dimensional divergence.
Remember that is fx,

00:20:00.671 --> 00:20:05.768
the partial of f with respect
to x, plus the partial of the g,

00:20:05.768 --> 00:20:08.525
the j component with respect to
y.

00:20:08.525 --> 00:20:12.285
And assume that that is a
continuous function.

00:20:12.285 --> 00:20:16.964
It always will be with us.
Practically all the examples I

00:20:16.964 --> 00:20:20.975
will give you f and g will be
simple polynomials.

00:20:20.975 --> 00:20:24.819
They are smooth,
continuous and nice and behave

00:20:24.819 --> 00:20:27.994
as you want.
And you calculate that and

00:20:27.994 --> 00:20:32.415
assume --
Suppose, in other words,

00:20:32.415 --> 00:20:36.641
that the divergence of f,
I need more room.

00:20:36.641 --> 00:20:42.276
The hypothesis is that the
divergence of f is not zero in

00:20:42.276 --> 00:20:45.396
that region D.
It is never zero.

00:20:45.396 --> 00:20:49.622
It is not zero at any point in
that region.

00:20:49.622 --> 00:20:55.056
The conclusion is that there
are no limit cycles in the

00:20:55.056 --> 00:20:58.075
region.
If it is not zero in D,

00:20:58.075 --> 00:21:04.844
there are no limit cycles.
In fact, there are not even any

00:21:04.844 --> 00:21:09.250
closed trajectories.
You couldn't even have those

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:13.838
bunch of concentric circles,
so there are no closed

00:21:13.838 --> 00:21:18.886
trajectories of the original
system whose divergence you

00:21:18.886 --> 00:21:21.639
calculated.
There are no closed

00:21:21.639 --> 00:21:24.392
trajectories in D.
For example,

00:21:24.392 --> 00:21:29.531
let me give you a simple
example to put a little flesh on

00:21:29.531 --> 00:21:32.057
it.
Let's see.

00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:35.971
What do I have?
I prepared an example.

00:21:35.971 --> 00:21:40.307
x prime equals,
here is a simple nonlinear

00:21:40.307 --> 00:21:45.278
system, x cubed plus y cubed.

00:21:45.278 --> 00:21:51.519
And y prime equals 3x plus y
cubed plus 2y.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.604
Does this system have limit
cycles?

00:22:01.604 --> 00:22:05.665
Well, even to calculate its
critical points would be a

00:22:05.665 --> 00:22:09.879
little task, but we can easily
answer the question as to

00:22:09.879 --> 00:22:14.399
whether it has limit cycles or
not by Bendixson's criterion.

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:18.919
Let's calculate the divergence.
The divergence of the vector

00:22:18.919 --> 00:22:22.673
field whose components are these
two functions is,

00:22:22.673 --> 00:22:26.887
well, 3x squared,
it's the partial of the first

00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:31.483
guy with respect to x plus the
partial of the second guy with

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:34.625
respect to y,
which is 3y squared plus two.

00:22:34.625 --> 00:22:39.654
Now, can that be zero anywhere

00:22:39.654 --> 00:22:43.635
in the x,y-plane?
No, because it is the sum of

00:22:43.635 --> 00:22:47.793
these two squares.
This much of it could be zero

00:22:47.793 --> 00:22:51.951
only at the origin,
but that plus two eliminates

00:22:51.951 --> 00:22:55.490
even that.
This is always positive in the

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:59.383
entire x,y-plane.
Here my domain is the whole

00:22:59.383 --> 00:23:03.099
x,y-plane and,
therefore, the conclusion is

00:23:03.099 --> 00:23:07.876
that there are no closed
trajectories in the x,y-plane,

00:23:07.876 --> 00:23:10.000
anywhere.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.566
And we have done that with just
a couple of lines of calculation

00:23:18.566 --> 00:23:21.283
and nothing further required.
No computer search.

00:23:21.283 --> 00:23:24.056
In fact, no computer search
could ever proof this.

00:23:24.056 --> 00:23:27.226
It would be impossible because,
no matter where you look,

00:23:27.226 --> 00:23:30.000
there is always some other
place to look.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.404
This is an example where a
couple lines of mathematics

00:23:35.404 --> 00:23:41.115
dispose of the matter far more
effectively than a million

00:23:41.115 --> 00:23:46.927
dollars worth of calculation.
Well, where does Bendixson's

00:23:46.927 --> 00:23:51.822
theorem come from?
Yes, Bendixson's theorem comes

00:23:51.822 --> 00:23:56.003
from 18.02.
And I am giving it to you both

00:23:56.003 --> 00:24:01.000
to recall a little bit of 18.02
to you.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.272
Because it is about the first
example in the course that we

00:24:06.272 --> 00:24:09.181
have had of an indirect
argument.

00:24:09.181 --> 00:24:14.454
And indirect arguments are
something you have to slowly get

00:24:14.454 --> 00:24:17.454
used to.
I am going to give you an

00:24:17.454 --> 00:24:20.818
indirect proof.
Remember what that is?

00:24:20.818 --> 00:24:25.272
You assume the contrary and you
show it leads to a

00:24:25.272 --> 00:24:28.636
contradiction.
What would assuming the

00:24:28.636 --> 00:24:34.335
contrary be?
Contrary would be I will assume

00:24:34.335 --> 00:24:40.360
the divergence is not zero,
but I will suppose there is a

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.987
closed trajectory.
Suppose there is a closed

00:24:44.987 --> 00:24:48.000
trajectory that exists.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Let's draw a picture of it.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.243
And let's say it goes around
this way.

00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:15.011
There is a closed trajectory
for our system.

00:25:15.011 --> 00:25:19.306
Let's call the curve C.
And I am going to call the

00:25:19.306 --> 00:25:22.812
inside of it R,
the way one often does in

00:25:22.812 --> 00:25:25.968
18.02.
D is all this region out here,

00:25:25.968 --> 00:25:30.000
in which everything is taking
place.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.257
This is to exist in D.
Now, what I am going to do is

00:25:35.257 --> 00:25:40.000
calculate a line integral around
that curve.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.825
A line integral of this vector
field.

00:25:47.825 --> 00:25:51.201
Now, there are two things you
can calculate.

00:25:51.201 --> 00:25:55.283
One of the line integrals,
I will put in a few of the

00:25:55.283 --> 00:25:58.737
vectors here.
The vectors I know are pointing

00:25:58.737 --> 00:26:03.368
this way because that is the
direction in which the curve is

00:26:03.368 --> 00:26:08.000
being traversed in order to make
it a trajectory.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.087
Those are a few of the typical
vectors in the field.

00:26:12.087 --> 00:26:16.735
I am going to calculate the
line integral around that curve

00:26:16.735 --> 00:26:19.700
in the positive sense.
In other words,

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.547
not in the direction of the
salmon-colored arrow,

00:26:23.547 --> 00:26:27.874
but in the normal sense in
which you calculate it using

00:26:27.874 --> 00:26:31.000
Green's theorem,
for example.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.752
The positive sense means the
one which keeps the region,

00:26:34.752 --> 00:26:38.301
the inside on your left,
as you walk around like that

00:26:38.301 --> 00:26:42.190
the region stays on your left.
That is the positive sense.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.124
That is the sense in which I am
integrating.

00:26:45.124 --> 00:26:49.014
I am going to use Green's
theorem, but the integral that I

00:26:49.014 --> 00:26:52.152
am going to calculate is not the
work integral.

00:26:52.152 --> 00:26:55.496
I am going to calculate instead
the flux integral,

00:26:55.496 --> 00:27:00.000
the integral that represents
the flux of F across C.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.372
Now, what is that integral?
Well, at each point,

00:27:04.372 --> 00:27:09.953
you station a little ant and
the ant reports the outward flow

00:27:09.953 --> 00:27:15.813
rate across that point which is
F dotted with the normal vector.

00:27:15.813 --> 00:27:20.744
I will put in a few normal
vectors just to remind you.

00:27:20.744 --> 00:27:25.953
The normal vectors look like
little unit vectors pointing

00:27:25.953 --> 00:27:29.209
perpendicularly outwards
everywhere.

00:27:29.209 --> 00:27:34.594
These are the n's.
F dotted with the unit normal

00:27:34.594 --> 00:27:38.619
vector, and that is added up
around the curve.

00:27:38.619 --> 00:27:43.361
This quantity gives me the flux
of the field across C.

00:27:43.361 --> 00:27:48.191
Now, we are going to calculate
that by Green's theorem.

00:27:48.191 --> 00:27:52.306
But, before we calculate it by
Green's theorem,

00:27:52.306 --> 00:27:55.884
we are going to psych it out.
What is it?

00:27:55.884 --> 00:28:00.000
What is the value of that
integral?

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.131
Well, since I am asking you to
do it in your head there can

00:28:04.131 --> 00:28:06.910
only be one possible answer.
It is zero.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:10.970
Why is that integral zero?
Well, because at each point the

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.464
field vector,
the velocity vector is

00:28:13.464 --> 00:28:15.886
perpendicular to the normal
vector.

00:28:15.886 --> 00:28:17.881
Why?
The normal vector points

00:28:17.881 --> 00:28:22.013
perpendicularly to the curve but
the field vector always is

00:28:22.013 --> 00:28:27.000
tangent to the curve because
this curve is a trajectory.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:34.631
It is always supposed to be
going in the direction given by

00:28:34.631 --> 00:28:39.631
that white field vector.
Do you follow?

00:28:39.631 --> 00:28:47.000
A trajectory means that it is
always tangent to the field

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.447
vector and, therefore,
always perpendicular to the

00:28:53.447 --> 00:28:59.105
normal vector.
This is zero since F dot n is

00:28:59.105 --> 00:29:03.846
always zero.
Everywhere on the curve,

00:29:03.846 --> 00:29:07.923
F dot n has to be zero.
There is no flux of this field

00:29:07.923 --> 00:29:12.153
across the curve because the
field is always in the same

00:29:12.153 --> 00:29:15.923
direction as the curve,
never perpendicular to it.

00:29:15.923 --> 00:29:19.000
It has no components
perpendicular to it.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.615
Good.
Now let's do it the hard way.

00:29:21.615 --> 00:29:25.846
Let's use Green's theorem.
Green's theorem says that the

00:29:25.846 --> 00:29:30.538
flux across C should be equal to
the double integral over that

00:29:30.538 --> 00:29:35.950
region of the divergence of F.
It's like Gauss theorem in two

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:39.006
dimensions, this version of it.
Divergence of F,

00:29:39.006 --> 00:29:42.191
that is a function,
I double integrate it over the

00:29:42.191 --> 00:29:46.092
region, and then that is dx /
dy, or let's say da because you

00:29:46.092 --> 00:29:48.693
might want to do it in polar
coordinates.

00:29:48.693 --> 00:29:52.139
And, on the problem set,
you certainly will want to do

00:29:52.139 --> 00:29:55.000
it in polar coordinates,
I think.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.769
All right.
How much is that?

00:30:02.769 --> 00:30:06.871
Well, we haven't yet used the
hypothesis.

00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:10.769
All we have done is set up the
problem.

00:30:10.769 --> 00:30:16.512
Now, the hypothesis was that
the divergence is never zero

00:30:16.512 --> 00:30:20.820
anywhere in D.
Therefore, the divergence is

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:26.564
never zero anywhere in R.
What I say is the divergence is

00:30:26.564 --> 00:30:32.000
either greater than zero
everywhere in R.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.017
Or less than zero everywhere in
R.

00:30:35.017 --> 00:30:40.321
But it cannot be sometimes
positive and sometimes negative.

00:30:40.321 --> 00:30:42.424
Why not?
In other words,

00:30:42.424 --> 00:30:47.820
I say it is not possible the
divergence here is one and here

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.660
is minus two.
That is not possible because,

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:55.318
if I drew a line from this
point to that,

00:30:55.318 --> 00:31:00.896
along that line the divergence
would start positive and end up

00:31:00.896 --> 00:31:04.021
negative.
And, therefore,

00:31:04.021 --> 00:31:06.473
have to be zero some time in
between.

00:31:06.473 --> 00:31:09.198
It's because it is a continuous
function.

00:31:09.198 --> 00:31:12.399
It is a continuous function.
I am assuming that.

00:31:12.399 --> 00:31:15.328
And, therefore,
if it sometimes positive and

00:31:15.328 --> 00:31:18.529
sometimes negative it has to be
zero in between.

00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:22.139
You cannot get continuously
from plus one to minus two

00:31:22.139 --> 00:31:27.915
without passing through zero.
The reason for this is,

00:31:27.915 --> 00:31:35.014
since the divergence is never
zero in R it therefore must

00:31:35.014 --> 00:31:40.591
always stay positive or always
stay negative.

00:31:40.591 --> 00:31:47.563
Now, if it always stays
positive, the conclusion is then

00:31:47.563 --> 00:31:52.253
this double integral must be
positive.

00:31:52.253 --> 00:32:01.000
Therefore, this double integral
is either greater than zero.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.911
That is if the divergence is
always positive.

00:32:04.911 --> 00:32:10.333
Or, it is less than zero if the
divergence is always negative.

00:32:10.333 --> 00:32:14.066
But the one thing it cannot be
is not zero.

00:32:14.066 --> 00:32:18.955
Well, the left-hand side,
Green's theorem is supposed to

00:32:18.955 --> 00:32:22.422
be true.
Green's theorem is our bedrock.

00:32:22.422 --> 00:32:26.955
18.02 would crumble without
that so it must be true.

00:32:26.955 --> 00:32:33.000
One way of calculating the
left-hand side gives us zero.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.352
If we calculate the right-hand
side it is not zero.

00:32:36.352 --> 00:32:38.498
That is called the
contradiction.

00:32:38.498 --> 00:32:41.046
Where did the contradiction
arise from?

00:32:41.046 --> 00:32:45.137
It arose from the fact that I
supposed that there was a closed

00:32:45.137 --> 00:32:48.892
trajectory in that region.
The conclusion is there cannot

00:32:48.892 --> 00:32:52.915
be any closed trajectory of that
region because it leads to a

00:32:52.915 --> 00:32:56.000
contradiction via Green's
theorem.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.210
Let me see if I can give you
some of the argument for the

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:10.270
other, well, let's at least
state the other criterion I

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.000
wanted to give you.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.067
Suppose, for example,
we use this system,

00:33:25.067 --> 00:33:27.000
x prime equals --

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Does this have limit cycles?

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Does that have limit cycles?

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.329
Let's Bendixson it.
We will calculate the

00:34:12.329 --> 00:34:18.824
divergence of a vector field.
It is 2x from the top function.

00:34:18.824 --> 00:34:22.613
The partial with respect to x
is 2x.

00:34:22.613 --> 00:34:29.000
The second function with
respect to y is negative 2y.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.736
That certainly could be zero.
In fact, this is zero along the

00:34:34.736 --> 00:34:39.516
entire line x equals y.
Its divergence is zero here

00:34:39.516 --> 00:34:44.488
along that whole line.
The best I could conclude was,

00:34:44.488 --> 00:34:50.033
I could conclude that there is
no limit cycle like this and

00:34:50.033 --> 00:34:55.483
there is no limit cycle like
this, but there is nothing so

00:34:55.483 --> 00:35:00.741
far that says a limit cycle
could not cross that because

00:35:00.741 --> 00:35:06.000
that would not violate
Bendixson's theorem.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.686
In other words,
any domain that contained part

00:35:09.686 --> 00:35:13.044
of this line,
the divergence would be zero

00:35:13.044 --> 00:35:15.583
along that line.
And, therefore,

00:35:15.583 --> 00:35:20.088
I could conclude nothing.
I could have limit cycles that

00:35:20.088 --> 00:35:23.529
cross that line,
as long as they included a

00:35:23.529 --> 00:35:28.116
piece of that line in them.
The answer is I cannot make a

00:35:28.116 --> 00:35:32.059
conclusion.
Well, that is because I am

00:35:32.059 --> 00:35:36.495
using the wrong criterion.
Let's instead use the critical

00:35:36.495 --> 00:35:38.000
point criterion.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.956
Now, I am going to say that it
makes a nice positive statement

00:35:58.956 --> 00:36:01.032
but nobody ever uses it this
way.

00:36:01.032 --> 00:36:03.108
Nonetheless,
let's first state it

00:36:03.108 --> 00:36:07.000
positively, even though that is
not the way to use it.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.808
The positive statement will be,
once again, we have our region

00:36:13.808 --> 00:36:20.058
D and we have a region of the xy
plane and we have our C,

00:36:20.058 --> 00:36:26.084
a closed trajectory in it.
A closed trajectory of what?

00:36:26.084 --> 00:36:30.883
Of our system.
And that is supposed to be in

00:36:30.883 --> 00:36:35.333
D.
The critical point criterion

00:36:35.333 --> 00:36:42.000
says something very simple.
If you have that situation it

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.428
says that inside that closed
trajectory there must be a

00:36:48.428 --> 00:36:52.000
critical point somewhere.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:08.000
It says that inside C is a
critical point.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.652
Now, this won't help us with
the existence problem.

00:37:18.652 --> 00:37:21.794
This won't help us find a
closed trajectory.

00:37:21.794 --> 00:37:26.397
We will take our system and say
it has a critical point here and

00:37:26.397 --> 00:37:29.611
a critical point there.
Does it have a closed

00:37:29.611 --> 00:37:33.091
trajectory?
Well, all I know is the closed

00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:36.855
trajectory, if it exists,
will have to go around one or

00:37:36.855 --> 00:37:40.550
more of those critical points.
But I don't know where.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:43.408
It is not going to go around it
like this.

00:37:43.408 --> 00:37:45.569
It might go around it like
this.

00:37:45.569 --> 00:37:49.752
And my computer search won't
find it because it is looking at

00:37:49.752 --> 00:37:53.656
too small a part of the screen.
It doesn't work that way.

00:37:53.656 --> 00:37:56.235
It works negatively by
contraposition.

00:37:56.235 --> 00:38:00.000
Do you know what the
contrapositive is?

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:07.764
You will at least learn that.
A implies B says the same thing

00:38:07.764 --> 00:38:11.000
as not B implies not A.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.551
They are different statements
but they are equivalent to each

00:38:24.551 --> 00:38:27.282
other.
If you prove one you prove the

00:38:27.282 --> 00:38:29.027
other.
What would be the

00:38:29.027 --> 00:38:35.939
contrapositive here?
If you have a closed trajectory

00:38:35.939 --> 00:38:44.862
inside is a critical point.
The theorem is used this way.

00:38:44.862 --> 00:38:53.945
If D has no critical points,
it has no closed trajectories

00:38:53.945 --> 00:39:00.000
and therefore has no limit
cycle.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.909
Because, if it did have a
closed trajectory,

00:39:03.909 --> 00:39:07.090
inside it would be a critical
point.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:10.181
But I said B had no critical
point.

00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:15.727
That enables us to dispose of
this system that Bendixson could

00:39:15.727 --> 00:39:20.000
not handle at all.
We can dispose of this system

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.818
immediately.
Namely, what is it?

00:39:22.818 --> 00:39:29.000
Where are its critical points?
Well, where is that zero?

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.550
x squared plus y 
squared is one,

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:35.449
plus one is never zero.
This is positive.

00:39:35.449 --> 00:39:38.637
Or, worse, zero.
And then I add the one to it

00:39:38.637 --> 00:39:42.188
and it is not zero anymore.
This has no zeros and,

00:39:42.188 --> 00:39:46.173
therefore, it does not matter
that this one has a lot of

00:39:46.173 --> 00:39:48.275
zeros.
It makes no difference.

00:39:48.275 --> 00:39:51.028
It has no critical points.
It has none,

00:39:51.028 --> 00:39:54.000
therefore, no limit cycles.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.705
Now, I desperately wanted to
give you the proof of this.

00:40:04.705 --> 00:40:07.804
It is clearly impossible in the
time remaining.

00:40:07.804 --> 00:40:09.960
The proof requires a little
time.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.588
I haven't decided what to do
about that.

00:40:12.588 --> 00:40:15.351
It might leak over until
Friday's lecture.

00:40:15.351 --> 00:40:18.382
Instead, I will finish by
telling you a story.

00:40:18.382 --> 00:40:20.000
How is that?

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.880
And along side of it was little
y prime.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:43.719
I am not going to continue on
with the letters of the

00:40:43.719 --> 00:40:46.526
alphabet.
I will prime the earlier one.

00:40:46.526 --> 00:40:49.406
This has a total of 12
parameters in it.

00:40:49.406 --> 00:40:52.655
But, in fact,
if you change variables you can

00:40:52.655 --> 00:40:57.012
get rid of all the linear terms.
The important part of it is

00:40:57.012 --> 00:41:01.000
only the quadratic terms in the
beginning.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.313
This sort of thing is called a
quadratic system.

00:41:05.313 --> 00:41:09.259
After you have departed from
linear systems,

00:41:09.259 --> 00:41:12.196
it is the simplest kind there
is.

00:41:12.196 --> 00:41:16.968
And the predictor-prey,
the robin-earthworm example I

00:41:16.968 --> 00:41:21.832
gave you is of a typical
quadratic system and exhibits

00:41:21.832 --> 00:41:25.778
typical nonlinear quadratic
system behavior.

00:41:25.778 --> 00:41:30.000
Now, the problem is the
following.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.297
A, b, c, d, e,
f and so on,

00:41:32.297 --> 00:41:37.421
those are just real numbers,
parameters, so I am allowed to

00:41:37.421 --> 00:41:42.016
give them any values I want.
And the problem that has

00:41:42.016 --> 00:41:47.228
bothered people since 1880 when
it was first proposed is how

00:41:47.228 --> 00:41:52.000
many limit cycles can a
quadratic system have?

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.106
After 120 years this problem is
totally unsolved,

00:42:07.106 --> 00:42:12.155
and the mathematicians of the
world who are interested in it

00:42:12.155 --> 00:42:16.433
cannot even agree with each
other on what the right

00:42:16.433 --> 00:42:20.026
conjecture is.
But let me tell you a little

00:42:20.026 --> 00:42:24.304
bit of its history.
There were attempts to solve it

00:42:24.304 --> 00:42:28.497
in the 20 or 30 years after it
was first proposed,

00:42:28.497 --> 00:42:35.000
through the 1920 and `30s which
all seemed to have gaps in them.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.818
Until finally around 1950 two
Russians mathematicians,

00:42:39.818 --> 00:42:44.000
one of whom is extremely
well-known, Petrovski,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.181
a specialist in systems of
ordinary differential equations

00:42:49.181 --> 00:42:54.636
published a long and difficult,
complicated 100 page paper in

00:42:54.636 --> 00:43:00.000
which they proved that the
maximum number is three.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.575
I won't put down their names.
Petrovski-Landis.

00:43:03.575 --> 00:43:08.084
The maximum number was three.
And then not many people were

00:43:08.084 --> 00:43:12.203
able to read the paper,
and those who did there seemed

00:43:12.203 --> 00:43:16.712
to be gaps in the reasoning in
various places until finally

00:43:16.712 --> 00:43:20.598
Arnold who was the greatest
Russian, in my opinion,

00:43:20.598 --> 00:43:23.785
one of the greatest Russian
mathematician,

00:43:23.785 --> 00:43:27.750
certainly in this field of
analysis and differential

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:31.947
equations, but in other fields,
too, he still is great,

00:43:31.947 --> 00:43:37.000
although he is somewhat older
now, criticized it.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.164
He said look,
there is a really big gap in

00:43:41.164 --> 00:43:46.546
this argument and it really
cannot be considered to be

00:43:46.546 --> 00:43:50.304
proven.
People tried working very hard

00:43:50.304 --> 00:43:53.757
to patch it up and without
success.

00:43:53.757 --> 00:43:58.023
Then about 1972 or so,
'75 maybe, a Chinese

00:43:58.023 --> 00:44:03.000
mathematician found a system
with four.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.581
Wrote down the numbers,
the number a is so much,

00:44:07.581 --> 00:44:11.577
b is so much,
and they were absurd numbers

00:44:11.577 --> 00:44:17.718
like 10^-6 and 40 billion and so
on, nothing you could plot on a

00:44:17.718 --> 00:44:22.104
computer screen,
but found a system with four.

00:44:22.104 --> 00:44:26.783
Nobody after this tried to fill
in the gap in the

00:44:26.783 --> 00:44:32.274
Petrovski-Landis paper.
I was then chairman of the math

00:44:32.274 --> 00:44:36.236
department, and one of my tasks
was protocol and so on.

00:44:36.236 --> 00:44:40.052
Anyway, we were trying very
hard to attract a Chinese

00:44:40.052 --> 00:44:44.308
mathematician to our department
to become a full professor.

00:44:44.308 --> 00:44:48.123
He was a really outstanding
analyst and specialist in

00:44:48.123 --> 00:44:50.985
various fields.
Anyway, he came in for a

00:44:50.985 --> 00:44:53.406
courtesy interview and we
chatted.

00:44:53.406 --> 00:44:56.415
At the time,
I was very much interested in

00:44:56.415 --> 00:44:59.496
limit cycles.
And I had on my desk the Math

00:44:59.496 --> 00:45:05.000
Society's translation of the
Chinese book on limit cycles.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.668
A collection of papers by
Chinese mathematicians all on

00:45:08.668 --> 00:45:11.589
limit cycles.
After a certain point he said,

00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:15.054
oh, I see you're interested in
limit cycle problems.

00:45:15.054 --> 00:45:16.820
I said yeah,
in particular,

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:20.828
I was reading this paper of the
mathematician who found four

00:45:20.828 --> 00:45:23.817
limit cycles.
And I opened to that system and

00:45:23.817 --> 00:45:26.535
said the name is,
and I read it out loud.

00:45:26.535 --> 00:45:30.000
I said do you by any chance
know him?

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.720
And he smiled and said yes,
very well.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.000
That is my mother.
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Well, bye-bye.
