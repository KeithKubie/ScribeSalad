00:00:05.508 --> 00:00:08.175
(playful music)

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.450
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.923
Bipedal, naked, large brained,

00:00:17.257 --> 00:00:20.713
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.873
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.233
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.293
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.420
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.693
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.150
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.703
to exchange insights on who
we are, and how we got here.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.960
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.513
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.113
(upbeat music)

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.330
- Paleo anthropologists once thought

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.120
humans evolved in Europe and Asia,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.610
around 40 to 50,000 years ago.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.350
We now know Home sapiens evolved in Africa

00:01:45.346 --> 00:01:48.770
more than 100 to 300,000 years ago.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.280
Yet evidence showing these
earlier humans behaved

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.160
in similar ways to recent
humans continues to surprise us.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.993
But should it?

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.930
Heres an example, several
weeks ago, there was an article

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.440
published in Nature, an
abstract drawing from

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.250
the 73,000 year old levels at
Blombos Cave in South Africa.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.510
Now, this is an important discovery,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.260
and it's published in one
of the world's foremost

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.211
and prestigious scientific journals,

00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:19.350
but abstract drawings are
human cultural universals.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.075
You're looking at some of them right now.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:23.613
Everyone makes them.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.610
Shouldn't we expect that humans who lived

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.930
in South Africa 73,000 years ago

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.064
made abstract drawings too?

00:02:31.064 --> 00:02:35.140
Were early humans not
behaviorally modern humans?

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.420
Were they these primitive
humans that anthropologists

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.477
have been looking for and not finding

00:02:39.477 --> 00:02:41.413
for more than two centuries?

00:02:43.322 --> 00:02:47.060
I think we have to ask, what
is behavioral modernity,

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.880
and take a close look at it.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.440
It's inferred quality based
on unexpected archeological

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.540
discoveries, art, symbols,
carved bone tools,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.249
and similar things, rather
than things predicted

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:01.140
from prior evolutionary theory

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.973
before the excavations started.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.600
Modernity claims come
first, supporting evidence,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.083
arguments and theoretical justifications

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:12.910
are developed after the fact.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.570
This is not a good way to to do science,

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.320
and it's a demonstrably
poor way to do justice,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.560
because long ago, people
in Salem, Massachusetts

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.657
used this same approach
to identify witches.

00:03:22.657 --> 00:03:25.540
(audience laughs)

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.040
Witchcraft accusations came first.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.790
Evidence was then gathered, and theories

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.680
developed after the fact.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.879
More than 200 people were
accused, dozens jailed,

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.960
19 hanged, and one tortured to death.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.116
And yet, Massachusetts exonerated
most accused and convicted

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:44.603
witches 17 years later in 1703.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.190
Why should we expect our
search for prehistoric,

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.720
behaviorally modern humans
to be any more successful

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.133
and enduring than Salem's
search for witches?

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.040
I don't think we should.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.510
So what's wrong with behavioral modernity?

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.537
First off, it's anti-evolutionary.

00:04:01.537 --> 00:04:04.125
It assumes all humans evolve convergently,

00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:06.280
towards the same end, and regardless

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.200
of divergent selective pressures.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.140
Secondly, it's a metaphor, rather than

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.620
measurable property of the evidence.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.313
A metaphor that archeologists
choose selectively.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.900
It doesn't predict.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.036
All the interpretations
are made after the fact.

00:04:23.036 --> 00:04:25.370
I think it's better to
focus, I'll propose,

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.870
it's better to focus on
behavioral complexity instead.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.320
With behavioral modernity,
different lightning bolts

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.640
will all produce the same
kinds of stone tools.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.830
Don't flint knap outdoors
during a lightning storm.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.210
With behavioral complexity,
different causes

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.490
beget different results.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.140
So, what is behavioral complexity?

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.680
Well, key features of
complex phenomena include

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.990
multiple parts that
interact with one another

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.990
systematically, different
inputs create different outputs,

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.970
and historical and geographic
variation among inputs

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.580
creates complexly patterned
variability among the outputs.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.630
That's too much systems theory.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.250
Here's a practical example,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.200
folk art is a complex
phenomenon in which artists,

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.354
cultures, materials, and markets

00:05:10.354 --> 00:05:12.720
interact dynamically with one another.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.325
If you think folk art is simple,

00:05:14.325 --> 00:05:16.969
do please joins us in
Santa Fe, New Mexico,

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:19.670
for the International Folk Art Festival.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:20.853
It happens each July.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.477
Handcrafted artifacts vary
historically and geographically

00:05:25.477 --> 00:05:27.703
in complexly patterned ways.

00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:33.610
So how complex was early
human stone working?

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.220
Today, stone working,
or making stone tools,

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.723
is a handicraft, a folk art,
of which I'm a practitioner.

00:05:41.337 --> 00:05:43.440
It's also a reasonable
source of hypotheses

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.030
about prehistoric stone working,

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.555
because it's familiar, we can observe it.

00:05:48.555 --> 00:05:51.298
If early Homo sapiens
had similar capacities

00:05:51.298 --> 00:05:54.510
for behavioral variability, excuse me,

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.560
for behavioral complexity to ours,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.553
and different ones from earlier hominids,

00:05:59.553 --> 00:06:02.660
then their first appearances
in the fossil record

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.020
should coincide with onsets

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.170
of complexly patterned
stone tool variability.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.850
There's a prediction.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.683
Does it?

00:06:10.683 --> 00:06:11.516
Well, indeed it does.

00:06:11.516 --> 00:06:13.478
After 100 to 300,000 years ago,

00:06:13.478 --> 00:06:16.570
Homo sapiens first appearances everywhere

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.771
coincide with increasingly complex

00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:22.290
and patterned stone tool variability.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.773
So, what is complexly patterned
stone tool variability?

00:06:27.033 --> 00:06:29.883
I think this slide, I hope
this slide captures it well.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.859
To make my point, I've
stripped away all the hints

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:34.555
you would have to the
origins of these artifacts

00:06:34.555 --> 00:06:36.010
from their raw materials,

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.760
and substituted them with drawings.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.814
The objects in blue here date
to more than 300,000 years ago

00:06:42.814 --> 00:06:46.120
and their artifact designs,
their shapes, their morphology,

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.642
their patterns of modification
only weakly indicate

00:06:48.642 --> 00:06:53.269
geographic origin and their
age, if they do so at all.

00:06:53.269 --> 00:06:56.310
Now, in the past, I've
offered to have a contest,

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.356
and offered a $20 bill
to anybody who can guess

00:06:58.356 --> 00:07:01.770
where the object, the
teardrop-shaped object comes from,

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.956
but I'm told that that
would be improper, hee hee.

00:07:04.956 --> 00:07:07.510
(audience laughs)

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.820
Okay, now less than 100,000 years ago,

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.810
artifact designs indicate
age and geographic origin

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.890
with increasing precision.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.300
The objects outlined
in red are a bit older.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.640
They're closer to around
100,000 years ago.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.360
If you were to guess
their ages, you'd probably

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.965
come within 10,000 years,
maybe 100,000 years.

00:07:24.965 --> 00:07:26.708
While the objects in black,

00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:29.380
the objects in black are more recent.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.380
They're younger than 40,000 years,

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.270
and with some of them, we can narrow down

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.686
their occurrence to 2,000 years.

00:07:35.686 --> 00:07:39.040
The object, let's see,
one, two, three, four,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.312
fourth from the right
there, the one with the

00:07:42.312 --> 00:07:45.890
hollow sort of base,
that's an artifact found

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.997
here in North America, but
from the Mississippi River

00:07:48.997 --> 00:07:52.020
to the Rocky Mountains and
up to the Great Plains,

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.570
over the course of about two centuries.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.913
Excuse me, 2,000 years.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.230
What do stone tools teach us?

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.251
First off, stone tools are
indestructible evidence

00:08:02.251 --> 00:08:05.483
about mind-technology relationships.

00:08:06.772 --> 00:08:11.340
This evidence shows complex
mind-technology relationships

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.140
were in place among early humans,

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.731
at least 100 to 300,000 years ago.

00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:19.910
Increasingly complex stone
tool and other artifact

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.730
variability since 100,000 years ago

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.577
suggests mind-technology
relationships changed

00:08:25.577 --> 00:08:28.290
during the course of human evolution.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.734
So if you're trying to discover
the influence of the mind

00:08:30.734 --> 00:08:33.282
on technology and technology on the mind,

00:08:33.282 --> 00:08:36.483
we need to remember, we're
shooting at a moving target.

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.630
So, why?

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.820
These are the fun questions.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.130
Why does stone tool variability become

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.250
increasingly complex and patterned?

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.563
Tools can be evolutionarily advantageous,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.653
but they come with costs
few other animals tolerate.

00:08:55.084 --> 00:08:57.946
Other primates occasionally use tools,

00:08:57.946 --> 00:09:02.654
but only Homo sapiens are
obligatory tool users.

00:09:02.654 --> 00:09:05.830
Obligatory tool use is irreversible.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.390
Even the best survival
experts require tools.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.220
How many of you guys will
fess up to seeing the show,

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.710
Naked and Afraid?
(audience laughs)

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.307
Come on, you've seen this.

00:09:14.307 --> 00:09:16.260
Some of you, I know at least one other

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.093
of you in the audience has been like me,

00:09:17.093 --> 00:09:19.670
recruited to participate in it.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.048
I don't want to treat
my students to pictures

00:09:21.048 --> 00:09:22.999
of me running around without clothes.

00:09:22.999 --> 00:09:24.927
They couldn't get
insurance for this program

00:09:24.927 --> 00:09:27.980
unless they equipped the
contestants with tools.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.022
It wouldn't be called Naked and Afraid,

00:09:30.022 --> 00:09:31.923
it would be called Naked and Dead.

00:09:31.923 --> 00:09:34.290
(audience laughs)

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.620
Now, I was gonna say, it's irreversible.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.810
We can't go back.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.840
More tool use increases
cultural differences' potential

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.552
influence on toolmaking strategies.

00:09:45.552 --> 00:09:49.193
I like to call this the no,
you're doing it wrong effect.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.640
So, what do we know, what do we not know,

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.690
and what do we want to know?

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.380
We know obligatory tool use
is intrinsically complex

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.556
and variable, and these are
qualities we can measure

00:10:01.556 --> 00:10:03.523
using the stone tool evidence.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.000
We do not know whether obligatory tool use

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.430
was a uniquely derived
characteristic of Homo sapiens'

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.469
behavior, or one shared by
other hominins now extinct,

00:10:14.469 --> 00:10:17.363
Such as Denisovans, Neanderthal, perhaps?

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:22.110
We find ourselves in a happy spot

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.080
where we have new research questions.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.820
You always want to come up
with new research questions.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.230
You don't want to just hang up your spurs

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.910
and go do something else.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.710
How did obligatory tool
use change the human mind

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.898
from earlier primate
and hominin conditions?

00:10:36.898 --> 00:10:40.063
And how do we detect obligatory tool use?

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.720
Now, some of my colleagues might say,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.730
and I'm not referring
to anyone in the room,

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.710
some of my colleagues might say

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.640
we have an arsenal of ways
of measuring stone tools,

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.575
and quantifying their variability,

00:10:50.575 --> 00:10:53.553
that we've been using for 200 years,

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.526
but archeologists who
formulated those measurements

00:10:56.526 --> 00:11:01.526
200 years ago weren't thinking
about obligatory tool use.

00:11:01.708 --> 00:11:04.840
So, we're in a situation
where we have a toolbox

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.890
full of hammers and chisels,
and we're setting forth

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.003
to change the battery on an iPhone.

00:11:11.839 --> 00:11:14.950
I don't think the existing
tools archeologists use

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.980
to characterize the stone tool record

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.980
are necessarily unhelpful, but
we have to prove that value.

00:11:22.297 --> 00:11:23.460
Thank you.

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.460
(audience applauds)

00:11:31.539 --> 00:11:34.206
(upbeat music)
