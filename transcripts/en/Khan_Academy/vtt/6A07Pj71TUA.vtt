MALE SPEAKER 1: What
could we do to improve K

00:00:01.945 --> 00:00:04.710
through 12 education
in America the best?

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.920
BILL GATES: Well, today, if
you're motivated to learn,

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.860
if you really, really,
really want to learn,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.530
this is an amazing
time for everyone.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.630
Because if you have
access to Wikipedia,

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.120
if you have access to the
latest information on the web--

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.060
there's a website that I've
just been using with my kids

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.840
recently called Khan
Academy, K-H-A-N.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.300
Just one guy doing some
unbelievable 15-minute

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.450
tutorials.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.820
There's great college lectures
out on academicearth.org.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.930
So if you're
motivated, now you can

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.800
go to the very best lectures.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.540
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Speaking of allocation

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.020
of society's resources, I think
you said, on your campus tour,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.670
at least at Harvard,
that the allocation of IQ

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.690
points of our society to Wall
Street financial instruments

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.780
was higher than it needed to
be, and that some of those IQ

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.462
points should go
into other fields.

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:04.170
BILL GATES: Yeah.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.240
Well if you say, OK, what
portion of society's IQ

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.510
goes into studying
great teachers

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.940
and documenting what
those great teachers do

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.290
and how you would spread those
practices, what is effectively

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.460
the R&amp;D component in
education, it's about as close

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.750
to nil as you can imagine.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.950
And yet, what's the
most important thing

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.960
in terms of having
a society that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.260
has both got equality
of opportunity

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.000
and is competitive
with other countries?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.400
It's education.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.260
And so it's this
mind-blowing misallocation.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.730
My favorite vignette is
that guy, Salman Khan.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.640
He was a hedge fund guy
making lots of money,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.760
and he quit to do these
little web videos.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.980
And so we have moved, I'd
say, about 160 IQ points

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.980
from the hedge fund category
into the teaching many,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.210
many people in a
leveraged way category.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.170
So that was a good day,
the day that his wife

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.450
let him quit his job.
