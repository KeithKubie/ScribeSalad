human tissue if you will that you can
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.410
human tissue if you will that you can
attach to the native rotator cuff and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420
attach to the native rotator cuff and
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.740
attach to the native rotator cuff and
then use that as a bridge to fill the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750
then use that as a bridge to fill the
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.560
then use that as a bridge to fill the
gap and reattach the continuity of the

with the procedure would recommend the

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149
with the procedure would recommend the
 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:59.850
with the procedure would recommend the
procedure to a friend or family member

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860
procedure to a friend or family member
 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.740
procedure to a friend or family member
and would have the procedure again under

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750
and would have the procedure again under
 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.899
and would have the procedure again under
the same circumstance and I think when

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909
the same circumstance and I think when
 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.789
the same circumstance and I think when
you look at patient satisfaction I think

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799
you look at patient satisfaction I think
 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.679
you look at patient satisfaction I think
that's the highest acid test that the

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689
that's the highest acid test that the
 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.120
that's the highest acid test that the
patient's actually felt that they

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130
patient's actually felt that they
 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.339
patient's actually felt that they
improved that their lifestyles improved

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349
improved that their lifestyles improved
 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.479
improved that their lifestyles improved
and that they would recommend the

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489
and that they would recommend the
 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.890
and that they would recommend the
procedure to a friend or family member

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900
procedure to a friend or family member
 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.160
procedure to a friend or family member
or have the procedure again the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170
or have the procedure again the
 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.199
or have the procedure again the
