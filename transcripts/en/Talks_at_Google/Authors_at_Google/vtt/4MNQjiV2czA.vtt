MALE SPEAKER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.590
Welcome.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.752
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:05.752 --> 00:00:08.050
MALE SPEAKER: No, it is not.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.480
Apparently we're starting
to do a little comedy.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.480
Welcome to Authors at Google
presents "Ultrasylvania." The

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.541
writer and the art director
of "Ultrasylvania" will be

00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:24.095
speaking today about the project
itself, which was done

00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:26.470
in collaboration with the
Academy of Art University in

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.140
San Francisco and also a
Kickstarter project.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.115
So we have two people today, the
writer Brian Schirmer and

00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:37.150
the co-creator and art director
Jeremy Saliba.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.851
Brian Schirmer has written
comics and screenplays for

00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:42.380
most of his adult life,
following aborted attempts as

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.914
a teenager to write "Indiana
Jones" and "Star Trek" novels.

00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:47.850
His first attempt at
screenwriting was a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.270
handwritten adaption of Marvel's
first "Micronauts"

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.700
comic series, circa 1980.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.390
It's in a box somewhere.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.802
He is the author of the comic
anthology "Worlds Apart" and

00:00:57.802 --> 00:01:00.486
the original graphic novel
"White Tower" due from

00:01:00.486 --> 00:01:02.438
Committed Comics in 2013.

00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:05.854
He has written, produced, and
directed two feature films--

00:01:05.854 --> 00:01:08.490
"Fools of the Game" and "Medium
Gray"-- the latter of

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.066
which screened in Park
City during the 2004

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.530
Sundance Film Festival.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.970
Nevertheless, pretty cool.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.680
He continues to write and teach
Writing for Comics in

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.360
San Francisco, California.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.955
Jeremy Saliba is a lover of all
things nerdy and has used

00:01:23.955 --> 00:01:26.420
that passion to continue
creating artwork despite the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.190
pleading from family and
friends to stop.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.025
He has done artwork for various
comic publications and

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:35.055
has become a licensed "Wheel of
Time" artist and sells art

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:36.550
prints online.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.070
He also inflicts his twisted
and self-absorbed point of

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.860
view on his students at
the Academy of Art.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.550
He's a movie fanatic, a
bookworm, and a beer

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.980
enthusiast.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.240
His imaginary friend when he was
little was Princess Leia,

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.310
and he will never say no if you
ask him to help you move.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.800
He also hates talking
in the third person.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.840
Ladies and Gentlemen, please
welcome Brian Schirmer and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.470
Jeremy Saliba.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.210
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Thank
you, Chris.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.350
Thank you, Googlers,
here and abroad.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.780
I'm Brian.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.520
This is Jeremy.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.509
JEREMY SALIBA: Hey.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.520
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And
we are behind

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.470
"Ultrasylvania," as he said.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.170
We titled this presentation the
Road to "Ultrasylvania"

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.780
because we wanted to basically
show you the path that we took

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.340
from initial conception all
the way to even here today

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.690
because it's an ongoing
project.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.860
We, he and I, have been working
together in comics for

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.660
about five years now.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.280
As Chris mentioned, we
collaborated on an anthology

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.950
called "Worlds Apart," which
I'm happy to say-- and that

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.760
doesn't come out quite right--
but happy to say is actually

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.760
out of print now because
we sold all of them.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.920
So that's fantastic.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.200
JEREMY SALIBA: Right.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.960
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And yeah.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.720
I write, and Jeremy's been
an Illustrator for ages.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.380
JEREMY SALIBA: Yeah, yeah.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.080
Yeah That was kind of our first
foray for us into this

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.985
collaborative kind of thing,
and we both just wanted to

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:03.235
work on a project together.

00:03:05.762 --> 00:03:07.610
Well, he had an idea to do
several short stories that

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.650
involve various artists.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.060
And he and I clicked really well
right away and all that

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.700
kind of stuff and have done
a couple short stories and

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.060
pitches since then.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.290
But both of our schedules were
precluding something really,

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.110
really hugely committed in terms
of like a graphic novel

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.520
or anything.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.240
And then Brian, took a little
trip and got some funny ideas.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.190
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Yeah.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.770
Summer of 2011, I went to Europe
because I hadn't been

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.300
in about 20 years, and
I figured I can go

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.900
into debt for this.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.980
So I did, and did some
traveling, blah, blah, biblah,

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.480
and saw some amazing sites and
some fantastic cities.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.180
And basically came up--

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.950
I was keeping a notebook of just
any ideas that would come

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.810
across like, to my opinion,
any good writer should.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.940
And a couple of ones that came
up and stuck had to do with

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.860
the notion of what if
Frankenstein's monster and

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.600
Dracula were world leaders,
instead of these creatures in

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.540
the darkness and ill-fated
and what have you.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.110
As I say, these were just a
couple of ideas amongst a

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.339
myriad of others that I jotted
down, but they kind

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:20.890
of stuck with me.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.330
As was mentioned, I think, we
both teach and have taught at

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.590
the Academy of Art here
in San Francisco.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.200
And basically what happened
was, I was approached by a

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.580
former student who said, why
don't they have a class here

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.540
that we could take one of your
comic scripts and make it a

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.860
class where students would come
in and do the artwork,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.330
basically a collaborative.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.150
And I laughed at him immediately
and probably made

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.240
him feel very small.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.640
As fate would have it, about
three or four days went by,

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.580
and I still couldn't
shake this notion.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.330
And I mentioned it to Jeremy,
and we talked

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.860
about it very briefly.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.110
And then we decided, you know,
let's go talk to the head of

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.510
the School of Illustration,
Chuck Pyle,

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.760
and see what he thinks.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.610
And yeah, he had some very
pointed questions about our

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.720
plans and what we thought
we would accomplish.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.170
And we said, well,
we'll do this.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.760
We'll come up with this great
story, and we'll give it to

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.400
the students and they'll work
on it and we'll put it out.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.570
It'll be a web comic, and then
we'll run a Kickstarter to

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.640
fund the printing of it.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.150
And then we'll have it at
conventions and premiere and

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.790
give it to industry people, and
then get it on Amazon and

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.660
get it in stores.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.990
And he said, OK, that
sounds good.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.830
Let's do that.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.490
And in the back of my mind I'm
thinking, OK, if we hit one or

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.050
two of those goals,
we're doing OK.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.970
I forgot to put this in here.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.260
This is the original
solicitation poster for the

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.550
class that Jeremy
put together.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.110
I guess this is probably
the original--

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.520
the first initial artwork that
we had of any kind, based on

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.660
the script and the notes that
existed at the time.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.520
So we had a very solid response
from students.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.780
I should point out that it was
not an open class, as it were.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.265
It wasn't something that anybody
could sign up for.

00:06:24.265 --> 00:06:27.350
We were basically given carte
blanche to handpick who we

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:28.170
wanted in the class.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.100
So students either had to submit
a portfolio, in some

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.450
cases, a couple of them were
students we already knew, so

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.210
we knew their work.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.730
We knew the quality that they
would bring and the

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.760
commitment.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.260
JEREMY SALIBA: In this case,
having a working knowledge of

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.150
how things are at the Academy
and what facilities were

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.680
available to us was a
big leg up because--

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.750
this, what Brian's showing you
a picture of here is the

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.450
Centique lab at the Academy.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.090
And for anyone who may not be
familiar with Centique, it's a

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.470
drawing tablet that
is a monitor.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.900
So you just use a stylus and
draw it on it and create

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.510
digital artwork that way,
primarily using Photoshop but

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.940
really, any drawing
program will do.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.710
And I've taught in that
classroom for quite a while.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.065
I'm very familiar with the
technology, and students are

00:07:07.065 --> 00:07:08.270
very excited about
the technology.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.290
So we had that going for us.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.640
And we asked Chuck, can
we teach in there?

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.180
As it happens, I have a lot of
experience working on those

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.450
and teaching in there, so he
said, sure, that sounds great.

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:20.950
And it helps with the
students, too.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.620
They get excited to have access
to this kind of really

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.100
high-end industry professional
materials.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.440
So that, and also having worked
at the Academy for a

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.490
while, we had a pretty good
knowledge of the students.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.190
I'd had quite a few students
come through my classes.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.010
We always make note of the good
ones, the competition, as

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.570
I call them.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:45.590
And when this idea started
crystallizing, I had a short

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.590
list already going in my head of
people I would ask to join

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.270
us in the classroom.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.990
So that working knowledge of
everything there, I think,

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.580
helped speed up the process
more than we

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.510
thought it would go.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.380
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Yes.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.140
To date, we've run this class
twice, and each time has

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:09.410
resulted in a volume of the
story, which-- and I don't

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.930
think I've even given
the basic spiel--

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.530
which, beyond the original note
that I jotted down that I

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.450
mentioned about Frankenstein and
Dracula as world leaders,

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:22.910
it evolved into this story that
basically stretches--

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.130
First of all, it stretches
throughout the entire 19th

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:29.200
century and basically recarves
the European and worldwide

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.549
landscape based on something
that Napoleon's forces unearth

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:40.780
when they were in Egypt
in 1799, I believe.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.520
But it's more than that.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.400
That's really just a setting.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.650
It's a place for us to go play
with these characters and have

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:51.760
them have real lives and deal
with, as they say, political

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.470
intrigues and assassination
attempts.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.280
JEREMY SALIBA: Well, even given
that core story, it

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.040
involves a lot of fun sub-genres
in comics.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.030
Alternate history is a big
fun thing to play with.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.860
When you have an alternate
history, you get to kind of

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.800
then mess around with the
evolution of technology a

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.130
little bit, which inevitably
will at least touch upon

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.910
steampunk kind of things,
which is a

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.020
very popular sub-genre.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.300
And we also have the monster,
the classic monster movie

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.690
genre, that we're playing with
in there with Frankenstein and

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.550
Dracula and the Mummy.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:25.260
So all of those things
were at our disposal.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.620
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And tweaking
expectations, I think.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.050
I don't think either one of us
are really huge fans of,

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.840
perhaps, movie
re-interpretations of things

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.110
that have come down the
pipe in recent years.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:41.410
Although some might deduce that
that's what we're doing,

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:45.180
it was really more taking--

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.060
not taking liberties.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.840
For example, rather than
having Dracula have a

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.330
Renfield, we give him a guy
named Redford, who's an

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:57.620
American and basically winds up
becoming known as Renfield.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.340
And I'll give a little something
away here-- that

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.600
Bram Stoker himself is an actual
character in the first

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:08.150
volume of this story coming to
ostensibly write a biography

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.550
of Dracula and ultimately
winds up writing the

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:12.970
book that we know.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.430
JEREMY SALIBA: Right, right.

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:19.230
So with all these ideas at our
back, Brian wrote the script,

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.930
and we brought it
to the students.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.550
And they were really excited.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.440
They seemed to be overjoyed at
the idea of yeah, let's make a

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.090
comic with a script in place
written by a professional.

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:30.810
We have another professional
who's going to oversee and

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.580
guide everything for us.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.890
So it was really enthusiastic
and a lot of fun.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.390
I tend to kind of try to have
fun when I'm teaching anyways

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.030
because that can be
a pretty bland

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.160
experience in some cases.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.510
But if we're doing comics,
it should be fun.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.240
So it was an interesting
in-class experience.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.650
I was the official teacher,
although Brian was pretty much

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.040
there for every minute of
the class to weigh in.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.150
You know, when looking at
artistic interpretations of

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.690
the ideas in his script,
sometimes, a lot of times, a

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.560
student will have a completely
different idea than what I was

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.480
thinking of.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.590
And sometimes, that's a great
thing, and sometimes it's a

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.420
little off the rails and
not what we wanted.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.640
And other times, I find it to
be a little bit of a draw.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.820
Those are the times when I find
Brian being there to be

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.520
the most valuable.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.460
He's my great tiebreaker.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.360
And it's like, your idea's
great, and my idea's clearly

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.920
awesome, but which one
should we go with?

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.415
And Brian's pretty impartial.

00:11:18.415 --> 00:11:20.290
BRIAN SCHIRMER: I sit in a
throne at the very front of

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:24.010
the classroom where we have a
screen, and I will either--

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:26.300
I'm the Roman praetor.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.520
JEREMY SALIBA: We need
to get you a scepter.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.770
BRIAN SCHIRMER: That
would be lovely.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.110
Basically, the first volume came
to fruition, and within

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.550
less than a week, we launched
the web comic, which is

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.240
ultrasylvania.com.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.500
And that started in May of 2012,
and we've been running

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.870
three pages a week
ever since then.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.060
And I'm very proud to say we've
never missed a day.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.050
JEREMY SALIBA: That's right.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.010
I was going to talk a little
more about the classroom

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.580
experience, too.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:57.220
I was running--

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.130
primarily, it was a
critique session.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.370
One of the first things I had
mentioned to the students is,

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.450
we're not going to run this
like a traditional class.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.860
Normally, in an art class like
this with students, you put

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.270
the burden of finding reference
on them because

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.520
that's part of the creative
process that they must learn.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.520
Whereas in this case, we want
to make as good a book as

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.620
possible, so Brian did
a lot of research.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.340
I did some research.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.210
And we brought it to the class
and provided it for them.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.930
So already, again, they
were very excited.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.340
And it's like, we get all this
already just handed to us?

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.290
And this is more of a
professional environment.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.280
If we have something specific
we want you to utilize to

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.050
create this, we should provide
that for you, at least steer

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.980
you in that direction.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:35.670
And so most of that semester was
them bringing in the work

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.910
and us dissecting it, going
over it, looking at it.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.910
And as much as we kept
it professional--

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:43.470
obviously they're still in
school, so they don't know

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:43.910
everything.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.870
So that's kind of where the
teaching element, for me at

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.170
least, would come in, discussing
some of the basics,

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.320
like crossing the line or
general rules of layout or the

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.480
flow of the eye through
a page.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.670
Digging into that kind of stuff
and making sure that

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.760
they understand these
fundamentals, as well as

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.410
pushing them to be as
professional as possible.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.780
One of the other things that's
kind of fun about the class,

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.140
for me in having Brian there, is
that he and I are a little

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.900
bit of a yin and a yang.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.560
When it comes to subverting
expectations and tweaking

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.880
things in a way that people
might not expect, Brian's a

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:16.480
big fan of that.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.080
I am, too, but Brian likes to
go a more subtle route.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.220
With monsters it's, well, it's
a monster, but we're going to

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.110
keep them a little bit more
distinguished, a little bit

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:28.320
more not so classic, universal,
black and white,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.280
Hollywood version.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.340
And I'm the pulpy guy.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.330
I'm the guy who's like, yeah,
let's have them rip up the

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.780
ground and throw rocks
at people if he's

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:35.820
Frankenstein, right?

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:36.890
Like the Hulk, right?

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:40.890
And so Brian will typically rein
me in, and I'll kind of

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:45.650
amp him up with kind of a fun
back and forth, trying to meet

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:46.670
things in the middle.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.325
Not completely going overboard,
but at the same

00:13:49.325 --> 00:13:52.770
time, not trying to
stay too somber.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.770
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And frequently
the students themselves are

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.790
the random element.

00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:00.080
More often than not, he'll
have some idea, and I'll

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.480
temper it down or vice versa.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.160
And then the student will
come in and say, well,

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:03.950
why don't I do this?

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.370
And they'll show us the artwork
and we'll go, that's

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.040
so much better than what
I wrote in the script.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.070
Thank you, thank you.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.250
This is fantastic.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.930
A for the day.

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.230
JEREMY SALIBA: Having that
trust-- like if you're going

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.560
to collaborate with a group of
people, if you want them to be

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.900
really involved, you want them
to have an input, right?

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:26.120
You want them to put their own
stamp on things and to have a

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.690
value in it because they're a
part owner of the ideas, of

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.860
the process of creating it,
and that can create

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.790
enthusiasm as well.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:37.350
But also, I mean, we're
extremely fallible, so anyone

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.080
who has any ideas, please
bring them before us.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.750
You'd rather hear a bad idea and
discard it than have you

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.150
not bring up a good idea that
would've really come in handy.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.340
And to me, that's been one of
the most rewarding parts of

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.260
this process is having this
really truly open,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.850
collaborative vibe throughout
the whole thing, where

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.480
anyone's free at any point to
come up and have a suggestion,

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.490
have an idea.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.860
And we make that clear
right away, too.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.750
If anyone has any ideas,
we'd love to hear them.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.185
Sometimes students come in with
crazy ideas, and I get a

00:15:06.185 --> 00:15:08.400
little torn because that
sounds amazing.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.650
Yes, Frankenstein should fight
a bear out in the woods.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.850
That's a great idea, but it just
doesn't fit in this part

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.350
of the book at all, so we're
going to have to not use that.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:20.300
But maybe a short story
somewhere else, where he

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.450
fights a giant octopus
in the ocean.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.560
BRIAN SCHIRMER: But
I do always--

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.870
in almost every script that I've
ever written for him or

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.190
for the students or anyone--

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:33.050
I always preface it with,
this is a blueprint.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.960
If you have a better idea for
something, I trust you.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.900
You are coming to this
as the visual artist.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:44.050
I have a bit of a visual art
background, but you are making

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:44.720
this your career.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.500
You are making a career choice
to do this stuff.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.520
And either go for it, or if
you're kind of not sure if you

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.240
think it's right, let's
talk about it.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.460
Because I don't want to,
basically, be coming in there

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.810
and saying, no, this
is what I wrote.

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.050
This is what the
comic will be.

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:01.800
I don't want to be
that person.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.720
JEREMY SALIBA: Yeah,
that's not fun.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.020
BRIAN SCHIRMER: No.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:05.729
Please.

00:16:05.729 --> 00:16:07.974
AUDIENCE: Just about how much
of the whole script do you

00:16:07.974 --> 00:16:11.440
guys have fleshed out or just
your whole timeline?

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.190
BRIAN SCHIRMER: How much of the
whole script do we have

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:14.929
fleshed out ahead of time?

00:16:14.929 --> 00:16:17.048
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm just kind
of curious more about-- you

00:16:17.048 --> 00:16:18.596
seem to have these
deadlines, like

00:16:18.596 --> 00:16:20.020
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:20.420
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Sure.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.550
JEREMY SALIBA: Right, right.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.680
JEREMY SALIBA: Well, he has
the script done before the

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.590
class starts.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.930
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.650
JEREMY SALIBA: Yeah.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.380
Yeah, we have, obviously,
like you noted,

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.600
we have these deadlines.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.540
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Part of the
beauty is that, basically,

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.690
when a semester ends, which is
when the class ends, which is

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:41.990
when a volume ends, and then we
go into that volume on the

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.460
website, everything's done.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.160
So that is what has really
enabled us to hit the Monday,

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.030
Wednesday, Friday deadline.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:53.730
If I'm really fortunate and all
the artwork is done and

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:57.440
I've done all the lettering,
theoretically, I can put all

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.460
that into the website, and I
just sit back and wait for it

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:05.665
to roll out every couple days,
thanks to the backbone.

00:17:05.665 --> 00:17:07.160
JEREMY SALIBA: Right.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.030
And part of this web comic
experience was another big

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.220
selling point for the Academy,
as well as the students.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.359
And one of our big declarations
at the beginning

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:18.150
was that our goal
was promotion.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:19.900
Our goal was to get everyone's
name out there who was

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.589
involved in the book.

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:21.910
Students want that terribly.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.440
They want to make a name for
themselves in the business.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.050
And comics, while it can be a
lucrative business, can also

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:32.260
just be a passion business that
you do where you're not

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.370
necessarily making
a lot of money.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.390
And I think you can't go into
it looking to make money or

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.230
your soul will be crushed far
too early and far too quickly.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.000
Because you have to go in to
want to tell the stories that

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.840
you want to tell or make cool
art or whatever your

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.700
passion on it is.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.620
So that was always
the first step.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.970
And I don't know, Brian
handles the web

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:51.800
comic side of things.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.090
But to me, it seems like one
of the easier steps of this

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:57.070
whole process in terms of the
outlook we had for the future

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:00.470
of this book, with having it
sell on certain websites,

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.930
having a Kickstarter, all
that kind of stuff.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.166
So that was the one kind of
surefire thing we knew and

00:18:05.166 --> 00:18:06.400
that we could guarantee the
students, well, it's going to

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.700
be a web comic, and it'll launch
right after class.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.990
So it's been an integral part
of everything for us and has

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.030
gotten some fun readership.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.500
And we get some fun feedback,
and people are leaving

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:21.890
comments and looking for the
next step and sharing their

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:25.700
shock when something
exciting happens.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:25.980
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Yeah.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.500
As I said before, we knew we
could do the web comic.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.050
That was easy, all things
considered.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:36.570
But then our next goal was OK,
well, web comics are great.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:40.710
But I think we're still fans of
printed media, and we knew

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:41.370
we wanted to do that.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.715
We knew it wasn't necessarily a
cheap thing, but we also, of

00:18:43.715 --> 00:18:45.260
course, knew about
Kickstarter.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:50.050
And so, probably, three months
or so after the web comic

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:56.340
launched, we went ahead and did
a campaign on Kickstarter

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.130
looking to raise just enough,
basically, enough money to do

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:05.200
an offset printing of
the first volume.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.930
And for those who don't know
about Kickstarter, it's

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.320
basically a platform where you
can go and raise money for an

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.680
artistic endeavor, in
our case, comics.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:21.220
But they also do film and
theater and books of any kind.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.300
JEREMY SALIBA: Products,
in some cases.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.320
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Electronics.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:24.690
JEREMY SALIBA: Right.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:29.430
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And yeah, so
we basically set a goal.

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.400
In our case, we were going out
for $8,500, which was going to

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.240
fund the printing and the
supplemental little rewards

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.050
that would be given to people
that would be supporters.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:43.370
And with Kickstarter,
if you don't

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:44.320
know, it's all or nothing.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.340
So we were setting
a goal of $8,500.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.810
If we made it, great.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:48.500
There's going to be a book.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.080
If we didn't, we got nothing,
and we would be very happy to

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.470
continue with the web comic.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:59.820
We were very pleased and
surprised that it got traction

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:04.120
almost immediately, and we
certainly made our goal.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.720
We exceeded our goal.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.880
We got about 130%
of what we were

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.480
after, which was fantastic.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:18.660
And we got some lovely press
along the way and support from

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:22.880
industry professionals by way of
everything from people who

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.040
actually backed the book to
folks who gave us shout outs

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.290
on Twitter or on
their website.

00:20:29.655 --> 00:20:30.540
JEREMY SALIBA: It
went very well.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.990
I think in the interest of
really discussing the process,

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.610
Brian did a lot of leg work
ahead of time, too.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.250
He really set up connections
with people, did all his

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:42.220
networking, conventions, other
things of that nature.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:46.090
And was sending out PDFs, copies
of the book ahead of

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.510
the Kickstarter campaign saying,
hey, this is our book.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.340
This is this new thing we came
up with at this class where

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.820
we're teaching students to make
a book and getting it out

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.610
there, and what do you think?

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.820
I think laying some initial
groundwork before starting

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.720
something like a Kickstarter
is a big part of-- it can

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.890
really help your odds of success
because then people

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:05.360
are looking for it.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.810
They're ready for it.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:09.370
In this case, we knew a
gentleman who was working for

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.660
the store Things From Another
World, and he was a big

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:13.530
supporter of it.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:16.690
And brought up the idea that,
oh, maybe we should work

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.415
together and maybe we could sell
your book at our store.

00:21:19.415 --> 00:21:20.840
We were like, oh, that
sounds terrible.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.390
Yes, we'll do it.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:26.690
So things like that, where he
did a lot of leg work ahead of

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.360
time, were fantastic.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.690
I think the other aspect that
helped the Kickstarter become

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:34.130
successful was, again, having
this little mini-phalanx of

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.580
students in our class.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.380
Online presences can
be quite vast.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.440
It seems like the younger a
person is, the more-- you know

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.800
the digital natives who grew
up with this stuff just fly

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.020
through the internet
faster than my

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.470
old-man eyes can handle.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.170
So then they were getting
the word out.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:54.400
And then they'd tell
two friends, and

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.010
they'd tell two friends.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:57.220
So having that core group of
people together, I think,

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.840
really helped the visibility.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:01.900
BRIAN SCHIRMER: One of the
things, though, that really

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.670
surprised me and still does to
this day was, as you can see,

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.670
we got 367 backers.

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:10.670
I would say only about
a third of those were

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:12.880
people that we knew.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.860
We meaning Jeremy and I, meaning
the students, meaning

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:15.820
their families.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.800
So about 200 of those people,
we have no idea.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.350
People from around the world
were backing this thing.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.920
People in our backyard that--

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.990
I don't know who
this person is.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.720
They live three blocks
from me, but they're

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.020
backing this book.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:33.410
And that was just phenomenal
that it had that kind of

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:38.450
reach, and people seemed to
want to be a part of it.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:41.220
And it was really rather amazing
when we were done, and

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.030
I'm looking at the breakdowns
of where everyone's from.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:52.950
And we've got Brazil, Belgium,
Australia, England of course,

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.592
France, most of Europe.

00:22:55.592 --> 00:22:58.450
Yeah, and it was just--

00:22:58.450 --> 00:22:59.590
I'm still flabbergasted.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.100
JEREMY SALIBA: I think the other
thing that's important

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.360
to discuss about people who
are just new to doing

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.280
Kickstarter campaigns is I've
had such a positive

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.060
experience with it.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.050
We did one.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.740
It got more than we asked for.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.790
It was awesome.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:12.800
It was wonderful.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.860
And so I just kind of for a
while there was seeing it as

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.980
this magic well of money.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.610
Yay, if you want something,
go to Kickstarter.

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.870
But I've since talked to other
people who've done it and

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.440
people who have run
Kickstarters

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.700
that did not succeed.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.210
And I helped run the Kickstarter
campaign, but

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.870
Brian spearheaded it, and
it's a full-time job.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.380
That's the one thing.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:35.370
It's a great place to go if
you want to get, whatever,

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.060
your work out there, get
something published, whatever

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.200
it is your artistic endeavor is
that requires some money.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.320
It's amazing, but you've got
to be ready because it's at

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.540
least, what, eight
hours a day.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.140
BRIAN SCHIRMER: You get out
what you put into it.

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:51.730
I have known people that have,
again, done eight or more

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:55.280
hours a day working on their
Kickstarter, and it shows and

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.360
they get results.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.160
And I've known other people that
basically turn it on and

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.640
walk away, and are then
flummoxed two, three weeks

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.310
later when they only
have four backers.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:07.810
You have to be realistic
about it.

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:10.030
And if you already have
a full-time job,

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.320
it's a second one.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.100
Congratulations.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.410
But the rewards are
self-evident.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.850
Again, we did this and
wound up with this.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:23.470
We wound up with a printed book
that we were then able

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:27.070
to, of course, send to all the
people that supported us,

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:30.990
along with the other goodies,
but then also sell.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.780
And our first sales experience
was really going around to

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.715
conventions and showing
it to folks.

00:24:37.715 --> 00:24:38.900
Or actually, I take that back.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.620
No, our first experience
was this is--

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.730
so this is a good , if not all,
then most of the students

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.720
who actually worked
on Volume One.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.550
And after the books came in,
we naturally needed to send

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:54.590
them out to the 367 people
who supported us.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:58.020
So we basically had a day where
we acquired one of the

00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:00.600
rooms at the Academy
and took it over.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.740
And what you're seeing here is
them putting sketches in

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.750
virtually all of the books
that went out.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.770
And then we signed everything,
packaged everything.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:12.110
Basically, it does
not end when the

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.980
Kickstarter campaign ends.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.920
You don't just suddenly get, oh
hurray, all this money is

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.600
now in my account.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.260
Boom, we're done.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.270
No, that's when--

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:21.050
I don't want to say when the
real work begins-- but that's

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:24.590
when the next stage of
the real work begins.

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:28.710
But then, yes, we were able to
move on to conventions and

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.730
selling stuff.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.520
I went to New York.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.270
Oh, that was the other thing.

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.470
Again, part of our original
plan was having a debut at

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:39.540
conventions.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:45.820
And we were fortunate enough
to have the only bi-coastal

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:50.660
debut taking place at New York
Comic Con and APE, the

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.760
Alternative Press Expo here in
San Francisco, which just

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.930
happened to be the same
weekend last year.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.100
I went to New York.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.960
Jeremy was here with some of
the guys from the book.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.750
And we got some press for
that, which was great.

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:05.830
And definitely had some people
come up to us at the

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:11.470
conventions saying, oh, I backed
this, or I saw this on

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.320
Bleeding Cool or io9 or any of
the other sites that actually

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.510
covered us.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.370
For me, that's still one of
the more amazing things is

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.160
like, people coming up to
me and saying oh yeah, I

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.860
recognize you from blah.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:22.900
And it's like really?

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.890
I live in a small apartment
in San Francisco.

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:27.570
Thank you, thank you.

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:32.950
And we managed to meet some
luminaries along the way that

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:34.410
gave us some support.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:39.100
That's Dave Gibbons, who was the
illustrator on "Watchmen"

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:44.140
most notably, but still a big
wheel in comics today.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.980
That's me hanging with Grant
Morrison, who was a kind

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:48.470
enough gentleman--

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:49.040
JEREMY SALIBA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.000
you guys, right?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:50.240
[INAUDIBLE].

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.480
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Oh
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.210
We're like this.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.810
And we have since also done
book signings, in-store

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.300
signings here in the Bay
Area, of which I should

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.200
definitely say that--

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.080
if this is something that anyone
wants to do, insofar as

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:09.450
getting a book published and
getting it out there, going

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:10.450
door-to-door to--

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:12.440
if you are fortunate to live
in an area that has comic

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.610
shops, go to them.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.580
Tell them that you're
doing this thing.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.610
More often than not, they are
going to be very excited and

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:22.440
supportive of the notion of
local artists because their

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:26.330
customers tend to be interested
in that as well.

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:29.590
We've probably done, what, four
or five signings here in

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.890
the Bay Area since last fall?

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.030
And it's a wonderful time.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:38.720
And it's great meeting the
owners of the businesses and

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.160
seeing what their
lives are like.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.230
And again, more often than not,
they are very, very much

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.270
in our corner.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.390
JEREMY SALIBA: This guy's
telling me he doesn't like the

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:48.590
book, and I'm like, what?

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:50.855
You're dumb.

00:27:50.855 --> 00:27:51.762
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Oh, we're
getting ahead of ourselves a

00:27:51.762 --> 00:27:54.590
little bit.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:55.930
JEREMY SALIBA: The comic shop
experience has been

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:57.080
a really fun one.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.190
And it gives it, I don't know,
like this whole grassroots

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:05.570
element of it is a very
appealing part of the process.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:07.605
I mean, it's amazing what you
can do by sending off an email

00:28:07.605 --> 00:28:09.650
or picking up the phone.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:12.930
And I imagine this applies to
things outside of comics

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:13.720
greatly as well.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.660
BRIAN SCHIRMER: I also want to
jump in and say, again, with

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:19.680
regard to the local
comic shops, we've

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.720
never been turned way.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.340
Anybody that I've gone
to and said, oh hey,

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.890
we've got this book.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.850
They've said, great, we
want to carry it.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:28.830
Do you have any with
you right now?

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.020
And more than half of them
have said, oh, wonderful.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.550
Do you guys want to come
in and do a signing?

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:34.480
Sure, all right.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.880
Let's to do that.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.710
And we've been very fortunate
with, as I say, with everyone.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:41.980
JEREMY SALIBA: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.280
The industry is very supportive,
which is nice.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.790
I think local comic shops,
there's some competition with

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.580
the little comic shop with
digital comics and stuff now.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:51.490
So that's another thing that's
an incentive for them to say,

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:52.930
yeah, let's generate
some interest.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:58.480
With the last one we did in
Concord, we were there for

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.690
their first one, if I understand
correctly.

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:02.895
They're going to do these Friday
night pizza nights at

00:29:02.895 --> 00:29:07.260
their comic shop, where they
have pizza and have artists or

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:11.320
anyone involved in the industry
come by and show

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.850
their wares, talk about their
experiences, whatever.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.100
BRIAN SCHIRMER: In a very
casual, relaxed atmosphere of

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:17.990
a comic shop.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.360
They're not up there at a podium
or a big table saying,

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.450
hello, I make comics
and ba ba ba.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:23.940
It's very much, hey, let's
grab a slice of

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.435
pizza and chat geekery.

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:31.130
But one other element
that I was almost

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.070
skipping over entirely--

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:36.030
it was, again, we went from web
comic to we got the book

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:38.630
published or printed, and
we were selling it.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:40.340
We were doing signings in
stores and selling at

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.390
conventions.

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:45.470
Our next hurdle was getting
it out to broader

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.300
retailers, ie, Amazon.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:51.350
And again, as Jerry mentioned,
Things From Another World,

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:57.970
which is also known as TFAW, is
sort of a comics and toys

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:04.530
and whatnot retailer up and down
the West Coast of the US.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:06.200
But they also a web presence.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.580
And we were fortunate to get
both books approved to be

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:15.740
carried online, which I think
was just, again, another step

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.190
in the legitimacy, I guess,
of the project.

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:22.700
That most people will now see
it as, oh, well, they're not

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.680
just selling it for $10
and a handshake at

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.030
a convention table.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.080
I can be sitting on my computer
anywhere in the world

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.230
and look it up and, lo and
behold, there's the book.

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.110
I can sell, I can buy.

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:35.610
JEREMY SALIBA: It's
a nice thing.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:37.250
Your friends say, oh,
a friend of mine was

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:38.170
asking about your book.

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:39.260
Where is it?

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.200
Where can they get it online?

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.440
Just one word, Amazon.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.600
And you say, you can get it
there and everyone knows

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.220
exactly how to get there.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:45.560
Yeah?

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.208
AUDIENCE: When you guys gave it
to the local retailers do

00:30:47.208 --> 00:30:50.320
they buy it off you and then
sell it for more [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.050
JEREMY SALIBA: When we give it
to local retailers, do they

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:54.320
buy it off us and then
sell it for more or--

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.060
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Yes.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.050
Local retailers--

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:59.550
our experience has been, the
base standard, is they pay a

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:02.540
wholesale of 50%.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:06.190
A little marketing ploy that I
picked up from someone else is

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:09.310
when they say, we'd like
to buy some copies.

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:11.320
We pay 50% of your retail.

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.630
And I then turn around and
say, you know what?

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:15.988
Yes, but we're going
to sell them to you

00:31:15.988 --> 00:31:18.580
for 40% of the retail.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.810
So you're getting it even
cheaper than you're getting it

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:24.320
from other people, with the
nod and the incentive that

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.250
they are more encouraged to
sell and to promote these

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:29.260
books because they will then
themselves be making more

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:32.340
money on the back
end of the sale.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.730
And no one has turned
that down.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:36.070
JEREMY SALIBA: Yeah.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:38.480
No, no, we insist, 50%.

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.240
[? I wonder if that's ?]
happened yet.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.850
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Not yet.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:43.180
JEREMY SALIBA: But yeah,
I mean, it's been an

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:46.230
overwhelmingly positive
experience.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:50.230
It's a surprisingly large
amount of work.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:52.760
BRIAN SCHIRMER: It is
not for the weak.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.460
JEREMY SALIBA: Going back to the
students and everything, I

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.540
mean, they've all been extremely
enthusiastic and

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.400
supportive, but there's
some wrangling to do.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.840
As with any collaborative
project, someone's not holding

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:03.810
up their end of the bargain.

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.420
Someone's not quite on
time with something.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.280
And you've got to kind of--

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.230
that was one of my heavy tasks,
anyways, was to get

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:15.800
after those guys, getting
them available for

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:16.930
signings and for things.

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:18.610
Again, most of them were really
excited about it.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.880
Even some of the Kickstarter
rewards that we did involved

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.230
like the artist, like,
sketching.

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:29.580
Or, there was one Kickstarter
reward that we set up where

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:33.740
it's like a night out the
creators, where we said,

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:37.190
someone who backs us for
such amount of money,

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.770
we'll take you out.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:40.030
We'll take you out for comics
and go out to dinner and have

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.190
drinks or whatever.

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:43.630
And a few people bought that.

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:46.030
One of the artists that was
really just a standout

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:49.190
supporter and star of the book,
we took him out, too, to

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:50.992
celebrate and everything.

00:32:50.992 --> 00:32:51.420
BRIAN SCHIRMER: I'm sorry.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:56.560
Right, because the only
obligation that the artists

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.300
have, because they're students,
is to actually

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.980
attend the class and
turn in work.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:04.320
In truth, the semester's
only 15 weeks long.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:09.130
Once it's over, their official
obligation to it is done.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:13.140
We are hopeful, from day one,
that they are going to be

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:16.040
proud of the work that they do
and that they want it to

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.850
succeed and go farther and be
able to do these, be able to

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.430
do signings and get the books
into the hands of the public

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:23.460
and into the hands of industry
people and basically have this

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.640
calling card.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.800
Most of them are gung ho
and do want to do that.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.005
But occasionally, you
get someone who's

00:33:29.005 --> 00:33:30.190
like, OK, I did this.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:31.930
I did this, I did
some good work.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:34.230
I got my grade or I graduated,
and it's, like, so long and

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:37.800
good luck, which, that's fine.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.250
I'm happy that that's the
exception rather than the

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:42.090
rule, of course.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:43.725
JEREMY SALIBA: There's been a
couple of students who we

00:33:43.725 --> 00:33:45.180
haven't heard from since
the class ended,

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:45.980
but that's all right.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.230
BRIAN SCHIRMER: These
things happen.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:55.260
So after about a year-- it
was about a year from the

00:33:55.260 --> 00:34:00.720
conception of the class and
getting it approved to having

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.740
the book come out on Amazon.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:05.950
And as I mentioned earlier,
we had that first meeting.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.230
And we were saying, yeah, we're
going to have a website

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:10.320
and we're going to do a
Kickstarter and it's going to

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.110
go into print.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.040
And then we're going to have it
in stores, and then we're

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.790
going to have it on Amazon.

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:16.530
And it was around the time that
we actually got it on

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:20.120
Amazon that I realized we
did all of those things.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.889
I guess I would have been so
impressed if we had just had a

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:24.909
web comic and been able
to just point to that.

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:29.670
But the fact that we soldiered
on, and people were interested

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:33.590
and it's thrived--

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:34.824
it's wonderful.

00:34:34.824 --> 00:34:35.239
JEREMY SALIBA: Yeah.

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:39.199
I attribute a lot of
that push to Brian.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:41.359
As happy as he is to get to
where he got and as happy as

00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:44.219
he would have been to just
have the bare minimum.

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:46.780
We work together, and we
had many conversations.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:47.830
We said, we got to go.

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:48.210
We got to do this.

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:49.510
We got to push a little
harder, get it

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:50.530
out a little further.

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.500
And I think that mentality is
a lot of what makes it go

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.170
further, what makes it more
successful, what makes it

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.920
complete is that drive.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.210
It related to, obviously,
talking about the commitment

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:03.620
to your Kickstarter campaign, if
you do something like that.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.500
He had no other obligation to
sit in on the classes other

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.370
than he wanted to be there
for that input.

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:11.560
But he was always there and
providing input and

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.650
everything.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:15.450
He's just been a very strong
presence for all that.

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:18.690
And there's a lot of discussion
about the paradigm

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:21.740
shift these days with--

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:26.530
I think Patton Oswald had
a great manifesto on it.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:30.470
But in any industry, you don't
have to go to a big company

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:32.370
anymore to get your
work out there.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:35.050
No matter what area you're in,
you can get it out there.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.670
And I think it takes talent.

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:41.170
It takes skill and the drive.

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:45.960
It's cliche and it's a trite
thing to say, but it's

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.290
absolutely effective.

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:49.500
And just getting up and saying,
let's go a little

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:51.790
further, let's push a little
harder every day-- which is

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:55.900
definitely Brian's tactic
on all this--

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.550
is what will push it through.

00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:01.230
Emailing people that you never
thought would back you or who

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:04.440
would spread the word to their
friends or buy a comic.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.660
Emailing the stores, emailing
the online distributors,

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:10.680
talking to them, telling
them about your book.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.120
Just having no fear.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.970
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And firing those
arrows into the air and

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.670
just crossing your fingers.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:21.040
I teach a Writing for Comics
class at the Academy, and I'm

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:26.510
always stunned by the number
of students who have no

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.290
interest in Twitter
whatsoever.

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:29.830
And they don't know
what it's for.

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:31.080
They don't know what they
would use it for.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.440
And I said, dude, if I didn't
have Twitter, and if I didn't

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.000
use Twitter towards my
goals, we would've

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.150
accomplished nothing.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:45.190
For me, it was really a tool for
finding industry people,

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:47.320
befriending them either
in person at first

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.160
or maybe via Twitter.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.990
There are people that I've
certainly met on Twitter that

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:52.660
I've now met in real life that
I now consider friends.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:58.170
But also we got some big pushes
from people like Warren

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:03.840
Ellis and Kurt Busiek and others
who we, basically, we

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:05.560
would tell them about the web
comic, or we told them about

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.420
the Kickstarter.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.870
And they went, that's pretty
cool, and then they would

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:09.830
spread the word.

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:13.310
And yeah, that's invaluable
in this day and age.

00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:13.930
JEREMY SALIBA: That was
another thing that was

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:16.120
surprising to me is how much the
industry people themselves

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.850
totally embraced it.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.170
And I would imagine that's true,
again, for almost any

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:21.580
industry that you're
looking at.

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.890
If someone sees you and sees
you're trying to do good work

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:25.630
and trying to get it out
there, it's amazing how

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:28.110
supportive those industries
can be.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:30.960
And so, if you're ever trying
to do anything on your own,

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.730
anything in your own avenue,
look to that,

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:35.610
look to those people.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:36.080
I don't know.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.780
It was this fun level of
legitimacy to use a term that

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.370
we've been kind of throwing
around a little bit for the

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:42.750
last hour is--

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.210
we're playing in the
same sandbox

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:47.600
basically, and that's great.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.390
For me, it's the best feeling
is knowing that

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.570
we're in the same area.

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:55.760
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And now we did
all of this, and we pat

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:56.700
ourselves on the back.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.120
And then we're tasked with--

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.150
we got to do it all again.

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:04.700
And we did, and we
had the second

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.700
volume, the second semester--

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.860
oh, we lost--

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.950
MALE SPEAKER: I got it.

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:13.410
JEREMY SALIBA: It's one, two,
three, four, five, right?

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:15.246
MALE SPEAKER: Security's
very tight at Google.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:18.650
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Basically
yeah.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:22.010
So we did the class again
this past fall.

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:23.710
And then the website--

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:24.500
thank you--

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.230
started up again.

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:29.460
The web comic started up again,
which meant the next

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:30.990
step was going to be
going into print.

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:35.870
And so we, again, returned to
Kickstarter and kicked off a

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:37.900
second volume--

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.940
or a pitch for a second volume
just about two weeks ago.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:47.390
And first day we had
a phenomenal--

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:51.610
I'm speechless still--
response that

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:53.440
ultimately saw us get--

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.210
we were the number one
staff pick for comics

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:56.460
within about an hour.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.000
I'm not going to pretend to
know exactly how all the

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.050
shenanigans at Kickstarter work,
the people that work

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:06.950
there, but they do seem to
genuinely love what we do.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:09.110
When I submitted the project,
I actually got an email back

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:11.370
from them that seemed
to be personalized.

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:14.830
If it's a bot, it's
a very clever bot.

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.840
Young lady saying, welcome back,
and this looks really

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.120
cool, and we're excited for
you, blah, blah, blah.

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.445
And as I say, after about an
hour, we were number one staff

00:39:22.445 --> 00:39:23.490
pick for comics.

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:26.660
We were the number four staff
pick for all projects of any

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:28.280
kind in San Francisco.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.200
And then by after like
six hours, we were

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.170
on the front page.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:34.060
Oh, the front page, and we
were on San Francisco.

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.732
So we were on the front
page twice at the

00:39:35.732 --> 00:39:40.680
same time, which again--

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.360
JEREMY SALIBA: It was
an awesome embrace.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.890
You know, welcome back.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:45.250
The second volume--

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:46.610
to talk a little bit
about that--

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:50.070
we had, basically, let's get
some new students together.

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:51.900
We did have some returned
students, which was actually

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:55.850
just great because they already
know everything about

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:58.150
what we're trying to do and
what we're working for.

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:01.840
It was a little bit easier in
some respects, again, to do it

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.150
a second time because
we had the first

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:04.610
book to give the students.

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:05.410
This is what we did.

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:07.740
This is what it looked like.

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:13.460
Please read it and check it
out and hit the ground

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.350
running with us.

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:19.735
So having some new students was
really cool, though, to

00:40:19.735 --> 00:40:21.150
get a fresh perspective,
to get some new looks.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:24.510
Because one of the things
about the book that is a

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:25.970
challenge for me is that we
have all these different

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:28.550
artists, and I'm trying to
create, visually, a through

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:30.390
line through everything.

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:34.090
So for the first one, I
kept it fairly loose.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:36.050
The first couple weeks, we would
do character designs and

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:38.430
kind of agree, OK, this is what
the character looks like.

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:40.550
He has a scar right there,
two millimeters

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:41.670
down from his hairline.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:42.740
You know, it was kind of
getting some basic

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.010
landmarks in place.

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:46.500
The overall color palette of
each character, getting that

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:46.920
stuff in place.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.900
So those things would be a
through line, regardless of an

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:52.360
individual artist's style.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.890
And the second time through,
one of the things that we'd

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:59.300
heard about Volume
One was that--

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.030
some great people, gave us some
feedback and said, you

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:02.600
could get a little tighter,
I think, even with those

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.570
different styles.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:06.480
So that was a big goal for me
was to do that in Volume Two.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.270
We're really excited because
the first volume, it was a

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:10.070
bunch of guys.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:12.540
It was all gentleman
who joined us.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:15.260
But in Volume Two, we've had
some ladies come and be

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:18.060
artists, come on the book and
help us, three of them.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:26.310
I'm a married gentleman, and my
wife is an anti-- she's not

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:26.990
a geek at all.

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:28.300
She doesn't understand
anything--

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:31.370
the appeal to "Star Wars" or
dragons or zombies or any of

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:32.610
that stuff.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:36.780
And I typically will go to her
with feedback because I want

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.940
that ground zero kind
of feedback.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:41.700
And one thing she always points
out that's lacking in

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.290
my work initially is a woman's
perspective, a woman's touch,

00:41:44.290 --> 00:41:46.500
and why would I want to leave
out half of the world's

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.310
population when I'm trying to
make something that will

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:50.840
appeal, that will speak
out to people.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.000
So having some ladies involved,
to me, is a great

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.830
boon because then
we have that.

00:41:54.830 --> 00:42:00.050
We have both sides of Earth, of
the human race contributing

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:02.630
to this and giving their
points of view.

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:03.840
The other thing that's
been kind of fun--

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:05.440
Brian and I have been having
conversations about it-- is

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.130
that with some students, with
constraints on how many

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:12.020
classes they have and all
that kind of stuff, they

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:12.790
want to do it again.

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:14.270
But they don't know if they
can sign up for the class

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:15.290
again, if they have
room in their

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.330
curriculum to do it again.

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.350
And Brian and I were recently
having a conversation about --

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:22.380
is it going to be too difficult
to have a student

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.400
who's not enrolled in the class
be part of the book?

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.460
They're not going to be
part of that format.

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.660
We'll have to wrangle them
a little harder.

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.730
And Brian was almost bemoaning
the fact that he had so many

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:32.790
people lining up that would want
to work on the book, but

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:33.970
not take the class.

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:35.815
And that's when I pointed out to
him, so you're a writer who

00:42:35.815 --> 00:42:37.740
has a bunch of artists who want
to work for you and help

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:42.000
you make a book for free, and
you're upset about that--

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.020
and for no initial
upfront cost?

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.770
And you're saying that that's
a problem for you?

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:49.430
So I think that's another great
thing, that's another

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:50.760
[? ancillary ?] benefit
of this project.

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.800
And what we've done is we're
creating these connections,

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.860
these artists, all of which are
talented and some of which

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.960
phenomenally talented, and are
going to probably go on to be

00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.060
superstars.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.220
And of course, they'll
just have to

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.030
remember the little people.

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:06.000
But the networking that goes
on, the expansion of your

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.500
professional group, it
phenomenally explodes, and

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.120
it's a lot of fun.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.460
When we go to signings, and
we do this kind of stuff

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:17.570
together, it's a blast.

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:20.920
We might go out to a local
establishment, have a beverage

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.880
or two after the signings.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.040
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Public
house, public house.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.450
JEREMY SALIBA: Sure,
thank you.

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:27.780
And hang out with each other.

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:30.650
As much as we're talking about
the hard work element of

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:35.950
everything, it doesn't feel
like it most of the time.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:38.320
It is a lot of effort,
but I do that anyway.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.510
Look at that drawing,
it should be better.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:40.260
It should be this and that.

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.910
So when I'm doing it
in class, it's just

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:45.180
something I would do anyways.

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.290
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Speaking for
myself, yes, there's a lot of

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:49.750
work that goes into this.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:51.790
And frequently, I find myself
spinning a lot of plates

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:55.920
simultaneously, where doing the
website or maybe doing a

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:56.310
Kickstarter.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:58.040
And then we're doing the class,
and then I'm writing

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.130
the next volume.

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:03.550
And occasionally will find
myself a bit stressed out and

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:06.960
then realize, wait, all of these
things, yeah, they might

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:12.450
be time consuming, but I love
them all for their constituent

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:15.570
elements, and I'm
very fortunate.

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:16.800
I see a hand.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:17.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:18.900
Could we leave a little time
at the end for questions?

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:19.170
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Yes.

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:21.640
Actually we are wrapping up.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.100
That's our last little--

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.160
thank you, Google.

00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:25.720
I'm Brian.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:26.340
He's Jeremy.

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.850
And yeah, fire away with any--

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:31.420
this would be the Q&amp;A
portion of the show.

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:32.350
JEREMY SALIBA: Right.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:33.380
And really, any question.

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:34.500
Nothing's out of bounds.

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:34.870
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Yes, sir?

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:36.695
AUDIENCE: I was wondering, what
would you do differently

00:44:36.695 --> 00:44:39.120
if you redid the project?

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.960
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Ooh, what would
we do differently if we

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.340
redid the project?

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.590
You want to field that?

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.540
JEREMY SALIBA: There's been a
few aspects of the project.

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.270
Volume Two is almost, in
a sense, doing that.

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:58.490
So we've had that chance, in
a way, to kind of-- we're

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:00.770
locking down things and being
a little more stringent on

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:04.465
what the students contribute
to the book.

00:45:04.465 --> 00:45:07.900
Being more selective about
who's on the book.

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:11.230
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Again, at this
point, we've done it.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:14.920
We've done the entire pipeline
once, and the entire thing was

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:15.590
a learning experience.

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:17.070
I'd never run a Kickstarter.

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:21.420
I'd never submitted anything
to Amazon.

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.500
And meeting industry folks and
basically going up to them

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.520
cold and saying,
hey, I'm Brian.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.920
This is my book, blah.

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:33.780
Now that all of that is done,
there were bumps in all those

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:36.720
aspects along the way,
and now we've

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.750
corrected for that, I think.

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:43.110
But as far as changing anything
from the outset--

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:44.970
like would we have changed
any aspect of the story?

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:47.300
Would we have done the class

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.320
differently from the beginning?

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.416
I don't think so.

00:45:50.416 --> 00:45:51.130
JEREMY SALIBA: No.

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:52.100
It worked out.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:52.670
It was great.

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:53.150
It was a of fun.

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.980
It worked really well.

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:55.150
That's probably why we
went back for more.

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:57.310
BRIAN SCHIRMER: And I want to
say that I was very blessed

00:45:57.310 --> 00:46:00.280
with the fact that Jeremy agreed
to be a part of this

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.450
and to actually teach
the class.

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.610
I can talk about three point
perspective, and I can talk

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:16.240
about crossing the line, but
I can't-- the minutia of

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:19.310
artistic critiques
is way beyond me.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:20.470
JEREMY SALIBA: It was a lot of
fun because I get to tell

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:22.070
people how much I hate
their artwork and how

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:25.110
it should be better.

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:26.770
As long as you learn
a few terms--

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:29.030
well, you should select this
out and make sure that the

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:30.250
line of sight's good here--

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:32.010
you sound like you know what
you're talking about.

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:32.890
Yeah?

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:34.300
AUDIENCE: I was curious
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:40.285 --> 00:46:42.900
who did what and what kind of
feedback did you give people,

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.810
get this to change.

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:46.950
JEREMY SALIBA: Thank you.

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:49.360
What kind of process, what kind
of feedback did we do

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.730
through the progression
of everything?

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:53.400
This is one of our returning
artists, Mr. John Gomes.

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.000
And this is another situation
where we had the good fortune

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.720
to know his strengths and
weaknesses, if any.

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.960
And so we knew this was going
to be a big splash page.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:08.980
So initially, he hadn't done
anything like city street

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:10.620
scenes before this.

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:12.230
So I just pulled him aside and
said, hey, you better get the

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:13.900
perspective perfect on this.

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:14.850
It's got to be good.

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:16.220
You know, get reference.

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:17.400
I'm going to ride you like--

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.680
BRIAN SCHIRMER: I want to jump
in real quick and say when we

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.890
wrote this in the script, I not
only envisioned that it

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:26.990
was going to be in Paris, but
also, when I thought of it, I

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:30.500
pictured the cover of
"Freewheelin' Bob Dylan." And

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.570
I basically took an image--

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:34.640
which is another thing that I
actually do in the script is I

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.300
will find imagery and reference
online, throw it in

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:38.080
the script.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.680
So I had the album cover there,
and he riffed on that

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:41.140
beautifully.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.540
But please, continue.

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:44.840
JEREMY SALIBA: So let me see.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.280
Well, you can kind of see
some of the progression.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.350
Like, obviously, it's a loose
sketch in the beginning

00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:52.310
anyways, so it's
very malleable.

00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:53.900
We can talk about things.

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.660
And I thought the placement of
some of the cars could use a

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.290
little bit of massaging, the
one on the left especially.

00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:00.800
And I thought that
the buildings--

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.500
there wasn't enough of a
cavernous kind of a feel.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.600
I wanted it to be a little bit
taller, have a little bit more

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.130
of a corridor that
they were in.

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:07.930
So those were kind of
my instructions.

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:09.160
I also thought the street
looked-- because this was

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.960
supposed to be-- what was
the year that this

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.300
scene takes place in?

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.540
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Our alternate
1930, I believe.

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:14.910
JEREMY SALIBA: Right.

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:16.700
And the street looked a little
too modern paved in the

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.540
initial sketch, so I was like,
maybe even go with, like,

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:21.700
cobblestone or something
like that.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.890
At which point, he made
those corrections.

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:29.630
On this stage, there's some
subtle small things.

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:30.410
He was doing great.

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:32.460
This one is just a
great example.

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:36.476
But the folds in Frankenstein's
sleeves were

00:48:36.476 --> 00:48:37.830
just a little unnatural
in the beginning.

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:40.500
We had to kind of
get reference.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.110
It's one of those things where
we'll discuss it and say,

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:44.830
well, if you're not sure,
get reference.

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:46.830
And if you can't find the
reference, let me know because

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:50.940
I'll find you the reference, and
push forward from there.

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.476
From that point on, after we
refined the sketch and got to

00:48:53.476 --> 00:48:55.080
where we wanted it to
be, it was the inks.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:58.290
And I didn't have to do much
with him on the inks.

00:48:58.290 --> 00:48:59.860
He knows his inking well.

00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.940
And I liked what he handled with
the silhouettes and how

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.780
he hit at a higher-contrast
area right here with black

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:08.780
behind the characters that were
primarily bright to make

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:10.120
that a focal point.

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.490
And again, with the readjusting
of these diagonal

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:15.120
lines of perspective to lead
us right to where we wanted

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:19.070
the eye to go, it was just a
matter of letting him have his

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:21.550
fun with it and go crazy.

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:25.460
Then with the color image,
again, he did a great job.

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.520
We had the reference.

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.560
We kind of established a palette
for everything at this

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.460
point already.

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:34.780
I don't know if I ever had a
specific conversation about

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.510
the red dress with him,
the color of it.

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:38.960
But it's a great choice.

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:42.190
It complements the green nicely
and, again, reinforces

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:44.510
that focal point.

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:47.130
So that's kind of a typical walk
through of the kind of

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:48.940
things that we would talk
about to make it

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:50.230
as good as we can.

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:52.830
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Well, sure.

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:53.730
JEREMY SALIBA: Yes, sir?

00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:56.670
AUDIENCE: How do you figure out
who worked on which panels

00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:59.610
and do you ever have multiple
students working on the same

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:01.570
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:02.340
JEREMY SALIBA: Yes.

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.410
BRIAN SCHIRMER: How
did [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:05.260
Yeah.

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:07.195
How did we determine who worked
on which pages, and did

00:50:07.195 --> 00:50:13.470
we have people collaborating
on any specific pages?

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:17.220
Basically two questions,
we have two answers.

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.450
Like I said, this was a
portfolio-driven class.

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:21.470
We had to see what the students
were capable of

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:23.890
before we admitted them
to the class.

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:25.040
So we were able look at that.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.220
And then, usually, in the first
week or two, they are

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:31.200
doing concept designs for,
perhaps, new elements.

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.690
And Jeremy and I will,
basically, we will have read

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:34.100
the script.

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:39.340
We will sit down, knowing each
person's strengths, and we'll

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:41.920
say, well, this person might be
best suited for these pages

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:45.420
or this character and so on.

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:48.390
And I don't think we've ever
had anyone complain.

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.920
JEREMY SALIBA: Right.

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.110
BRIAN SCHIRMER: We do
occasionally get requests

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:53.000
saying, oh, I definitely
want to do Dracula.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.580
And where we can accommodate,
we do.

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:56.160
JEREMY SALIBA: Right, right.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:57.460
We want them to have fun.

00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:58.560
And then in collaboration--

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:02.050
the main collaboration I can
think of in Volume One, two of

00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:03.270
our students worked
on the same page.

00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:05.140
One of them penciled it, and one
of them inked it, which is

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.930
a common way to work in the
comics field anyways.

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:07.940
And they did a great job.

00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:08.720
It was the kiss.

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:12.480
BRIAN SCHIRMER: But more often
than not, again, because it's

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.690
a class and students need to be
learning all the different

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:18.690
aspects, you've got a student
doing everything.

00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:20.710
Like in this case, John did
the original pencils.

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:21.850
He did the final pencils.

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:24.870
He did the inks, and
he did the colors.

00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:25.910
JEREMY SALIBA: The other thing
that Brian does, he caters

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:28.090
specifically to the needs of
the students in the class.

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:30.570
In Book Two, he made sure
to have everyone have a

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:32.120
consistent chunk and a run.

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:34.190
So when they have their
portfolio to present to

00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:36.586
someone, they've got a nice,
clean run of the story so they

00:51:36.586 --> 00:51:37.230
can show it to someone.

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:38.700
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Right.

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:44.300
We have learned from contacts
in the industry that when

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:47.670
recruiters are looking at work
that students, or anyone, has

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:51.520
done, who is basically looking
for a job as a sequential

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:54.110
artist, they want to see pages
of sequential storytelling.

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:58.290
They don't want cover design,
cover design, cover design or

00:51:58.290 --> 00:51:59.630
just random pages
here and there.

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:01.000
They want to see that
you can tell a good

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.490
story straight through.

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:04.180
JEREMY SALIBA: Right.

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.026
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Sir?

00:52:05.026 --> 00:52:07.010
AUDIENCE: So the Kickstarter
portion.

00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:10.978
There was a lot of stuff that
seemed time consuming to you

00:52:10.978 --> 00:52:12.962
guys-- the Kickstarter
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:12.962 --> 00:52:13.458
Amazon.

00:52:13.458 --> 00:52:15.442
So I assume that will get
easier this time.

00:52:15.442 --> 00:52:16.434
Maybe not.

00:52:16.434 --> 00:52:20.402
But you envision a future
with that, where that

00:52:20.402 --> 00:52:22.386
part isn't as necessary?

00:52:22.386 --> 00:52:23.636
Or [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.870
self-reinforcing?

00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:30.290
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Do we envision
a future where we don't need

00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:30.630
Kickstarter?

00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:34.180
Would that be a good
way [INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:37.850
Short answer, at
this stage, no.

00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:42.830
Only because, as Jeremy said,
it's more than a passion

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:45.660
project, but it is not
uber lucrative.

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:46.100
Let's put it that way.

00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:47.310
The money that does
come through

00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:48.925
does pay for the printing.

00:52:48.925 --> 00:52:50.900
It does pay for the shipping.

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:54.490
It does pay for some of the
rewards or the perks

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:56.290
and what have you.

00:52:56.290 --> 00:53:00.250
But we're not sitting on a big
bag with a dollar sign on it

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:03.982
that then allows us
to go forward.

00:53:03.982 --> 00:53:05.000
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
time.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.212
BRIAN SCHIRMER: OK.

00:53:06.212 --> 00:53:06.590
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:06.910
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Thank you.

00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:07.670
Thank you very much.

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.870
JEREMY SALIBA: Yeah,
thanks everyonne.

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:08.670
BRIAN SCHIRMER: Thank
you, Google.

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:09.920
Yay.
