00:00:06.776 --> 00:00:08.337
How did Adolf Hitler,

00:00:08.337 --> 00:00:12.747
a tyrant who orchestrated one of the
largest genocides in human history,

00:00:12.747 --> 00:00:16.506
rise to power in a democratic country?

00:00:16.506 --> 00:00:19.738
The story begins at the end
of World War I.

00:00:19.738 --> 00:00:22.798
With the successful 
Allied advance in 1918,

00:00:22.798 --> 00:00:26.256
Germany realized the war was unwinnable

00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:29.566
and signed an armistice 
ending the fighting.

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.698
As its imperial government collapsed,

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:36.006
civil unrest and worker strikes
spread across the nation.

00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:37.896
Fearing a Communist revolution,

00:00:37.896 --> 00:00:41.557
major parties joined 
to suppress the uprisings,

00:00:41.557 --> 00:00:45.348
establishing the parliamentary
Weimar Republic.

00:00:45.348 --> 00:00:47.477
One of the new government's first tasks

00:00:47.477 --> 00:00:51.617
was implementing the peace treaty
imposed by the Allies.

00:00:51.617 --> 00:00:56.298
In addition to losing over a tenth
of its territory and dismantling its army,

00:00:56.298 --> 00:01:02.258
Germany had to accept full responsibility
for the war and pay reparations,

00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:06.017
debilitating its already weakened economy.

00:01:06.017 --> 00:01:10.928
All this was seen as a humiliation
by many nationalists and veterans.

00:01:10.928 --> 00:01:13.719
They wrongly believed the war 
could have been won

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:19.407
if the army hadn't been betrayed
by politicians and protesters.

00:01:19.407 --> 00:01:22.470
For Hitler, these views became obsession,

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.370
and his bigotry and paranoid delusions
led him to pin the blame on Jews.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.500
His words found resonance in a society
with many anti-Semitic people.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.310
By this time, hundreds 
of thousands of Jews

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.947
had integrated into German society,

00:01:37.947 --> 00:01:42.620
but many Germans continued to perceive
them as outsiders.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.582
After World War I, Jewish success led
to ungrounded accusations

00:01:47.582 --> 00:01:51.029
of subversion and war profiteering.

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:54.399
It can not be stressed enough that these
conspiracy theories

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.191
were born out of fear,

00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:57.099
anger,

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:58.351
and bigotry,

00:01:58.351 --> 00:01:59.960
not fact.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.527
Nonetheless, Hitler found 
success with them.

00:02:02.527 --> 00:02:05.970
When he joined a small nationalist
political party,

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.839
his manipulative public speaking
launched him into its leadership

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:12.880
and drew increasingly larger crowds.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.149
Combining anti-Semitism with 
populist resentment,

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:19.749
the Nazis denounced both Communism
and Capitalism

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:24.820
as international Jewish conspiracies
to destroy Germany.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.851
The Nazi party was not initially popular.

00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:31.340
After they made an unsuccessful attempt
at overthrowing the government,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.160
the party was banned,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.680
and Hitler jailed for treason.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.931
But upon his release about a year later,

00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:41.201
he immediately began to rebuild
the movement.

00:02:41.201 --> 00:02:45.380
And then, in 1929, 
the Great Depression happened.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.061
It led to American banks withdrawing
their loans from Germany,

00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:54.010
and the already struggling German economy
collapsed overnight.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.442
Hitler took advantage 
of the people's anger,

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:58.343
offering them convenient scapegoats

00:02:58.343 --> 00:03:02.221
and a promise to restore Germany's
former greatness.

00:03:02.221 --> 00:03:06.042
Mainstream parties proved
unable to handle the crisis

00:03:06.042 --> 00:03:11.131
while left-wing opposition was too
fragmented by internal squabbles.

00:03:11.131 --> 00:03:15.431
And so some of the frustrated public
flocked to the Nazis,

00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:22.652
increasing their parliamentary votes from
under 3% to over 18% in just two years.

00:03:22.652 --> 00:03:25.485
In 1932, Hitler ran for president,

00:03:25.485 --> 00:03:30.273
losing the election to decorated war hero
General von Hindenburg.

00:03:30.273 --> 00:03:35.855
But with 36% of the vote, Hitler had
demonstrated the extent of his support.

00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:38.856
The following year, advisors 
and business leaders

00:03:38.856 --> 00:03:42.882
convinced Hindenburg to appoint Hitler
as Chancellor,

00:03:42.882 --> 00:03:46.783
hoping to channel his popularity
for their own goals.

00:03:46.783 --> 00:03:50.132
Though the Chancellor was only
the administrative head of parliament,

00:03:50.132 --> 00:03:54.082
Hitler steadily expanded the power
of his position.

00:03:54.082 --> 00:03:56.932
While his supporters formed 
paramilitary groups

00:03:56.932 --> 00:03:59.323
and fought protestors in streets.

00:03:59.323 --> 00:04:02.943
Hitler raised fears 
of a Communist uprising

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:06.873
and argued that only he could restore
law and order.

00:04:06.873 --> 00:04:08.824
Then in 1933,

00:04:08.824 --> 00:04:13.843
a young worker was convicted of
setting fire to the parliament building.

00:04:13.843 --> 00:04:16.663
Hitler used the event to convince
the government

00:04:16.663 --> 00:04:19.383
to grant him emergency powers.

00:04:19.383 --> 00:04:23.384
Within a matter of months,
freedom of the press was abolished,

00:04:23.384 --> 00:04:25.245
other parties were disbanded,

00:04:25.245 --> 00:04:28.775
and anti-Jewish laws were passed.

00:04:28.775 --> 00:04:33.424
Many of Hitler's early radical supporters
were arrested and executed,

00:04:33.424 --> 00:04:35.483
along with potential rivals,

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:38.975
and when President Hindenburg died
in August 1934,

00:04:38.975 --> 00:04:42.304
it was clear there would be 
no new election.

00:04:42.304 --> 00:04:47.564
Disturbingly, many of Hitler's early 
measures didn't require mass repression.

00:04:47.564 --> 00:04:50.613
His speeches exploited 
people's fear and ire

00:04:50.613 --> 00:04:54.574
to drive their support behind him
and the Nazi party.

00:04:54.574 --> 00:04:57.104
Meanwhile, businessmen and intellectuals,

00:04:57.104 --> 00:04:59.745
wanting to be on the right side 
of public opinion,

00:04:59.745 --> 00:05:01.394
endorsed Hitler.

00:05:01.394 --> 00:05:03.244
They assured themselves and each other

00:05:03.244 --> 00:05:06.294
that his more extreme rhetoric 
was only for show.

00:05:06.294 --> 00:05:09.976
Decades later, Hitler's rise remains 
a warning

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:15.096
of how fragile democratic institutions
can be in the face of angry crowds

00:05:15.096 --> 00:05:19.167
and a leader willing to feed their anger
and exploit their fears.
