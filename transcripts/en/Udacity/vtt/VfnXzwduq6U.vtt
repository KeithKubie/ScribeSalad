00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.570
We challenged ourselves to create an online

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.689
class that would be equal or better in

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:10.460
quality to our Stanford class, but to bring it to anyone in the world for free.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.850
&gt;&gt; We sent out out one email. We are

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.420
offering our class to the world free of charge.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.700
&gt;&gt; And within two weeks 50,000 people had signed

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.660
up for it. And that grew to 160,000 students from

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.360
209 countries.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.550
&gt;&gt; The [INAUDIBLE] is quite amazing. We decided to, to flip the entire

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.000
way we teach, rather than lecturing students, we decided to quiz students.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.240
&gt;&gt; A student said this class felt like

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.710
sitting in a bar with a really smart friend

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.640
whose explaining something you haven't grasped, but are about

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.920
to. And, that's exactly what we were aiming for.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.530
&gt;&gt; We're now offering the Historic AI-class

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.650
again on the Udacity platform.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.443
&gt;&gt; So, come join us. It's the old technology, still paper and

00:00:58.443 --> 00:01:03.953
pencils, but you can take this class for free at your own pace at udacity.com.

00:01:03.953 --> 00:01:09.962
