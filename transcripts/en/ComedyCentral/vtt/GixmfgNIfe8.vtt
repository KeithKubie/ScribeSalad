00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:04.837
-(applause &amp; cheering continue)
-Yes.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.506
Thank you very much!

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:09.008
Thank you!

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:10.843
Thank you very much!

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:12.578
-Thank you.
-AUDIENCE: Larry! Larry!

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:14.280
-Thank you very much!
-Larry! Larry! Larry!

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:16.416
-Thank you. I appreciate it.
-(chanting continues)

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.618
Thank you.
Welcome to<i> The Nightly Show.</i>

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.620
-Larry! Larry! Larry! Larry!
Larry! -Thank you very much.

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:22.688
-Please. You're too kind. -MAN:
We love you, Larry! -(cheering)

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:25.291
-I love you, too! I love you,
too. -MAN: We love you, Larry.

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:27.026
I love all you guys!

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:29.062
(laughter)

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:31.230
I am Larry Wilmore.

00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:33.399
Um, so, how was your day?

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:35.468
(laughter)

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:37.236
Um...

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.639
Mine? Yours was okay?

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.774
Well, as many of you
probably heard,

00:00:41.807 --> 00:00:45.144
this is our final week
of<i> The Nightly Show.</i> Um...

00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:47.547
-(booing)
-I know. Yeah.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.818
Four shows left, and I just want
to thank Comedy Central

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:53.753
first of all,
for this rare opportunity,

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:57.256
and it really is
a rare opportunity...

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.459
-doing this thing.
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:00.993
Thank you so much.

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:02.995
And also,
the staff of this show--

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:04.931
we have an amazing staff,
you guys--

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.933
for giving it their all
this past 20 months.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:10.103
Um, I want to thank, um...
um, all of them here.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:13.172
And especially,
I want to thank all of our fans.

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:16.943
Let me just say, you guys
have been unbelievable.

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:19.946
We have the best fans in late
night, I'm saying it right now.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.615
-Okay? Right now.
-(cheers and applause)

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:24.551
It's the passion.

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:27.687
It's the passion.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.523
Um, it really is true.

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:33.693
People come up, and they never
say, "Hey, nice show."

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:35.528
They always say, "Thank you!"

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:37.130
You know,
it's such a cool thing.

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:39.365
And hearing from you guys
has really been incredible.

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:42.268
Even you, @wilmore_blows666.

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:46.539
(laughter)

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:49.942
I mean, you brought such
a unique voice to the dialogue.

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:51.677
-I appreciate that. Uh...
-(laughter)

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.680
Now, when we started the show,
we wanted to have a conversation

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:56.382
on some very tough subjects,

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:58.518
and we've had a lot of fun
doing just that.

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.653
I mean, really,
our show was at its best

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:02.655
when the news was at its worst.

00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:04.690
And, uh, I'm just so proud

00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:06.626
that we were able
to take on real issues,

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.461
and, I don't know, hopefully,
say something powerful

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:12.398
while making people laugh and
on some very, very dark days.

00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:14.834
Um, my only regret is
that we won't be around

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:18.504
to cover this truly insane
election season.

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:21.140
Although, on the plus side,
on the plus side, I must say,

00:02:21.173 --> 00:02:24.310
our show going off the air
has to only mean one thing--

00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:26.512
racism is solved.

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:28.581
-(laughter)
-We did it.

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:30.550
-(applause and cheering)
-We did it.

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:33.753
In fact, in fact, in fact,
I think we have a photo

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:35.888
from Ferguson
that was taken earlier today.

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:40.860
(laughter)

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:43.729
Yeah! You're welcome, America.

00:02:43.762 --> 00:02:45.665
You're welcome.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:48.701
But black and white aren't the
only issues out there right now.

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:50.670
Orange seems to be the biggest
problem facing America.

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:52.171
WOMAN:
Yes! Yes!

00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:54.540
So let's check in and see what's
happening with the Unblackening.

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:55.775
♪ ♪

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:57.376
(screeching)

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.779
(yelling)

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:01.414
(screeching and yelling)

00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:04.750
(screeching)

00:03:04.783 --> 00:03:08.387
That thing's gonna haunt me
for a long time.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.456
-(laughter)
-It is.

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.892
Okay, now, last week,
I made a few jokes

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:15.962
at the expense of Trump's
spokes-goblin Katrina Pierson.

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:17.597
(laughter)

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.700
Um, I don't want
to give the impression

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:23.569
I was picking on her just
because she's working for Trump.

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:24.804
I would never do that.

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:27.139
-Goblin lives matter, you guys.
-(laughter)

00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:29.375
Okay? They matter.

00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:30.943
Ugh!

00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:32.912
But then she has to go
and say this.

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:35.715
Remember, we weren't even
in Afghanistan by this time.

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:37.483
Barack Obama went
into Afghanistan,

00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:38.618
creating another problem.

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:41.053
-No, no, no, no!
-(laughter)

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:43.656
No, Obama did not go
into Afghanistan!

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.791
Now you're just being stupid
for stupid's sake!

00:03:45.824 --> 00:03:47.627
-WOMAN: Yeah, there you go!
-Okay?

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.229
But I don't understand.
What is wrong with you people?

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:52.298
Perhaps you're not familiar
with all the disasters

00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:53.799
from the Bush Administration.

00:03:53.832 --> 00:03:55.801
There was a terrorist attack.
We got into two wars.

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:58.604
Vice president shot his friend,
for Christ's sakes.

00:03:58.637 --> 00:04:00.740
There was a horrible hurricane,
which, thanks to you,

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:03.676
is no longer the first thing
that comes up when you Google

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.012
the words "Katrina"
and "Total (bleeping) show."

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:07.913
(laughter)

00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:09.649
-Okay.
-(applause)

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:11.250
-But...
-(whooping)

00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:13.853
but... but--

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:16.122
sorry--
maybe you were going fast

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:18.124
and you didn't mean to say that.

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:20.293
Let me give you
the benefit of the doubt.

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:21.861 line:0%
That was Obama's war, yes.

00:04:21.894 --> 00:04:24.096
Mmm...

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:27.800
But look at the confident way
she spews that bull (bleep).

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:30.303
"It was Obama's war, yes."

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:32.872
(laughter)

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:35.308
Now, earlier today she admitted
she got this wrong,

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.677
after the entire world told her
she was wrong.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.845
But here's what
really gets me, guys.

00:04:39.878 --> 00:04:41.681
She's the spokesperson for a man

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:43.616
seeking the highest office
in the land.

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:47.520
All she had to do was be alive
for the last 16 years...

00:04:47.553 --> 00:04:49.555
right, to have known
she was wrong.

00:04:49.588 --> 00:04:51.190
And keep in mind, as a goblin,

00:04:51.223 --> 00:04:53.326
she may have been alive
for centuries.

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:54.694
(laughter)

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:56.562
All right? I'm just saying.

00:04:56.595 --> 00:05:00.399
-(applause, whooping)
-This is possible.

00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:02.968
Also, here's the other thing.
And these Trump surrogates

00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:05.838
not only spew these lies,
like, with confidence,

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:08.507
sometimes the bull (bleep)
coming out of their mouths

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.176
surprises even them.

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:12.878 line:0%
So to be clear, Mr. Trump
has no financial relationships

00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:15.147 line:0%
with any Russian oligarchs?

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.817 line:0%
If that's what he said,
I... that's what I said...

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.653 line:0%
that's obviously what the...
our position is.

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:23.155
-(laughter)
-Oh, my God.

00:05:23.188 --> 00:05:24.857
Oh, my God.

00:05:26.925 --> 00:05:29.729
The bull (bleep) is coming
out of his mouth so fast,

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:32.164
you almost want
to hold his head back, right?

00:05:32.197 --> 00:05:33.833
-(laughter)
-(coughs)

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:36.168
Go ahead, man, get it out.
Take your time.

00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:38.437
(choking)

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.840
(groans) But someone
who doesn't seem to mind

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:43.776
the taste of bull (bleep)
in their mouth is the...

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:46.946
is the bovine dung
connoisseur himself.

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.280 line:0%
President Obama.

00:05:48.313 --> 00:05:50.950 line:0%
He is the founder of ISIS.

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:53.252 line:0%
He's the founder of ISIS. Okay?

00:05:53.285 --> 00:05:56.088 line:0%
-(cheering)
-He's the founder.

00:05:56.121 --> 00:05:59.392 line:0%
He founded ISIS.

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:02.628 line:0%
And... I would say the cofounder

00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:06.031 line:0%
would be
crooked Hillary Clinton.

00:06:06.064 --> 00:06:08.033
Mm, mm, mm.

00:06:08.066 --> 00:06:10.736
Please make up
your own joke there.

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:12.438
(laughter)

00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:14.874
But Trump soon followed
that bat (bleep) crazy statement

00:06:14.907 --> 00:06:16.809
by doing something
very presidential--

00:06:16.842 --> 00:06:19.245
sending
a bat (bleep) crazy tweet.

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:20.446
All right?

00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:29.422
(audience gasps, groans)

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:30.790
(laughter)

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:32.625
Well, but that's not sarcasm.

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:35.561
Sarcasm is when you tell
your friend with the ugly shirt,

00:06:35.594 --> 00:06:36.962
"Hey, nice shirt."

00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:38.330
(laughter)

00:06:38.363 --> 00:06:40.633
Not sure why you would do that
to your friend

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:43.002
who's just trying
to get back on the dating scene

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:45.471
after his divorce, but...

00:06:45.504 --> 00:06:48.574
Regardless,
sarcasm is a pretty lame excuse.

00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:51.677
But at least Trump kind of
admitted he was wrong, right?

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.447
Obviously, I'm being sarcastic.
Then... then...

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.149
But not that sarcastic,
to be honest with you.

00:06:57.182 --> 00:06:59.118
(laughter)

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.090
"To be honest"?
You're never honest with us!

00:07:05.123 --> 00:07:07.359
The end of your sentence
stated the complete opposite

00:07:07.392 --> 00:07:09.428
of the beginning
of your sentence.

00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:11.430
Do you have any idea
how confused

00:07:11.463 --> 00:07:13.466
the middle of your sentence is?

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:14.800
(laughter)

00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:15.868
(groans)

00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:18.304
I got to Keep It 100
about this election.

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:20.506
Donald Trump
has stopped being funny,

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:22.308
he's stopped being outrageous,

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:24.210
he's stopped being
politically incorrect--

00:07:24.243 --> 00:07:26.378
he's just downright dangerous.

00:07:26.411 --> 00:07:27.880
AUDIENCE MEMBERS:
Yeah! Yeah!

00:07:27.913 --> 00:07:30.015
(whooping, applause)

00:07:30.048 --> 00:07:31.951
Let me tell you.

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:34.386
And the worst...

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:37.857
and the worst of it is,
he's just a liar, okay?

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.625
And I don't want to hear...

00:07:39.658 --> 00:07:41.961
(mocking):
"Hillary Clinton's a liar, too."

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:43.963
Okay? That is
a false equivalency.

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:45.364
Let me tell you something.

00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:48.200
Hillary Clinton is a very smart
and capable politician

00:07:48.233 --> 00:07:52.071
who many people don't trust
because she spends too much time

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:54.139
lawyering her words
so she doesn't lose votes,

00:07:54.172 --> 00:07:56.709
instead of telling us what
she actually (bleep) thinks.

00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:57.977
All right?

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.481
Donald Trump is a
psychopathic narcissist who...

00:08:02.514 --> 00:08:04.083
-(cheers and applause)
-MAN: Go, Larry.

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:08.988
...not only has the hands of an
infant, he has the mind of one.

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.389
Okay?

00:08:10.422 --> 00:08:12.358
(cheers and applause)

00:08:14.092 --> 00:08:15.094
I'm just saying.

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:16.228
I'm just
saying.

00:08:16.261 --> 00:08:18.697
And I apologize to all infants.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:19.765
(laughter)

00:08:19.798 --> 00:08:20.900
Okay?

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:24.003
So, stop comparing the two.

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:28.007
Donald Trump is an existential
threat to America.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.277
And if you love America,
like me,

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.379
you have to hope
that Hillary Clinton wins

00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:37.249
every single electoral vote
this November.

00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:39.685
-(applause, cheering)
-Let me just say.

00:08:39.718 --> 00:08:41.120
Let me make this clear.

00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:42.755
(applause)

00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:45.558
It's not so much that
"I'm with her."

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:48.060
It's that I'm with her.

00:08:48.093 --> 00:08:49.428
We'll be right back.

00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:51.397
(cheers and applause)
