00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.420
All right.

00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.295
Thank you, gentlemen.

00:00:01.295 --> 00:00:05.050
And our final speaker of the
conference is Tommy Hilfiger.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.470
And let me just tell you
a little bit about Tommy.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.540
I've known him for a long time.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.490
Our daughters-- my
daughter, Jessica, is here,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.890
and his daughter Allie
went to school together.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.870
So we go back on
a personal level,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.440
as well as on a business level.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.260
I showed you, yesterday,
in my presentation,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.850
the QR codes that we're doing.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.875
And I used Tommy as
an example of that.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:27.750
So you've got to know
a little bit about him,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.030
because he talks
about himself and how

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.750
he got started in the
business better than I can do.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.120
But he grew up in
Elmira, New York.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.260
And as he said in
the video, actually

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.230
was going into
Manhattan, buying jeans,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.271
and sometimes just dressing
them, and sometimes doing

00:00:46.271 --> 00:00:46.770
otherwise.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.580
But reselling those jeans to
his friends back in high school.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.830
And that ultimately
turned into a store

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.820
that ultimately turned into
a career for Tommy that's

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.060
been quite extraordinary.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.440
And he's done an
extraordinary job, I think,

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.630
of continuously
reinventing his brand,

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.700
but staying true to this
classic American man and woman

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.910
who he caters to, and a
children's line as well.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.750
And his brand is sold, now
exclusively, in Macy's stores

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.850
and in Tommy Hilfiger
stores, and is

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.620
one of the single
best-performing brands

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.520
we have in the entire company.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.040
It's a combination
of many things,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.400
but it's really Tommy's
leadership and Tommy's vision

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.220
for who this customer is and
what these customers want

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.090
to buy from him.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.520
So please welcome our closing
speaker, Tommy Hilfiger.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.412
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.390
Thank you very much, Terry.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.040
Thank you very much.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.280
I'm proud and honored
to be here today.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.320
I was here a few years ago.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.660
But I didn't have
a crowd like this.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.690
So I'm very happy
and excited to talk

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.460
about my 25 years in business.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.390
We just celebrated
our 25th anniversary.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.889
And I have a video to show you.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.130
And after the video, I'll be
glad to talk about my career

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.000
and answer any questions.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.500
Thank you.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.570
So as Terry said,
I was brought up

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.510
in Elmira, New York,
a very small town

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.580
in the middle of New York State.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.490
And my dream was to
be a football player.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.000
But while I was 17 years
old, my coach pulled me along

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.110
on the sidelines and said, look,
I don't think you should play.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.070
And I said, what do you mean?

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.430
And he said, look,
you know, the linemen

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.630
average about 200
pounds each, and you

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.940
weigh about 100, 110 pounds.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.130
I don't think it's a good idea.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.110
So I decided to step back
and do something else.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.320
So I got a job in a
sporting goods store.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.450
And as I was working in
this sporting goods store,

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.280
I was learning about retail.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.380
And at that point
in time, my dream

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.450
was to have my own retail store.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.110
But I wanted to sell cool
clothes in my retail store.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.040
So I took my $150 I'd
saved from working

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.610
part time in the
sporting shop, and a gas

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.310
station in the nighttime,
in the evenings,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.270
and I drove my Volkswagen
Bug to New York City.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.190
I bought 20 pairs
of bell-bottom jeans

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.170
from the streets
of New York City,

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.420
put them in the
backseat of my car,

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.310
drove them to the
school parking lot,

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.650
and started selling
bell-bottoms to my friends

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.800
and my classmates, who had
never seen bell-bottoms before.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.640
So that really triggered
my initial interest

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.620
in opening a jeans shop.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.420
And I opened a jeans
shop when I was

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.610
18 called People's Place in
downtown Elmira, in a basement.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.750
I painted it black.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.730
I played rock and roll music.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.740
And all of my
friends from school,

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.050
at 3 o'clock in the
afternoon, when the bell rang,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.710
would march to People's Place
and buy clothes from me.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.380
Within a year, I
started expanding,

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.230
and I opened another store
on the Cornell campus.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.390
And what I learned
at that point in time

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.330
was that my reach was not
just in Elmira, New York,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.800
but it was beyond.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.940
So I always had a dream of
expanding beyond my roots

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.780
and expanding beyond just my
hometown of Elmira, New York.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.370
And while I was expanding into
other college towns in New York

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.640
State, I realized there was
an international customer

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.710
and a fashion
customer who really

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.180
liked what I was selling.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.810
But I was really never
satisfied buying merchandise

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.820
from manufacturers,
because I always

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.060
thought I could do better at
designing the clothes if I

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.530
could do it myself.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.480
So one day, I took
a pad and a pen,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.510
and I started sketching
clothes I would want to wear

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.690
and clothes I wanted
my customers to wear.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.780
So my relatives and friends
told me I was crazy.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.480
There was no way I could
ever become a designer

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.060
or manufacture
clothes, because you

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.460
needed to know how
to cut patterns,

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.050
and you needed a lot of
money and connections.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.520
And you really wouldn't
be able to do that.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.290
But I hired local seamstresses
to sew jeans for me.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.480
And when they would
sew the genes,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.900
I took them to the
local laundromat,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.320
and I put sticks and stones and
bricks and Clorox and all sorts

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.080
of treatments into
the washing machines

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.410
and bleached them, distressed
them, made them stone-washed,

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.770
made them look used
and old, but very cool.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.950
So although the local laundromat
wouldn't allow me to come back

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.190
in after a few
visits, I thought it

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.760
was incredible to invent
something different and new

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.470
for the consumer.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.390
So I kept designing.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.930
And I kept putting
these ideas on paper.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.450
And during this
time, my parents were

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.950
begging me to go to college.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.200
I was fighting with
them like crazy.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.840
And I really just
wanted to be on my own,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.610
in business on my own.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.160
And one day, my
accountant came to me

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.172
and basically told
me I was bankrupt.

00:06:05.172 --> 00:06:06.630
And I said, well,
what do you mean?

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.882
Can't we just take a bank
loan to pay off the debt?

00:06:09.882 --> 00:06:11.340
He said, no, no,
no, you've already

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.140
borrowed money from this bank.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.430
And you either have to
close or file Chapter 11.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.770
I didn't even know
what Chapter 11 was.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.050
So that was really
my college education.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.320
It was cold water,
a slap in the face.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.080
And it taught me that
I actually should

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.410
have gone to school
to learn economics

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.220
and to learn all I could learn
about business before going

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.090
into business.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.100
But I put the cart
before the horse.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.160
So I had to take a step
backwards to go forward.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.060
I did end up teaching myself
how to read a balance sheet,

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.940
and how to understand
the aspects of business,

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.300
and what the business end of
the business was all about.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.440
And I started to actually
formulate a small company.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.230
I formulated a company
called Tommy Hill.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.010
And I manufactured clothes
locally and sold them

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.340
to Macy's, Bloomingdale's,
the Gap-- at the time,

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.200
they bought many
different brands.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.770
And I actually went into
business on my own in 1984.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.290
After some starts and
stops, because I found out

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.330
the Tommy Hill name
was registered,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.320
I was fortunate
enough to meet a man

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.200
by the name of Mohan
Murjani, who, at the time,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.720
owned Gloria Vanderbilt jeans.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.080
He asked if I would
come to work for him

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.622
and develop a Tommy
Hilfiger brand.

00:07:31.622 --> 00:07:33.580
And I said, well, you
know, I'd really love to,

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.660
but I just took a job
with Calvin Klein.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.640
Calvin Klein had offered me a
job to design their jeanswear.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.080
And I thought I was
floating in heaven.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.120
I couldn't believe
I was actually

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.770
asked by Calvin Klein
himself to design his line.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.750
And I had accepted the job.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.660
So this was a Thursday-- I
promised the Calvin Klein

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.490
people I would be
on a plane going

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.990
to the Orient on the following
Monday-- when Mr. Murjani said,

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.270
go into competition
with Calvin Klein.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.410
I will back you.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:06.640
I have factories.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.780
I'll support you.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.932
And we'll develop
Tommy Hilfiger.

00:08:09.932 --> 00:08:11.890
And I said, but you know,
Tommy Hilfiger people

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.690
can't even pronounce the name.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.300
And he said, do you think
people can pronounce Yves Saint

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.750
Laurent?

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.345
And I said, well,
you've got a point.

00:08:19.345 --> 00:08:21.880
And he said, look, why
don't you call Calvin,

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.780
tell him that you've
accepted another position.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.810
So with a little bit of
coaxing, a lot of excitement,

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.480
I ended up calling Calvin
Klein and telling Calvin

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.789
that I was going into
competition with him.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:36.610
And this was in 1985,
after he had been

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.409
established for many years.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.669
And he basically laughed, and
then hung up the phone on me.

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.350
So we started Tommy Hilfiger.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.360
And when I started
Tommy Hilfiger,

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.960
I decided to design
what I wanted to wear,

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.810
what I thought was missing
in the marketplace.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.390
And what was missing,
in my opinion,

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.570
was a cool, preppy brand.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.566
There was a Brooks Brothers,
and there was a Ralph Lauren,

00:09:01.566 --> 00:09:03.190
and there were preppy
brands out there.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.190
But they were very
boring and very staid.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:09.670
I decided to make
them very cool.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:13.190
So I redesigned all
of the preppy clothes

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.970
I had been brought up wearing--
the button-down shirt,

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:20.920
the chino trouser, the cotton
sweater, a basic khaki golf

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.180
jacket.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.610
And I redesigned
them to make them

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.500
be more relevant for the time.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.320
I wanted them to be
relaxed, oversized,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:34.550
fun, colorful, detailed, but
to have a cool edge with them.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.480
And at this point
in time, I actually

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.890
put them in a duffel bag
myself, went to Bloomingdale's,

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.500
Neiman's, Saks-- all
the department stores--

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.410
knocked on the doors,
and I sold my collection

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.640
into these stores.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.520
And that is where I met Mr.
Terry Lundgren, when he was--

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.180
actually, Terry was at
Bullocks before Neiman's.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.870
But I was out on the
road selling my clothes

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.410
to people like Terry,
who were, I think,

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:06.910
kind enough and open
enough to, at least, sample

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:07.900
what I was selling.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.160
And it ended up selling.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.310
The customers ended
up accepting my

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.070
look-- my preppy,
all-American, classic look.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.020
So I started to expand it.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.920
And in 1989, Mr. Murjani
came to me and said, look,

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.400
I just took the license
for Coca-Cola clothes.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.170
Would you help me design it?

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.760
And I said, Coca-Cola clothes?

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.490
I mean, that seems
a little weird.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.770
And he said, well,
look, if you really

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.680
want me to continue to support
you with Tommy Hilfiger,

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.860
I need your help designing
Coca-Cola clothes.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.230
So I went back to
my drawing board.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.440
And I thought, OK, if I were
to wear Coca-Cola clothes, what

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.940
would they look like?

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.420
And at first, I envisioned a red
T-shirt with a white Coca-Cola

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.290
printing.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.850
And I said, no,
that wouldn't work.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.750
So I decided to design great,
cool, American-classic clothes,

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.630
and then put the
Coca-Cola label on them.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.580
So we developed
Coca-Cola clothes

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.110
in the '80s and early '90s.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.300
And it was an explosive
business right out of the box.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.580
But within two years,
it took a tumble.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.300
And what that taught me
was that trends never last.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.890
And I would have to develop a
real brand, avoiding trends,

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.330
but being true to myself.

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.560
So I continued to build my
preppy, all-American, classic

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.490
look.

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.400
I took on some new
partners in the early '90s.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:32.540
And these partners
were from Ralph Lauren.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.570
A couple of them owned
Ralph Lauren in Europe.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:38.050
One was and is a
Chinese manufacturer.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.630
And the other was, at
the time, the president

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.850
of Gloria Vanderbilt
with Murjani.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.650
So they had some experience.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.050
And we sat around
one day and decided

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.940
what to do with the brand.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.910
And they said, Tommy,
what is the real vision?

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:56.800
And I said, I want to
build a global lifestyle

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.010
brand with a preppy attitude.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:06.310
But I wanted to be aspirational,
inspirational, exciting, fun,

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:11.690
style-wise, on point,
fresh, new, and unique.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:12.820
So we did that.

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.480
And we did it over a
period of 20-some years.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.520
And as I said, this
is the 25th year,

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.790
so it was 20-some years
since this new partnership.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.420
And we developed a classic,
all-American, preppy, global

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.980
lifestyle brand.

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.220
Men's wear, women's wear,
children's wear, fragrance,

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:35.500
accessories, neckwear, dress
shirts, shoes, belts, bags.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.150
We developed homewear.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.750
So it was really coming around
to becoming a global lifestyle

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:41.620
brand.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:45.020
Well, we weren't really
global quite yet.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.370
We had a store in London,
and we had a small selling

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.220
office in the middle
of Europe in Amsterdam.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.010
And the selling office
was run by a man

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:58.060
by the name of Fred Gehring,
who is currently our CEO.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.800
Fred's idea was to expand
the brand throughout Europe

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.900
to become a luxury,
upscale lifestyle brand.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.890
Slowly but surely, while we're
expanding rapidly in the United

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.130
States, opening shops
and department stores,

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:19.910
advertising, marketing through
celebrity, through music,

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:23.860
through all sorts of unique
ways, sponsoring racing teams,

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:28.030
sailing racing, we were
developing nautical clothes

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:32.020
and dressing some of
the America's Cup teams.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.180
We were developing clothes
for Formula One race drivers,

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.550
and really touching society,
touching pop culture

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.810
and society.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:44.320
When it was time to launch
our Tommy and Tommy Girl

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.980
fragrances, I said, I think
we should attach ourselves

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.030
to music.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.610
Because music, when I opened
my People's Place store

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:55.160
in the very beginning,
was my inspiration.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.760
At that time, when I
was 17 and 18 years old,

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.640
my friends and I wanted to
look like the rock stars,

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.130
wearing bell bottoms.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.190
We had long hair.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.790
We listened to the Beatles, the
Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix--

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.070
all of that classic rock music.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.900
And the music was
great, but we wanted

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.670
to look like the rock stars.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:19.280
And that really inspired
me to develop my own stores

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.380
and go into the
fashion business.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.670
So here we are in the '90s,
developing a new fragrance.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:30.140
And we said, what can we do to
be unique in our advertising

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.290
and marketing?

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.520
So I decided to hire
the sons and daughters

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.710
of all the iconic rock stars.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.820
We hired Mick Jagger's son and
daughter, Sting's daughter,

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.880
Rod Stewart's daughter,
Quincy Jones' daughter,

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.570
and we put them all in a
group in an advertisement

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.760
for Tommy and Tommy
Girl fragrance.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.670
And our fragrances
took off like crazy.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:57.230
At that point in time, I thought
it was a good idea to market

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.720
through celebrity,
because I thought

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.060
that, if the celebrities
wore the clothes,

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.430
their fans would also
wear the clothes.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.410
So we started
dressing Lenny Kravitz

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:10.430
and sponsored a Lenny Kravitz
tour, a Sheryl Crow tour.

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.640
We used David Bowie and
Iman in our advertising.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.830
We used everyone from the
Rolling Stones in a sponsorship

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.550
concert tour to Britney Spears.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.440
And I remember
the day my brother

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.690
Andy brought me Britney Spears.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:29.510
He said, Britney
is a new musician.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.860
She just moved to New York.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.830
And she has a hit coming
out on the radio any day.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:37.040
And wouldn't it be great to use
her in our jeans advertising?

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.190
So we used her in our
Tommy jeans advertising

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:45.920
the day her Baby One More
Time hit went to number one.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.410
We had no idea who
she was at that time.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.630
But we were deciding,
at that point in time,

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.840
to market and advertise
through celebrity,

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.910
which is done all the time now.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.220
But I think it's
probably something that

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.730
is overused today and overdone.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.130
So I'm always looking for
something new and something

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.670
different, something unique,
but holding onto the brand

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.950
and keeping true to its roots.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.080
Recently, as you
saw in the video,

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.300
we developed a family campaign--
an all-American, quirky, fun

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.830
family campaign.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.040
And that really
plants us into who

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.890
we are, because we
are a family brand.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.320
We're a cool,
American-classic family brand.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:33.140
And it all happens as a result
of having a great product.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.650
At the end of the day, I believe
you can have the greatest

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:40.550
advertising, the most
amazing logo, the greatest

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.460
name, the most marketing
muscle, but if you

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.790
don't have the product, you
absolutely have nothing.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.000
So our focus, at
this point in time,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.010
as it was in the
very beginning, is

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:56.750
to offer the consumer amazing
product, amazing value,

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:01.790
affordable, accessible,
inspirational, aspirational.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:03.710
And that's what
we're really focused

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.020
on more than anything else.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.760
Although we are opening
stores all over the world.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.079
We have over 1,000 stores
in the world today.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:15.440
We just opened a new store on
Fifth Avenue in New York City.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.060
We have a new flagship store
in Paris on the Champs-Elysees.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:26.180
We're opening a new flagship in
Tokyo, in Rio, in Buenos Aires.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.490
We just opened in
Dublin recently.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.820
We believe having our own
stores is very important.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.820
But we also believe in
having a relationship

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.090
and a partnership with a
department store like Macy's is

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.920
incredibly important.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:42.410
Because with this
exclusive arrangement,

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.500
we have a true
family partnership,

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.980
where we have shops-- men's,
women's, children's-- in all

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.510
of the Macy's stores.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.670
And we don't have
to focus on selling

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.640
25 or 50 different
customers in the US.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.880
We focus on a
partnership with Macy's.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.690
And our business, as Terry
said, has never been better.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:04.290
And it continues to grow.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.720
We continue to add new product
lines, new ideas, new marketing

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:14.840
ideas, and continue to evolve
the business into the future.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.570
All of that keeps me very busy.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:20.270
As a matter of
fact, for me, it's

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:21.980
not like work at
all because it's

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.260
so much fun and so exciting.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.200
But in addition to
that, we're, I think,

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.720
charity-minded, as
you [? could ?] say.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.960
We're very involved
in youth outreach

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.350
programs like the Fresh
Air Fund in New York City.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:40.650
We built a summer camp for
the underprivileged children.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.700
We've been involved
in helping raise funds

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.370
and building the
Martin Luther King Jr.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:48.840
Memorial in Washington DC.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:53.750
We're involved with breast
cancer, Evelyn Lauder's quest

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.040
to fight breast cancer.

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.310
We're involved with MS,
the race to erase MS.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.410
So we're continually
giving back.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.320
Recently, we adopted
a village in Africa

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.270
with Millennium Promise.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.180
So we take a certain percentage
of our sales, a certain amount

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.790
of our profits,
and we give back,

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.010
which we think is
very important,

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:15.390
and something that
we'll continue

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:19.470
to do for at least
the rest of my life.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:25.680
We believe that having a very
diverse company is important.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.440
We have people from
all walks of life.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:35.220
We have people from
the Chinese factory

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:39.900
sewing machine operators
to top-level executives.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.265
And I'm sure many
of you are thinking

00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:44.220
of what to do in the future.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:49.230
This business offers so
much amazing opportunity.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.550
If you just look
at the marketing

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:55.690
area and the social networking,
which we're very involved with,

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.880
that spells opportunity.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.740
If you look at
the manufacturing,

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.050
that's all about opportunity.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.280
And you look at the leadership
in the executive programs

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.930
Macy's and companies like ours
offer, it's really incredible,

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:12.320
and the sky is the limit.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.000
So if you're contemplating
being in this business

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.760
at some point in time,
the opportunities

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.410
are endless, not to mention
the creative area, which

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:26.420
is probably my favorite.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:31.660
It is, I would say, a
dream come true to be

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:35.530
able to sit with a design
team, sit with creative people

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:39.560
and come up with new
ideas, execute those ideas,

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.650
put them into the
stores, and actually see

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:45.250
people wearing the ideas
or wearing the clothes

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.320
or wearing the accessories
on the streets.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.850
There's nothing
better than that.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.670
That's a fulfilling feeling.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.430
And I would only
wish some of you

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:58.190
could experience
that in your lives.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:01.100
In addition to, I
think, the success

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:06.350
we've had in building a brand
and building a product line,

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.680
I would say that it all
revolves around the people

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.450
and the quality of the people.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.790
I have an all-star team.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.720
And I really believe I wouldn't
be standing here today, talking

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.920
about the greatness of
my company and the growth

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.180
and the phenomenal success
we've had worldwide,

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:28.760
if I hadn't been able
to surround myself

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.250
with incredible people.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:33.140
It is really all about a team.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.700
It's not about me.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.980
It is not about Fred
Gehring, the CEO.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.640
But it's about a team.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.660
And within the team,
we have subteams.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.040
We have our marketing team.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.120
We have our design team.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.950
We have our production team.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:47.600
We have our accessory team.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.020
We have a team just searching
the world for new fabrics.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.820
We have a team just
going out, looking

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.130
for buttons in the world.

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:58.670
We have teams on the
ground just doing events.

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:02.240
And we have teams just
working on fashion collections

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.350
for the runway.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:06.170
And we have teams just
working with celebrities.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:09.980
We have teams looking around
the world in vintage stores

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.830
and antique markets
for new ideas.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:16.810
It's all about these
teams coming together,

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:20.270
bringing, I would say,
all of the ingredients

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:25.200
needed in building a
global lifestyle brand.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:29.730
So hopefully, I covered
the general idea

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:35.070
of how this company was
formed and how we built it.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.920
The vision for the
future is as exciting

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.550
as it's been in the past--
maybe even more exciting,

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:46.740
with being able to talk
directly to the consumer today.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.990
And I would be more
than happy to answer

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.980
any questions you may have.

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.190
I hope I covered everything.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:58.920
Probably too much, but I thank
you very much for listening.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.806
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:09.021 --> 00:23:10.330
Hi, Mr. Hilfiger.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.184
Thank you so much for sharing.

00:23:12.184 --> 00:23:14.350
My name is [? Saris ?]
[? Angelo. ?] I teach fashion

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:17.410
design and merchandising at
a high school here in Tucson.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.560
And last March, I had a
chance to take 35 of my girls

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.400
to New York.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.770
And we actually
toured Tommy Hilfiger.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:26.410
And I had a chance to
meet your sister, Betsy.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:30.100
And she was amazing--
very, very personable.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:34.090
And I think all of my girls
were amazed with all that you're

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.800
doing for the community.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.800
One thing I just
wanted to ask is

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.550
what you see the next 25
years for Tommy Hilfiger,

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:45.490
and what you're hoping
to do with the company.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.340
Well, for the next
25 years, I think

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:52.090
I can say that the
number one priority is

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:55.180
to improve the product.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.070
Always improve the product.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.340
I think there are
better ways to sew

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.650
in the pocketing
in our jeanswear.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:06.100
I think there are better
ways to soften the fabric.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.360
I think there are organic
opportunities, sustainable

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.160
opportunities.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.120
You just heard the gentleman
speak on organic cottons.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.060
I really believe a lot
of that is our future.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.980
But the first and
number one priority

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.720
is all about the product.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.660
And then the evolution
of the brand,

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:29.650
of marketing-- the evolution
of our own retail stores,

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:31.930
and more of our
own retail stores.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:35.080
I really believe that
everything we're doing today

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.900
can be done better tomorrow.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.720
So it's about challenging
ourselves to be

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.640
better at everything we do.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.721
Hi, Tommy.

00:24:44.721 --> 00:24:45.220
Hi.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:45.719
Hi.

00:24:45.719 --> 00:24:48.460
I remember the fad well
of the Coca-Cola shirts.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:50.380
I had one and loved it.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:52.720
And I've loved your
brand for a long time.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.730
I used to be a buyer at
a sporting goods store.

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:57.520
And I noticed
lately, or recently,

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.610
that you redesigned some
professional sports uniforms.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.680
And they've turned
out very cool.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.700
And I have two
questions for you.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:07.870
Do you plan to do any more
designing of professional sport

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:08.710
uniforms?

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.260
And secondly, in our
lifetime, will we

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.296
ever see baseball uniforms
become more flattering?

00:25:14.296 --> 00:25:16.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:22.230
Well, I can say designing sports
uniforms is a big challenge.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:28.650
Because the technical
aspect that goes into it is,

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:31.200
I would say,
challenging at best.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.830
But I would love to design
more sports uniforms.

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:38.310
But unfortunately, I have to
design for my favorite teams,

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:41.580
and that becomes a
little conflicting.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:46.170
I did a number of
different designs for ESPN

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:49.590
as examples of what I would
do if I were to design clothes

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:54.720
for the Cowboys, the Lakers,
and a number of different teams.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:00.810
But I started working as a stock
boy in a sporting goods store.

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:03.090
And I learned a lot.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:06.900
But ultimately, it's
all about the product.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:07.870
Thank you.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:08.611
Hey, Tommy.

00:26:08.611 --> 00:26:09.110
Hi.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.050
Tom Julian over here.

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:12.080
Nice to see you.

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:12.890
How are you?

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:13.730
Well, thank you.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:14.310
Hey, Tommy.

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.820
So you know, you've never
done a secondary line.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.860
You've never
bastardized your name.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.710
You've always kept
this new luxury going

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.420
with your entire collection.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.120
That's hard for a lot of
companies and brands today.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.470
So how do you maintain it?

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:31.190
Or what is always your criteria
for being aspirational,

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:35.480
quality, and so image-oriented?

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.450
I think it's a
very good question.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:41.740
Actually, in the mid-'90s,
I made a big mistake.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.950
We overexpanded.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.910
And we created more supply
than there was demand.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:49.890
As a result of that, we
had to take a big step

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:51.750
backwards to go forward.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.910
And that taught us a lesson.

00:26:53.910 --> 00:27:00.210
And the lesson was that to
keep it somewhat exclusive

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:05.070
is important-- to somehow
be on the other side

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:09.090
of the supply-demand equation.

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:11.340
Because once you
oversupply the demand,

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:14.640
you have a glut of product
in the marketplace,

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.830
and the customer says, no more.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.740
So it is, I think,
always a challenge.

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:23.580
It's something we're
looking at every single day.

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.920
But I really believe
that there is

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.630
such a thing as overexpanding
and damaging the brand.

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:34.080
We really experienced,
I would say,

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.210
a brush with it in the '90s.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:41.770
Fortunately, our management
team acted upon it very quickly.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:44.250
We cleaned up
distribution, so to speak.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.910
We were selling all of
our excess to discounters.

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:49.890
And we put an end to that.

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:53.400
And we do have some of
our own outlet stores.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.400
But we are always
looking at the balance,

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:01.260
and always making sure that we
don't overexpand and over-flood

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.750
the market with our
product, because it takes

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.590
the value out of the product.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.090
Perfect.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:08.520
And then how would you
describe new luxury today?

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.560
What is new luxury
for the consumer?

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.040
New luxury today, for me and
for the consumer, I believe,

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.840
is affordable luxury.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.510
Because people want
luxury, but people

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.050
want to be able to afford it.

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:22.950
And in years past, luxury
was something that you really

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.660
couldn't quite afford.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:29.280
It was always a tremendous
reach to buy something cashmere

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:34.230
or something from one
of the luxury brands.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.720
But I think it's
up to us to offer

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.040
that customer great luxury
at affordable price points.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.430
Because everyone
wants it, and everyone

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:47.910
feels that they're
deserving of it somehow.

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:50.970
And whether it's a
cashmere cotton sweater,

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:58.500
or whether it is a
handbag with a bit of trim

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:06.480
from either a lizard or snake
or fur, just to, I would say,

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.130
make the customer
feel that they're

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:09.390
getting something luxurious.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.130
I think that's very
important to do.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:13.170
I know Macy's is
working on that.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:17.730
My friend, Michael Kors,
is one of the number

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:19.420
one designers in America today.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:23.340
But he has a big presence
in Macy's, along with Coach,

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.880
selling luxury handbags,
accessories, shoes,

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.140
and fashion.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:32.220
And I really believe that
they're leading the way.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.990
I like being on that bandwagon.

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:35.656
I think it's very important.

00:29:35.656 --> 00:29:36.430
Thank you.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:37.570
Thank you.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:39.070
Hi, Tommy.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:40.240
Hi.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.710
Going back to that point in your
life, when your accountant came

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.910
to you and said that you're
going to go bankrupt,

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.326
what did you say
to yourself to be

00:29:48.326 --> 00:29:51.250
able to still feel that you
could persevere and continue

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:52.312
with your dream?

00:29:52.312 --> 00:29:54.020
Do you want to know
what I said at first?

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:55.210
Yeah.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:58.150
Oh, shit.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:00.970
Oh, no.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:05.230
See, my father was a
watchmaker, jeweler.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:06.280
My mother was a nurse.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.230
And we had nine children.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.960
So that sort of tells
you that I couldn't

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:17.170
go knocking on my parents'
door to get a loan.

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:20.260
I really had to rethink my life.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.210
And I had to decide
at that point in time,

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.220
should I go back to school?

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.580
Should I continue on?

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:31.890
I was so passionate
about what I was doing.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.470
I decided to continue on.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:35.360
And I learned about the law.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.060
I learned about the fact that,
if you are Chapter 11, which

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:42.470
is a form of bankruptcy, you can
stay in business as long as you

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:47.870
pay your creditors off,
and as long as you really

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:49.710
operate on a cash basis.

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:51.650
So I kept in
business at the time,

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:53.900
and then built the business
back up to the point

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.750
where I could sell
it, take that money,

00:30:56.750 --> 00:31:00.650
and become my own manufacturing
designer brand, which

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:03.740
was tiny at the time, but
I had visions and dreams

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.030
of it growing.

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.490
And my dreams did come true.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:09.460
So I do believe
dreams do come true.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:12.850
All right.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:15.080
Thank you so much
for coming today.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.490
I appreciate you sharing your
transparency and being real.

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:21.640
I know a lot of us students
at the University of Arizona

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.410
have dreams.

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.320
And you've shown us that
they are obtainable.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.940
So thank you.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:32.050
But mine is more or less just a
comment that I wanted to make.

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:33.850
On behalf of all of
the students attending

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:35.770
the Global Retail
Conference, we want

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:37.810
to say thank you for
all of you for allowing

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:40.210
us to be a fly on the wall.

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:43.210
We take away great insight
on brand development,

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.920
building brand equity,
and most importantly,

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.220
understanding the
forever-changing environment

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:50.460
and challenges
faced by retailers.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.254
And for that, we want
to say thank you.

00:31:52.254 --> 00:31:53.555
Thank you very much.

00:31:53.555 --> 00:31:54.555
It's a great compliment.

00:31:54.555 --> 00:31:57.245
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:57.245 --> 00:31:59.620
Thank you.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.820
Tommy, what are the
contemporary trends

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.400
in American casual
wear and denim,

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.890
and how are they different
around the globe?

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:10.680
What are other cultures' tastes?

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:13.680
Well, I think they vary
somewhat around the globe.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.040
Not tremendously, because
the people in Japan

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.410
are wearing the same
styles that they're

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:21.750
wearing in Paris, that they're
wearing in Minneapolis.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:26.580
But I really believe that there
are nuances in different areas.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.940
The preppy look in some
areas is not the same

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.530
as it is in the states.

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:35.850
In Italy, it's much brighter
and much more slender.

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.160
In France, it's a
little bit more staid

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.920
and a little bit more starched.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:45.720
I think that it
depends on the region.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.830
And it depends on even
the weights of the fabric.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:52.050
Our business in Germany is much
different than our business

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.100
in Spain.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:56.040
The Germans like
heavier, darker fabrics.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.760
The customer in
Spain would prefer

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.170
something lighter and brighter.

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:04.080
So we mold and shape
to the territory.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.560
And we do that with My Macy's.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.080
Terry developed a program
called My Macy's, whereby,

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.930
in Texas, the stores might
want something different

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.210
than they would want in Boston.

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:17.310
And I think that's
really a great way

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:22.140
to plan and develop a
business, because you're really

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.790
responding to the
customers' needs.

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:26.790
But from a fashion
standpoint, I think

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:31.620
we're all on the same track
of what is fashionable,

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.030
what is now.

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:35.390
But I think, from
a fit standpoint,

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.070
a color, a fabric
standpoint, it does vary.

00:33:41.144 --> 00:33:42.185
And it's a good question.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:46.820
Yes.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:47.320
Yes.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.625
I work for a brand design firm.

00:33:48.625 --> 00:33:50.750
And I just wanted to say,
first of all, that I love

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.410
your American-- I'm over here.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:54.216
Right over here.

00:33:54.216 --> 00:33:54.716
All right.

00:33:54.716 --> 00:33:55.910
All right.

00:33:55.910 --> 00:33:57.010
OK.

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:58.460
The speaker is over here, so--

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.200
I'm sorry.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.850
I love your American
Family campaign.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:02.960
I think it's fantastic.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.606
Thank you.

00:34:03.606 --> 00:34:05.480
One of the best things
about it and, I think,

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:10.177
about your brand-- its essence
is the styling of the clothes,

00:34:10.177 --> 00:34:11.510
not just the clothes themselves.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:14.750
I'm wondering how you make sure
that that reaches the store

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:19.100
level, and that the styling
itself is translating.

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:23.980
That's a very difficult
proposition, making sure

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.100
that the stores look
like the advertising.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:30.550
Well, we're talking about
hundreds and hundreds

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:32.650
of designs every season.

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:36.639
And it's up to the buyer and
the buyers in these stores

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:38.020
to select.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:40.330
And sometimes,
they may not think

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:42.730
that one of the
jackets in the ad

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:46.659
would be appropriate for their
consumer because of the climate

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:47.460
or whatever.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.110
But we try our best
to make sure that what

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:53.980
we show in the advertising
ends up on the selling floor.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:57.430
And sometimes, it ends up on
the selling floor in smaller

00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:00.190
quantities and sells
out immediately,

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:05.710
which prompts us to redesign
the same item with, maybe,

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.440
a nuance or two for
the next season.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.000
But we try very
hard to make sure

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.217
that whatever is in the
advertising shows up

00:35:12.217 --> 00:35:12.800
in the stores.

00:35:16.635 --> 00:35:17.625
Thank you.

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.070
You're welcome.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:28.170
Thank you very much.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:31.520
Thank you.
