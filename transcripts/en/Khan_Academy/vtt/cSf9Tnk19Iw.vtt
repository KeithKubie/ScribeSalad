00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.154
- I'm Dave Paunesku, and I'm
the executive director of PERTS

00:00:03.154 --> 00:00:06.370
which is the Project for
Education Research That Scales.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.180
It's a center at Stanford University.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.240
PERTS makes a variety of resources

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.910
that help educators learn about
the science of motivation.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.060
And we do that in order to help educators

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.550
inspire all of their
students to learn fearlessly.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.100
When students have a growth mindset,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.360
when they're thinking in a growth mindset,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.700
they're really thinking of their abilities

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.440
as something that they can
grow, something like a muscle.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.760
Something that they can grow over time

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.490
by investing their effort
into the right strategy.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.060
When students are thinking
in a fixed mindset,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.880
they tend to think of their
abilities as something fixed,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.850
something like eye color,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.040
something they really can't
change about themselves.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.360
When students are thinking
in a growth mindset,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.991
they're doing I think two things

00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:45.010
that are really helpful,
that'll ultimately help them

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.950
be more successful, that'll
help them be more motivated.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.660
One is that they're viewing challenges

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.060
really as opportunities
to grow their abilities.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.260
That means they're much less
likely to be discouraged

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.770
if they encounter something
that's challenging.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.560
In contrast, they might be more likely

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.654
to seek out challenges, and
research shows that, in fact,

00:01:03.654 --> 00:01:05.770
when students are thinking
in a growth mindset,

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.140
they're more likely to seek out

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.340
more challenging work.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.250
The second piece is that they realize

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.050
that if they're really stuck on something,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.210
then the key to doing that, one,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.460
might be to persist, but
two, and just as important,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.180
is to switch up the
strategies they're using.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.150
Maybe to seek out help from someone.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.700
And if they're thinking
in a growth mindset

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.640
they're gonna be less likely to be worried

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.520
that if they need help that means that

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.480
they're not smart enough to succeed.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.410
Instead they'll understand that

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.080
their teachers and their peers are there

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.900
to help them grow and develop as learners.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.190
So through the Learnstorm activities,

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.030
we're really trying to arm teachers

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.870
with a bunch of activities
that will help them

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.810
and their students learn together

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.900
about the science of learning

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.400
and the science of growth mindset

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.050
that will help them engage in important

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.200
kinds of self reflection.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.760
And different kinds of activities

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.358
that could help kinda
really reinforce those ideas

00:01:57.358 --> 00:01:59.360
over the course of Learnstorm.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.050
But then also kinda create
a model, a scaffold,

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.990
and an approach toward self reflection

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.840
and thinking about learning,
and about growth mindset.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.360
That could then be kinda
revisited throughout the year

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.430
to really reinforce these ideas.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.253
And to remind students to
keep going and keep growing.
