WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.370
They notice a difference cause I agree.
You know,

2
00:00:02.371 --> 00:00:06.570
sometimes I'll be on tour and you go to a Vegan spot and I'll take my bus driver

3
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:10.050
in or my,
whoever's traveling with me and they're like,
oh man,
this is rough.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.850
You know,
like they can't stand it.

5
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.360
Crossroads is not one of those spots where you're thinking about like,
man,

6
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:19.860
I might not enjoy this meal.
There's some good spots in la.
Has some great spots.

7
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.100
You ever go to follow your heart in the valley all the time,
right spot.
Yeah.

8
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:26.880
That's the spot close to home that I love.
Like follow your heart.
Uh,

9
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.200
shout out to Erewhon.
Everyone has like good vegan options.
Uh,

10
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.470
chef Edo who has a spot in downtown called Allach who took a vow of silence 22

11
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:41.130
years ago.
Yeah,
he's special man.
Yeah.

12
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.970
22 years ago.
Took a vow of silence and these done no more talking.

13
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.820
No more talking.
What in the fuck is that about?
Yeah,

14
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.870
so he just communicates if he has a lot to say or write it down.

15
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:55.530
But other than that,
you just read the lips and I know what he's saying,
but he,

16
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:59.370
he shows up to,
oh,
that's so crazy.
Yeah.
He takes a lot of photos.

17
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:02.700
So he'll show up to like punk or wraps or whatever.
Whatever show I'm playing.

18
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.960
He's in the pit with this camera,
this silent guy who doesn't say a word.

19
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.510
Yeah.
And it's,
his cooking is phenomenal.
So,
but yeah,
La,
we're spoiled with great,

20
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.340
great Vegan restaurant.
That's a fucking trip.
Yeah.
22 years of no talking.

21
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.761
Yeah.

22
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:22.761
He also does like this juicing where this year he juiced for 189 days with no

23
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:27.120
food.
Wow.
What did he get down to?

24
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.610
I think he was,
yeah,
he lost about 20 something pounds.
Fuck man.

25
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.950
He does it every year.
Wow.
Yeah.
He's trying to vanish.
Right.

26
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.180
I try to not talk.
I don't think I can do it.

27
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.330
Intermittent fasting is like as much as I can do.
Yeah.
I do that every night.

28
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:50.160
But that's the vow science.
It's frequent.
That silence is freaking me out.
Yeah.

29
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.090
He and I,

30
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.880
I've never really pried and kind of like asked a bunch of questions of why cause

31
00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:57.810
they ain't even have to write a lot.
Yeah.
That too.
But no,
I've,

32
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.370
I've been around when people ask him and he just said he wanted a timeout for 22

33
00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:05.340
years.
Yeah.
That's a serious fucking time out.
How old his homeboy,

34
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.050
he's gotta be probably in his fifties so almost half his life.
Yeah.

35
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.980
What the fuck man?
Yep.
But he spends Christmas with me,

36
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:16.650
spins Thanksgiving with my family and I,
oh,
that's cool.

37
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.360
Let's put everybody just smiles at them.
Yeah.

38
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:20.190
Everyone just smiles and waves basically.

39
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.880
He'd be a good guy to sit next to someone who's on coke.
Totally.

40
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:27.030
They would just talk as fucking Europe and he'd just be sitting there all
silent.

41
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.620
Yeah,
no,
I just blah blah blah.
Yeah.
Fuck man,
that is,

42
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.540
I've never even heard of anything like that.

43
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.530
Does he make any noises as you whistle?
No.

44
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.710
I've heard him snore at one time when he was laughing Hella hard.

45
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.990
But that was about as close as it gets.

46
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:47.250
So he doesn't laugh out loud like ha ha ha ha,
wow.

47
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.360
Nothing terrible comedy club,
audience member.
Yeah,
it would be rough.

48
00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.500
He has a march two it's called March of silence.

49
00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:59.410
That happens once a year where you have a bunch of them that basically,

50
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.460
you know that are,

51
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.940
and they're basically marching for the march of silence for like the cruelty of

52
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:08.230
animals and whatever else.
So yeah,
I like to have him on the podcast.
I see.

53
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:12.700
How long have you talked to him for?
Yeah,
just to see what,
what it would be like.

54
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.900
That's so strange.
It sounds cool.
I mean yeah,

55
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.460
I love that there's people like that out there though.
I do,

56
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.650
I love hearing those stories like the world needs him.

57
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:22.810
You know like when you said that I got excited,

58
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.540
the guy has been solid for 20 I'm like Whoa.

59
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.120
You know there's something about that.
It makes you go wow,

60
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.280
I was talking hell loud when I first met him.
He was like,
I can hear you.

61
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.440
You know,
I was like,
oh man.
Cause I was trying to wrap my head around,
you know,

62
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:42.820
no one did an introduction going,
hey,
this guy silent.
I just tell you no,

63
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.590
no.
Had no idea.
So I'm talking really loud and he like,

64
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.970
he like just whispers to me like mouse to me.
I can hear you now.
I was like,
okay.

65
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.980
Then I just figured out over time,
silent by choice.
Whew.

66
00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.770
Yeah,
that's heavy.
What is he involved,

67
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:03.400
like heavy meditation or Buddhism or anything very strange like that.
Yeah,

68
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.660
he meditates.
I think he has like a lot of kind of Buddhist,

69
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.980
uh,
kind of qualities,
like kind of,
I think he,

70
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.800
if he had a lean in some kind of religion or practice,
who would be that?

71
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.560
Wow.
Yeah.
That's intense.
Yeah.
That's a serious commitment,
man.
Yeah.

72
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.910
I couldn't even imagine going 22 days without talking a day.
I think.

73
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.850
Any,
anything.
I think we'd catch ourselves.
It being very hard.
Ah,

74
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.010
I was going to get my tonsils and adenoids removed because I have sleep apnea

75
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.270
because I fat neck.
But,
uh,

76
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:41.260
I found a mouth piece that I couldn't sleep with that keeps my tongue from

77
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:44.950
falling over because I have a,
when when your neck is thick,

78
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.630
your wind hole is smaller believer or not.
Cause the more muscle you put in,

79
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:53.140
the small year your whole gets.
And then if you have a big tongue,

80
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.970
when you lay back,
you can actually block your airway.
Wow.
Yeah.

81
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.160
And so friends that I know have had their adenoids,

82
00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:04.450
their tonsils removed and they actually take some of the soft tissue out of
your,

83
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.490
your passageway so you can breathe these here.

84
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.110
But the problem is you can't talk for like seven days.
Oh yeah.

85
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:14.500
That would probably be rough for you.
For me.
Yeah.
And then wonder if wide neck,

86
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:14.741
you know,

87
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:19.180
like that the Internet phenomenon that has the same problem I get that guy must

88
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:22.360
sleep terrible.
Yeah.
His neck starts up here.
It's crazy.

89
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:25.600
As neck starts at the top of his ears and works its way to his shoulders,

90
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.920
tonsils out as a,
uh,
it's a bum out.
I did that.
Did you,

91
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.970
did you have taught Salinas or,
um,
now,

92
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:38.890
you know what I had is I had,
I was smoking tons of weed,
right.

93
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.280
Like,
but I would smoke backwoods,
like I loved the woods,

94
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:45.880
so everything I got him right here.
Yeah.

95
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.710
So I'd smoke about 20,
20 backwards a day.
Yeah.

96
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.490
And I was recording an album,
uh,

97
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.830
with the transplants and then I turned to skinhead rob and I was like,
Yo,

98
00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:59.930
I think,
I think I have something,
like something's lodged in my throat.

99
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.050
Like I could barely breathe right now.
And um,

100
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.230
kept smoking,
didn't even,
you know,
I didn't,

101
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:07.730
I didn't really know what was going on.

102
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.270
And then I went to the hospital that night and they rushed me to another

103
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:15.200
hospital to get my tonsils removed because they were like twice the size of

104
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:16.034
these should be.

105
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.880
And then I had a throat infection and then it comes to find out I had what's

106
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:21.200
called like Barrett's Esophagus,

107
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:26.201
which is like pre cancer row lining my esophagus from smoking.

108
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.710
And I don't know,
I guess just abuse over the years.
So that was,

109
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.690
that's what led to my tonsils being pulled out.
