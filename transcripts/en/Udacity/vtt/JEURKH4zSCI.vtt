00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.296
The answer is 57/100.

00:00:04.296 --> 00:00:08.842
The first thing we did to solve this
problem was to write 32 hundredths as

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.145
a fraction.

00:00:10.145 --> 00:00:12.970
32 hundredths becomes 32/100.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:21.370
So our new expression is 1/4 + 32/100.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.990
We need to find a common denominator,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.430
which we can get by
multiplying 1/4 by 25.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.309
Don't forget you multiply both
the numerator and the denominator by 25.

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.082
Our equivalent fraction is 25/100 and

00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:43.150
now our expression
becomes 25/100 + 32/100.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.426
These two fractions have
a common denominator, so

00:00:46.426 --> 00:00:50.091
we just add the numerators together and
they add to 57.

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:51.940
And the denominator stays 100.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.549
So there we go, 57/100.
