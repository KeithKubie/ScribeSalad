00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
We've talked up carbon quite a bit here on
Crash Course Chemistry,

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:05.520
but we really haven't justified the lofty
position I put it in.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.040
Just chains so far and while chains are good, they're not enough reason on their own for this high level of esteem.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.940
But carbon atoms, they do more than just form
chains.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.580
Sometimes, they form rings, or as chemists
call them: cyclic structures,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.200
and if the rings have the right number and placement of double bonds they start acting weird and wonderful.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.900
The compounds made from them are called aromatic,

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.660
literally because they have aromas, they can
smell amazing.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.480
Basil, vanilla, cloves, tarragon, lemon, cinnamon.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.219
When we smell these things, it's because aromatic
compounds, compounds with carbon rings,

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.440
are binding to receptors in our noses that
tell our brains "OMG tasty stuff nearby".

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.680
Of course, moth-balls and modelling glue and lots of other stuff are also aromatic and don't smell so good...

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.720
But if you've ever smelled an herb, taken
medicine, worn clothes or enjoyed a meal,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.640
you probably owe that experience, at least
in part, to aromatic hydrocarbons.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.960
[Theme Music]

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.380
But before we talk about aromatics, let's talk about the most basic cyclic structures, the cycloalkanes.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.000
You recognize the -alkane ending there, so
there must be no double bonds, right?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.420
And you can't make a ring with one or two carbons, so the simplest cyclic hydrocarbon must be cyclopropane.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.960
But those tight bond angles of that triangular
cyclopropane make it very fragile.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.440
This instability makes it highly reactive and it would much rather just be a straight chain.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.640
But as more carbons join into the ring cyclic
structures get more stable.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.460
Cyclobutane with its four carbon atoms is
still fairly unstable and reactive,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.469
while in cyclopentane the bonds are even more
stable

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.740
because they form something close to those
tetrahedral bond angles,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.860
while the angles in cyclohexane are basically perfect for the tetrahedral orbitals to overlap without strain.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.720
Cycloalkenes also start at three carbons and
get increasingly stable as more are added,

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.999
though their double bonds make their molecules
plainer instead of tetrahedral.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.840
Finally, cycloalkynes do exist, but they are crazy hard to form because the triple bond is linear,

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.450
so it hates bending into rings, and that is
why the simplest cycloalkyne has eight carbons.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.630
Of course these rings can have all sorts of
things stringing off of them

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.350
and their names work almost exactly the same
way as straight chains do.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.580
Example: This ring has five carbon atoms and
a double bond, so it's a cyclopentene.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.190
It has two branches, an ethyl group and a
methyl group.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.420
We list these in alphabetical order in the
name.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.600
And we number the carbons in the ring so we get the lowest possible numbers on the branches and on the double bond.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.020
If we number counterclockwise from the beginning of the double bond, we get the branches at the 2 and 5 positions,

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.160
but if we number clockwise from the double
bond the branches are at the 1 and 3 positions.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.800
So, this must be 1-Ethyl-3-methylcyclopent-1-ene.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.460
But since it's only one double bond and it's
in the first position,

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.230
the second one is often left out as being
understood.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.150
So we simply call it 1-Ethyl-3-methylcyclopentene.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.100
Incidentally all of the identifying parts
of an organic molecule,

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.490
the double and triple bonds, the carbon chains
that branch off the main chain,

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.330
those are called substituents because they
substitute for hydrogen atoms.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.080
So far we've just been looking at the cyclic
hydrocarbons, so what's up with the aromatics?

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.800
How are they different?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.020
Well this is one of the times when carbon
starts doing some of its spectacular dances.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.360
Cyclic hydrocarbons that contain resonant
structures.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.020
Things are getting interesting, and by interesting,
I mean--what?

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.160
Resonance occurs when electrons are distributed
around the molecule

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.190
in a way that makes it impossible to draw
with a single Lewis structure.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.630
It's a limitation of our tools to represent
this beauty and complexity of reality.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.950
In a resonance structure, the real world structure
of a molecule is essentially

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.660
an average of all the possible structures
that we can draw.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.880
The simplest aromatic hydrocarbon (and one
of the most common) is benzene (C6H6).

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.520
It's the pungent compound that gives gasoline
its strong sweet smell.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.350
It contains 3 double bonds, so that each carbon
has a total of 4 bonds.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.460
We normally write this and other organic structures without the hydrogens in order to simplify things,

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.960
and we often don't even write the c's for
the carbons.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.820
Every corner is assumed to be a carbon atom,
and since we know carbon needs four bonds,

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.540
it's easy to figure out where the hydrogens
belong even when they are not written.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.620
Here's the thing though.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.500
Those double bonds could just as easily be in these positions and they are in those positions -- sort of.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.660
Remember there are two types of bonds in double
bonds.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.960
There's those sigma bonds that happen linearly,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.740
and then there's those p-orbitals that stick
up above and below the plane of the molecule.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.079
Those p-orbitals in an aromatic compound all
merge together in a ring

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.140
that stretches above and below the whole molecule.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.760
It's a distribution of electrons that's like a donut on top of and below a molecule-it's extremely stable.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.100
Overall, the bonds are in both places so the
actual structure is essentially an average

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.280
of the two draw-able Lewis structures.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.340
That's resonance, it's reality poking us in
the nose and saying,

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.100
"oh you thought you were so clever with your Lewis structures, but in this situation, they are useless."

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.440
To show that the double bonds aren't in any specific place, we often just show the structure with a circle in the middle

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.600
signifying that the double bonds are averaged
in a ring throughout the benzene group.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.170
Technically the number of bonds between each
pair of carbons is defined as 1.5.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.570
It's not a double bond, it's a one-and-a-half
bond.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.000
Now aromatics can have all sorts of substituents
as well,

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.790
and the naming system is pretty much the same
as with other cyclics.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.630
Another example: So this is a benzene with
two methyl groups on it.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.040
As always, we number the rings so that the
branches have the smallest possible numbers.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.410
In this case, if one of the methyl is in the
1 position, the other is in position 2.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.010
Note that the numbering can also be done like
this,

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.980
but it doesn't matter as long as the branches
are at the lowest possible numbers.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.800
That makes this molecule 1, 2-dimethylbenzene.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.840
Now if you swap the methyls out for a couple
of other slightly more complicated groups,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.520
then you get acetylsalicylic acid, or aspirin.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.500
Aromatic rings can be used the other way around
too, as substituents on dihydrocarbons.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.790
Consider this molecule, a hexane with a benzene
ring attached to carbon number 2.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:45.430
When benzene is used as an attachment, we
call it a phenyl group, so this is 2-phenylhexane.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.490
Or 2-phenylhexane. [Different pronunciation]
It doesn't matter.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.070
What's important is that it is not a benzyl
group. Why?

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:57.020
Well, it was English genius Michael Faraday who first isolated benzene in 1825 from the gas used in lamps.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.700
In honor of this, his French contemporary chemist Auguste Laurent started calling the derivatives of benzene "phene,"

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.660
from the Greek "I illiminate." It's a lovely
gesture, very sweet, but, like, seriously?

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.540
But just to make sure you're, like, good and
solidly confused, benzyl groups do exist.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.120
They're a phenyl group joined by a methyl
group instead of just directly.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.010
So now that we know where the word "phenyl"
comes from,

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.470
I bet you're just salivating with curiosity, wanting to know where "benzene" comes from, because,

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.580
like, your desire to know things is stronger
than any of your other desires, right?

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.380
Yeah, I thought so.
So here's how it happened.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.620
Back in the 1400s when the spice trade drove
the majority of the global economy,

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.230
Arabic traders sold European traders a resin
used in perfumes and medicine that they called

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.340
"luban jawi" or "incense of Java."

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.360
Of course, it didn't come from Java, it came
from Sumatra,

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.060
but the world was a big and complicated place so we can't really blame them for being a little bit confused.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:54.300
The "lu" was mistaken by the Italians for the definite article "la", and so it was dropped, making it "banjawa,"

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.040
and then the French called it "banjoin," and eventually the German and English made it "benzoin."

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.790
This is also, by the way, the same root as
the name Bon Jovi (it's not...).

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.720
When we started doing some chemistry, we found
that most of benzoin was composed of an acid,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.370
which chemists named benzoic acid, or acid
of benzoin.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:17.560
Then, a little chemistry knocked the acid off, creating what was clearly an alkene, so they named it benzene,

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.900
because it was an alkene that was from the
benzoin resin.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.110
History is hiding everywhere!
And so is chemistry.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:29.199
Now benzoic acid is one of literally infinite
possible benzene-based compounds.

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.389
There's naphthalene, the main ingredient in
mothballs.

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:33.490
It's basically two benzene rings stuck together.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.180
And there's anthracene, with three benzenes, which is probably the dye that's making your blue jeans blue.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.040
And it can get crazy complicated all the way
up to humic acid, a component of soil.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.420
Now you might be wondering how something so complicated as that could ever even come into being.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.860
Like any organic compound, aromatics can undergo tons of reactions that produce all sorts of molecules.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.440
By far the simplest and most common are substitution reactions in which one substituent is substituted for another.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.420
Like one of the hydrogen atoms on a benzene
might be changed to a propyl group,

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.740
or that a halogen might come in and replace
that propyl group with a bromine.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:08.580
These changes alter the compound, of course, but it may not be that major a change, like changing your shoes.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.580
(Unless you put on some really weird shoes.)

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:16.040
Another fairly common reaction of aromatic hydrocarbons is coupling, the joining of two aromatic structures,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.110
and it basically works the same as a substitution
reaction.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.449
The only difference is that the new substituent
is a another aromatic structure

00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:24.490
and it typically requires some kind of catalyst.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.669
A final common reaction of aromatics is hydrogenation,
which we talked about a little last week,

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:30.990
the addition of hydrogen atoms to remove double
bonds.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:35.279
Now of course getting rid of even a single double bond in a phenyl group always destroys the resonance,

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:38.729
and thus it is no longer an aromatic compound
after hydrogenation.

00:08:38.729 --> 00:08:41.459
Now obviously we haven't covered all the possibilities
here,

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:46.540
but you can already see that organic molecules have the potential to become extremely large and complex,

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:51.580
integrating straight chains, cyclic structures,
and aromatic groups in the same molecule.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:58.040
This literally infinite variety is what makes organic compounds the basis for the infinite variety of life on Earth.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.820
So we'll leave you to jeans and basil pesto and aspirin now to appreciate them on a whole new level

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.460
that simply was not possible just ten minutes ago.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.920
Meanwhile, thank you for watching this episode
of Crash Course Chemistry.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.540
If you paid attention, you learned about the
structure of cyclic organic compounds

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.740
and how to name them and their substituents.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.800
You also learned what an aromatic compound
is, what resonance is,

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.509
and how to name aromatics and their substituents.

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:25.819
And finally, you learned a few common reactions
and uses for aromatic compounds.
