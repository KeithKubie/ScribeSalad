00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Let's see if we can find out how much x + 7 ... 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.780
 let me write it a little more clearly: 

00:00:05.788 --> 00:00:09.485
 (x + 7) 2. 

00:00:09.485 --> 00:00:11.240
 I also recommend that you pause the video 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.220
 and solve it yourself. 

00:00:13.223 --> 00:00:15.295
 Okay, now let's solve it together. 

00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:16.494
 We just have to forget, 

00:00:16.494 --> 00:00:19.664
 that we are lifting the second full-second. 

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:26.200
 This is the same thing as (x + 7) (x + 7). 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.440
 I will write the second (x + 7) with a different color, 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.860
 which will be useful to us, 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.832
 when we begin to multiply. 

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:32.910
 When we see it written in this way, 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.312
 we can multiply it by the way, 

00:00:34.312 --> 00:00:36.559
 by which we multiply all two members. 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.258
 And I will do it first in the slow but more logical way, 

00:00:40.258 --> 00:00:43.143
 by applying the distribution property twice. 

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:45.000
 And maybe we will then think of some shorter ways 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.660
 or any formulas we can use, 

00:00:46.677 --> 00:00:49.420
 especially when we lift two-piece squares. 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.479
 Let's start by simply applying 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.103
 distribution property twice. 

00:00:52.103 --> 00:00:56.755
 Explain the brackets and multiply this yellow (x + 7) 

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:59.741
 on this purple (x + 7). 

00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:03.236
 We can multiply by x, this purple x, 

00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:07.395
 so it will be x ... let's write it with the same color. 

00:01:07.395 --> 00:01:14.375
 This will be purple x (x + 7), 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.000
 plus purple 7 in yellow (x + 7). 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.920
 And now we can uncover the brackets 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.389
 again and multiply. 

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:27.197
 We can take this purple x 

00:01:27.197 --> 00:01:29.393
 and multiply it by x and by 7. 

00:01:29.393 --> 00:01:33.050
 So x in x is x ^ 2. 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.072
 x 7 is 7x. 

00:01:37.072 --> 00:01:39.388
 And then we can do it again here. 

00:01:39.388 --> 00:01:43.900
 This 7 - let me write it in a different color, 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.134
 this 7 will be this 

00:01:46.134 --> 00:01:48.713
 plus another 7x 

00:01:48.713 --> 00:01:51.476
 and then 7 at 7 

00:01:51.476 --> 00:01:53.995
 will be 49. 

00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:55.243
 We're almost in the final rights. 

00:01:55.243 --> 00:01:56.578
 Then we can simplify it. 

00:01:56.578 --> 00:02:01.716
 This is x ^ 2 and then we can collect these two members in the middle. 

00:02:01.716 --> 00:02:06.533
 7h ... let's write it in orange, 

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:10.535
 7x plus 7x will be 14x. 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:21.620
 Plus 14x plus 49. 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.680
 And we're ready. 

00:02:22.686 --> 00:02:25.754
 The key question here is whether we see some regularity? 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.360
 Whether we see a model that we can summarize 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.740
 and who can help us lift two-piece squares 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.317
 faster in the future? 

00:02:32.317 --> 00:02:34.775
 When we first looked at the multiplication of two- 

00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:37.142
 we saw a formula like 

00:02:37.142 --> 00:02:41.652
 (x + a) (x + b) 

00:02:41.652 --> 00:02:45.248
 will be equal to x ^ 2 ... 

00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:46.120
 Let me write it this way: 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:56.100
 is equal to x2 + (a + b) x + b ^ 2. 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.813
 And if a and b are the same number, 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.700
 we can say that 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.360
 (x + a) (x + a) will be equal to x 2 ... 

00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.757
 And this is the case when we have 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.580
 coefficient one in front of the two hiccups. 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.560
 Now in this case a and b are both a. 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.524
 So this will be (a + a) x 

00:03:17.524 --> 00:03:20.916
 or we can just say plus 2ah. 

00:03:20.916 --> 00:03:22.604
 Let me know what I have just done. 

00:03:22.604 --> 00:03:23.714
 Instead of writing a + b, 

00:03:23.714 --> 00:03:27.452
 just expressed it as (a + a) on x. 

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:30.622
 And then plus a ^ 2, 

00:03:30.622 --> 00:03:31.881
 or it is the same thing as 

00:03:31.881 --> 00:03:39.160
 x 2 + 2ax + a ^ 2. 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.473
 This is the common formula for a two- 

00:03:42.473 --> 00:03:44.509
 raised square. 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.557
 Two-pointed, squared, the odds of both x are one. 

00:03:47.557 --> 00:03:49.751
 We see that this is exactly the same here. 

00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:53.733
 In this example we did, ours is 7. 

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:57.675
 So there we get x in a square ... let's surround it. 

00:03:57.675 --> 00:03:59.544
 We have this blue x 2, 

00:03:59.544 --> 00:04:01.352
 which corresponds to that there. 

00:04:01.352 --> 00:04:03.770
 And then 7 is ours, 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.732
 2ax ... 2 in 7 is 14x. 

00:04:07.732 --> 00:04:11.124
 Note that here we have 14x. 

00:04:11.124 --> 00:04:15.472
 This 14x corresponds to 2ax. 

00:04:15.472 --> 00:04:17.706
 Finally, if a is 7, 

00:04:17.706 --> 00:04:22.860
 and a square is 49. 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.540
 When you raise a two-piece square, 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.049
 a quick way to do it is to use this formula here. 

00:04:28.049 --> 00:04:29.653
 And we can quickly make another example, 

00:04:29.653 --> 00:04:32.153
 just to make sure we understand things. 

00:04:32.153 --> 00:04:34.226
 If I tell you, how much is minus ... 

00:04:34.226 --> 00:04:36.012
 will put a minus sign here, 

00:04:36.012 --> 00:04:37.577
 How many (x - 3)? 2? 

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:38.492
 I recommend that you pause the video 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.360
 and think about it. 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.520
 Think about how you will use this formula. 

00:04:43.855 --> 00:04:46.435
 In this case our a ... 

00:04:46.435 --> 00:04:47.268
 we have to be careful ... 

00:04:47.268 --> 00:04:49.706
 ours will be -3, 

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.982
 so this is ours here. 

00:04:51.982 --> 00:04:56.771
 This will be equal to x ^ 2. 

00:04:56.771 --> 00:04:59.787
 Now, 2ah, let me actually write it with the same colors, 

00:04:59.787 --> 00:05:00.864
 just to be fun. 

00:05:00.864 --> 00:05:02.834
 This will be x ^ 2. 

00:05:02.834 --> 00:05:05.516
 Now, how much is 2 x a x? 

00:05:05.516 --> 00:05:09.153
 a is -3, so that 2 is a-6. 

00:05:09.153 --> 00:05:11.064
 This will be -6x. 

00:05:11.064 --> 00:05:15.208
 So, -6x, this is 2 by -3 the coefficient. 

00:05:15.208 --> 00:05:16.691
 And then we have x. 

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:18.337
 And then plus a ^ 2. 

00:05:18.337 --> 00:05:19.962
 Ok if a is -3, 

00:05:19.962 --> 00:05:22.034
 how much is -3 at -3? 

00:05:22.034 --> 00:05:24.613
 This will be plus 9. 

00:05:24.613 --> 00:05:27.033
 And here, when we look at this formula, 

00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:28.373
 we can find very quickly 

00:05:28.373 --> 00:05:31.806
 how much is this two-piece raised in a square. 

00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:33.660
 And I recommend you do it again, 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.078
 revealing the braces and multiplying, 

00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:37.860
 to confirm that 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.158
 this really is equal to (x - 3) ^ 2.
