1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,400
Coach. I'm just going to go. Yeah, just
go do it. Ready? Yep. This is Radiolab.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,470
I'm Jad Abumrad, and I'm Robert Krulwich
with you today. Our topic is Zeus.

3
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:09,990
We're doing a little sort
of chronological thing,

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,700
tracing the line from past to present,

5
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:15,690
starting back at those old
nasty concrete enclosures,

6
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:17,610
which I'm sure you love
to visit as a little boy.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:19,500
Okay.

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,920
What do you mean? You know
you're a city boy, you, you,

9
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:24,560
you don't have much animals here. Oh,
there's nothing to do with New York.

10
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:27,260
What do you like?
Tennessee [inaudible] fine,

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,350
but when you talk about, you know,

12
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:34,340
enriching the lives of gorillas
as we did before the break.

13
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,770
It's a simple heartwarming story
cause gorillas and our out,

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:39,950
they have their vegetarians.

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,110
Rankling it gets a lot more complicated
when you switch to a Predator who likes

16
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,000
to pounce and chase and bite. Yes,

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,230
you're going to put those animals in a
cage and their whole being is organized

18
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:54,840
around killing things. Well,
what do you feed them? Mm,

19
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,050
I the question to a NPR
science reporter. Nell boys.

20
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,000
If we're talking like the big carnivores,

21
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,880
like the Tigers that would
normally be out in the wild.

22
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:05,900
Ripping other animals to shred.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. What are they?

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,740
They're eating mostly this,
uh, this is a little bag of,

24
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,870
um, uh, kibble. It's, it's
basically like a dog food. Yeah.

25
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,723
Check it out.

26
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,690
Well, this is for a meeting
animal. Oh, again, try one.

27
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,430
All right. Skinny.

28
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,730
Oh, that's like getting chalk.

29
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,960
This is what the predators
eat according to now. Really?

30
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,690
Why don't they just give them meat?
That's sort of what she wanted to know.

31
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,000
Testing the mini days
before heading to the zoo.

32
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:41,850
Testing them in the days
before heading to the zoo. No,

33
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,300
recently took a trip to the Toledo zoo.

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,793
Okay.

35
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,130
Oh, hi. I'm here to see Ann.

36
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:52,600
She wanted to know what it might look
like if a zoo actually gave the predators

37
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:56,200
what they want in this regard.
The Toledo zoo is pretty radical.

38
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,700
Once a year they have this event
they call the big feed, the big feed,

39
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,490
the big feed to be
opening. Thank, you know,

40
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,980
got there a day early just
to check things out. Okay.

41
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:09,350
So I duck behind the Rhino
House, go behind the scenes here.

42
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,300
I go in the back door.

43
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,350
And where I finally end up is this kind
of thing. Nondescript pillow kitchen.

44
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,170
This is the kitchen. We have a
freezer and refrigerator down here.

45
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,800
Don't think about a kitchen being at the
zoo, but there's a kitchen here. Yes,

46
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,330
yes, there. So I'm sorry, your name again?

47
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:26,750
Was Beverly scooting over screen
over? Yes. Beverly's going over.

48
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,570
And this kitchen is
actually the reason I came.

49
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,550
This is our freezer. You
can run about 10 below

50
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,310
the rat and we actually have
rats in about four sizes.

51
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:43,800
We have large jumbo monsters.

52
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,600
And then we have packs of
50 mice, packs of 25 mice.

53
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,790
And then these are the fuzzies.

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,670
These are probably about 10 days old.

55
00:02:56,671 --> 00:03:00,550
The fuzzies and the pinkies are pretty
much newborn. Here's the basic idea.

56
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,030
You want to get closer to what the
animals actually eat in the wild.

57
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,110
So you want to give them some sort of
whole animals pull as in like all the

58
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:12,370
first eyeballs whiskers. So, um,
what are things different today?

59
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:16,210
Because the big fetus
tomorrow hooves hooves. Yeah,

60
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,410
the Tigers are getting some calves and
that's not something that we give out

61
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,890
like all the time. Calves. Can we look
at it? Yeah. So they take me into the

62
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,640
freezer and in the
corner, just so the one,

63
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:33,641
the floor is this box and it's got a
black garbage bag kind of thing in it,

64
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:37,610
which we opened up, you know, like
looking right up at me. I happens to be,

65
00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:40,550
the head part is the baby
cab, but that's just the head,

66
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:46,370
the head. It was like a little
baby. We got it. Little eyelashes,

67
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,700
little ears. It's a baby
cow, you know? And I put,

68
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:54,470
oh baby cow. And then
I thought, oh my God,

69
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,730
tomorrow little children are going
gonna be watching this baby cow.

70
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,350
It'd be ripped apart by a giant wild cat.
They're wild animals. You know, they,

71
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:06,950
they live in a captive situation, but
they still have those wild instincts.

72
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,670
That's Beth stark. She's the one who
brought carcass feeding to the Toledo zoo.

73
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,740
The time we hear, oh,
carnivores are meat eaters,

74
00:04:12,741 --> 00:04:15,440
but really they're not just meat
eaters, they're flesh eaters.

75
00:04:15,441 --> 00:04:18,760
They eat other animals. And one of
the challenges there is is you know,

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,833
how do we,

77
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,100
how do we provide for the welfare of
the animals that while at the same time

78
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:26,930
providing for the needs of our visitors.

79
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,000
So it's about 10 o'clock in the
morning and the gates are open now.

80
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:36,550
So visitors are starting to
stream in about 15 minutes or so.

81
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,040
They're going to start the tiger feed.

82
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,320
The tiger feeding was the
first feeding of the day.

83
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,670
A big crowd was beginning to gather.
Right now the tigers aren't in the pen.

84
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,320
How many people? Oh, like maybe
150 people. A lot of little kids.

85
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,380
So we brought the boy down Ben pumps
since my wife told me about it,

86
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:54,990
so he made sure we got
her early to check us out.

87
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,520
The carcasses were already out.

88
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,140
The zookeeper comes out with her
microphone and like sort of gives a little

89
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,340
[inaudible] and Richmond
program description of
carcass feeding sures that we

90
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:06,200
meet, why they do it,

91
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,170
all the animals behavioral needs as
well as their psychological needs.

92
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,830
And nobody at this point is listening
to the interpretive discussion of this

93
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,790
because as she's doing this,
I think I heard a door,

94
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,450
they let the tigers into the pen.
Oh look, here come the Tigers.

95
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,420
Watch brand. Look, the
big ones coming down.

96
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,420
One of the tires just like streaks
across the pan and grabs the car.

97
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,020
It's like, you know,

98
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:39,021
it starts like immediately playing with
it and I have never seen in all my years

99
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:42,490
of Zulu going, I have never
seen a tiger move that fast.

100
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,070
Like at 1.1 of the Tigers was like
carrying one around by the ear.

101
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,230
You could see like the little cafes and
it was dragging it around and what were

102
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:54,540
people doing? Were they
cheering? Were they crying?

103
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,430
There was nobody there that
seemed to be disturbed. It really,

104
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,580
although here was a
conversation that I heard many,

105
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:05,690
many times the children
would say, what is that?

106
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:10,190
What is he eating? And the parent would
say, I put a baby cow hates a baby cow.

107
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,700
And the kid would say,
why is he doing it, honey?

108
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,110
The Tigers have to, well, that's
what he eats, the food that they eat,

109
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,040
and the child said, well,
I don't need cow. Yeah,

110
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,690
you do. And the parent would say,
what? Of course you eat cow at home,

111
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,800
hamburgers, hamburger. What do you
think a hamburger is out of cows?

112
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,820
And they would just be this
shocked look on the kid.

113
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,210
And I must've heard that conversation
like five times. It's food hunting.

114
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,060
No, it's food.

115
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,470
Wow. That's like a birds and the bees
kind of moment. Yeah, it really was.

116
00:06:50,471 --> 00:06:53,750
People are just fascinated by it.
They appreciate being so close.

117
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,610
I see them back there. Right?

118
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,120
They'll say, Oh guy, that's really gross.

119
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:01,700
But then moving closer for a better view.

120
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,250
What Beth stark was telling me is that,

121
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:08,220
you know the whole time that they've been
doing this carcass feeding program and

122
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,730
they would interview people
afterwards and ask them questions.

123
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,250
We did survey people. How did
you feel? What did you think?

124
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:15,350
And found that more
than, and what she found,

125
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:20,351
98% of them is that the public is pretty
much uniformly very positive and what

126
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,100
they saw. Enthusiastic. One of the
questions we put on the survey is,

127
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:27,950
do you want to see more of this in
which animals would you like to see?

128
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,280
And so what did people
say just about everybody.

129
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:35,720
From what I can remember circled every
animal we put every just about every

130
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,200
animal, every animal, you know, like,
you know, do you wanna see dead rabbits?

131
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:41,570
Do you want to see dead rats?
Do you want to see dead calves?

132
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:42,800
Do you want to see dead deers?

133
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,910
And do you want them to see them fed to
polar bears, tigers, wolves, you know,

134
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:50,270
like a Chinese menu, you know, like, pick
your prey animal, pick your predator.

135
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,850
Do you want to see that? And they're
like, yes, yes. We want to see this.

136
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,890
The only complaints where people didn't
want rabbits fed at Easter and around

137
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:59,560
Easter, you know,

138
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,010
parents complaining or worrying that
their kid was thinking that the eastern

139
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:05,090
bunny was being eaten.

140
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,660
It just shows you how,

141
00:08:06,661 --> 00:08:11,661
like what the animals eat at the zoo is
fraught with sort of human emotions and

142
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,740
ideas about right and wrong.
Here's another example. Okay?

143
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,420
So when I was at the tiger pen,

144
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,850
there was this woman who came
up and was very interested.

145
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:24,870
She didn't seem turned off by the idea
that they were eating a dead calf. Right?

146
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,710
Yeah. But then she got this very
strange look on her face and she said,

147
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,000
I hope that was dead. And I said,
well, does it does it manner? I mean,

148
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:36,000
because at some point it died, you know,

149
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,780
does it matter whether it died at the
hands of a human or the hands of a tiger?

150
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,970
And it was late in the
afternoon and I'm ready to go.

151
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:44,490
So I turn off my tape recorder
and just at that second,

152
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,570
even though she's just expressed sort
of relief that the calf was dead when it

153
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:49,620
was put in the tiger's pen,

154
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,720
she starts to tell this story that was
so diametrically opposed to what she had

155
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,830
just expressed that I just had to turn
my tape recorder back on and say like,

156
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:01,410
wait a minute. Wait, can you
start at the whole beginning?

157
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:03,310
So what was happening? What happened? Um,

158
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,600
a squirrel health through that
layers on the snow leopards cage.

159
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,840
She and her daughter had been
hanging out by the snow leopards pin.

160
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,360
There's this sort of net
kind of above the pen.

161
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,690
And there was this squirrel that had
been walking on the net and it fell down.

162
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,530
Cereal is here, lay down
into the snow lepers pants.

163
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,520
And her daughter described the
story to me where the snow leopard,

164
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:28,650
who'd just been like kind of
hanging out kind of board,

165
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,970
immediately began to stop.

166
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:34,470
The squirrel was pouncing and the
squirrel like started trying to get away.

167
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,690
Her mother said it was like
the standard dot. Oh yes.

168
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,380
Like the snow leopard was matching all
of the moves of the score on c pilot a

169
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,720
move for me. And like the
audience was kind of transfixed.

170
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:43,680
Excellent.

171
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,550
Her daughter like could not watt head
when she thought the Squirrel was coming

172
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:50,340
down. Yeah. Yeah. She took off.
Her daughter couldn't watch,

173
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:54,360
was hiding her face. And in the end the
squirrel escaped. The Squirrel got away.

174
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:58,140
He was smarter. And I said to
the girl, well, how did you feel?

175
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:02,940
Were you rooting for the Leopard or
the Squirrel? Which one? And she said,

176
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:08,910
laughing. I was rooting for the
snow leopard. Huh. And I said,

177
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,210
but you didn't want to see
it eat the squirrel and you,

178
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,790
you didn't want to see
that. And she said, well,

179
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,750
I still want to fit the snow leopard
because I didn't want to see it,

180
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:23,870
but I still wanted to see it
because it is cool but nature.

181
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,920
Right. Yeah, the wild.

182
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,100
I think that that the reason they felt
comfortable watching that and telling me

183
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,900
about it was because it seemed like a,

184
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,560
an episode that was not between
the animals in the human.

185
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,700
It was between the animals.

186
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,890
What about you? If you
were that little girl,

187
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,280
how would you watch that whole scene when
you watch it kind of gleefully or more

188
00:10:51,341 --> 00:10:52,140
sheepishly.

189
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,500
You just watch. It's just
happening in front of you. I mean,

190
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,090
that has nothing to do with you.

191
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,650
It's funny, you know,

192
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,830
sh she never mentioned the possibility
of feeding live animals to um,

193
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,610
a predator. By the way, Nell Boys' is
a science reporter for NPR. Thank you.

194
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:12,550
Now, not those frozen
rat sickle things, but,

195
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,300
but something that scurry
then you can, yeah.

196
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,690
Live feeding is a line which
Americans use will not cross.

197
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,770
The only places that do feed out live
animals as far as we could find are in

198
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:27,030
China. Lucky for us.
Yeah. I live in Beijing.

199
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:31,470
That's where reporter Jocelyn Ford lifts
just over an hours bus ride outside of

200
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:35,190
Beijing. We ask Jocelyn to go visit
one of these live feeding parks.

201
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:38,250
That's what they're called. Live
feeding bark. You just get on a bus.

202
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,360
They'd drive you right into the lines
then, and they'll even sell you chicken.

203
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,400
The chickens are about $4 each and the
tour people sell them right there on the

204
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:49,110
bus riding the bus.

205
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,110
They don't have the lion's den
and one of the people on the bus,

206
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:02,830
one of the tourists decided often
don't care. I'm going to buy a chicken.

207
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,580
I'm going to feed the lion and
I can get the Allen County jail.

208
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,450
That side of the bus,

209
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,850
the guy who bought the chicken,
he would kick it up, rested again.

210
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,363
Here come the lion,

211
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,480
and soon we had four or five lions sitting
right under our window looking at us.

212
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,620
You're circling us. Dionysus

213
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,030
looks very intense. I tell you,

214
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:46,360
they had the most intense look
I have ever seen him anywhere.

215
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:50,830
I mean they have these very cold
amber eyes, angry, hungry eyes.

216
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,200
Whoa. He's looks like he's ready to pounce

217
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,710
and the guy with the chicken
just opened the window,

218
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,070
drop the chicken out

219
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,230
second that lion grab the chicken and just

220
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,830
[inaudible]. It helped me smell it.

221
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:20,660
Then I noticed that his
legs were still quivering.

222
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,310
Now it's working away at it
just sort of lipping it to bits

223
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,670
that say a pile of feathers.

224
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,820
Did it tell you what's your
house? You, what's on your base?

225
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,010
I asked a grandmother who was on the bus,

226
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,240
she was with something like a five year
old and I asked her if she thought this

227
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,300
was a healthy thing to have this hurt her,

228
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:50,880
her grandson watching this cruel event

229
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,920
and she said, hey, it'll
make him a braver guy

230
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,230
if you don't eat them
first they're going to use.

231
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,570
And she was just very matter
of fact about it, that

232
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,580
one woman said, we should
teach our kids to love animals.

233
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,610
But at the same time, if you know the
bigger animal eats the smaller animal,

234
00:14:17,611 --> 00:14:19,230
that's the way the world works.

235
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:22,490
So you should understand this survival
of the fittest, just your Darwin,

236
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,220
Darwin [inaudible] and you should
also understand where you fit into it.

237
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,810
We'll get to the army. If you're weak and
you can't run fast escape or whatever,

238
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,040
you'll become somebody dinner.
And that's the lesson of life

239
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,180
I think. I think in the
United States that we've,

240
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,260
we're often so far removed from
the ugly part of the food we eat.

241
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,680
We just get squeamish when we see
it. Whereas especially the, the,

242
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,010
the rural people in China, you know,

243
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,250
they deal with life and death of
animals around them all the time.

244
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,490
And I think we're just closing our
eyes to it. I, having said that, I,

245
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:03,830
I mean personally I feel that it does
make for a more humane society when you do

246
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:07,790
feel sorry or compassionate
about the animals around you.

247
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,870
And there was no concern
at the safari park here.

248
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,350
Nothing of that sort. It was
all about funding. Dan's.

249
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:22,370
Okay. So at the end of the best ride,
they dropped you off. I got a little,

250
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:27,950
little circus-like place and they had
a little fake shooting gallery with all

251
00:15:28,231 --> 00:15:29,700
sorts of repeating music.

252
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,150
And I went, I went and looked under
this dirty old tent over some,

253
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,210
some metal rods,

254
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,500
and there were rows of cages and tigers
pacing back and forth and yelling.

255
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,820
Have you ever heard of a tiger? Yowell?

256
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,450
Yeah. Yeah.

257
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,070
Wow. Yeah,

258
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,660
the cage, just the length of his body
turned around, but that's about it.

259
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,640
[inaudible] okay,

260
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,830
thanks to reporter Justin Ford.
