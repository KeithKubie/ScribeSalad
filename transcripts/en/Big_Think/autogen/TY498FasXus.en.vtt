give me the answer that I think I'm
 

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.730
give me the answer that I think I'm
gonna find from the research I've done

talking to you in this pilot speak which
 

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.780
talking to you in this pilot speak which
is cursory and mysterious until you

is cursory and mysterious until you
 

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:19.200
is cursory and mysterious until you
learn all these things are happening at

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:19.210
learn all these things are happening at
 

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:21.330
learn all these things are happening at
once and the grounds coming up at you

and you're moving in at 125 miles an
 

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.620
and you're moving in at 125 miles an
hour so it's happening fast right and

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:27.630
hour so it's happening fast right and
 

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.720
hour so it's happening fast right and
the result is that you can't think about

the result is that you can't think about
 

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:34.710
the result is that you can't think about
anything else it erases the rest of the

both of these things appeal to me
 

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:14.940
both of these things appeal to me
because they forced me to focus on them

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:14.950
because they forced me to focus on them
 

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:17.340
