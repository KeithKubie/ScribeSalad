00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
appears that way
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.170
appears that way
because of a statistical fallacy called

books and paradox go with me on this for

books and paradox go with me on this for
a second let's imagine that there is no

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
a second let's imagine that there is no
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.219
a second let's imagine that there is no
connection whatsoever of all of the

connection whatsoever of all of the
possible stories in the world if you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630
possible stories in the world if you
 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.420
possible stories in the world if you
plotted them on this as to how good a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430
plotted them on this as to how good a
 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.249
plotted them on this as to how good a
film they make and how good a book they

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
film they make and how good a book they
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.539
film they make and how good a book they
make actually there's no connection

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
make actually there's no connection
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.160
make actually there's no connection
whatsoever that you just got this this

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170
whatsoever that you just got this this
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.880
whatsoever that you just got this this
kind of mishmash of dots right like this

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890
kind of mishmash of dots right like this
 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.340
kind of mishmash of dots right like this
now the slight problem here when you're

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
now the slight problem here when you're
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.640
now the slight problem here when you're
looking at the data or you're thinking

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650
looking at the data or you're thinking
 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.460
looking at the data or you're thinking
about films that that sort of answer

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
about films that that sort of answer
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.830
about films that that sort of answer
this question is that you are only

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
this question is that you are only
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.090
this question is that you are only
considering a very small subsection of

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100
considering a very small subsection of
 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.249
considering a very small subsection of
all of the possible stories right so

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
all of the possible stories right so
 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.789
all of the possible stories right so
you're only thinking about films that

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
you're only thinking about films that
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.859
you're only thinking about films that
were good so we're kind of up here so

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
were good so we're kind of up here so
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.810
were good so we're kind of up here so
this is where all the good films are or

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
this is where all the good films are or
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.819
this is where all the good films are or
you're only thinking about good books

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829
you're only thinking about good books
 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.859
you're only thinking about good books
right so books they're kind of down here

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869
right so books they're kind of down here
 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.870
right so books they're kind of down here
so generally speaking the only ones that

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880
so generally speaking the only ones that
 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.969
so generally speaking the only ones that
are sort of in your consciousness are

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979
are sort of in your consciousness are
 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.550
are sort of in your consciousness are
going to be above this line here all of

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560
going to be above this line here all of
 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.800
going to be above this line here all of
these dots here so either very good

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
these dots here so either very good
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.369
these dots here so either very good
films or very good books why Hanna why

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379
films or very good books why Hanna why
 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.660
films or very good books why Hanna why
aren't we considering what's below that

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670
aren't we considering what's below that
 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.910
aren't we considering what's below that
well because either a book

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
well because either a book
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.190
well because either a book
is so bad that it never gets made into a

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200
is so bad that it never gets made into a
 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.670
is so bad that it never gets made into a
film for a film that's been made from a

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680
film for a film that's been made from a
 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.610
film for a film that's been made from a
book is so bad that you never heard of

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620
book is so bad that you never heard of
 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.250
book is so bad that you never heard of
it you know like Count of Monte Cristo

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260
it you know like Count of Monte Cristo
 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.589
it you know like Count of Monte Cristo
and I've seen that film no it was

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599
and I've seen that film no it was
 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.770
and I've seen that film no it was
terrible absolutely atrocious so it just

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780
terrible absolutely atrocious so it just
 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.090
terrible absolutely atrocious so it just
isn't really in your consciousness

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100
isn't really in your consciousness
 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.080
isn't really in your consciousness
because the film is kind of so is so bad

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090
because the film is kind of so is so bad
 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.210
because the film is kind of so is so bad
we don't know about bad books we don't

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220
we don't know about bad books we don't
 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.590
we don't know about bad books we don't
know about all they don't even get made

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600
know about all they don't even get made
 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.729
know about all they don't even get made
into a film so we don't know that

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739
into a film so we don't know that
 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.520
into a film so we don't know that
exactly right exactly right but the end

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530
exactly right exactly right but the end
 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.460
exactly right exactly right but the end
result is that you're only ever

this on this you've got films like maybe

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920
this on this you've got films like maybe

Harry Potter is down here Harry Potter

kind of thing but you're not considering

kind of thing but you're not considering
 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.500
kind of thing but you're not considering
any of this stuff so if you just redraw

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510
any of this stuff so if you just redraw
 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.509
any of this stuff so if you just redraw

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.170
of film of all of the books that are
really good it's kind of going to be

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180
really good it's kind of going to be
 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.729
really good it's kind of going to be
around about here it's like a mediocre

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739
around about here it's like a mediocre
 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.979
around about here it's like a mediocre
film whereas if you're over here these

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989
film whereas if you're over here these
 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.440
film whereas if you're over here these
kind of mediocre books and you look at

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450
kind of mediocre books and you look at
 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.599
kind of mediocre books and you look at
the average goodness of the film that

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609
the average goodness of the film that
 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.009
the average goodness of the film that
they make actually they make pretty good

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019
they make actually they make pretty good
 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.560
they make actually they make pretty good
films right so it almost looks as though

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570
films right so it almost looks as though
 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.710
films right so it almost looks as though
the goodness of the book is negatively

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720
the goodness of the book is negatively
 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.050
the goodness of the book is negatively
related to the goodness of the film as

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060
related to the goodness of the film as
 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.380
related to the goodness of the film as
though if your Hollywood exec you want

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390
though if your Hollywood exec you want
 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.430
though if your Hollywood exec you want
to try and find books down here not very

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440
to try and find books down here not very
 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.319
to try and find books down here not very
good books basically to make those ones

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329
good books basically to make those ones
 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.990
good books basically to make those ones
into films because statistically they'll

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000
into films because statistically they'll
 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.090
into films because statistically they'll
make you're better films sort of doesn't

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100
make you're better films sort of doesn't
 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.890
make you're better films sort of doesn't
make any sense and it's because you're

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900
make any sense and it's because you're
 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.599
make any sense and it's because you're
only considering a really small

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609
only considering a really small
 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.819
only considering a really small
subsection of the population so this

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829
subsection of the population so this
 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.590
subsection of the population so this
here is Burton's paradox it was

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600
here is Burton's paradox it was
 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.030
here is Burton's paradox it was
discovered by a guy called Joseph

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040
discovered by a guy called Joseph
 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.309
discovered by a guy called Joseph
Bergson after he was working in

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319
Bergson after he was working in
 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.080
Bergson after he was working in
hospitals and trying to collect data on

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090
hospitals and trying to collect data on
 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.550
hospitals and trying to collect data on
the different diseases that people had

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560
the different diseases that people had
 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.039
the different diseases that people had
and found these negative correlations

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049
and found these negative correlations
 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.680
and found these negative correlations
between things that you wouldn't you

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690
between things that you wouldn't you
 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.330
between things that you wouldn't you
know you wouldn't necessarily expect so

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340
know you wouldn't necessarily expect so
 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.740
know you wouldn't necessarily expect so
let's say that you had diabetes

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750
let's say that you had diabetes
 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.130
let's say that you had diabetes
and severe ingrown toenails for instance

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140
and severe ingrown toenails for instance
 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.100
and severe ingrown toenails for instance
he went into hospital and there's kind

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110
he went into hospital and there's kind
 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.140
he went into hospital and there's kind
of negative correlation right so here

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150
of negative correlation right so here
 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.810
of negative correlation right so here
are your toenails and here are your

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820
are your toenails and here are your
 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.970
are your toenails and here are your
diabetes so this is kind of like how

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980
diabetes so this is kind of like how
 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.070
diabetes so this is kind of like how
extreme your cases are so more extreme

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080
extreme your cases are so more extreme
 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.990
extreme your cases are so more extreme
cases aren't gonna be out here so there

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000
cases aren't gonna be out here so there
 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.520
cases aren't gonna be out here so there
were some people who had bad cases of

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530
were some people who had bad cases of
 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.830
were some people who had bad cases of
both but it looked as though if you had

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840
both but it looked as though if you had
 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.010
both but it looked as though if you had
diabetes you were less likely to have

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020
diabetes you were less likely to have
 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.380
diabetes you were less likely to have
bad toenails people with most diabetes

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390
bad toenails people with most diabetes
 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.450
bad toenails people with most diabetes
the worst diabetes tended to have the

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460
the worst diabetes tended to have the
 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.520
the worst diabetes tended to have the
best toenails and likewise people with

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530
best toenails and likewise people with
 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.820
best toenails and likewise people with
the worst toenails down here tended to

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830
the worst toenails down here tended to
 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.730
the worst toenails down here tended to
have you know alright diabetes but it's

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740
have you know alright diabetes but it's
 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.740
have you know alright diabetes but it's
this negative correlation but actually

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750
this negative correlation but actually
 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.990
this negative correlation but actually
isn't really there because of course in

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000
isn't really there because of course in
 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.610
isn't really there because of course in
the whole population actually there are

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620
the whole population actually there are
 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.230
the whole population actually there are
all those people down here you have kind

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240
all those people down here you have kind
 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.170
all those people down here you have kind
of not very bad toenails or not very bad

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180
of not very bad toenails or not very bad
 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.030
of not very bad toenails or not very bad
diabetes but they're just not the ones

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040
diabetes but they're just not the ones
 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.190
diabetes but they're just not the ones
who are in hospital so if you're only

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200
who are in hospital so if you're only
 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.420
who are in hospital so if you're only
considering the people who are in

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430
considering the people who are in
 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.400
considering the people who are in
hospital who are there because they have

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410
hospital who are there because they have
 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.550
hospital who are there because they have
only the bad toenails or bad diabetes

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560
only the bad toenails or bad diabetes
 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.980
only the bad toenails or bad diabetes
you end up getting this sort of spurious

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990
you end up getting this sort of spurious
 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.900
you end up getting this sort of spurious
correlation between things that isn't

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910
correlation between things that isn't
 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.880
correlation between things that isn't
really there my favorite example of this

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890
really there my favorite example of this
 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.610
really there my favorite example of this
is in Jordan and the Berg's book how not

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620
is in Jordan and the Berg's book how not
 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.740
is in Jordan and the Berg's book how not
to be wrong and he talks about there's

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750
to be wrong and he talks about there's
 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.180
to be wrong and he talks about there's
that sort of old adage that very

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190
that sort of old adage that very
 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.580
that sort of old adage that very
beautiful people are assholes and that's

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590
beautiful people are assholes and that's
 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.230
beautiful people are assholes and that's
another example of Burke's as paradox

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240
another example of Burke's as paradox
 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.580
another example of Burke's as paradox
but you kind of take this one step

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590
but you kind of take this one step
 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.040
but you kind of take this one step
further because on that example here so

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050
further because on that example here so
 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.320
further because on that example here so
this is sort of good-looking so the

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330
this is sort of good-looking so the
 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.580
this is sort of good-looking so the
prettiest people going to be over here

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590
prettiest people going to be over here
 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.620
prettiest people going to be over here
and this here is niceness

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630
and this here is niceness
 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.420
and this here is niceness
so the nicest people are gonna be up

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430
so the nicest people are gonna be up
 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.130
so the nicest people are gonna be up
here and you've got sort of again you've

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140
here and you've got sort of again you've
 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.630
here and you've got sort of again you've
got all of this data like this in the

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640
got all of this data like this in the
 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.100
got all of this data like this in the
real population actually there's no

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110
real population actually there's no
 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.080
real population actually there's no
connection between them you get nice

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090
connection between them you get nice
 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.210
connection between them you get nice
people all across the spectrum and you

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220
people all across the spectrum and you
 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.860
people all across the spectrum and you
get good-looking people all across the

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870
get good-looking people all across the
 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.050
get good-looking people all across the
spectrum of niceness the thing is is

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060
spectrum of niceness the thing is is
 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.469
spectrum of niceness the thing is is
that if you are dating people the people

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479
that if you are dating people the people
 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:11.850
that if you are dating people the people
that you're considering there's sort of

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860
that you're considering there's sort of
 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.710
that you're considering there's sort of
a level of good-looking this that you

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720
a level of good-looking this that you
 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.020
a level of good-looking this that you
you generally don't go below and there's

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030
you generally don't go below and there's
 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.670
you generally don't go below and there's
a level of niceness that you generally

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680
a level of niceness that you generally
 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.710
a level of niceness that you generally
don't go below so even though this is

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720
don't go below so even though this is
 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.020
don't go below so even though this is
the whole population when you're talking

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030
the whole population when you're talking
 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.480
the whole population when you're talking
about the people that you would date

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490
about the people that you would date
 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.890
about the people that you would date
there is this line here you're only

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900
there is this line here you're only
 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.200
there is this line here you're only
really considering the people to this

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210
really considering the people to this
 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.360
really considering the people to this
side of this line so it looks like

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370
side of this line so it looks like
 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.440
side of this line so it looks like
there's a negative

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450
there's a negative
 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.420
there's a negative
between niceness and good-looking girls

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430
between niceness and good-looking girls
 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.880
between niceness and good-looking girls
if you're talking about very very

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890
if you're talking about very very
 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.160
if you're talking about very very
good-looking people the range that they

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.170
good-looking people the range that they
 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.290
good-looking people the range that they
have in terms of niceness is kind of the

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300
have in terms of niceness is kind of the
 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.330
have in terms of niceness is kind of the
full spectrum but the average niceness

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340
full spectrum but the average niceness
 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.280
full spectrum but the average niceness
that they have is like somewhere in the

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290
that they have is like somewhere in the
 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.830
that they have is like somewhere in the
middle as in not very nice but meanwhile

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840
middle as in not very nice but meanwhile
 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.600

the ugliest people that you would

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610
the ugliest people that you would
 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.970
the ugliest people that you would
consider going out with are actually

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:50.980
consider going out with are actually
 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.710
consider going out with are actually
only the people at the very top of this

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720
only the people at the very top of this
 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.630
only the people at the very top of this
line - they're only the very nicest

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:54.640
line - they're only the very nicest
 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.760
line - they're only the very nicest
people so it looks like there's this

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770
people so it looks like there's this
 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.860
people so it looks like there's this
downward trend right so sort of the

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:58.870
downward trend right so sort of the
 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.020
downward trend right so sort of the
average here is up here and the average

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030
average here is up here and the average
 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:02.910
average here is up here and the average
down here is kind of somewhere about

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:02.920
down here is kind of somewhere about
 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.650
down here is kind of somewhere about
there so it looks like there's this

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:04.660
there so it looks like there's this
 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.320
there so it looks like there's this
downward trend and with this example in

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330
downward trend and with this example in
 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.620
downward trend and with this example in
particular if you also add to this that

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:10.630
particular if you also add to this that
 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.290
particular if you also add to this that
the very sort of most attractive people

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.300
the very sort of most attractive people
 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.570
the very sort of most attractive people
of all are gonna be up here in this

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580
of all are gonna be up here in this
 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.250
of all are gonna be up here in this
other triangle up here so the very

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:17.260
other triangle up here so the very
 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.950
other triangle up here so the very
nicest and most good-looking people are

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960
nicest and most good-looking people are
 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.360
nicest and most good-looking people are
actually gonna be in this triangle over

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.370
actually gonna be in this triangle over
 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.870
actually gonna be in this triangle over
here and probably they're not gonna want

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880
here and probably they're not gonna want
 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.790
here and probably they're not gonna want
to go out with you so these people are

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800
to go out with you so these people are
 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.920
to go out with you so these people are
off-limits to you anyway all you're left

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:28.930
off-limits to you anyway all you're left
 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.740
off-limits to you anyway all you're left
with is this very very narrow channel of

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:31.750
with is this very very narrow channel of
 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.140
with is this very very narrow channel of

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.150
people who you'd be willing today and
 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.600
people who you'd be willing today and
who'd be willing to date you and that is

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:36.610
who'd be willing to date you and that is
 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:39.300
who'd be willing to date you and that is
definitely a negative correlation or at

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.310
definitely a negative correlation or at
 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.520
definitely a negative correlation or at
least it looks like one so just to prove

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:41.530
least it looks like one so just to prove
 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.710
least it looks like one so just to prove
that there isn't this negative

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:43.720
that there isn't this negative
 

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.180
that there isn't this negative
correlation the sort of secret negative

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.190
correlation the sort of secret negative
 

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.790

all of the films that he could find
which were both made into a film and

which were both made into a film and
 

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.730
which were both made into a film and
were released as a novel so he got the

were released as a novel so he got the
 

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.440
were released as a novel so he got the
Metacritic score which kind of like a

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:04.450
Metacritic score which kind of like a
 

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.910

essentially and he also got the
 

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.770
essentially and he also got the
Goodreads score which is again similar

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:10.780
Goodreads score which is again similar
 

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.870
Goodreads score which is again similar
sort of thing a user-generated score so

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:12.880
sort of thing a user-generated score so
 

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.980
sort of thing a user-generated score so
you've got the goodness of the book

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:13.990
you've got the goodness of the book

it looks very heavily skewed which isn't

it looks very heavily skewed which isn't
 

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.350
it looks very heavily skewed which isn't
necessarily fair because scores on

about things the scores they arranged

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720
about things the scores they arranged
 

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.650
about things the scores they arranged
between noir and 5 whereas on Metacritic

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:31.660
between noir and 5 whereas on Metacritic
 

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.990
between noir and 5 whereas on Metacritic
they is a percentage between no.1 and

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000
they is a percentage between no.1 and
 

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.740
they is a percentage between no.1 and
100 and the thing is is that if you do

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:36.750
100 and the thing is is that if you do
 

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.050
100 and the thing is is that if you do
finish a book and then take the time to

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:40.060
finish a book and then take the time to
 

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.570
finish a book and then take the time to
review it you're probably going to have

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:42.580
review it you're probably going to have
 

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.730
review it you're probably going to have
enjoyed the book a little bit right if

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:44.740
enjoyed the book a little bit right if
 

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.110
enjoyed the book a little bit right if
it's a really rubbish book you just

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.120
it's a really rubbish book you just
 

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.730
it's a really rubbish book you just
would put it down before you got to that

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:47.740
would put it down before you got to that
 

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.579
would put it down before you got to that
stage so this graph here doesn't totally

00:08:50.579 --> 00:08:50.589
stage so this graph here doesn't totally
 

00:08:50.589 --> 00:08:52.710

represent the data very well instead

what you can do is you can use something

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760
what you can do is you can use something
 

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.120
what you can do is you can use something
called a z-score which is a little

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.130
called a z-score which is a little
 

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.190
called a z-score which is a little
statistical trick that gives you a score

00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200
statistical trick that gives you a score
 

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.260
statistical trick that gives you a score
of how good something is compared to all

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:01.270
of how good something is compared to all
 

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.910
of how good something is compared to all
of the other data and it kind of

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920
of the other data and it kind of
 

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.620
of the other data and it kind of
normalizes everything for you because

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:04.630
normalizes everything for you because
 

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.210
normalizes everything for you because
you're a slightly more accurate picture

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:06.220
you're a slightly more accurate picture
 

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.370
you're a slightly more accurate picture
of what's going on so this here and this

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:08.380
of what's going on so this here and this
 

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.050
of what's going on so this here and this
is the real data here you've got your

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:10.060
is the real data here you've got your
 

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.670
is the real data here you've got your
goodness of your book along the bottom

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680
goodness of your book along the bottom
 

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.920

and the goodness of your film along the
 

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.720
and the goodness of your film along the

looking you know people don't read bad

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:56.410
looking you know people don't read bad
 

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.190
looking you know people don't read bad
books but they do watch terrible films

00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200
books but they do watch terrible films
 

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.160
