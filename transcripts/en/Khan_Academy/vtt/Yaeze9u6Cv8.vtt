00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.490
Solve the equation, 5 over
x minus 1 is equal to

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.130
3 over x plus 3.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.930
And they give us two constraints
here. x can't be

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.410
negative 3 or 1.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.570
And that's because if x was
negative 3, this expression

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.100
right here, you'd be dividing
by 0, it'd be undefined.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.420
If x was 1, this expression
right here would be dividing

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.480
by 0 and it would
be undefined.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.520
So let's see what
we can do here.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.000
So let me just rewrite
it so we have some

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.010
space to work with.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.940
So 5 over x minus 1 is equal
to 3 over x plus 3.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.230
We're going to assume
these constraints

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.370
throughout this video.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.690
Now, I don't like having my x
terms in the denominator, so

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.330
let's see if we can get them
out of the denominator.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.670
Well, a good place to start, if
we don't want this x plus 3

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.930
in the denominator right here,
we can multiply both sides of

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.695
this equation by x plus 3.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.510
Anything you do to one side
you have to do the other.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.190
Now, by the same argument,
I don't like having

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.250
this x minus 1 here.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.330
So let's multiply both sides of
the equation by x minus 1.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.010
Now, when we do this, what's
going to happen?

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.310
Well, the whole point of
multiplying by x minus 1 is so

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.500
that that cancels
out with that.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.150
And the whole reason behind
multiplying by x plus 3 is so

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.010
that this cancels
out with this.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:31.410
So we end up with 5 times
x plus 3 is equal to 3

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.680
times x minus 1.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.600
And all we did is we multiplied
both sides of the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.260
equation by both denominators.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.940
Both sides of the equation by
x plus 3 times x minus 1.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.140
And this is where the whole
notion of cross multiplying

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.440
comes from.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.100
When we did that, it looks like
we just took 5 times x

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.460
plus 3 is equal to 3
times x minus 1.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.690
Which is a legitimate thing to
do, but it just comes from the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.000
idea of multiplying both sides
by both denominators,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.520
essentially in one step.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.420
But now this is a pretty

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.750
straightforward linear equation.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.300
We can just distribute the
numbers and get the x's on one

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.060
term-- on one side and just
solve for things.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.550
So let's see, we have
5 times x plus 3.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.500
That's the same thing as
5x plus 15 when you

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.780
distribute the 5.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.780
And that's going to be equal
to 3x minus 3 when you

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.300
distribute the 3.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.170
Now, let's get all the x's
on the left-hand side.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.080
So let's subtract 3x
from both sides.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.770
And we get 2x plus 15 is equal
to-- those cancel out-- is

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.710
equal to negative 3.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.840
And then we can subtract
15 from both sides.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.290
And we're left with 2x, this 2x,
is equal to-- negative 3

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.320
minus 15 is negative 18.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.005
Divide both sides by 2.

00:02:54.005 --> 00:02:57.700
Divide both sides of the
equation by 2, and we're left

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.680
with x is equal to negative 18
over 2, which is negative 9.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.390
We get x is equal
to negative 9.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.400
And, of course, we say well,
it's good it doesn't equal one

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.010
of these things.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.970
That would have messed
things up.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.600
And now let's test. Let's make
sure that x does not equal

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.660
negative 9 satisfies
this equation.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.010
Let's make sure it
satisfies it.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.410
So 5 over negative 9 minus 1
is equal to-- let's see, 5

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.840
over negative 9 minus
1 is negative 10.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.170
So it's equal to 5
over negative 10,

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.410
which is negative 1/2.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.550
That's where I substitute
it into the

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.370
left-hand side of the equation.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.160
Now, what happens when I
substitute it into the

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.410
right-hand side of
the equation?

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.540
3 over negative 9 plus 3 is
equal to 3 over negative 6,

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.610
which is equal to
negative 1/2.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.110
So the left-hand side does equal
the right-hand side when

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.620
x is equal to negative 9.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.400
And to some degree, they didn't
even have to write this

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.760
condition here, because the only
x for which this is true

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.070
is x is equal to negative 9.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.090
That's the only thing that you
can legitimately put in here

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.260
and this equality holding.
