00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Narrator] And here's my solution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I initialized the robot--my robot--using the function robot().

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I set the coordinates to be 30, 50, and pi/2.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I then apply the motion command, assign the result to my robot again

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
with minus pi/2 and 15.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I print the measurement values.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I move again, and I print the measurement values again,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and when I hit run,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.484
this is exactly what I get.
