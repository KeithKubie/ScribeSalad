00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319
alarm clock we're going to look at for a
 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.800
alarm clock we're going to look at for a
little while so it's got Zen alarms in

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810
little while so it's got Zen alarms in
 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.539

Zen okay that looks kind of cool all
right so we've got we've got a zen-like

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810
right so we've got we've got a zen-like
 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.520

picture here blue nice sort of simple UI

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530
picture here blue nice sort of simple UI
 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.190
picture here blue nice sort of simple UI
I will note that the it's not just your

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200
I will note that the it's not just your
 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.129
I will note that the it's not just your
video the the little moon icon down the

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139
video the the little moon icon down the
 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.479
video the the little moon icon down the
bottom yet it's a little bit fuzzy it's

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489
bottom yet it's a little bit fuzzy it's
 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.439
bottom yet it's a little bit fuzzy it's
a little bit fuzzy so I'm a little

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.449
a little bit fuzzy so I'm a little
 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.180
a little bit fuzzy so I'm a little
concerned that that's not set at the

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190
concerned that that's not set at the
 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.979
concerned that that's not set at the
appropriate resolution for my screens at

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989
appropriate resolution for my screens at
 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.110
appropriate resolution for my screens at
my eyes or does that look yeah it's

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120
my eyes or does that look yeah it's
 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.080
my eyes or does that look yeah it's
fuzzy for you too okay yeah yeah very

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090
fuzzy for you too okay yeah yeah very
 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.809
fuzzy for you too okay yeah yeah very
fuzzy not as fuzzy okay so we have a

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819
fuzzy not as fuzzy okay so we have a
 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.610
fuzzy not as fuzzy okay so we have a
menu item so I'm gonna hit that

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620
menu item so I'm gonna hit that
 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.729
menu item so I'm gonna hit that
so get alarm Pro go home so one of the

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739
so get alarm Pro go home so one of the
 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.409
so get alarm Pro go home so one of the
things that that you'll note here are

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419
things that that you'll note here are
 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.839
things that that you'll note here are
looking at these menu icons is that

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849
looking at these menu icons is that
 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.420
looking at these menu icons is that
they're sort of a mishmash so the Home

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430
they're sort of a mishmash so the Home
 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.839
they're sort of a mishmash so the Home
icon looks like it's something from go

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849
icon looks like it's something from go
 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.830
icon looks like it's something from go
ahead and say Froyo gingerbread I'm not

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840
ahead and say Froyo gingerbread I'm not
 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.210
ahead and say Froyo gingerbread I'm not
sure it's got the GREs effect but it's

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220
sure it's got the GREs effect but it's
 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.830
sure it's got the GREs effect but it's
it's not quite the the straight

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840
it's not quite the the straight
 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.140
it's not quite the the straight
monochrome of the other ones whereas the

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150
monochrome of the other ones whereas the
 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.029
monochrome of the other ones whereas the
others look like they're custom sort of

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039
others look like they're custom sort of
 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.550
others look like they're custom sort of
designed specifically so this and and

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560
designed specifically so this and and
 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.430
designed specifically so this and and
the alarm Pro icon is in full color 3d

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440
the alarm Pro icon is in full color 3d
 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.529
the alarm Pro icon is in full color 3d
so this illustrates a couple of bad

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539
so this illustrates a couple of bad
 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.140
so this illustrates a couple of bad
practices one is that you shouldn't be

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150
practices one is that you shouldn't be
 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.920
practices one is that you shouldn't be
using color for your menu icon icons and

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930
using color for your menu icon icons and
 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.110
using color for your menu icon icons and
the other thing is that there's a danger

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120
the other thing is that there's a danger
 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.010
the other thing is that there's a danger
here if you sort of use the built-in

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020
here if you sort of use the built-in
 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.659
here if you sort of use the built-in
icons for any of the particular versions

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669
icons for any of the particular versions
 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.459
icons for any of the particular versions
of the OS they're going to start to

00:04:42.459 --> 00:04:42.469
of the OS they're going to start to
 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:44.409
of the OS they're going to start to
mismatch so the ones you have which are

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419
mismatch so the ones you have which are
 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:45.580
mismatch so the ones you have which are
custom which are going to be Const

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590
custom which are going to be Const
 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.660
custom which are going to be Const
and the other ones are going to change

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670
and the other ones are going to change
 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.640
and the other ones are going to change
to see what I build them all and you

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650
to see what I build them all and you
 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.080
to see what I build them all and you
want them all to look the same and

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090
want them all to look the same and
 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.150
want them all to look the same and
consistent otherwise you get this kind

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160
consistent otherwise you get this kind
 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.670
consistent otherwise you get this kind
of weird effect here where it's like

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680
of weird effect here where it's like
 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.900
of weird effect here where it's like
well they all look kind of different

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910
well they all look kind of different
 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.370
well they all look kind of different
when I'm expecting them all to look the

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380
when I'm expecting them all to look the
 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.120
when I'm expecting them all to look the
same consistency yeah exactly and

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130
same consistency yeah exactly and
 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.070
same consistency yeah exactly and
actually you know that the Settings icon

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080
actually you know that the Settings icon
 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.840
actually you know that the Settings icon
which is down the bottom here there is a

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850
which is down the bottom here there is a
 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.660
which is down the bottom here there is a
standard icon to use for that so again I

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670
standard icon to use for that so again I
 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.140
standard icon to use for that so again I
probably use that if possible but a

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150
probably use that if possible but a
 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.030
probably use that if possible but a
wrench is a wrench is reasonable people

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040
wrench is a wrench is reasonable people
 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.220
wrench is a wrench is reasonable people
are going to know what that means if we

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230
are going to know what that means if we
 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.680
are going to know what that means if we
go into settings we have a Zen alarm

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690
go into settings we have a Zen alarm
 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.950
go into settings we have a Zen alarm
push the screen to continue as a general

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960
push the screen to continue as a general
 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.200
push the screen to continue as a general
set okay so we've got here kind of a

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210
set okay so we've got here kind of a
 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.100
set okay so we've got here kind of a
workflow wizard to-do list again the

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110
workflow wizard to-do list again the
 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.800
workflow wizard to-do list again the
text here is a little sorry I'm ruining

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810
text here is a little sorry I'm ruining
 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.910
text here is a little sorry I'm ruining
a focus yeah yes this approach seems to

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920
a focus yeah yes this approach seems to
 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.380
a focus yeah yes this approach seems to
be pretty popular these days when it's

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390
be pretty popular these days when it's
 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.880
be pretty popular these days when it's
the overlay translucent or transparent

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890
the overlay translucent or transparent
 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.440
the overlay translucent or transparent
instruction not you know screen to

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450
instruction not you know screen to
 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.380
instruction not you know screen to
illustrate how to use a particular app

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390
illustrate how to use a particular app
 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.290
illustrate how to use a particular app
what I usually found tricky is that the

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300
what I usually found tricky is that the
 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.200
what I usually found tricky is that the
alignments don't always work out well

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210
alignments don't always work out well
 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.850
alignments don't always work out well
hmm depend on different screen size

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860
hmm depend on different screen size
 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.190
hmm depend on different screen size
that's very good point yeah

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200
that's very good point yeah
 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.110
that's very good point yeah
so it's interesting in this example in

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120
so it's interesting in this example in
 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.790
so it's interesting in this example in
particular looks like they've used an

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800
particular looks like they've used an
 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.770
particular looks like they've used an
image for the instructions so it's a

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780
image for the instructions so it's a
 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.770
image for the instructions so it's a
little bit squashed and a little bit out

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780
little bit squashed and a little bit out
 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.040
little bit squashed and a little bit out
of focus so that's maybe one way that

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050
of focus so that's maybe one way that
 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.900
of focus so that's maybe one way that
they've tried to make it all fit but but

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910
they've tried to make it all fit but but

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.120
that as well because you can see the all
the options and you you're told what is

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:26.130
the options and you you're told what is
 

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.710
the options and you you're told what is
the advantage here of paying extra so

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720
the advantage here of paying extra so
 

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.050
the advantage here of paying extra so
let's go with blue water ocean which

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:30.060
let's go with blue water ocean which
 

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.540
let's go with blue water ocean which
means they would need to download two

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:31.550
means they would need to download two
 

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:34.640
means they would need to download two
more in two comma eight okay so this is

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:34.650
more in two comma eight okay so this is
 

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:35.690
more in two comma eight okay so this is
actually a good example so I'm going to

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:35.700
actually a good example so I'm going to
 

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.280
actually a good example so I'm going to
go ahead and guess that the developer is

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:37.290
go ahead and guess that the developer is
 

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:42.110
go ahead and guess that the developer is
not in England or the US so in a lot of

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120
not in England or the US so in a lot of
 

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.360
not in England or the US so in a lot of
countries so here you generally would

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:44.370
countries so here you generally would
 

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.140
countries so here you generally would
use a 2.08 to indicate it a decimal and

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:48.150
use a 2.08 to indicate it a decimal and
 

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.760
use a 2.08 to indicate it a decimal and
a lot of countries it's a comma this is

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:49.770
a lot of countries it's a comma this is
 

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.650
a lot of countries it's a comma this is
a good example where using localization

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:51.660
a good example where using localization
 

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.630
a good example where using localization
to do the formatting for you is a good

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640
to do the formatting for you is a good
 

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.240
to do the formatting for you is a good
tip because this looks weird to me yeah

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:56.250
tip because this looks weird to me yeah
 

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.710
tip because this looks weird to me yeah
and I'm sure it looks correct to the

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720
and I'm sure it looks correct to the
 

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.660
and I'm sure it looks correct to the
developer but it it's causes a little

00:09:59.660 --> 00:09:59.670
developer but it it's causes a little
 

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.430
developer but it it's causes a little
bit of cognitive dissonance in Android

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440
bit of cognitive dissonance in Android
 

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.510
bit of cognitive dissonance in Android
there's some there's a built-in

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:02.520
there's some there's a built-in
 

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.730
there's some there's a built-in
framework to make them again easy for

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:04.740
framework to make them again easy for
 

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.890
framework to make them again easy for
developers to arrange to take advantage

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:06.900
developers to arrange to take advantage
 

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.200
developers to arrange to take advantage
of localization yeah and then you can

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:09.210
of localization yeah and then you can
 

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.580
of localization yeah and then you can
just say what the number isn't and let

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:10.590
just say what the number isn't and let
 

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.590

so we clear the download boom

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:19.080
so we clear the download boom
 

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.890
so we clear the download boom
let's play it alright so one tip here as

I'd kind of use a standard button if

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260
I'd kind of use a standard button if
 

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.470
I'd kind of use a standard button if

alright so we can change the sound so

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:38.610
alright so we can change the sound so
 

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.650
alright so we can change the sound so
that's what it sounds like I don't know

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:39.660
that's what it sounds like I don't know

how well that comes across all right I'm
 

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.860
how well that comes across all right I'm
feeling very zen ok so we get back let's

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:47.870
feeling very zen ok so we get back let's
 

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.570
feeling very zen ok so we get back let's
it be a lot so for a start here

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:50.580
it be a lot so for a start here
 

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.980

particularly if you've got no alarm set

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:51.990
particularly if you've got no alarm set
 

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.600
particularly if you've got no alarm set
I would kind of like it to be more

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:53.610
I would kind of like it to be more
 

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.090
I would kind of like it to be more
obvious how to set it so that's one of

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:56.100
obvious how to set it so that's one of

the tips of the reasons why we have this

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:57.570
the tips of the reasons why we have this
 

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.210
the tips of the reasons why we have this
action bar paradigm is to make those

00:10:59.210 --> 00:10:59.220
action bar paradigm is to make those
 

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.430
action bar paradigm is to make those
primary actions more visible because

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440
primary actions more visible because
 

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.400
primary actions more visible because
here I think you need to go into the

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:03.410
here I think you need to go into the
 

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.740
here I think you need to go into the
into the menu so anything in the menu

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:06.750
into the menu so anything in the menu
 

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.910
into the menu so anything in the menu
you can kind of think of that as

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920
you can kind of think of that as
 

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.410
you can kind of think of that as
secondary actions which a lot of your

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:09.420
secondary actions which a lot of your
 

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.660
secondary actions which a lot of your
users are never been find so things like

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:11.670
users are never been find so things like
 

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.990
users are never been find so things like
settings home potentially are fine but

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000
settings home potentially are fine but
 

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.460
settings home potentially are fine but
things like create new alarm which is

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:16.470
things like create new alarm which is
 

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:17.780
things like create new alarm which is
sort of central to this app you want

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:17.790
sort of central to this app you want
 

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.630
sort of central to this app you want
that front and center ok let's have a

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640
that front and center ok let's have a
 

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.580
that front and center ok let's have a
look a long time so if I click on that

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:22.590
look a long time so if I click on that
 

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.499
look a long time so if I click on that
that's fine this thinks it's

00:11:26.499 --> 00:11:26.509
that's fine this thinks it's
 

00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:31.040
that's fine this thinks it's
8:14 p.m. every five minutes the key to

choosing date weeks s repeat alarm every
 

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.960
choosing date weeks s repeat alarm every
five minutes I was i wonder what's the

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:35.970
five minutes I was i wonder what's the
 

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.139
five minutes I was i wonder what's the
practical use of oh yeah see all that

00:11:39.139 --> 00:11:39.149
practical use of oh yeah see all that
 

00:11:39.149 --> 00:11:41.090
practical use of oh yeah see all that
still installed air core it's a good

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.100
still installed air core it's a good
 

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.860
still installed air core it's a good
example of why that isn't always the

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:42.870
example of why that isn't always the
 

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.679
example of why that isn't always the
most preferred option okay so what

00:11:45.679 --> 00:11:45.689
most preferred option okay so what
 

00:11:45.689 --> 00:11:47.300
most preferred option okay so what
happens about you sample stream so I can

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:47.310
happens about you sample stream so I can
 

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.579
happens about you sample stream so I can
choose a file so what I would select

00:11:49.579 --> 00:11:49.589
choose a file so what I would select
 

00:11:49.589 --> 00:11:51.319
choose a file so what I would select
here is rather than having this filename

00:11:51.319 --> 00:11:51.329
here is rather than having this filename
 

00:11:51.329 --> 00:11:54.110
here is rather than having this filename
which is I guess the placeholder if I

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120
which is I guess the placeholder if I
 

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.540

option here might be you know custom

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:58.410
option here might be you know custom
 

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:02.569
option here might be you know custom
custom file which would be nice yeah

00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579
custom file which would be nice yeah
 

00:12:02.579 --> 00:12:03.800
custom file which would be nice yeah
okay so we'll leave it at fountain at

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:03.810
okay so we'll leave it at fountain at
 

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.679

cancel button so we've kind of gone with

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000
cancel button so we've kind of gone with
 

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.480
cancel button so we've kind of gone with
some of the more standard buttons but at

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:11.490
some of the more standard buttons but at
 

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.410
some of the more standard buttons but at
least make sure you've got them in the

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.420
least make sure you've got them in the
 

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.179
least make sure you've got them in the
right way yeah you guys see the contrast

00:12:14.179 --> 00:12:14.189
right way yeah you guys see the contrast
 

00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:16.100
right way yeah you guys see the contrast
here the system dialog box popped up

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:16.110
here the system dialog box popped up
 

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.619
here the system dialog box popped up
with the black theme dark theme as

00:12:18.619 --> 00:12:18.629
with the black theme dark theme as
 

00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:21.980

compared with custom buttons it gives

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:21.990
compared with custom buttons it gives
 

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.569
compared with custom buttons it gives
yeah it's right away you've got this

00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:23.579
yeah it's right away you've got this
 

00:12:23.579 --> 00:12:25.639
yeah it's right away you've got this
this dissonance right it's like well the

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:25.649
this dissonance right it's like well the
 

00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:27.710
this dissonance right it's like well the
system says this but the the save and

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720
system says this but the the save and
 

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.869
system says this but the the save and
cancel button look different so why do

00:12:29.869 --> 00:12:29.879
cancel button look different so why do
 

00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:31.009
cancel button look different so why do
they look different they should look the

00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:31.019
they look different they should look the
 

00:12:31.019 --> 00:12:32.929
they look different they should look the
same so you can customize your your

00:12:32.929 --> 00:12:32.939
same so you can customize your your
 

00:12:32.939 --> 00:12:35.030
same so you can customize your your
alert dialogues a better option would be

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040
alert dialogues a better option would be
 

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.639
alert dialogues a better option would be
perhaps to to not customize your own

00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:37.649
perhaps to to not customize your own
 

00:12:37.649 --> 00:12:39.139

00:12:39.139 --> 00:12:39.149

one idea again here might be to set a

00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:42.899
one idea again here might be to set a
 

00:12:42.899 --> 00:12:47.929
one idea again here might be to set a
default so look click here to choose a

00:12:47.929 --> 00:12:47.939
default so look click here to choose a
 

00:12:47.939 --> 00:12:48.530
default so look click here to choose a
date

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.540

there's some interesting I'd like to get
 

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.320
there's some interesting I'd like to get
your opinion on his radio show go back

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:08.330
your opinion on his radio show go back
 

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:09.430
your opinion on his radio show go back
to the calendar

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440
to the calendar
 

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.000
to the calendar
so from the previous screen where you

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:13.010
so from the previous screen where you
 

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.220
so from the previous screen where you
have an action bar and when you go back

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:15.230
have an action bar and when you go back
 

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.320
have an action bar and when you go back
we go into the calendar if they research

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:17.330
we go into the calendar if they research
 

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.320
we go into the calendar if they research
replace the action bar with confirmation

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:20.330
replace the action bar with confirmation
 

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:24.280
replace the action bar with confirmation
or cancel ok or cancel what do you think

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:24.290
or cancel ok or cancel what do you think
 

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.760
or cancel ok or cancel what do you think
of its kind of huh this is either like

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:27.770
of its kind of huh this is either like
 

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.220
of its kind of huh this is either like
contextual it kind of is rather

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:30.230
contextual it kind of is rather
 

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.990
contextual it kind of is rather
contextual action bar where the only

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:32.000
contextual action bar where the only
 

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.250
contextual action bar where the only
actions that you want to invite or

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:33.260
actions that you want to invite or
 

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:37.180
actions that you want to invite or
either - ok or cancel yeah I mean I

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:37.190
either - ok or cancel yeah I mean I
 

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:38.980
either - ok or cancel yeah I mean I
think that there are other apps which do

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:38.990
think that there are other apps which do
 

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:40.210
think that there are other apps which do
something similar I want to say

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:40.220
something similar I want to say
 

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.550
something similar I want to say
something like the calendar app I'm not

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:42.560
something like the calendar app I'm not
 

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.620
something like the calendar app I'm not
sure office of my head so it's

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:44.630
sure office of my head so it's
 

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:45.970
sure office of my head so it's
interesting I think it works in this

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:45.980
interesting I think it works in this
 

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.320
interesting I think it works in this
case because it's literally the only

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:47.330
case because it's literally the only
 

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.930
case because it's literally the only
action so you can take from this I'm

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:49.940
action so you can take from this I'm
 

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.430
action so you can take from this I'm
gonna go ahead and assume that as they

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440
gonna go ahead and assume that as they
 

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.440
gonna go ahead and assume that as they
probably can't place these two buttons

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:53.450
probably can't place these two buttons
 

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:54.940
probably can't place these two buttons
anywhere on the screen because you have

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:54.950
anywhere on the screen because you have
 

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:56.920
anywhere on the screen because you have
so many options to choose from so this

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:56.930
so many options to choose from so this
 

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.030
so many options to choose from so this
is the bit which I found a little bit

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:58.040
is the bit which I found a little bit
 

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.910
is the bit which I found a little bit
concerning so if I change the date if I

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:00.920
concerning so if I change the date if I
 

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.160
concerning so if I change the date if I
go to 21 so if I hit cancel I would

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:03.170
go to 21 so if I hit cancel I would
 

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.990
go to 21 so if I hit cancel I would
presume that that doesn't change and it

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.000
presume that that doesn't change and it
 

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.350
presume that that doesn't change and it
doesn't if I change it and hit back I

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:08.360
doesn't if I change it and hit back I
 

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.790
doesn't if I change it and hit back I
would assume that back is going to be

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:09.800
would assume that back is going to be
 

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.730
would assume that back is going to be
the bullet of castle and it isn't it

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:12.740
the bullet of castle and it isn't it
 

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.760
the bullet of castle and it isn't it
it's implicit it's an implicit okay okay

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:15.770
it's implicit it's an implicit okay okay
 

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:17.530
it's implicit it's an implicit okay okay
in this in this instance if I hit back

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:17.540
in this in this instance if I hit back
 

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.240
in this in this instance if I hit back
that I'm saying save I'm so I have to

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:19.250
that I'm saying save I'm so I have to
 

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.430
that I'm saying save I'm so I have to
hit cancel explicitly to cancel the

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440
hit cancel explicitly to cancel the
 

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.530
hit cancel explicitly to cancel the
option and to me that seems backwards if

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:23.540
option and to me that seems backwards if
 

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.240
option and to me that seems backwards if
I get back in this instance I would

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:25.250
I get back in this instance I would
 

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.700
I get back in this instance I would
expect it to not save so in almost an

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:27.710
expect it to not save so in almost an
 

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:30.520
expect it to not save so in almost an
explicit save so remember you can change

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:30.530
explicit save so remember you can change
 

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:37.000
explicit save so remember you can change
it to an implicit save okay I don't must

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.010
it to an implicit save okay I don't must
 

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:38.680
it to an implicit save okay I don't must
go the other way and so basically just

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:38.690
go the other way and so basically just
 

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.600
go the other way and so basically just
remove cancel because there's nothing

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:40.610
remove cancel because there's nothing
 

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:43.510
remove cancel because there's nothing
here that's you don't risk losing a lot

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520
here that's you don't risk losing a lot
 

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.760
here that's you don't risk losing a lot
of data you know it's basically just

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:45.770
of data you know it's basically just
 

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:47.350
of data you know it's basically just
changing the date and those sorts of

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360
changing the date and those sorts of
 

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.040
changing the date and those sorts of
things and so it's quite as urgent so uh

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:51.050
things and so it's quite as urgent so uh
 

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.560
things and so it's quite as urgent so uh
yeah I would basically just cancel the

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:53.570
yeah I would basically just cancel the
 

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:55.390
yeah I would basically just cancel the
cancel and just have okay and back is

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:55.400
cancel and just have okay and back is
 

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.670
cancel and just have okay and back is
the way to cancel it to just to go back

00:21:57.670 --> 00:21:57.680
the way to cancel it to just to go back
 

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.230
the way to cancel it to just to go back
to the previous screen so you can't

00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.240
to the previous screen so you can't
 

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.780
to the previous screen so you can't
cancel it yeah that would be my

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:01.790
cancel it yeah that would be my
 

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:03.160
cancel it yeah that would be my
inclination and the other thing I think

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:03.170
inclination and the other thing I think
 

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:06.310
inclination and the other thing I think
we've done here is so the thing which is

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320
we've done here is so the thing which is
 

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.250
we've done here is so the thing which is
a little bit confusing is that it seems

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:09.260
a little bit confusing is that it seems
 

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.610
a little bit confusing is that it seems
almost as though the the review apps is

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:12.620
almost as though the the review apps is
 

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.900
almost as though the the review apps is
a note associated with this task but the

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:16.910
a note associated with this task but the
 

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:21.520
a note associated with this task but the
task itself doesn't have a title so you

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:21.530
task itself doesn't have a title so you
 

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:22.900
task itself doesn't have a title so you
kind of got this blank space here we are

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:22.910
kind of got this blank space here we are
 

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:23.289
kind of got this blank space here we are
yeah

00:22:23.289 --> 00:22:23.299
yeah
 

00:22:23.299 --> 00:22:24.940
yeah
one time you're wondering what this

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:24.950
one time you're wondering what this
 

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:27.879
one time you're wondering what this
checkbox is well yeah the textbox is OK

00:22:27.879 --> 00:22:27.889
checkbox is well yeah the textbox is OK
 

00:22:27.889 --> 00:22:29.350
checkbox is well yeah the textbox is OK
or cancel but like what's the white

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360
or cancel but like what's the white
 

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.749
or cancel but like what's the white
space like this seems like notes about

00:22:31.749 --> 00:22:31.759
space like this seems like notes about
 

00:22:31.759 --> 00:22:37.210
space like this seems like notes about
review apps make more notes more boats

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:37.220
review apps make more notes more boats
 

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.840
review apps make more notes more boats
that's yeah autocorrect sites and you

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:40.850
that's yeah autocorrect sites and you
 

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.060
that's yeah autocorrect sites and you
say so it goes there and it's sort of

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:43.070
say so it goes there and it's sort of
 

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.889
say so it goes there and it's sort of
creating this this longer thing but and

00:22:44.889 --> 00:22:44.899
creating this this longer thing but and
 

00:22:44.899 --> 00:22:46.840
creating this this longer thing but and
you know I kind of would expect this to

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:46.850
you know I kind of would expect this to
 

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.060
you know I kind of would expect this to
look the same in both ways if that makes

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:49.070
look the same in both ways if that makes
 

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:50.229
look the same in both ways if that makes
sense what if you get four more lines

00:22:50.229 --> 00:22:50.239
sense what if you get four more lines
 

00:22:50.239 --> 00:23:02.830
sense what if you get four more lines
that's it you wonder how far it goes so

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:02.840
that's it you wonder how far it goes so
 

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.690
that's it you wonder how far it goes so
it's hence appending it to it it's

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:04.700
it's hence appending it to it it's
 

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.349
it's hence appending it to it it's
interesting okay okay we have refresh we

00:23:08.349 --> 00:23:08.359
interesting okay okay we have refresh we
 

00:23:08.359 --> 00:23:11.289
interesting okay okay we have refresh we
have the overflow menu edit tasks lists

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:11.299
have the overflow menu edit tasks lists
 

00:23:11.299 --> 00:23:13.779
have the overflow menu edit tasks lists
which is going to let us have multiple

00:23:13.779 --> 00:23:13.789
which is going to let us have multiple
 

00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:15.609
which is going to let us have multiple
things and I guess integrate the

00:23:15.609 --> 00:23:15.619
things and I guess integrate the
 

00:23:15.619 --> 00:23:16.720
things and I guess integrate the
calendar as well which is quite

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:16.730
calendar as well which is quite
 

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:21.159
calendar as well which is quite
interesting add new tasks I'll sue else

00:23:21.159 --> 00:23:21.169
interesting add new tasks I'll sue else
 

00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:27.190
interesting add new tasks I'll sue else
we got this let's trash it three times

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200
we got this let's trash it three times
 

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.609
we got this let's trash it three times
for three percent of the new tasks and

00:23:29.609 --> 00:23:29.619
for three percent of the new tasks and
 

00:23:29.619 --> 00:23:32.639
for three percent of the new tasks and
that's an interesting way to monetize

00:23:32.639 --> 00:23:32.649
that's an interesting way to monetize
 

00:23:32.649 --> 00:23:36.129
that's an interesting way to monetize
that's interesting so you can add up to

00:23:36.129 --> 00:23:36.139
that's interesting so you can add up to
 

00:23:36.139 --> 00:23:38.879
that's interesting so you can add up to
three tasks in a free version

00:23:38.879 --> 00:23:38.889
three tasks in a free version
 

00:23:38.889 --> 00:23:42.509
three tasks in a free version
what does it batch add actually doing

00:23:42.509 --> 00:23:42.519
what does it batch add actually doing
 

00:23:42.519 --> 00:23:44.799
what does it batch add actually doing
I'm gonna go back I could try it

00:23:44.799 --> 00:23:44.809
I'm gonna go back I could try it
 

00:23:44.809 --> 00:23:48.580
I'm gonna go back I could try it
yeah batch add bad chef and press enter

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:48.590
yeah batch add bad chef and press enter
 

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:52.899
yeah batch add bad chef and press enter
new test taught you type something up so

00:23:52.899 --> 00:23:52.909
new test taught you type something up so
 

00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:55.330
new test taught you type something up so
you can enter multiple now just faster

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:55.340
you can enter multiple now just faster
 

00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:01.060
you can enter multiple now just faster
yeah for city great you see so I think

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:01.070
yeah for city great you see so I think
 

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:05.019
yeah for city great you see so I think
it's going to ignore you but did at it

00:24:05.019 --> 00:24:05.029
it's going to ignore you but did at it
 

00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:07.450
it's going to ignore you but did at it
interesting okay maybe that they know

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:07.460
interesting okay maybe that they know
 

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.519
interesting okay maybe that they know
that we're reviewing their app yeah

00:24:09.519 --> 00:24:09.529
that we're reviewing their app yeah
 

00:24:09.529 --> 00:24:12.009
that we're reviewing their app yeah
possibly no I suspect that what it is is

00:24:12.009 --> 00:24:12.019
possibly no I suspect that what it is is
 

00:24:12.019 --> 00:24:14.440
possibly no I suspect that what it is is
batch add as a way of adding tasks to

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:14.450
batch add as a way of adding tasks to
 

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:16.930

multiple lists and we only have one list

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:16.940
multiple lists and we only have one list
 

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.549
multiple lists and we only have one list

00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559
so that maybe beer that maybe the issue
 

00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:21.879
so that maybe beer that maybe the issue
there okay so I mean overall I think

00:24:21.879 --> 00:24:21.889
there okay so I mean overall I think
 

00:24:21.889 --> 00:24:24.279
there okay so I mean overall I think
it's it's a it's a good-looking app it

00:24:24.279 --> 00:24:24.289
it's it's a it's a good-looking app it
 

00:24:24.289 --> 00:24:26.889
it's it's a it's a good-looking app it
uses the action bar paradigm they assume

00:24:26.889 --> 00:24:26.899
uses the action bar paradigm they assume
 

00:24:26.899 --> 00:24:29.859
uses the action bar paradigm they assume
that it has a landscape mate yeah oh

00:24:29.859 --> 00:24:29.869
that it has a landscape mate yeah oh
 

00:24:29.869 --> 00:24:34.450
that it has a landscape mate yeah oh
that's interesting so when I switched to

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:34.460
that's interesting so when I switched to
 

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.279
that's interesting so when I switched to
landscape mode it seems to have lost all

00:24:36.279 --> 00:24:36.289
landscape mode it seems to have lost all
 

00:24:36.289 --> 00:24:36.880
landscape mode it seems to have lost all
of my

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:36.890
of my
 

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.460
of my
if we create a task under this list

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:39.470
if we create a task under this list
 

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.680
if we create a task under this list
Friday review list yeah I think we only

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:41.690
Friday review list yeah I think we only
 

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.990
Friday review list yeah I think we only
have one list how about all can try to

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000
have one list how about all can try to
 

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.530
have one list how about all can try to
get it all in tragic tried to rotate

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:49.540
 

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.150
interesting yeah seems like a bug so it

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:52.160
interesting yeah seems like a bug so it
 

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.919
interesting yeah seems like a bug so it
didn't so it's not associated with

00:24:53.919 --> 00:24:53.929
didn't so it's not associated with
 

00:24:53.929 --> 00:24:56.320
didn't so it's not associated with
anything so the question is how do you

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:56.330
anything so the question is how do you
 

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.289
anything so the question is how do you
associate it with a particular list yeah

00:24:59.289 --> 00:24:59.299
associate it with a particular list yeah
 

00:24:59.299 --> 00:25:01.090
associate it with a particular list yeah
particularly because he I don't know how

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:01.100
particularly because he I don't know how
 

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.860
particularly because he I don't know how
well you can see but it claims that this

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:02.870
well you can see but it claims that this
 

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:04.900
well you can see but it claims that this
five all right right so I'd really

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:04.910
five all right right so I'd really
 

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.060
five all right right so I'd really
expect to see them here that seems to be

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:07.070
expect to see them here that seems to be
 

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.640
expect to see them here that seems to be
a bug anyway I'm just force close yeah

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:09.650
a bug anyway I'm just force close yeah
 

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:10.990
a bug anyway I'm just force close yeah

save it got saved so I would suggest you

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.120
save it got saved so I would suggest you
 

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.710
save it got saved so I would suggest you
know typically on a wider tablet form

00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720
know typically on a wider tablet form
 

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.390
know typically on a wider tablet form
factor you would want to introduce some

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:01.400
factor you would want to introduce some
 

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.190
factor you would want to introduce some
padding on the side on the right-hand

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200
padding on the side on the right-hand
 

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.900
padding on the side on the right-hand
side and on the left-hand side so that

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:04.910
side and on the left-hand side so that
 

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.570
side and on the left-hand side so that
it doesn't feel like too stretched so

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:07.580
it doesn't feel like too stretched so
 

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.850
it doesn't feel like too stretched so
because right now looking at the tablet

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:09.860
because right now looking at the tablet
 

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.680
because right now looking at the tablet
optimized version it looks like a little

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:11.690
optimized version it looks like a little
 

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:13.900
optimized version it looks like a little
bit stretched and also you can probably

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:13.910
bit stretched and also you can probably
 

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.700
bit stretched and also you can probably
work on the screen the font size a

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:15.710
work on the screen the font size a
 

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.799
work on the screen the font size a
little bit by increasing the font size

00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:17.809
little bit by increasing the font size
 

00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:20.049
little bit by increasing the font size
because at this distance reading the

00:26:20.049 --> 00:26:20.059
because at this distance reading the
 

00:26:20.059 --> 00:26:22.270
because at this distance reading the
reading it off up from the tablet it's

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:22.280
reading it off up from the tablet it's
 

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.430
reading it off up from the tablet it's
not legible because of the small font

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440
not legible because of the small font
 

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:29.620
not legible because of the small font
size you can switch to different

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:29.630
size you can switch to different
 

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:31.870
size you can switch to different
accounts and overall I think I think in

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:31.880
accounts and overall I think I think in
 

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.049
accounts and overall I think I think in
terms of functions functionality the

00:26:34.049 --> 00:26:34.059
terms of functions functionality the
 

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:37.270
terms of functions functionality the
version on the phone form factor is you

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:37.280
version on the phone form factor is you
 

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.430
version on the phone form factor is you
know identical with the functionality

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440
know identical with the functionality
 

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.860
know identical with the functionality
here you just need to figure out the

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:41.870
here you just need to figure out the
 

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:46.690
here you just need to figure out the
layout and and the padding on a tablet

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:46.700
layout and and the padding on a tablet
 

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.130
layout and and the padding on a tablet
yeah absolutely so I think that's the

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:49.140
yeah absolutely so I think that's the
 

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.440
yeah absolutely so I think that's the
the two big pieces of advice here would

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:51.450
the two big pieces of advice here would
 

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:53.270
the two big pieces of advice here would
be definitely work on a tablet layout or

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:53.280
be definitely work on a tablet layout or
 

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.910
be definitely work on a tablet layout or
something like notes and tasks works

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:55.920
something like notes and tasks works
 

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.410
something like notes and tasks works
really well on tablet and I've seen some

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:57.420
really well on tablet and I've seen some
 

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.640
really well on tablet and I've seen some
good implementations you know on a

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:58.650
good implementations you know on a
 

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.590
good implementations you know on a
bigger screen it just makes it easier

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600
bigger screen it just makes it easier
 

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.170
bigger screen it just makes it easier

trick notes all right nice um okay so

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:22.230
trick notes all right nice um okay so
 

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:24.380
trick notes all right nice um okay so
okay so that's the big advice I've built

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:24.390
okay so that's the big advice I've built
 

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:26.419
okay so that's the big advice I've built
a nice tablet version and if we get it

00:28:26.419 --> 00:28:26.429
a nice tablet version and if we get it
 

00:28:26.429 --> 00:28:28.190
a nice tablet version and if we get it
to crash on air while we're just tapping

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200
to crash on air while we're just tapping
 

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.900
to crash on air while we're just tapping
through it that suggests that you

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:29.910
through it that suggests that you
 

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:30.860
through it that suggests that you
probably want to do a little bit more

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:30.870
probably want to do a little bit more
 

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.500
probably want to do a little bit more
testing it's a really kind of a really

testing it's a really kind of a really
 

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:35.630
testing it's a really kind of a really
important part of your app development

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640
important part of your app development
 

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.240
important part of your app development
is to really give it a workout and one

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:38.250
is to really give it a workout and one
 

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:39.530
is to really give it a workout and one
of the one of the key tips I have for

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:39.540
of the one of the key tips I have for
 

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.020
of the one of the key tips I have for
testing so there's a bunch of stuff you

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:42.030
testing so there's a bunch of stuff you
 

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:43.700
testing so there's a bunch of stuff you
can read about using unit tests and test

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:43.710
can read about using unit tests and test
 

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:45.380

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:45.390
frameworks and getting different devices
 

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.780
frameworks and getting different devices
to test it and all those sorts of things

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:46.790
to test it and all those sorts of things
 

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.860
to test it and all those sorts of things
one thing which a lot of people tend to

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:48.870
one thing which a lot of people tend to
 

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.169
one thing which a lot of people tend to
forget is actually just getting people

00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:51.179
forget is actually just getting people
 

00:28:51.179 --> 00:28:52.940
forget is actually just getting people
to use your apps and you might think

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:52.950
to use your apps and you might think
 

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:54.169
to use your apps and you might think
well then uh how many people would you

00:28:54.169 --> 00:28:54.179
well then uh how many people would you
 

00:28:54.179 --> 00:28:56.210
well then uh how many people would you
really qualified to test it the best

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:56.220
really qualified to test it the best
 

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.700
really qualified to test it the best
people to test your apps are the people

want testing your app because they will

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.320
want testing your app because they will
 

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.050

conditions all the simple things that
 

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:18.000
conditions all the simple things that
can happen so yeah definitely test it as

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:18.010
can happen so yeah definitely test it as
 

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:19.740

eagle-eyes on Fred um so what they've

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:27.100
eagle-eyes on Fred um so what they've
 

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.220
eagle-eyes on Fred um so what they've
done like a attention to detail which is

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:29.230
done like a attention to detail which is
 

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.800
done like a attention to detail which is
nice and also so this is primarily a

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:31.810
nice and also so this is primarily a
 

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:33.540
nice and also so this is primarily a
widget but if you open the app it

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:33.550
widget but if you open the app it
 

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.520
widget but if you open the app it
provides useful information here so you

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:35.530
provides useful information here so you
 

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.890
provides useful information here so you
can see all of the stuff right here the

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:37.900
can see all of the stuff right here the
 

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.240
can see all of the stuff right here the
only thing that they maybe do wrong here

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:39.250
only thing that they maybe do wrong here
 

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.560
only thing that they maybe do wrong here
is that doesn't actually say that it's a

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:40.570
is that doesn't actually say that it's a
 

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:43.380
is that doesn't actually say that it's a
widget you got it's implied here

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:43.390
widget you got it's implied here
 

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:45.090
widget you got it's implied here
temperature on big widget and text

temperature on big widget and text
 

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.410
temperature on big widget and text
inside widget but you probably want to

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:46.420
inside widget but you probably want to
 

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.120
inside widget but you probably want to
mention just you know a line of text

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:48.130
mention just you know a line of text
 

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.620
mention just you know a line of text
which says you know don't forget to

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:49.630
which says you know don't forget to
 

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.960
which says you know don't forget to
install the widget or actually back to

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:51.970
install the widget or actually back to
 

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.180
install the widget or actually back to
your point earlier you know for users

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:54.190
your point earlier you know for users
 

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:56.010
your point earlier you know for users
for regular you know consumer users that

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:56.020
for regular you know consumer users that
 

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.170
for regular you know consumer users that
may not be familiar with widgets they

00:30:58.170 --> 00:30:58.180
may not be familiar with widgets they
 

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.180
may not be familiar with widgets they
may not know what these two instructions

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:00.190
may not know what these two instructions
 

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:02.490
may not know what these two instructions
mean precisely I mean if this if the app

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:02.500
mean precisely I mean if this if the app
 

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.230
mean precisely I mean if this if the app
as it is is exactly what they want then

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240
as it is is exactly what they want then
 

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:04.950
as it is is exactly what they want then
you're in good shape

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960
you're in good shape
 

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.290
you're in good shape
but it doesn't hurt to tell people that

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:07.300
but it doesn't hurt to tell people that
 

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.080
but it doesn't hurt to tell people that
some of the other functionality exists

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:09.090
some of the other functionality exists
 

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:11.910
some of the other functionality exists
so this is all nice we got battery disk

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:11.920
so this is all nice we got battery disk
 

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.410
so this is all nice we got battery disk

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:35.890
it's for writing a listening back okay
 

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:37.560
it's for writing a listening back okay
okay well that's that's not an obnoxious

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:37.570
okay well that's that's not an obnoxious
 

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:39.750
okay well that's that's not an obnoxious
way of giving way to ask you know it's a

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760
way of giving way to ask you know it's a
 

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.210
way of giving way to ask you know it's a
good practice to ask people hey give me

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:42.220
good practice to ask people hey give me
 

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.540
good practice to ask people hey give me
a feedback but the icon lets include a

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:45.550
a feedback but the icon lets include a
 

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:46.920
a feedback but the icon lets include a
nice that into it

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:46.930
nice that into it
 

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:48.390
nice that into it
yeah maybe you could have the Google

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:48.400
yeah maybe you could have the Google
 

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.710
yeah maybe you could have the Google
Play icon I'm not I'm not quite sure

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:49.720
Play icon I'm not I'm not quite sure
 

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.660
Play icon I'm not I'm not quite sure
what the right solution is there but you

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:51.670
what the right solution is there but you
 

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:52.980
what the right solution is there but you
know on the one hand I guess it's fine

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:52.990
know on the one hand I guess it's fine
 

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:54.750
know on the one hand I guess it's fine
because it's an explicit user action you

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760
because it's an explicit user action you
 

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.180
because it's an explicit user action you
don't know what to expect so I guess

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:57.190
don't know what to expect so I guess
 

00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:58.590
don't know what to expect so I guess
that's fine and then you've got the

00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:58.600
that's fine and then you've got the
 

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.170
that's fine and then you've got the
about okay that's that's fine and the

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:01.180
about okay that's that's fine and the
 

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.450
about okay that's that's fine and the
the eye icon there indicates the that

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:03.460
the eye icon there indicates the that
 

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.760
the eye icon there indicates the that
the about stuff so that's fine you've

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:05.770
the about stuff so that's fine you've
 

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:08.100
the about stuff so that's fine you've
got a menu button of shame so you've got

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:08.110
got a menu button of shame so you've got
 

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.790
got a menu button of shame so you've got
a menu button doesn't do anything so for

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:10.800
a menu button doesn't do anything so for
 

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.870
a menu button doesn't do anything so for
so all you need to do is set your target

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880
so all you need to do is set your target
 

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.540
so all you need to do is set your target
SDK to 14 and that will disappear just

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:15.550
SDK to 14 and that will disappear just
 

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:20.310
SDK to 14 and that will disappear just
one line change okay that's that's

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320
one line change okay that's that's
 

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.590
one line change okay that's that's
perfect so let's let's move on so this

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:22.600
perfect so let's let's move on so this
 

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.140
perfect so let's let's move on so this
is an existing battery widget as week

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:25.150
is an existing battery widget as week
 

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:27.870
is an existing battery widget as week
exactly so you can see that last weeks

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:27.880
exactly so you can see that last weeks
 

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.310
exactly so you can see that last weeks
if you watched last week's beautiful

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:29.320
if you watched last week's beautiful
 

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.840
if you watched last week's beautiful
battery widget you remove the big one

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:30.850
battery widget you remove the big one
 

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.490
battery widget you remove the big one
that's right so we can't really tell

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:32.500
that's right so we can't really tell
 

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.280
that's right so we can't really tell
exactly right so you can see it's still

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:35.290
exactly right so you can see it's still
 

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:36.750
exactly right so you can see it's still
beautiful widget and their color has

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:36.760
beautiful widget and their color has
 

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.790
beautiful widget and their color has
changed due to the decreased battery

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:38.800
changed due to the decreased battery
 

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.590
changed due to the decreased battery
life let's go to widget here and go to

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:42.600
life let's go to widget here and go to
 

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:48.840
life let's go to widget here and go to
what was the name of this one battery

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:48.850
what was the name of this one battery
 

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:51.510
what was the name of this one battery
disk battery disk that's good further

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:51.520
disk battery disk that's good further
 

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:56.520
disk battery disk that's good further
back all right every disk okay all right

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:56.530
back all right every disk okay all right
 

00:32:56.530 --> 00:32:58.200
back all right every disk okay all right
perfect so let's go with the drop the

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:58.210
perfect so let's go with the drop the
 

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:01.310
perfect so let's go with the drop the
big one on the screen first

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.320
big one on the screen first
 

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.080
big one on the screen first
okay here's bigger that is big nice I'm

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:04.090
okay here's bigger that is big nice I'm
 

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:05.280
okay here's bigger that is big nice I'm
gonna drop the small one on there as

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:05.290
gonna drop the small one on there as
 

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:08.550
gonna drop the small one on there as
well so we can compare okay nice nice

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:08.560
well so we can compare okay nice nice
 

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.850
well so we can compare okay nice nice
either of them resize no no okay

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:11.860
either of them resize no no okay
 

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.320
either of them resize no no okay
that's actually that's actually quite

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:13.330
that's actually that's actually quite
 

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:15.270
that's actually that's actually quite
nice actually I like this circular look

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:15.280
nice actually I like this circular look
 

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.520
nice actually I like this circular look
rather than sort of mock real life

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:17.530
rather than sort of mock real life
 

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:22.890
rather than sort of mock real life
things so that actually works for me I

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:22.900
things so that actually works for me I
 

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.380
things so that actually works for me I
think it's just it's just that Tron

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:25.390
think it's just it's just that Tron
 

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:26.880
think it's just it's just that Tron
style yeah

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:26.890
style yeah
 

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:30.900
style yeah
yeah so one thing you could do and maybe

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:30.910
yeah so one thing you could do and maybe
 

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:32.310
yeah so one thing you could do and maybe
I mean they're a bunch of themes which I

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320
I mean they're a bunch of themes which I
 

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.330
I mean they're a bunch of themes which I
think you're just going to change the

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:33.340
think you're just going to change the
 

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.280
think you're just going to change the
color but one thing you could consider

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:35.290
color but one thing you could consider
 

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:38.430
color but one thing you could consider
is to sort of follow the footpaths of a

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.440
is to sort of follow the footpaths of a
 

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.230
is to sort of follow the footpaths of a
lot of other with battery widgets and

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240
lot of other with battery widgets and
 

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.600
lot of other with battery widgets and
change the color of the sort of the

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:42.610
change the color of the sort of the
 

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:45.120
change the color of the sort of the
circles dynamically as the as the

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:45.130
circles dynamically as the as the
 

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:49.080
circles dynamically as the as the
battery decreases yeah and one of the

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:49.090
battery decreases yeah and one of the
 

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:50.580
battery decreases yeah and one of the
things so I'm not sure I'm gonna I'm

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:50.590
things so I'm not sure I'm gonna I'm
 

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:52.580
things so I'm not sure I'm gonna I'm
going to go go on a limb and assume that

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:52.590
going to go go on a limb and assume that
 

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:55.289
going to go go on a limb and assume that
these are PNG files with set colors

00:33:55.289 --> 00:33:55.299
these are PNG files with set colors
 

00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:56.820
these are PNG files with set colors
which is generally a pretty good

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:56.830
which is generally a pretty good
 

00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:00.690
which is generally a pretty good
approach but if you have static images

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:00.700
approach but if you have static images
 

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.370
approach but if you have static images
which have gradients and those sorts of

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:02.380
which have gradients and those sorts of
 

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.750
which have gradients and those sorts of
things you can draw them dynamically

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760
things you can draw them dynamically
 

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.539
things you can draw them dynamically
which will let you which will let you be

00:34:06.539 --> 00:34:06.549
which will let you which will let you be
 

00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:07.860
which will let you which will let you be
able to choose whatever colors you want

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:07.870
able to choose whatever colors you want
 

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:10.409
able to choose whatever colors you want
and have you know a vast range of

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:10.419
and have you know a vast range of
 

00:34:10.419 --> 00:34:12.570
and have you know a vast range of
gradients and colors normally that's not

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:12.580
gradients and colors normally that's not
 

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.639
gradients and colors normally that's not
a great idea because it's expensive to

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:14.649
a great idea because it's expensive to
 

00:34:14.649 --> 00:34:16.440
a great idea because it's expensive to
have to keep redrawing if you've got

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:16.450
have to keep redrawing if you've got
 

00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:17.669
have to keep redrawing if you've got
something like a compass where you're

00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679
something like a compass where you're
 

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:20.280
something like a compass where you're
moving things around gets expensive this

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:20.290
moving things around gets expensive this
 

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:22.500
moving things around gets expensive this
is constant right so you can even draw

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:22.510
is constant right so you can even draw
 

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.540
is constant right so you can even draw
it once save it as a well recorded as a

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:24.550
it once save it as a well recorded as a
 

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:26.250
it once save it as a well recorded as a
bitmap and then keep keep using it with

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:26.260
bitmap and then keep keep using it with
 

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:27.930
bitmap and then keep keep using it with
different colors it also helps decrease

00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:27.940
different colors it also helps decrease
 

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.599
different colors it also helps decrease
the size of your application exactly and

00:34:30.599 --> 00:34:30.609
the size of your application exactly and
 

00:34:30.609 --> 00:34:31.770
the size of your application exactly and
then you can have a thousand different

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:31.780
then you can have a thousand different
 

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.570
then you can have a thousand different
themes and it doesn't increase the size

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:33.580
themes and it doesn't increase the size
 

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.740
themes and it doesn't increase the size
of your app at all because it's just

00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:34.750
of your app at all because it's just
 

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:36.030
of your app at all because it's just
different color values that you're

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:36.040
different color values that you're
 

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.560
different color values that you're
inserting into the code at runtime so

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:37.570
inserting into the code at runtime so
 

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:40.320
inserting into the code at runtime so
that's to consider and you can do the

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:40.330
that's to consider and you can do the
 

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:42.270
that's to consider and you can do the
same thing using gradient drawables as

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:42.280
same thing using gradient drawables as
 

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.010
same thing using gradient drawables as
well as an option that's presuming

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:44.020
well as an option that's presuming
 

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.470
well as an option that's presuming
you're not already doing that otherwise

00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480
you're not already doing that otherwise
 

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.300
you're not already doing that otherwise
yeah I think it looks pretty good I

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:48.310
yeah I think it looks pretty good I
 

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:49.649
yeah I think it looks pretty good I
don't know that I would put the

00:34:49.649 --> 00:34:49.659
don't know that I would put the
 

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:51.659
don't know that I would put the
temperature as a first-class citizen but

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:51.669
temperature as a first-class citizen but
 

00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:53.300
temperature as a first-class citizen but
I guess that's one of the options in the

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:53.310
I guess that's one of the options in the
 

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:57.599
I guess that's one of the options in the
in the settings isn't it yes so I can

00:34:57.599 --> 00:34:57.609
in the settings isn't it yes so I can
 

00:34:57.609 --> 00:35:00.870
in the settings isn't it yes so I can
