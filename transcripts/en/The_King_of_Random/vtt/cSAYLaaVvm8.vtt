00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:00.520
Hey guys, I'm a welcome back to the workshop everyone loves a good bonfire

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.340
Whether it's hot or cold outside

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.650
But sometimes it doesn't make sense to really get a giant fire going the  purpose of today's video is to see if we can build

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.980
A portable tabletop fire pit that we can move around with us

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.410
This is a slightly more complicated build than some so we do have quite a few parts that are going to be working with for

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.070
The main body of the fire pit we have this

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.279
medium-sized plastic container and a metal pie tin as the fuel for our tabletop fire pit

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.129
We have this little canister of propane butane mix usually these are for powering camping stoves when you go hiking

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.450
speaking of camp stoves

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.700
We have a small one of those we bought on Amazon that we're going to

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.710
Disassemble to use as a regulator to get the fuel out of our tank we have a bunch of paint sticks that are going to

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.349
Use to decorate the outside of our container once everything is built

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.570
Then we've got some of these blue glass beads that we can use as a decorative element to make the top of our fire pit

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.939
Look a lot nicer for the workings of our fire pit

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.940
We have some quarter inch copper tubing and some

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.379
copper fittings as well as a small piece of

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.449
3/8 inch vinyl tubing the rest of what I have here is hardware and supplies to attach the other pieces together

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.869
And I'll go over those as I get to them. We've got all of our supplies and equipment ready

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.809
Let's start building the first step in building is actually going to be

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.729
disassembling some of the parts that we have our plastic container has a lid and a latch that we aren't going to need so let's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.729
Just take them off

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.930
Now let's take the camp stove out of the box and break it down to just the parts that we need pretty neat little stove

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.520
collapses down really small

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.520
Now what we want is this orange part down at the bottom that works as regulator for the fuel

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.009
The rest of this stove we actually aren't going to use

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.829
Just by grabbing this top part. I'm able to twist and this will unscrew from the regulator

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.949
That's done. Everything else is sort of connected to it

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.799
There's also this little brass nozzle at the tip of our stove and that helps regulate the speed at which the fuel comes out

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.390
Normally, that's a good thing

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.080
But we want the fuel to come out a little bit faster than this nozzle is designed to allow

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.459
So let's remove it as well. Let's secure that in the vise now. I'm just gonna take a pair of pliers

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:03.229
That is pretty stuck on there, but is removable

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:10.729
It's enough force pull these really tiny I can't tell maybe they're brass rods or brass beads

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.639
They're super little now we have the piece of the regulator that we want to use on our fuel canister this regulator

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.979
Just screws right down onto our fuel canister

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.869
And then we can open and close it as we like at this point if we twist this handle right here

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.399
Fuel will start coming out, but I don't really just want to spray propane and butane in the air

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.970
So I'm not going to do that at the moment

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.859
We're going to want our metal pan to be nice and secure in its attachment to our plastic container

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:39.709
But we don't want it permanently affixed because that would make it impossible to switch out the fuel if we run out

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.069
What we're going to do is we're going to take four of these metal brackets

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.518
And we're going to have a magnet attached to the top of each one of them

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.358
We also have an assortment of these small machine bolts

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.840
And we're going to use these to attach the magnets permanently to the brackets

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.380
And then we'll also use them to attach the brackets to the plastic container

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.479
With the magnet on the bracket one of those screws passing through the magnet and the bracket going to attach a washer

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.090
And then a nut to keep it nice and secured in place

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.129
Feels nice and secure now let's do the same thing for the other three brackets

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.989
Now we need to attach our four brackets at four equal points around our plastic container

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.199
With those four points marked on the side of the plastic container

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.839
Let's drill four small holes one at each point just large enough for our small screws to fit through

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.449
It's fun little spiral plastic pieces

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.389
I'm trying not to press too hard because I really want it to cut through the plastic rather than breaking through at the end

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.479
Now we should be able to line our brackets up with those holes and attach the screw

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.789
Right in place to help make sure the screws don't damage the plastic

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.160
I do have some rubber washers that I'm going to use

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.899
I just want to make sure I don't crack through the side of the plastic when I tighten down the bolts the head on these

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.530
Screws is pretty small, and if I try I can actually pass it through the rubber washer

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.890
So I'm going to be using a regular washer first, and then the rubber washer

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.720
That's lately attached, I'm not going to tighten it down quite yet, so at the moment this bracket can still move around fairly freely

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.349
Let's attach the other three the same way there we go

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:41.589
We've got all four brackets loosely attached to our plastic container, and here's why we didn't anchor those down really firmly yet

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.619
I want to make sure that they all sit perfectly level with each other

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.970
Let's take our plastic container flip it upside down and secure it to the bottom of our metal pan

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.449
We can just as easily

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:53.499
Flip it right side up and we can get a good look at how this is going to work

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.679
And you can see that the magnets are providing a really strong attachment

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.130
Which is just what we want with our magnets attached to the bottom of the pan

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.799
We know that all four are sticking up from the plastic

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.229
Container the same amount we're not going to end up with three of them in contact and one of them with a small gap

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.279
With our brackets measured out, so we know they're at the right height. Let's tighten down the bolts

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.060
There we go

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.020
At this point we should be able to pull our pan off

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.759
Our brackets will stay in place and now we know that we put our pan back on

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.449
It will be in good contact with all four brackets at once

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.690
And it's very well attached

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.419
But we can still take it off

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.948
And we need to to change out the fuel the next step is we're going to prep our copper tubing and how it's going to

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:39.879
Attach to our metal pan the tubing will be coming straight up the middle of our plastic container

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.889
So let's drill a hole in the center of our pan to let it come through to find the center of this pan

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.939
I'm going to just try and balance it on the tip of a pen until it's staying in one spot

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.218
That'll let me know where the middle of the pan is

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.999
There we go, we've got a balance point

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.449
If we're off by a couple of millimeters here there. It's really not gonna make a difference so this point will work

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.500
We want to drill a hole

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.359
That's big enough that the widest part of our quarter inch copper elbow fitting will fit through the hole

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:12.519
It's so close so you can see that the drill bit fits inside the copper fitting right there

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:19.449
Which makes sense because it's designed to fit 3/8 inch pipe here. Let's try the next size up it might be too large

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.038
Definitely big enough, but it's really a lot more than we want so I think

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:27.968
let's take our 3/8 inch drill bit and

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.260
Then we'll just sort of wiggle it around inside the pan a little bit to open up the hole

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.800
Here we go

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.410
Beautiful our copper fitting now fits through that hole. Let's look at the layout

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:55.249
We're gonna want for our copper pipes our vinyl tube fits perfectly into this three-eighths to 1/4 inch copper adapter

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.169
It's a pretty snug fit, too

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:02.779
So I'm really not worried about any gas leaking out of it the fuel will travel up the tube through this copper fitting

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.799
We'll have another piece of copper connecting these two then we'll have this elbow

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.079
Which will run out another straight piece of copper tube connected to that will be a second elbow?

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:18.470
We'll have a nice tight circle of copper tubing that comes back to about right here to be finished off with an end cap

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.760
Let's start by bending the copper tube that we need in our circle and cutting that off

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:28.189
I got this copper pipe at Lowe's it came in a coil about three. Maybe four feet long and a cardboard box

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:33.260
I think it was about five bucks copper is very flexible which makes it easier to bend into a circle

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.169
But you do have to be careful because if you bend it too aggressively

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.099
It will kink in the middle, and then the gas won't be able to flow through the piping well

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:43.549
I want a nice clean edge to start our copper pipe so first

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.240
I'm just gonna cut this off using a hacksaw should want to be pretty gentle

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.419
Putting in the vise because since copper is so soft it

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.190
Could very easily get squished in the vise here. I just want it to hold it in place

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.700
There we go we have a much cleaner edge on this now

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.279
let's just take a file and clean it up a little bit more -

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.549
If we've cut the end of our pipe off nicely it should fit into the end of our elbow piece

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:18.170
Perfect with the end of our pipe cut we now want to bend it into a circle with a diameter of four to five inches

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.160
You can see that the copper pipe is fairly easy to bend even with just your hands

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:29.599
You can also see that as unbending it. It is getting narrower than it is when it's unbent

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.319
This is what I meant when I said you have to be careful if you were to bend it too hard

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.240
We would get a kink in the pipe there. We go. I think that's bent into a pretty good circle

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.849
It's fairly tight it hasn't kinked too badly. I do have one spot here where it started to smash the tube

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.910
I'm going to see if I can use a pair of pliers and get that out a little bit

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.440
It shouldn't cause any problems

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.080
It's definitely still wide enough that the gas can flow through it

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.799
But just to make it a little bit nicer see if we can bring that back out a little

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.200
Okay, I think that popped out a little bit now we want to cut off the excess of our copper pipe

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.309
Let's do that right about there. I didn't really like using the vise on the copper

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:05.900
I thought it was pinching it a little too much

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.410
So I'm just gonna try and hold it down using this wooden block in my own bodyweight

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.840
Of course I should be using a pipe cutter rather than a hacksaw, but I don't have one

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.809
Let's just use our file and clean up that edge a little bit

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:33.020
Alright and our cap fits nicely on the end of that now we need to cut off a section of our quarter inch copper pipe

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.680
to connect these two pieces

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:40.760
There we go that's a pretty nice straight section of pipe, so we'll cut out the rest of our fittings from that part

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:57.500
We've got our little fitting of course let's take our file and clean it up so it fits nicely into both of our pieces

00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:02.839
That it looks good

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.539
There we go both pieces are fitting just the way we want them to

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:15.440
With our regulator in place our 3/8 inch vinyl tubing should fit very snugly over the nozzle in fact

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.479
It's snug enough that when I twist it

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.760
I can get it to fit down onto the threads and that actually helps tighten it into place the reason

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:28.909
I'm using vinyl tubing instead of metal hardware is that I could not find any other metal hardware that fit nicely

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:35.749
Onto this thread it seems to be a size that doesn't conform the standard threading so clearly we have way more

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.050
Tubing that is going to be necessary in fact

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.299
I think we want to cut it down so it's only about three quarters of an inch tall

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.370
It's nice and snug

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.329
Into our copper there we go

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.930
And if we drop that down into the bottom of the container

00:11:02.139 --> 00:11:07.439
We can see how long of a fitting we need to connect from the source of the fuel up into our metal Pam

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:12.690
I'm gonna do a little test I cut this one-inch piece to connect our elbow into our circle

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.620
I'm gonna see if that's close to the right size to connect these other two pieces

00:11:17.079 --> 00:11:19.229
This length of pipe does seem to be working

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.230
But this particular piece of pipe is only

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:29.189
Barely inside this connection point so I'm going to measure this pieces length, and then cut another piece. That's about 1/4 inch longer

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.870
All right fits there pretty nicely

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.920
Magnets

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.440
Looks like it fits there great -

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.790
That looks like a perfect fit

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.809
We've now got all of our pieces cut out shaped and ready to assemble so come back tomorrow

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:01.850
It will show you how to permanently attach them all together and form them into a beautiful tabletop firepit

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.189
