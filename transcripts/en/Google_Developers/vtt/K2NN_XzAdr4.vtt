00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:04.980
Hello.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.935
My name's Marcel and I work
as a data analytics enthusiast

00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:09.220
at Futurelytics startup.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.560
Today, I will show
you how I use BigQuery

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.180
to find who are my most
valuable customers.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.280
So the basic insight
of the Pareto rule

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.090
is it takes 20% of your most
valuable customers, which

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.420
brings you 80% of your revenue.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.370
In this example, I
will show you how

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:36.080
to use BigQuery to show you
the most valuable contributors

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.590
on Wikipedia.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.020
Data is taken from other
public data sets, which

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.090
is available on a
BigQuery console,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.845
so you can play
with the basic SQL.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.970
For the basic calculation of the
Pareto rule on a Wikipedia data

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.550
set, we should start with
a basic calculation, which

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.129
is the number of edited
pages for each contributor,

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.790
for content creator.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.215
So we will run this
simple query and we

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:12.620
will be able to see the
Contributor ID and the number

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.730
of pages he edited.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.090
This basic calculation is
used for advanced calculations

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.320
of the Pareto rule.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:40.790
This one, this one,
this one, this one.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.660
There is the basic
calculation we used first,

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.660
and we calculate the running
totals of each contributor

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.375
so we will be able to divide
each contributor in two groups,

00:01:56.375 --> 00:02:00.160
if the contributor is
important or if it's

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.285
a small contributor with a
small amount of edited pages.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.005
The results show us some
running totals numbers

00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:12.690
and the total contribution
per contributor.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.580
From these calculations,
we are able to divide

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.800
those contributors
in a specific group.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.350
In this example, we have the
basic query, and a second query

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.055
which helps us to calculate
the running total metrics.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.260
I chose the wrong query.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.790
Should use this one.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.760
Again, in this query,
we have the basic query,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.800
which we use to
start, the second,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.500
which helps us to calculate
the running totals.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.980
And we are really interested in
how many important contributors

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.360
Wikipedia has, so we
will put this query

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.150
into another one,
which allows us

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.155
to count the number of
contributors in each group.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.920
So the result is
that Wikipedia has

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.510
26,000 important contributors,
and 4,400,000 small ones.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:47.600
From the calculation of Pareto,
we found that there is no 20%

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.140
of the most valuable
contributors.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.890
There is only 8% of the most
valuable which brings you

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.370
80% of valuable
content on Wikipedia.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.606
We used this basic
calculation when

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:00.980
we started building
Futurelytics.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.980
For us, it was the
simplest way how

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.790
to find the most valuable
and less valuable customers.
