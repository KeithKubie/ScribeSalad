00:00:00.974 --> 00:00:01.807
(mouse clicks)

00:00:01.807 --> 00:00:05.140
(soft electronic music)

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.523
- When we think of the distinct claims,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.470
dependence, developmental modulation,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.470
promise, and innocence,
those are the main components

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.320
that drive a public understanding

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.903
of our current conception of childhood.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.143
The reality, of course, is this.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.070
Many of you have met Omran Daqneesh

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.160
through this photograph.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.140
Omran was a child pulled out of the rubble

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.510
in Aleppo, Syria after bombardment

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.053
by Russian and Syrian jets.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.650
This photograph went viral

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.910
because of its compelling imagery

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.633
and how it challenges
the four distinct claims

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.863
that I just went through
before, particularly innocence.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.060
Now, the thing to remember
about Omran Daqneesh,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.990
this is a tragic occurrence,
tragic photograph,

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.510
but it's not unique.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.020
On the same day that this
photograph was taken,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.910
there were 12 other children his age

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.533
pulled out of the same rubble,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.890
taken to the same emergency room,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.790
that this photograph captures
not something unusual

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.433
or unique, but something
that had become routine.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.230
What I'm going to discuss is the reality

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.180
that this photograph represents,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.180
and this is what kids like
Omran were confronting

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.083
on a daily basis for
more than seven years.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.800
The implications of, how do we protect,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.700
and how do we respond
to this kind of assault

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.700
will be my conversation for
the next half hour or so.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.870
We also have a special focus

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.720
on the particular
vulnerabilities and strengths

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.710
of children with disabilities

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.930
caught up in violent conflict.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.340
To begin, let's recognize that children

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.380
caught up in armed
conflict is not unusual.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.700
These are countries, different levels

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.140
of armed violence as of a few weeks ago.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.290
It's not unusual that about a quarter

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.040
of the world's children are living

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.143
in places in armed conflict.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.630
This is common, and our work at Stanford,

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.260
here at UCSF, with
colleagues around the world

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.550
is trying to address the implications,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.640
both protective implications

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.640
as well as response
implications, of this fact.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.130
The other thing to remember is that most

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.880
of our protections for civilians,

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.850
particularly for children, were built

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.410
after World War II.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.350
The Geneva Conventions particularly,

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.120
most international
humanitarian law came about

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.830
after World War II.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.920
Interstate wars, France fighting Germany,

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.460
US fighting Japan, but if you look

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.170
at where violent conflict
is taking place now

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.420
in the world, it's totally dominated

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.313
by intrastate, what many
would call civil wars,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.430
and most of these wars are protracted.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.590
They're not two, three, four-year wars,

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.400
which is long enough, of course,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.660
but some can go on for decades,

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.000
like in the Eastern Congo
and the North and South Kivu,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.690
and even in Syria and Iraq now,

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.720
the wars decade long,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.600
Afghanistan approaching several decades.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.250
These are protracted civil wars

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.973
that we are talking about.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.930
One, particularly, that I will use

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.930
as a case is the battle that took place

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.780
in northern Iraq in the city of Mosul.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.060
It's Iraq's second largest city.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.137
It was taken over by ISIS 2014,

00:04:46.137 --> 00:04:51.137
and the battle for Mosul was
the Iraqi security forces

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.330
with US coalition
backing taking Mosul back

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.583
in the fall of 2016, 2017.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.343
This is Mosul before the battle.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.653
This is Mosul after the battle.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.440
There's virtually complete destruction,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.830
and it took not several
months, which was expected.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.260
It took nine months, and we were part

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.260
of a small team that were tasked

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.700
with evaluating the international response

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.773
to this, civilian casualties,

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.180
which had become extremely controversial

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.763
for several different reasons,

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.910
but our job was basically to see

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.460
how, in fact, civilians were cared for,

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.370
protected during this battle

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.690
that lasted more than nine months,

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.683
and basically destroyed the whole city.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.810
We were looking at how groups

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.380
not only in Mosul, but are in the theater,

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.710
including Syria, like
here, the White Helmets,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.040
responded to civilian casualties,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.400
and particularly for
me, as a pediatrician,

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.943
responded to the needs of children.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.290
Now, when we think about the impact of war

00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:28.310
on human beings, but
particularly on children,

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.210
the first thing to recognize
is that there's a category

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.570
of effects that we would
call direct effects.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.173
They are exposure to bullets and bombs.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.640
It's primarily trauma, and
mortality is the crucial impact,

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.623
but there's also morbidity.

00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:58.771
The human toll in terms of morbidity

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.630
from direct exposure to bombs and bullets,

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.910
to combat operations,
is usually between five

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.800
and 10 times greater than the mortality.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.540
If we know that 100 people died,

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.670
we can expect that the disabilities

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.440
and the ongoing morbidity
associated with being exposed

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.853
to those battles is between
five and 10 times greater.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.880
I'm going to show you this little guy

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.190
who I met in Mosul about a month

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.933
after the fighting had died down.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:40.080
He's a little guy who
had his foot amputated

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:45.500
because he was exposed
to an explosive device

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:50.320
that was triggered by ISIS.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:56.350
The thing that is particularly compelling

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.580
about this child was not only

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.883
that he was badly injured,

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.860
but it also reflected something

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.400
about the changing nature of warfare,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.200
and the changing nature of combatants

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.710
that is important to address, to confront,

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.440
as we think about children in war now.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.450
That is that this little guy's mother

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:26.773
and father were both ISIS suicide bombers.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:32.630
He was orphaned because
both parents had triggered

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:37.630
suicide vests as they
approached Iraqi security forces

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.393
on the front line.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.910
This is dynamic, and the challenges

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:48.283
to children are dynamic as well.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.630
The also important mental
health implications

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:58.290
of this exposure to such violence,

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.290
we did a study in Bosnia
during the Bosnian fighting.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.083
This was in a camp.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:14.420
Most of the children that we
interviewed were in the camp

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.730
for less than six months,

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.990
but the experience that they had,

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.043
which is mimicked in Iraq and Syria,

00:09:23.043 --> 00:09:27.930
many of the other places that
I'll discuss, is profound,

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.120
that separation, death in the family,

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.680
witnessing violence to a family member

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.973
was pretty close to universal.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.880
We had a bunch of different outcomes

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.870
that we looked at, but
virtually all the kids had had

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.020
deep emotional trauma, and we don't know

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.960
what happened to them
subsequent to our study

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.220
because the camp members were dispersed

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.440
soon after our interviews,

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.650
but the expectation is that this kind

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:09.343
of morbidity continued for years to come.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.670
But in addition to the direct effects

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.850
of being exposed to bombs and bullets

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.823
are the indirect effects.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.020
The indirect effects come not because

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:26.570
they were maimed, or injured, or killed

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.790
by exploding ordnance or by bullets.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.850
It's because they have been affected

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.100
by the destruction of
the essentials of life,

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.000
what happened to food supplies,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.210
what happened to shelter, what
happened to water supplies

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.690
in the face of conflict,

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:49.620
and displacement becomes dramatic

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.503
in these kinds of scenarios.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.800
Most displaced people
in war, children in war,

00:10:58.937 --> 00:11:03.937
are what we call IDPs,
internally displaced persons.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.360
They're not refugees.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.000
They do not cross borders.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.120
They are someplace else
in their home country,

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.463
but seeking shelter someplace else.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.410
The displacement coming
out of the Middle East,

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:21.410
Central Africa, Myanmar,
now Latin America,

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.493
can be dramatic.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:29.680
There's also destruction of
healthcare infrastructure,

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.050
and these are photographs taken

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:37.050
of direct hits, targeted hits
against health infrastructure

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.810
in different areas of the world.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.170
Here, in the Middle East, this is an MSF,

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.100
Doctors Without Borders, facility

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.100
that was hit by Syrian bombs
several times in Syria.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:55.430
This is very recent.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.600
This is just a few weeks ago.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.500
This is in North Kivu.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.890
This is one of the
Ebola treatment centers,

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:06.890
because we have an outbreak
of Ebola in a war zone,

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:12.430
in North Kivu in the
Democratic Republic of Congo,

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.740
but because of the complexity

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.410
of the political situation,
the changing nature

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:23.410
of militias aligning with the government,

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.713
with the UN peacekeepers,
or with other militias,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
unknown assailants came in and burned down

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
the MSF Ebola facility in
North Kivu just recently.

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:42.460
MSF had to shut down its
Ebola activities in the area

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:47.460
despite the fact that the Ebola
epidemic continues to grow.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.310
Also, the social fabric of
community life evaporates,

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.980
and that social fabric is critical

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.573
to the protection of children.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:04.493
One manifestation, a deeply
tragic manifestation, is rape.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.360
More and more information is coming out

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.453
that victims of sexual
assault in these situations,

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.950
the assailants are not
only roving militias

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.670
or armies that are coming through,

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.130
but in fact, the assailants are people

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:28.420
that the victims know, that the breakdown

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:32.610
of community relations,
community protections

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:37.600
when people are displaced, when they begin

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.240
to flee violent assault, those protections

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.890
of community life begin to break down,

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:49.890
and the prohibitions to things like rape

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:55.150
by people who victims
know begin to evaporate,

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.470
and you get situations like we've had

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.510
in the Kivus for the last 20 years.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.490
When I was in North
Kivu, I saw this poster,

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.380
and found it particularly compelling

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.130
in recognizing, by local people,

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:16.410
what the challenge of sexual assault

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.543
in the area continues to be.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:22.820
If you look at the statistics,

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.790
and this is from some
tabulations that we did,

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:31.060
of looking at direct, bombs
and bullet, mortality,

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:33.660
and mortality from the indirect effects,

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:36.220
the destruction of the essentials of life

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:40.570
in different conflicts,
we began to compare,

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.910
and what you can see is that,

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:45.280
in most of these major conflicts,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.803
indirect effects are much
larger than the direct effects,

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.730
that the longterm implications,

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.670
particularly for children,
of destroying the essentials

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:04.670
of life becomes more dramatic
than the direct effects.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.410
Now, what does that look like?

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:09.690
Well, this is a study that was done

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:14.690
in Darfur in Western Sudan.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.090
At the height of the fighting,

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.940
they looked at mortality, and there was,

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.500
of course, excess mortality,
but the vast majority

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.840
of that excess mortality was not due

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.610
to violence, directly speaking.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.780
It was the indirect effect
that was most dramatic.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:37.780
It was the indirect effects
that were predominant.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.990
Same thing in the Eastern Congo,

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.473
and this is for little
kids, less than five.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:49.430
You could see what the causal epidemiology

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:50.690
of young child mortality was.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:53.300
Now, the mortality was elevated,

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.090
but for people who do global child health,

00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:00.220
you'll recognize, this is
exactly the same distribution

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.610
of causes as you get in global
settings all over the world.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:08.263
It's just that the absolute
rates were elevated,

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:12.430
that the indirect effects take on the form

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:17.013
that always are threatening
kids in these situations.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.380
This is what it looks like.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.930
This is an indirect effect.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.333
This is malnutrition.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:27.023
This is malaria.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.870
This is starvation.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:32.713
This is cholera.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.630
The thing to remember
about all of these causes

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:42.630
of death is that 75% of all of
these deaths are preventable

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:49.083
with interventions that we have right now.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.430
We don't need to come up, UCSF, Stanford,

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:54.263
doesn't need to come up

00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:56.340
with any brilliant new interventions.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.790
With interventions we have now,

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:03.300
we could prevent 75% of the
indirect deaths associated

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.423
with conflict around the world.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.970
If you look at something
like neonatal mortality,

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.780
and you just list the country

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.520
with the highest neonatal
mortality in the world,

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.700
and then you just keep going down,

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:21.700
the top 20, they're all
countries in conflict.

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.300
It's important to recognize

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.170
that global child health
is increasingly becoming

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:32.050
global child health in conflict

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.360
because so much of the
residual child mortality

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.433
is now occurring in places at war.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.240
I'm going to describe one case

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.240
that we've been examining in detail

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.610
over the last several months,

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:53.193
and that is the cholera epidemic in Yemen.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:00.730
This cholera epidemic
is the largest epidemic

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.763
of cholera in recorded history.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.270
Yemen remains the worst
humanitarian catastrophe

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:11.873
on the planet today.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:16.720
This is what cholera and
malnutrition look like.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.180
This is what the indirect effects

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.953
of war look like.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.490
Part of our team was looking

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:31.690
at the cholera
preparedness, the treatment,

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:35.480
the epidemiology, but our
job at Stanford was to look

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.930
at what Saudi airstrikes and the blockade

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:43.840
by Saudi and US forces have been doing

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.870
to the humanitarian situation,

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.903
particularly the cholera, in Yemen.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:55.820
What we found was things
that look like this.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.130
This is a desalination plant

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.680
on the west coast of Yemen,

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.510
and there's heavy reliance on desalination

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.543
because of where they're located.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.960
This is after a double
tap Saudi airstrike.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.823
Double tap is, they hit it,

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:15.530
they assess what damage they've done,

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.150
and then come back the
next day to finish it off.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:21.730
This was not inadvertent
collateral damage,

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.520
that the Saudi airstrikes were attempting

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.320
to destroy water infrastructure

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.330
to put pressure on the civilian population

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.240
that was considered to be supportive

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.693
to the Houthi rebels backed by Iran.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:39.830
This is the destroyed
Coca Cola bottling plant

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:43.590
that also bottled water in Yemen

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.700
after a double tag strike.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.607
We found evidence for 74 or so airstrikes

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.960
on water infrastructure,
civilian water infrastructure

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.510
in Yemen that we feel contributing

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:01.293
to the cholera outbreak.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:08.710
People with disabilities
are at enhanced risk

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:12.670
in these situations,
particularly the direct effects,

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:16.193
but even moreso, the
longer-term indirect effects.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.400
The literature on what happens

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.690
to kids with disabilities,

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.210
particularly developmental disabilities,

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.980
is relatively nonexistent, but we know

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.740
that there are 93 million kids

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:36.860
in the world with disabilities.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.440
We also know that they tend

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.100
to have at least double
the mortality rates

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:47.100
from direct effects
because of the difficulties

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.120
in fleeing and seeking shelter
in conflict situations.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.030
They're also more likely to
be abandoned or separated,

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:59.790
which also holds important implications

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:01.660
for indirect effects.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.890
They lose meds, assisted devices,

00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:07.290
and we know that they
are at increased risk,

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:09.923
particularly if they're
girls, of sexual assault.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:16.270
Again, these are in the curricula,

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.120
but the data that we have

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.160
just speak to enhanced vulnerabilities,

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.160
and as a pediatrician working in areas

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:32.120
with complex political
environments and violence,

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.960
this is a special concern for us,

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.720
particularly in areas
affected by indirect effects.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.410
There are vulnerabilities,
there are structural challenges

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:46.520
because of their exclusion
from the main mechanisms

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.600
of protection, of escape, and provision

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.163
that exist in these very
complicated places to be.

00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:00.980
Also that their strengths
are rarely taken advantage of

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:07.490
in preparedness, in
addressing the challenges

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.550
that confront these communities

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.510
when they are under stress.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.610
One thing that does come through

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:19.350
in many of the experiences,
in the journals,

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:23.170
and even in some of the analytic pieces

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:27.240
is how children with disabilities,

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:32.240
developmental disabilities,
rally to provide leadership,

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:36.310
to provide guidance for
the communities in need.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:39.800
It's something that remains an advantage,

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.943
but that is rarely
exploited in the real world.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:51.300
To finish, I'm going to discuss children

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.030
in a complex political
environment driven by violence,

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.750
and that is kids in detention

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.970
on our southern border.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:06.970
I've had the privilege of
visiting separated detained kids

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.320
in detention centers on the US border

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.170
over the last six months.

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:13.220
In two weeks, I'll be going

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.333
to the detention center in Homestead.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:22.760
A more detailed discussion
of immigrant kids,

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.560
the trauma, the implications, longterm,

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.350
Fernando will be talking
about in a few minutes.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:33.803
I'm going to focus on the
political dynamics here.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:42.030
These are the places that kids are held

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:45.160
in the first week or
so of their detention.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.860
They come through a system that was built

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:53.860
for young adult males because
it was primarily Mexican,

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.940
young adult males that were caught up

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.733
in US border detention
facilities for decades,

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:07.150
but now, 65% of the
people who are detained

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:14.300
on our US southern
border are families, 65%,

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:19.220
and this has changed primarily

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:23.030
since the separation policy was instituted

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.850
by the Trump administration.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.850
I know it sounds paradoxical.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:30.020
I didn't make a mistake,
but the big increase

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.530
in kids coming across
the border has occurred

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:38.130
since the institution of
the separation policy.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:38.963
Why?

00:24:38.963 --> 00:24:41.080
It's a complicated set of reasons

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.150
that we can get into in the Q&amp;A,

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.890
but the reality is that the border patrol,

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:49.440
the US government, is unprepared

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.143
to handle all these
families with children.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.780
They are no longer routinely
separating young kids

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.383
from parent on the border.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.450
I said routinely.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:04.330
There are still separations taking place,

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:07.800
but this is the tent city that was set up,

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.053
Tornillo, Texas, outside of El Paso,

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.250
to hold kids who were either unaccompanied

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.620
when they came across or were separated

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:21.440
from their families as soon
as they came into detention.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.940
This is the Casa Padre facility,

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:27.350
you can see it's an old
Walmart, in Brownsville, Texas,

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:30.253
that holds about 1,500 kids.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:36.890
I was there in late spring,
early summer, about three weeks

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.530
after the separation
policy had been rescinded,

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:46.210
but there were thousands
of separated kids,

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.193
some as small as six months of age,

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:54.370
that were in detention or had been placed

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.540
in foster care in cities
across the country,

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.123
Chicago, Minneapolis, New York City.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:06.610
One child that I
interviewed in Brownsville,

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:11.340
David, and they were
virtually all Guatemalan,

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.473
they're all Central Americans,

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.600
but this one little kid, David,

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.760
just full disclosure, I've been working

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.970
in Highland Guatemala for 48 years now,

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:28.490
since college, freshman year of college,

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:30.960
and David was 10 years of age,

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.683
had been separated from his mom,

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.390
had been in detention
for about seven weeks,

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:38.973
had no clue what was
happening with his case.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.800
I was there with lawyers,

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.500
'cause they're allowed to go in

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.460
because of court order.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.070
I went with them, and the lawyer

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.840
who was speaking to David first has to go

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.200
through a script, a humane script

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.920
that says, if you're not comfortable

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.770
answering these questions, don't answer.

00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:00.363
If you want us to stop, just say so,

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.430
obviously, in Spanish.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.660
The lawyer spoke very good Spanish,

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.210
going through the script,

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:10.290
more legal, legal, legal, legal, legal,

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.623
kind, but pretty much legalese.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.250
Then she stopped, and turned to David,

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:18.097
and said, "How are you doing?"

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.387
David thought for a second and said,

00:27:22.387 --> 00:27:23.587
"I miss my mommy."

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.880
These are little kids caught up

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.703
in a system built for adult males.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:38.803
We don't know how many kids
were actually separated,

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.550
but we do know that there
have been two deaths

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:47.463
of young children in US
detention facilities,

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.470
two little Guatemalan kids,

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:56.060
same kids that we had been caring for

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.350
in their home villages in the Highlands,

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.670
indigenous Highlands of Guatemala.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:03.920
Now, the specifics of what happened

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:10.190
in these deaths, I can't speak to

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.253
because I don't know all the details,

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:19.070
but my strong view in
knowing what I do know

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:24.063
is that this was a failure
that was systematic,

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:28.690
that 200 people are apprehended

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.910
by one border patrol agent on a border

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:36.070
in a remote location,
taken to a holding facility

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:41.070
about an hour away, the holding
facility is basically cells

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:47.240
to process people, then taken
to a second processing center

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:51.220
another few hours away,
and they may be held

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.480
in those facilities for days,

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.150
up to a week, sometimes, even longer

00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:01.230
before the kids, and now, with the parent,

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:06.230
will be taken to either a
holding facility for families,

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:11.250
the vast majority are
released with a court date

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:14.463
to present for asylum-seeking.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:19.100
These kids died during that first week,

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:24.100
during the first few days
in that detention process.

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:28.980
That the system makes
it extremely dangerous

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.220
for children in these settings,

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.070
particularly if you get sick.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:36.620
These were kids who were previously well

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:40.360
who died in detention, in custody

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.663
because of acute illness.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:50.650
Now, many people I've
spoken to around the country

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.693
about these issues will
have strong opinions.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.730
I'll talk to strong Trump-backers,

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.773
anti-immigrant, hardcore.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.860
Virtually all will say

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.303
that the separation policy was a mistake,

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:13.750
that even the hardcore
anti-immigrant group

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.780
will say, look, this was a mistake,

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.340
it should never have happened,

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:20.590
but what you also hear all the time is

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:23.170
that it's the parents' fault

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:27.100
because they are irresponsible
to put these kids

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.740
into these risky situations,
with the risk of death,

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:35.740
but also, look, you put the
kid in this risky position,

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:40.770
getting separated, it's
irresponsible parenting

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:43.903
that puts the kid at
risk, not our policies.

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:46.620
There are irresponsible parents

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.970
that try to game the system

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.803
who do put kids at risk.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.110
However, I want to show you this slide.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.450
Now, you're not gonna be able

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:58.530
to necessarily read all of this,

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:02.070
but this is violent death rates

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:05.753
by country for the most
violent places on earth.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:11.330
Syria is the most violent place on earth,

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:15.453
the highest death rates,
but look what's number two.

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:18.160
Salvador.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:23.160
Number three, Venezuela,
Honduras, neck and neck.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.363
Then you get Afghanistan.

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:29.820
Go down the list, then you get Somalia,

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:33.880
then you get Yemen, and the
area that I work in most,

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:37.950
Guatemala, is up there on this list.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:42.070
In other words, the places
with the greatest risk

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:44.660
of violent death other than Syria

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.123
are exactly where these
people are leaving,

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:53.840
that it would be irresponsible not to flee

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:56.920
with your child if you are living

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.480
in parts of these countries afflicted

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.350
by primarily criminal violence

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:06.540
that is at an epidemic proportion.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:11.540
These are dangerous places
to live and to work,

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.410
so when people suggest
that placing a child

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:18.180
in this situation is irresponsible,

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.260
remember that slide, and remember

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:27.570
what the implications for
your child's wellbeing

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:32.300
as they grow up into being
adolescents and young adults,

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:36.910
what their prospects are,
what their promise would be

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.400
in settings like Venezuela,

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.360
settings like Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras,

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:50.763
precisely where all these
families are coming from.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:56.090
A recent report by the
inspector general basically said

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:58.560
that we have no clue how many kids

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:02.600
we separated from their
parents on the border,

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.330
and as most of you will remember,

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.830
they even lost track of which
kid belonged to which parent

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:12.500
because they entered into two systems,

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:17.180
and headquarters basically
told the people responsible

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.163
on the front line, do this now.

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:24.140
People, in some ways, tried their best

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:28.720
to have data systems that
kept the connection together,

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.560
but they were told, separate.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.070
They lost track of which kid
belonged to which parent.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:36.550
Parents were deported,

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:39.770
the kids were in New York, six months old,

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:43.960
and they had no clue which kid was which,

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.210
and what parent they belonged to.

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.610
Now, I told you I was gonna talk

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:51.530
about the worst and the best in the world.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.763
I mostly talked to you about the worst.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:58.770
That's my job, particularly
for an audience like this,

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:02.653
of professionals and strong
public advocates for children,

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.580
but there is also best.

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.610
The resilience of these kids

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:11.513
and their families is overwhelming.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:17.070
People ask, is this
extremely depressing work,

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:18.830
to be working in war zones

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.720
and areas of violence, and the answer,

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.260
of course, it's deeply
troubling and distressing,

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.360
sometimes, terribly depressing,

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.503
but it's also remarkably
rewarding and invigorating.

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:32.360
I often say when I come back

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.130
from my time in Guatemala,

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:36.700
I'm there every couple of months,

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.973
I come back exhausted and
energized at the same time.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.920
It's experiences like this,

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:47.453
a child in Iraq who I met,

00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:51.750
that make it rewarding, invigorating,

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:54.360
energizing, and then you meet people

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.900
like Sister Norma in McAllen, Texas,

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.423
who runs a Catholic
charity's respite center.

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.960
Basically, families are in lock up.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.240
They get released en masse.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.650
They walk two blocks, like a caravan,

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:13.140
down the street with
their little belongings

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:16.407
to Sister Norma, and Sister Norma

00:35:16.407 --> 00:35:19.180
and the respite center will provide them

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.390
with hot meals, guidance,

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:23.710
because they all have bus tickets,

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.260
'cause they're given bus tickets to go

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:26.780
to wherever they're gonna go,

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.550
and the bus station is nearby,

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:32.230
but before they do, they're given showers,

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:36.710
food, clothing, and,
at times, medical care,

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:41.710
medical care provided by volunteers

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:44.680
from around the country that come in

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:49.410
for a week at a time and
see a bunch of patients,

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:54.270
but it may be an adult
neurologist seeing six-year-olds

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:59.270
who just came through, could
be a month, in detention,

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:05.100
months coming up from Central America.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.580
This is what global
health used to look like

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.133
20 or 30 years ago.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:15.010
One of our efforts with
colleagues at UCSF,

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:19.760
and Baylor, and groups in New York is

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:24.760
to elevate the needs of
these facilities caring

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.490
for families leaving detention

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:30.800
before they disperse around the country,

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.210
and particularly once they get

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:33.650
to wherever they're gonna go

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:37.463
to have exquisitely high
quality pediatric followup.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.200
That this should not only rely

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.560
on Sister Norma and Catholic charities.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.950
We need to strengthen in places,

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:52.950
build an infrastructure
of pediatric social work,

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:59.127
nursing, care that is responsive

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:05.230
to the needs, responsive to
the demands of these families.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:17.440
In closing, my suggestion
is that your expertise,

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.670
the importance of what's
gonna be discussed

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:25.120
in this conference is directly relevant

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.343
to the future of kids in war,

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:33.270
both in public advocacy, but also because

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.610
of your technical expertise

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:38.150
and longstanding
commitment to the wellbeing

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:41.513
of children in complex
social environments.

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:47.420
My bottom line is that, while I've talked

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.503
about the worst in the world,

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:54.430
child death, disabling conditions,

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:57.120
morbidity, emotional trauma,

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.260
that's really very hard
for all of us to fathom.

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:03.963
It is also the domain
of compassionate care,

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:10.210
of a basic humanity in the face
of traumatic horrors of war.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:14.982
Thank you.
