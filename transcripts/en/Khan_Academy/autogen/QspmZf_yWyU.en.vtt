00:00:00.354 --> 00:00:01.526
 We have other videos we talk about 

00:00:01.526 --> 00:00:03.883
 about how small molecules or ions 

00:00:03.883 --> 00:00:07.238
 can pass through the cell membrane 

00:00:07.238 --> 00:00:09.990
 in different ways - active, passive 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.952
 or relieved. 

00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:13.392
 In this video I want to talk 

00:00:13.392 --> 00:00:16.050
 about what's going on with larger objects. 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.790
 We will focus on 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.019
 transporting bigger things. 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.320
 Transport. 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.492
 In the first example 

00:00:23.492 --> 00:00:26.917
 you can imagine this cell 

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:29.553
 with the purple membrane swallowing up 

00:00:29.553 --> 00:00:30.992
 this great green thing that can be 

00:00:30.992 --> 00:00:33.082
 bacteria. 

00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:34.951
 You see the membrane - 

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:35.892
 Let's make things clearer. 

00:00:35.892 --> 00:00:38.539
 It's inside. 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:40.188
 This is the inside of the cage. 

00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:42.022
 It's outside. 

00:00:42.022 --> 00:00:43.195
 This is the environment outside the cage. 

00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:44.553
 You can see that the cell membrane starts to 

00:00:44.553 --> 00:00:46.561
 envelops 

00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:49.081
 this bacterium, 

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:51.217
 finally wrap it completely 

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.226
 and the membrane 

00:00:53.226 --> 00:00:55.826
 is torn off. Now the bacteria 

00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:58.450
 is inside the cage 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.959
 and is embraced by this layer of membrane. 

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:03.953
 This process of swallowing large objects 

00:01:03.953 --> 00:01:06.623
 is called phagocytosis. 

00:01:06.623 --> 00:01:09.387
 This is phago - 

00:01:09.387 --> 00:01:12.556
 Phagocytosis. 

00:01:12.556 --> 00:01:15.679
 The prefix "phago" 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:17.920
 comes from the Greek word for "eat". 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.927
 It can literally be translated as a cellular meal. 

00:01:20.927 --> 00:01:23.516
 Very often, this thing here 

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.327
 can be considered as food for the cage. 

00:01:25.327 --> 00:01:29.114
 This compartment keeps 

00:01:29.114 --> 00:01:31.295
 the bacteria to be transported 

00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:33.489
 to the lysozyme, for example, to be processed 

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:35.172
 and courageous. 

00:01:35.172 --> 00:01:37.285
 We can call this big compartment, 

00:01:37.285 --> 00:01:38.922
 surrounded by a membrane, 

00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:42.382
 food vacuum. 

00:01:42.382 --> 00:01:43.752
 Nutritional. 

00:01:43.752 --> 00:01:46.806
 Food baguette. 

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:51.055
 This scenario below is similar but slightly different. 

00:01:51.055 --> 00:01:52.785
 Here we have the cage, 

00:01:52.785 --> 00:01:55.084
 we see part of its membrane 

00:01:55.084 --> 00:01:56.488
 in the manga. 

00:01:56.488 --> 00:01:58.056
 We also see the dual phospholipid layer, 

00:01:58.056 --> 00:02:02.084
 that is why I have marked the two-line membranes. 

00:02:02.084 --> 00:02:05.451
 Instead of swallowing a large particle or bacterium, 

00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:08.017
 this cell absorbs some liquid. 

00:02:08.017 --> 00:02:09.561
 Swallows some liquid, you see how it starts 

00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:11.686
 to wrap this part of the liquid, 

00:02:11.686 --> 00:02:13.694
 it embraces it even more, 

00:02:13.694 --> 00:02:15.656
 then the membrane that is around the liquid, 

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:18.118
 completely detaches and stays in the cage. 

00:02:18.118 --> 00:02:20.556
 I draw all this in two dimensions, 

00:02:20.556 --> 00:02:22.286
 but it happens in three. 

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:23.725
 This is not just a circle, 

00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:25.850
 but a sphere. 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.358
 This thing will tear apart 

00:02:28.358 --> 00:02:31.690
 and now it will be inside the cell, we call it a secretory bubble or vesicle. 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.290
 This is a common term for these cell compartments, 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.019
 surrounded by a membrane. 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.190
 This process, in which the cell actually 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.757
 Drinking different liquids 

00:02:42.487 --> 00:02:44.995
 is called pinocytosis. 

00:02:44.995 --> 00:02:46.292
 Pinocytosis. 

00:02:46.852 --> 00:02:50.126
 Pinocytosis. 

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:52.924
 A "pino" comes from the Greek word for "drink". 

00:02:52.924 --> 00:02:54.852
 The roots and origin of words have always been very interesting to me. 

00:02:54.852 --> 00:02:57.288
 I'm not an expert in linguistics, 

00:02:57.288 --> 00:02:59.424
 but it's quite interesting to know in other languages ​​I'm familiar with 

00:02:59.424 --> 00:03:02.024
 such as Hund and Urdu, 

00:03:02.024 --> 00:03:04.360
 smoke "pins" means "drink". 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.624
 It may also be related to the word "panni" 

00:03:06.624 --> 00:03:08.691
 in these languages. 

00:03:08.691 --> 00:03:10.723
 All these words have a common linguistic root, 

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.655
 it's always very interesting to see 

00:03:12.655 --> 00:03:14.484
 such linguistic ties. 

00:03:14.484 --> 00:03:17.886
 So, this is pinocytosis, we can say that to her 

00:03:17.886 --> 00:03:19.891
 the cell drinks and takes up the substances that are contained 

00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:21.427
 in the liquid. 

00:03:21.427 --> 00:03:23.923
 In phagocytosis the cell eats. 

00:03:23.923 --> 00:03:26.489
 These are two specific cases. 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.590
 We can also use a more general term, 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.158
 to indicate the swallowing of different objects from the cell, 

00:03:30.158 --> 00:03:32.851
 this is a singlety. 

00:03:32.851 --> 00:03:38.110
 Unicytosis. 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.280
 Phagocytosis is a type of endocytosis, 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.158
 pinocytosis is also a type of endocytosis. 

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:46.481
 Your next question may be, 

00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.757
 "Well, I understand that these processes are happening, 

00:03:48.757 --> 00:03:51.114
 can be observed under a microscope, 

00:03:51.114 --> 00:03:52.460
 but how exactly are they going? " 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.119
 "How does the cell enclose an object and the membrane breaks off?" 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:57.151
 In many videos I like to say, 

00:03:57.151 --> 00:03:59.159
 that people think they understand part of a process, 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.923
 but they do not fully understand it. 

00:04:01.923 --> 00:04:05.539
 There are ideas that the cytoskeleton 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:07.774
 plays a role. 

00:04:07.774 --> 00:04:11.454
 You have to make a place here here so he can 

00:04:11.454 --> 00:04:15.587
 the bubble to tear off and move in that direction. 

00:04:15.587 --> 00:04:20.545
 It can also help the cell membrane envelop the object, 

00:04:20.545 --> 00:04:23.424
 but these issues are subject to active research. 

00:04:23.424 --> 00:04:26.187
 How exactly does endocytosis? 

00:04:26.187 --> 00:04:30.286
 How the cage knows what to swallow, 

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:32.050
 how exactly the membrane behaves, 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.625
 for the process to take place 

00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:37.084
 successful?
