00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Let's go about implementing that.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's say I had my old definition of sequence of (x,y),

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and we say return the tuple consisting of a sequence x and y.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now I want to change that. How would I change that?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Well, instead of x and y, I think I'm going to insist that we have at least 1 argument,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
so I can say x and then the rest of the args,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and I can say, if the length of the rest of the args equals 1,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
then I've got this binary case and then I can take sequence of x.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The second arg is now no longer called y.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's called args at 0.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Else: now I've got a recursive case with more than 2 args, and I can do something there.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So it's not that hard, but I had to do a lot of violence to this definition of sequence,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and come to think of it, I may be repeating myself because I had to do this for sequence,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and I'm also going to have to do it for alt,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and if I expand my program, let's say I start wanting to take on arithmetic

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
as well as regular expressions, then I may have functions for addition and multiplication

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and others, and I'm going to have to make exactly the same changes

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
to all these binary functions.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So that seems to violate the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm making the same changes over and over again.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It's more work for me. There's a possibility of introducing bugs.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Is there a better way?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So let's back up and say, what are we doing in general?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Well, we're taking a binary function f of (x,y), and we want to transform that somehow

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
into an n_ary function--f prime, which takes x and any number of arguments.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The question is, can we come up with a way to do that to automatically--

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
change one function or modify or generate a new function from the definition

00:01:57.000 --> 09:59:59.000
of that original function.
