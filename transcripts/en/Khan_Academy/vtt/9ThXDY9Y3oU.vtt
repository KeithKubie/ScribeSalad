00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.830
When we compare triangle
ABC to triangle XYZ,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.450
it's pretty clear that
they aren't congruent,

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.300
that they have very different
lengths of their sides.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.130
But there does seem
to be something

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.120
interesting about the
relationship between these two

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.020
triangles.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.500
One, all of their corresponding
angles are the same.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.620
So the angle right here, angle
BAC, is congruent to angle YXZ.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.640
Angle BCA is congruent
to angle YZX,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.990
and angle ABC is
congruent to angle XYZ.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.550
So all of their corresponding
angles are the same.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.000
And we also see that
the sides are just

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.600
scaled-up versions
of each other.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.380
So to go from the length of XZ
to AC, we can multiply by 3.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.320
We multiplied by 3 there.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.790
To go from the length of XY
to the length of AB, which

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.960
is the corresponding side,
we are multiplying by 3.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.760
We have to multiply by 3.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.160
And then to go from the length
of YZ to the length of BC,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.702
we also multiplied by 3.

00:01:13.702 --> 00:01:16.830
So essentially,
triangle ABC is just

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.830
a scaled-up version
of triangle XYZ.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.520
If they were the
same scale, they

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.110
would be the exact
same triangles.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.162
But one is just a bigger,
a blown-up version

00:01:25.162 --> 00:01:25.870
of the other one.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.610
Or this is a miniaturized
version of that one over there.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.060
If you just multiply
all the sides by 3,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.700
you get to this triangle.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.230
And so we can't
call them congruent,

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.320
but this does seem to be a
bit of a special relationship.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.720
So we call this special
relationship similarity.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:49.489
So we can write that triangle
ABC is similar to triangle--

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:51.780
and we want to make sure we
get the corresponding sides

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.126
right-- ABC is going
to be similar to XYZ.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.450
And so, based on
what we just saw,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.550
there's actually kind
of three ideas here.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.720
And they're all equivalent ways
of thinking about similarity.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.210
One way to think
about it is that one

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.190
is a scaled-up
version of the other.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.850
So scaled-up or -down
version of the other.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.400
When we talked about
congruency, they

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.680
had to be exactly the same.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.260
You could rotate it, you could
shift it, you could flip it.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.760
But when you do all
of those things,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.840
they would have to
essentially be identical.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.690
With similarity, you can
rotate it, you can shift it,

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.460
you can flip it.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.980
And you can also scale it up
and down in order for something

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.090
to be similar.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:44.310
So for example, let's
say triangle CDE,

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.100
if we know that triangle CDE
is congruent to triangle FGH,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.450
then we definitely know
that they are similar.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.195
They are scaled up
by a factor of 1.

00:02:54.195 --> 00:02:57.680
Then we know, for a
fact, that CDE is also

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.740
similar to triangle FGH.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.840
But we can't say it
the other way around.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.350
If triangle ABC
is similar to XYZ,

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.430
we can't say that it's
necessarily congruent.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.140
And we see, for this
particular example,

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.930
they definitely
are not congruent.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.965
So this is one way to
think about similarity.

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:15.590
The other way to
think about similarity

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.000
is that all of the corresponding
angles will be equal.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.520
So if something is similar, then
all of the corresponding angles

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.890
are going to be congruent.

00:03:29.935 --> 00:03:31.990
I always have trouble
spelling this.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:41.835
It is 2 Rs, 1 S. Corresponding
angles are congruent.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.220
So if we say that triangle ABC
is similar to triangle XYZ,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:58.026
that is equivalent to saying
that angle ABC is congruent--

00:03:58.026 --> 00:03:59.650
or we could say that
their measures are

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.136
equal-- to angle XYZ.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:13.405
That angle BAC is going to
be congruent to angle YXZ.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:24.880
And then finally,
angle ACB is going

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.940
to be congruent to angle XZY.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.240
So if you have two triangles,
all of their angles

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.490
are the same, then you could
say that they're similar.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.700
Or if you find two
triangles and you're

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.474
told that they are
similar triangles,

00:04:43.474 --> 00:04:45.640
then you know that all of
their corresponding angles

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.650
are the same.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.170
And the last way
to think about it

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.120
is that the sides are all
just scaled-up versions

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.180
of each other.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.450
So the sides scaled
by the same factor.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.191
In the example we did here,
the scaling factor was 3.

00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:06.190
It doesn't have to be 3.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.750
It just has to be the same
scaling factor for every side.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.560
If we scaled this side up by 3
and we only scaled this side up

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.410
by 2, then we would
not be dealing

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.110
with a similar triangle.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.230
But if we scaled all
of these sides up by 7,

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.730
then that's still a similar,
as long as you have all of them

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.240
scaled up or scaled down
by the exact same factor.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.964
So one way to think
about it is-- I

00:05:28.964 --> 00:05:30.630
want to still visualize
those triangles.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.010
Let me redraw them right over
here a little bit simpler.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.010
Because I'm not talking
in now in general terms,

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.650
not even for that specific case.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:43.600
So if we say that this is A, B,
and C, and this right over here

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.150
is X, Y, and Z. I
just redrew them

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.110
so I can refer them
when we write down here.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.665
If we're saying that these
two things right over here

00:05:54.665 --> 00:05:57.680
are similar, that means
that corresponding sides

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.530
are scaled-up versions
of each other.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.920
So we could say that
the length of AB

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.110
is equal to some
scaling factor--

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.640
and this thing could be
less than 1-- some scaling

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.770
factor times the length of
XY, the corresponding sides.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.920
And I know that AB
corresponds to XY because

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.180
of the order in which I wrote
this similarity statement.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.100
So some scaling factor times XY.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:30.000
We know that the
length of BC needs

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.455
to be that same scaling
factor times the length of YZ.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.140
And then we know
the length of AC

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.210
is going to be equal to that
same scaling factor times XZ.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.840
So that's XZ, and this
could be a scaling factor.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.470
So if ABC is larger
than XYZ, then

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.390
these k's will be larger than 1.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.640
If they're the exact same
size, if they're essentially

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.630
congruent triangles,
then these k's will be 1.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.420
And if XYZ is bigger
than ABC, then

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.361
these [? scaling ?] factors
will be less than 1.

00:07:15.361 --> 00:07:17.860
But another way to write these
same statements-- notice, all

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:19.235
I'm saying is
corresponding sides

00:07:19.235 --> 00:07:21.150
are scaled-up versions
of each other.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.710
This first statement right here,
if you divide both sides by XY,

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:31.720
you get AB over XY is equal
to our scaling factor.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.470
And then the second
statement right

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.320
over here, if you divide
both sides by YZ--

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.400
let me do it in that
same color-- you

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:47.557
get BC divided by YZ is
equal to that scaling factor.

00:07:47.557 --> 00:07:49.390
And remember, in the
example we just showed,

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.512
that scaling factor was 3.

00:07:52.512 --> 00:07:54.970
But now we're saying in the
more general terms, similarity,

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.370
as long as you have the
same scaling factor.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.280
And then finally, if
you divide both sides

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.210
here by the length between X
and Z, or segment XZ's length,

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:11.390
you get AC over XZ is
equal to k, as well.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.620
Or another way to think
about it is the ratio

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.980
between corresponding sides.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.990
Notice, this is the
ratio between AB and XY.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:27.460
The ratio between BC and YZ,
the ratio between AC and XZ,

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.590
that the ratio between
corresponding sides

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:31.990
all gives us the same constant.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:37.059
Or you could rewrite
this as AB over XY

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:48.050
is equal to BC over YZ is equal
to AC over XZ, which would be

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.214
equal to some scaling
factor, which is equal to k.

00:08:51.214 --> 00:08:52.630
So if you have
similar triangles--

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.580
let me draw an arrow
right over here.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.962
Similar triangles means that
they're scaled-up versions,

00:08:56.962 --> 00:08:59.170
and you can also flip and
rotate and do all the stuff

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.450
with congruency.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.500
And you can scale
them up or down.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.390
Which means all of the
corresponding angles

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.940
are congruent, which
also means that the ratio

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.970
between corresponding
sides is going

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.580
to be the same constant for
all the corresponding sides.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.360
Or the ratio between
corresponding sides

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.942
is constant.
