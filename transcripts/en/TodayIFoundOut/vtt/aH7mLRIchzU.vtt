00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:27.890
Unsurprisingly, neither the origin of the
name nor the food item itself have anything

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.120
to do with actual buffalo, nor American Bison
which many people call buffalo even though

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.000
they are not.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:46.300
Rather, this tasty item originated in Buffalo,
New York, with most foodstorians indicating

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.159
buffalo wings probably were first served in
the Anchor Bar there.

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.909
Frank and Teressa Bellissimo owned that bar,
which they had purchased in 1939.

00:00:54.909 --> 00:01:00.159
In 1964, Theresa had an idea: why not fry
chicken wings up and serve them in a hot sauce?

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.260
Of course, different stories come from all
of the primary persons involved in terms of

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.680
how she came up with the idea.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.180
First, it’s claimed that Dominic Belissimo,
Frank and Teressa’s son, came in one night

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.640
with a group of friends who were looking for
a quick snack.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.760
Teressa was preparing some chicken stock for
soups and sauces and decided to put the chicken

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.140
wings in to broil instead, which she then
presented to the boys.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.540
Dominic Belissimo told a different story:
one Friday night the bar was particularly

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.540
busy.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.760
As they attracted a mostly Catholic patronage,
he thought he’d bring out something for

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.219
them at midnight, when they could eat this
sort of meat again.

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:35.040
(At the time, many Catholics stuck to only
fish and veggies every Friday.)

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.480
He presented this idea to his mother, who
found what she could in the kitchen: chicken

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.480
wings.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.979
On the other hand, Frank told the New Yorker
in 1980- perhaps the one that seems most plausible-

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.320
that the bar had received a shipment of wings
on accident; they had been expecting other

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.280
parts of chicken, and simply didn’t know
what to do with all of them.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.590
That was when his wife started experimenting
in the kitchen to see what she could whip

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.780
up so the wings wouldn’t go to waste.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.990
Whatever the case, the stories coalesce on
this point- after spending some time experimenting

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.380
in the kitchen, Teressa came out with fried
wings smothered in a special hot sauce she’d

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.970
made, served with blue cheese dressing and
a few celery sticks.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.831
Needless to say, the crowd—whether it was
Dominic’s friends, hungry Catholics, or

00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:16.000
just their normal patrons—loved them.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.970
Soon, buffalo wings were a staple on the menu
and news of this tasty dish had come to the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.190
attention of many Buffalonians.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.330
At least, this is the official version of
events.You see, there was a 1969 in depth

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:34.610
article done on the Anchor Bar by the Courier-Express,
and nowhere in there do they mention chicken

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.510
wings being served there- a food item the
restaurant was supposedly famous for at this

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.140
point.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.860
A man named John Young threw buffalo wing
history a curveball by saying he invented

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.860
the wings.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.810
Indeed, his restaurant Wings n’ Things started
serving chicken wings with his special hot

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.340
“mambo sauce” in the mid-1960s.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.130
The main difference between Young’s wings
and the Bellissimos’ wings was simply that

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.010
Young’s were breaded and whole, while the
Bellisimos chopped their wings in half (to

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.220
make them easier to eat with your hands) and
left them unbreaded.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.630
A local poultry distributor did come forward
to say that both parties started buying a

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.130
large number of chicken wings around the same
time, but he of course saw no reason to keep

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.930
records to prove who started buying the large
quantities first.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:16.930
Who knew food-history was being made, after
all?

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.890
When former Buffalo mayor Stan Makowski announced
that July 29th was to be declared National

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.731
Chicken Wing Day in 1977, he chose to cite
the Belissimos as the inventors, though of

00:03:25.731 --> 00:03:30.600
course he offered no real basis for his choice
and there has been some small grumbling that

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.230
because Young is a black man, in the 1970s
perhaps it wasn’t a popular idea to give

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.230
the credit to him.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.210
Young also stated that the invention of the
Buffalo Wing wasn’t much of a leap for him

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.420
as he grew up in an African American household
and community where, according to him, chicken

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.320
wings were a common dinner item, unlike elsewhere
at the time where it was often more common

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.460
to not eat the chicken wing directly, but
use it in the preparation of sauces and soups.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.080
The real innovation then in his opinion was
simply his special “mamba” hot sauce.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.720
Whatever the case, Buffalo wings remained
a regional thing for quite some time.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.070
In the 1980 New Yorker article that interviewed
the Bellissimos, the author noted that New

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.750
Yorkers returning home from a few months away
had to get their wing fix because they couldn’t

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.750
elsewhere.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.450
However, over time, other restaurants serving
the wings began to pop up.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.940
Buffalo Wild Wings is a great example of how
buffalo wings spread to different parts of

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.940
the country.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.620
It was founded by a man who spent some time
in Buffalo before moving to Ohio.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.290
Unable to find a good place to get buffalo
wings, he and a friend opened up their own

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.780
restaurant in Columbus in 1982.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.940
The restaurant chain, which prides itself
on sixteen different buffalo wing sauces,

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.820
now has at least one store in every state
except Rhode Island, and also has stores in

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.820
Canada.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.380
And, of course, who could forget Hooters,
which was founded in 1983 with wings a central

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.590
feature on its menu.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.990
This spreading of the buffalo wing was relatively
slow until American Football stepped in.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.990
What happened?

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.500
From 1990-1993, the Buffalo Bills made it
to the Super Bowl four consecutive seasons.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.090
During this time, the media covering the team
also did features on the region itself, including

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.620
talking quite a bit about local food and particularly
highlighting these spicy, fried chicken wings.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:15.180
From there, Buffalo wings saw a huge surge
in popularity, including becoming a “traditional”

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:44.380
snack to eat while 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:06:01.950
watching 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:29.750
American Football
