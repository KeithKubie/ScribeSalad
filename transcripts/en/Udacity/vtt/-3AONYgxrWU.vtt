00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
To make sure we understand this idea, that velocity is proportional to time,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
let's look at one example. Let's imagine that we drop a ball.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The instant we drop the ball t = 0, the ball's speed is 0 m/s.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If I wanted to represent this with a picture, I would just draw a stationary ball.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If my acceleration is 10 m/s per second, which we can also say 10 m/sÂ²,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
then after 1 second I will have gained 10 m/s.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I can represent this velocity with a downwards arrow.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The length of this arrow somehow represents the size or magnitude of this velocity.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
After another second the speed increases to 20, and my arrow is twice as long.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I want you to tell me two things about what happens after 3 seconds.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
First, the speed and, second, where should I put the end of this arrow,

00:00:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which represents that speed. Should I put it here, here, here, or here?
