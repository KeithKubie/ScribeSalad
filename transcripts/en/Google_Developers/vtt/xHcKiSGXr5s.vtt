ANNA GORDON: I'm
Anna Gordon, one

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.465
of the co-founders
of Clara &amp; Jack.

00:00:08.465 --> 00:00:10.510
Clara &amp; Jack is a
new nursing brand

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.670
for breastfeeding mothers.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.990
The real challenge
with creating a startup

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.670
is that you're suddenly
everything in that company.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.380
I'm used to working
in a huge institution

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.920
where, if I don't
know something,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.810
I go and ask for
somebody who does, right?

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.270
So if I don't know about
producing a television program,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.970
I know a lot of
people who can tell me

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.511
about producing a
television program.

00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:33.450
And I think running a
startup, you suddenly

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.100
realize that you have to
have much more confidence

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.660
and the drive to go out and find
information out for yourself

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.243
and take on the role
that you need to,

00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:43.840
whether that's
the manufacturing,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.320
whether it's the
press and PR role,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.890
whether it's the HR
role, whatever it is.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.760
You've got to take
all those functions.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.570
And it's given me much
greater confidence.

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:56.680
One of the speakers
talked about the need

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.180
to really test your
market before you've even

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.169
spent any money.

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:03.210
And we walked away from
that going, you're right.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.269
We think there's an opportunity.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.530
And our friends think
there's an opportunity.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.230
But that's not the only
people we want to sell to.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.220
We want to sell to
many more than that.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.230
So we actually pulled
together a survey

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.690
that we got out,
shared on social media.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.540
And within 48 hours, we
had over 400 responses,

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.740
which was fantastic.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.990
That gave us a real boost
as well, to say actually,

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.310
there is interest and
demand for our product

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.420
out there before
we've even started.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.950
And it also gave us some
really detailed feedback

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.900
about why people
buy nursing bras,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.360
where do they go, what's
most important to them

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.070
in terms of comfort,
or style, or fit.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.360
So that gave us a real
starter to develop the product

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.090
that we wanted to,
before we'd even

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.110
spent any money on creating
a product, which was great.
