00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.643
The equation we just came up with, y equals x over 10 minus 15, and the one we

00:00:04.643 --> 00:00:08.877
started out with, y equals 10x plus 150, are related to one another in a

00:00:08.877 --> 00:00:14.584
special way. To figure out what that is, I think it would be great if we

00:00:14.584 --> 00:00:18.618
plotted both of them. To get to that point, though, we need to know, well, some

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:23.034
points on each line. Please fill out each of these x y charts to give us some

00:00:23.034 --> 00:00:24.849
of those points.
