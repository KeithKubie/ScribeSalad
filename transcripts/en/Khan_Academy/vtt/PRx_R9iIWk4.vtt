00:00:00.523 --> 00:00:03.083
- [Voiceover] Let's say
this is me right over here,

00:00:03.083 --> 00:00:05.440
and I'm drifting through space

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.984
at a constant velocity

00:00:06.984 --> 00:00:08.751
relative to any other

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:10.539
inertial frame of reference,

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:11.625
and so I am,

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:14.506
I am in an inertial frame
of reference myself,

00:00:14.506 --> 00:00:16.233
and in fact I'm going to define

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:17.762
my frame of reference by me,

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:19.142
I'm gonna say I'm at the origin

00:00:19.142 --> 00:00:20.869
of my frame of reference.

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.374
So at all times,

00:00:22.374 --> 00:00:25.237
I consider myself to be stationary,

00:00:25.237 --> 00:00:26.640
and I am at the point,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.520
'x' equals zero,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.641
and we're gonna focus on

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:30.848
just the 'x' dimension,

00:00:30.848 --> 00:00:32.142
to simplify our discussion,

00:00:32.142 --> 00:00:33.136
and I have, you know,

00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:34.274
my oxygen and everything,

00:00:34.274 --> 00:00:35.165
and food,

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:38.725
so no need to worry about me.

00:00:38.725 --> 00:00:40.356
Now, what I've drawn here

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:42.145
are some axes,

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:45.209
so that I can plot the path of things

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:47.016
as time progresses

00:00:47.016 --> 00:00:49.760
in my frame of reference.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.877
And one thing that

00:00:50.877 --> 00:00:52.136
many of ya'll might have noticed

00:00:52.136 --> 00:00:54.108
is that I have plotted time in seconds

00:00:54.108 --> 00:00:55.510
on the vertical axis,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.418
and our position, our 'x' position,

00:00:57.418 --> 00:01:00.528
in meters on the horizontal axis.

00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:01.929
And that might be a little
bit counter-intuitive

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.003
for a lot of ya'll,

00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:04.241
especially with math backgrounds,

00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:06.237
in fact, it's a little
bit uncomfortable for me,

00:01:06.237 --> 00:01:09.777
we often prefer to put time
on the horizontal axis,

00:01:09.777 --> 00:01:12.803
and position on the vertical axis,

00:01:12.803 --> 00:01:14.775
so this is a little bit counter-intuitive.

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:15.933
But this is,

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:18.188
you know, our choice is
a little bit arbitrary,

00:01:18.188 --> 00:01:20.646
in math class, we liked to think

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:22.211
of our independent variable

00:01:22.211 --> 00:01:23.389
on our horizontal axis,

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:26.173
and we think of time as
somehow driving position,

00:01:26.173 --> 00:01:28.408
so that's why we tend to put time there

00:01:28.408 --> 00:01:29.765
than we'd position there,

00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:31.719
but you can flip them around.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:33.945
And as we'll get more into physics,

00:01:33.945 --> 00:01:35.510
we'll see, well maybe we shouldn't

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.578
necessarily think of time
always driving position,

00:01:38.578 --> 00:01:42.073
or maybe position in some
ways are driving time.

00:01:42.073 --> 00:01:43.942
But we'll get into that.

00:01:43.942 --> 00:01:46.826
But let's just first get a
little bit comfortable with this.

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:50.179
So what would be my position over time

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.454
on this diagram right over here?

00:01:52.454 --> 00:01:53.463
And you might notice these numbers,

00:01:53.463 --> 00:01:54.437
one second, two second,

00:01:54.437 --> 00:01:55.363
three second,

00:01:55.363 --> 00:01:56.378
and then in meters

00:01:56.378 --> 00:01:57.497
I have three times to the eighth,

00:01:57.497 --> 00:01:58.329
six times to the eighth,

00:01:58.329 --> 00:01:59.284
nine times to the eighth,

00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:00.828
so these are massive, massive numbers,

00:02:00.828 --> 00:02:03.083
and you could guess where
they are coming from.

00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:04.730
They are coming from the notion

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.948
that the speed of light

00:02:05.948 --> 00:02:08.792
is approximately 3x10 to the eighth

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:10.763
meters per second.

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.897
But we'll get to that in a second.

00:02:12.897 --> 00:02:14.258
But let's just think about

00:02:14.258 --> 00:02:17.122
my position over time,

00:02:17.122 --> 00:02:19.255
in my frame of reference here.

00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:21.390
So, time equals zero,

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.380
my 'x' position in this frame of reference

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.578
is zero,

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:26.631
I consider myself to be stationary.

00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:28.054
After one second,

00:02:28.054 --> 00:02:30.024
well my position is still zero,

00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:31.650
after two seconds my position

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.498
is still 'x' equals zero,

00:02:33.498 --> 00:02:34.758
after three seconds my position

00:02:34.758 --> 00:02:36.424
is still 'x' equals zero,

00:02:36.424 --> 00:02:38.517
so my, I guess you could almost

00:02:38.517 --> 00:02:39.858
consider my path

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:41.096
on this diagram,

00:02:41.096 --> 00:02:43.737
where I'm plotting time and space,

00:02:43.737 --> 00:02:45.384
at least in the 'x' direction,

00:02:45.384 --> 00:02:47.444
is going to look like,

00:02:47.444 --> 00:02:50.204
is going to look like,

00:02:50.204 --> 00:02:52.568
whoops, I can do a better job than that.

00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:54.008
It's going to look,

00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:56.448
it's going to look like,

00:02:56.448 --> 00:02:58.683
it's going to look like that.

00:02:58.683 --> 00:03:00.709
That would be my path

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.116
on my little time and space axes,

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:06.615
or on this little diagram that I have.

00:03:06.615 --> 00:03:08.180
But let's think about

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.272
something a little bit more interesting.

00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:13.828
Let's think about me having a flashlight,

00:03:13.828 --> 00:03:16.225
so this is, I have a flashlight here,

00:03:16.225 --> 00:03:18.480
and I, at time equals zero,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.085
I turn on that flashlight,

00:03:20.085 --> 00:03:21.447
exactly at time equals zero

00:03:21.447 --> 00:03:22.808
I turn on that flashlight.

00:03:22.808 --> 00:03:25.916
And let's think about
the very first photon

00:03:25.916 --> 00:03:28.720
of light that emits from my flashlight.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.447
And let's plot it's path

00:03:30.447 --> 00:03:31.971
on my little diagram here.

00:03:31.971 --> 00:03:33.352
So time equals zero,

00:03:33.352 --> 00:03:35.140
it's exactly where I am.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.217
So time equals zero,

00:03:36.217 --> 00:03:37.985
it's position is zero meters.

00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:39.285
But after one second,

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:40.484
where is my photon of light?

00:03:40.484 --> 00:03:41.703
And I'm gonna put it,

00:03:41.703 --> 00:03:43.084
and the photon is moving

00:03:43.084 --> 00:03:45.244
in the positive 'x' direction.

00:03:45.244 --> 00:03:48.246
So it's moving in the
positive 'x' direction

00:03:48.246 --> 00:03:51.321
with a velocity of 'C' meters per second

00:03:51.321 --> 00:03:53.989
in the positive 'x' direction.

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.960
And so, after one second,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.779
it will have moved 3x10
to the eighth meters.

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:01.526
After two seconds,

00:04:01.526 --> 00:04:04.330
it will have moved 6x10
to the eighth meters.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.545
And I've intentionally scaled my axes,

00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:10.419
so that now if I were to
draw the position of light

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:11.720
relative to time,

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.117
it's going to be at a 45 degree angle.

00:04:14.117 --> 00:04:16.210
And that's just an artifact

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.962
of how I've picked my axes.

00:04:18.962 --> 00:04:21.116
But let's see if I can plot this.

00:04:21.116 --> 00:04:23.757
So it's gonna look something like this.

00:04:23.757 --> 00:04:24.854
And this is hand drawn,

00:04:24.854 --> 00:04:26.358
so it's not going to be perfect.

00:04:26.358 --> 00:04:29.934
So the position of that photon over time

00:04:29.934 --> 00:04:31.214
is going to look like that.

00:04:31.214 --> 00:04:33.508
After one second,

00:04:33.508 --> 00:04:36.576
3x10 to the eighth meters,

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:40.152
after two seconds, 6x10
to the eighth meters,

00:04:40.152 --> 00:04:42.434
after three seconds,

00:04:42.434 --> 00:04:45.300
we have 9x10

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.373
to the eighth meters.

00:04:47.373 --> 00:04:50.217
Alright, well that's
reasonably interesting so far,

00:04:50.217 --> 00:04:51.882
we're getting a little bit comfortable

00:04:51.882 --> 00:04:53.833
with my little diagram here,

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:55.074
maybe some of us are getting

00:04:55.074 --> 00:04:56.212
a little bit more comfortable

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:57.775
with time on the vertical axis,

00:04:57.775 --> 00:05:00.701
and my position on the horizontal axis.

00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:03.262
But now let's introduce another character.

00:05:03.262 --> 00:05:05.070
Another character who could almost define,

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.914
or who could define their
own frame of reference.

00:05:07.914 --> 00:05:11.511
So let's say that right
at time equals zero,

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:14.496
a spaceship passes me by.

00:05:14.496 --> 00:05:15.654
So that's,

00:05:15.654 --> 00:05:17.727
I have to draw a bigger
spaceship than that.

00:05:17.727 --> 00:05:18.865
So, there you go,

00:05:18.865 --> 00:05:20.572
that's the spaceship,

00:05:20.572 --> 00:05:23.112
and in the spaceship I have my friend,

00:05:23.112 --> 00:05:26.402
so that's the spaceship.

00:05:26.402 --> 00:05:28.699
And the spaceship is travelling

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.401
with a pretty incredible velocity,

00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:34.001
in the positive 'x' direction.

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:35.545
So I guess if this is,

00:05:35.545 --> 00:05:37.801
this vector is the speed of light,

00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:39.506
which this seems like
an awfully short arrow,

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.193
but if I'm gonna say
that's the speed of light,

00:05:41.193 --> 00:05:42.636
then let's say that this thing

00:05:42.636 --> 00:05:45.219
is moving with half the speed of light.

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:48.023
Which is still incredibly fast.

00:05:48.023 --> 00:05:49.222
So the velocity,

00:05:49.222 --> 00:05:50.329
the magnitude of

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:54.679
the velocity here is 0.5C.

00:05:54.679 --> 00:05:56.248
So let's plot,

00:05:56.248 --> 00:05:58.910
and my friend is stationary
in that spaceship,

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.986
the spaceship is moving

00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:02.608
at this constant velocity, 0.5C

00:06:02.608 --> 00:06:04.945
in the positive 'x' direction.

00:06:04.945 --> 00:06:08.581
So, they also are in an
inertial frame of reference,

00:06:08.581 --> 00:06:10.572
because it's at a constant velocity

00:06:10.572 --> 00:06:11.507
relative to me,

00:06:11.507 --> 00:06:13.092
which is an inertial frame of reference.

00:06:13.092 --> 00:06:15.084
And so let's plot my,

00:06:15.084 --> 00:06:17.602
let's plot her position

00:06:17.602 --> 00:06:19.938
on my little diagram.

00:06:19.938 --> 00:06:21.443
So time equals zero,

00:06:21.443 --> 00:06:23.840
she's exactly where I am.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.582
She's at the origin of
my frame of reference.

00:06:26.582 --> 00:06:29.162
Her 'x' position is zero.

00:06:29.162 --> 00:06:30.544
Now after one second,

00:06:30.544 --> 00:06:33.206
she's moving half the speed of light,

00:06:33.206 --> 00:06:35.379
so after one second she

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.341
would have gone 1.5x10 to
the eighth meters per second.

00:06:39.341 --> 00:06:43.059
So she would have gone about that far.

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:45.091
After two seconds,

00:06:45.091 --> 00:06:47.712
she would have gone as far as light can go

00:06:47.712 --> 00:06:48.729
in one second,

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:50.537
because she's going
half the speed of light,

00:06:50.537 --> 00:06:52.812
so she would go about that far.

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:54.397
After three seconds,

00:06:54.397 --> 00:06:58.381
she will have gone 4.5x10

00:06:58.381 --> 00:07:00.249
to the eighth meters.

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:02.221
So let me put that

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:03.786
right over there,

00:07:03.786 --> 00:07:05.146
and you see where this is going.

00:07:05.146 --> 00:07:07.279
So if I were to plot her path,

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:08.681
if I were to plot her path,

00:07:08.681 --> 00:07:12.178
it would look like this.

00:07:12.178 --> 00:07:15.091
It would look like this,

00:07:15.091 --> 00:07:18.078
path of my friend.

00:07:18.078 --> 00:07:20.739
That's the path of my
friend right over there.

00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:23.361
And, I want you to just
kind of think about this,

00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:24.640
think about this a little bit,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.428
think about how these different lines are,

00:07:26.428 --> 00:07:27.505
what they represent,

00:07:27.505 --> 00:07:28.764
once again get familiar with

00:07:28.764 --> 00:07:30.228
the 't' on the vertical axis.

00:07:30.228 --> 00:07:31.873
But now in the next video,

00:07:31.873 --> 00:07:33.072
we're gonna use this,

00:07:33.072 --> 00:07:34.373
what I just drew,

00:07:34.373 --> 00:07:35.835
to draw her frame of reference,

00:07:35.835 --> 00:07:37.135
to draw a coordinate system,

00:07:37.135 --> 00:07:38.943
or I guess you could say

00:07:38.943 --> 00:07:41.077
a space time diagram for
her frame of reference,

00:07:41.077 --> 00:07:42.479
on top of this one.

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.449
And at least in the context of this video

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:45.568
and the next few videos,

00:07:45.568 --> 00:07:47.192
we're going to assume a Newtonian world,

00:07:47.192 --> 00:07:48.270
we're not gonna get to Einstein

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.406
in special relativity,

00:07:49.406 --> 00:07:50.605
we're just going to assume,

00:07:50.605 --> 00:07:51.418
well,

00:07:51.418 --> 00:07:54.082
we'll get to that in the next video.
