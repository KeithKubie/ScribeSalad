00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,780
If you are listening to radiolab, Radiolab

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,440
from [inaudible], W N, y.

3
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:11,610
S. E. N, n. P. R.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,740
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab, the podcast.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,790
And today since we are right about to
have the New York City Marathon Zip

6
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:24,360
through our neighborhoods senior in
New York, we have a puzzle. Yeah,

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,910
it's a puzzle. It's a
puzzle. It's a, it's a, yes,

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,630
it is a puzzle and it comes from,
uh, NPRs East Africa correspondent,

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,980
Gregory Warner. I've prepared for this
story by taking a jog through Nairobi.

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,240
Well, all right, so where
do we start with this, Greg?

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,080
I think we should start in 1968 I mean,
there's a lot of places we could start,

12
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:47,610
but let's start there. Let's try it.
So 1968 summer Olympics in Mexico City,

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,290
Mexico City, thankfully [inaudible]
piece on the Olympic opening day,

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,430
it's 7,900 feet, one of the
highest elevated Olympics.

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,340
And that's difficult for runners
because there's less oxygen.

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,960
And one of the big races that everybody's
looking forward to is the 1500 meter

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,180
between the 23 year old American. Yeah.

18
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,420
Favorite Jim Ryan.

19
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,200
Ryan of America number 300 he's the world
record holder and this guy named Kip

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,300
Chuggy, Kane, Kane, Kenya, number
five six five kip Kane's got flip cam.

21
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,180
They bill him as an untrained
Andy tribesmen from Kenya.

22
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,350
He's actually a policeman from
a long line of cattle wrestlers.

23
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,520
Marvin Woodruff was the winner. And
here's what you need to know about Kipp.

24
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,540
He's running three different races
at this Olympics, 1500 meters,

25
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,250
not only the 1500 but also the
5,000 meter and the 10,000 meters.

26
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,150
If you include the qualifying measures,

27
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:46,610
he'll be running six Olympic
events in eight days. Wow.

28
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:51,140
Six races in eight days, which would
never be done today was hardly done then.

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,840
So first step, have about
the later 10,000 meter race.

30
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,550
He's in the lead two laps away
from finishing. When he collapses,

31
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,600
it falls off the track. He gets
rushed to the Kenyan doctors,

32
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,890
a German guy who diagnosed him
with a gallbladder infection,

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,920
Mitch turns out is incredibly painful,

34
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,190
actually hurts the most
when you take deep breaths,

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,250
like when you're running
and if you don't treat it,

36
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,190
your gallbladder could burst. So basically

37
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,430
who the doctor sends, kept bed says
there's no way you can run, but Kipp,

38
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,390
he runs the next race anyway,
ends up getting silver. Wow.

39
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,050
He sent to bed by the German doctor
again who literally says, okay,

40
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:37,700
this time you have to stay in bed. If
you run any more races, you could die

41
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,670
back to the drag for one of the most
memorable events are they old games?

42
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,960
The 1500 meters,

43
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,580
three days later. It's the big
matchup against Jim Ryan and Kipp.

44
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,170
Apparently he just leaped out of bed
an hour before the race and he said

45
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:54,250
something like, if I die, I'm
going to die in the track.

46
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,020
It's really complicated. So
kip Kaino starts, they're off

47
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,870
and running, three and three
quarter labs for the stadium.

48
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,350
He starts out dead last.

49
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,550
Okay. I know running my ass and then
moving up to the middle of the pack. Now

50
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,630
how? By the end of the
first lap, he's in third

51
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,410
drop out, the Germany's back
at and Kipp Kaino third,

52
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,140
third lap. He takes the lead.

53
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,690
Here comes gift k. Now having
up with this teammates,

54
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,150
he goes ahead, but that's
okay. For Jim Ryan.

55
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:23,930
Jim Ryan's known to have the
greatest kick in the sport. Okay,

56
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,030
kick right at the end of the race.

57
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,060
Every runner gives this extra boost
and Ryan's got the best kick in the

58
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:33,620
business. Good. Brian is beginning,

59
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,450
so he's thinking there's no way that
kip Kaino at altitude suffering a

60
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:44,450
gallbladder infection can hold out
against my kick. Very rough in the,

61
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:48,440
in the final lap. It looks like he's
right. Starts shooting up the field,

62
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,790
gaining on Kipp Kaino
who is clearly in pain,

63
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,110
sort of reminiscing, reading his teeth.

64
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,660
Hey y'all. Good job. Lurching.

65
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,190
Did the finish line and even though
he's in an ungodly amount of pain,

66
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,070
even though pain is shooting
through his entire body,

67
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,443
amazingly

68
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,380
he does not slow down.
Jim Ryan never catches

69
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:24,690
[inaudible]

70
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,680
when he hung on around
that last turn, it was all,

71
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,190
I was hysterical. This is John Manners.

72
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,370
I'm a semi retired journalists who for
many years had a specialty in covering

73
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:42,120
the exploits of Kenyan runners,
African runners in general.

74
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,900
He was watching that race in a bar
about 50 miles north of New York,

75
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,140
but as a kid, manners actually
lived in the part of Kenya.

76
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,810
The KIP Keto is from my people,
and so when Kaino won gold,

77
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,020
it sparked a question for manners that
he would spend the next 40 years thinking

78
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:01,680
about. I wanted to find
a reason why my people,

79
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:06,681
as I chose to regard them were
great because on that day in 1968

80
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,510
ushered in an era of
east African dominance

81
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,980
in the sport. It's 10 year your,
it's kind your, it's can be applied.

82
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,600
It is almost hard to believe,

83
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,830
but Kenyans have done it again. One, two,

84
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,230
yeah.

85
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:31,740
It was a once again as the eighth
successive gold medal in Olympic history,

86
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:41,050
so 1968 was the beginning of the
Kenyan dominance and running. Yeah, but

87
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,700
in the United States we think of
Kenyans as being good runners,

88
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:45,830
but really it's this one tiny,

89
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,030
small geographic swath within Kenya
where all the runners come from.

90
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,410
That's David Epstein. He's a senior
editor at sports illustrated.

91
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,210
He wrote a book called the sports gene,

92
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,620
and the swath that he's talking
about is in western Kenya.

93
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,550
It's a mountainous region spread out
about the size of Massachusetts and the

94
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:08,160
people who live there are a particular
tribe of Kenyans called the Caligiuri,

95
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,620
pretty small group of people.

96
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,150
His tribe accounts for about
0.06% of the world's population.

97
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,180
But from this one tiny tribe has come
this unbelievable fount of talent that I

98
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:22,190
think is unparalleled
in any other sport ever.

99
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:24,580
[inaudible]

100
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,630
there's all kinds of, statistics sort
of becomes laughable. Uh, you know,

101
00:06:28,631 --> 00:06:33,340
there've been five American high school
runners who have broken four minutes in

102
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,630
the mile. The first was actually Jim
Ryan, but there's one high school,

103
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,950
any 10 in Kenya that had four
sub four minors at the same time.

104
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,810
There's 17 American men in history who
have run under two 10 in the marathon.

105
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,620
That's about four minutes
and 58 seconds per mile pace.

106
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,660
17 American men in history.

107
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:57,250
There were 32 [inaudible] who did it in
October of 2011 so you start to look at

108
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,360
these statistics and it,

109
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,190
and it appears to be the
greatest concentration of
elite athletic talent ever

110
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,250
in any sport, anywhere in the world.
And that's the question. I mean,

111
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:12,090
how does that happen? That was
John Manners question 40 years ago.

112
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,920
Something has to account for this
extraordinary set of numbers, but what

113
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:18,900
[inaudible],

114
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,100
and there have been any
number of scientists and
sports gurus and athletes have

115
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:25,890
gone to this place to figure out
what's happening. What's the,

116
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,650
what's the secret here? You know, and
this, and there's all kinds of theories.

117
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,010
Like it's something about the tree
that they use to make the spoon,

118
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:36,150
which they used to mix the corn
meal. What would the tree do? Well,

119
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,330
this was this Swedish scientist
who came in and looked at Lugalia,

120
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,240
which is a corn meal. It's
the basic staple food of,

121
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:47,241
of Kenyans because he wanted to mix it
with the water from the spring in the pot

122
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:50,400
that Calonge in use thinking that
something chemical was happening that was

123
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:54,160
making these, these guys, you know,
run super fast that, I mean, you know,

124
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,320
it's kind of silly but, but
a lot of people here, Tom,
tell me it's the bananas,

125
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,120
but people have also suggested
some more reasonable theories.

126
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,740
Well John Manners.

127
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,460
People talk a lot about altitude and the
ability to process oxygen and what have

128
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:08,850
you.

129
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,790
Other people have said it's cause the
calendar didn't have a high starchy diet

130
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,520
or because they run to school. This
is a very prominent phenomenon.

131
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:17,850
We know that the runners that come from
the calendar and tribe to become great

132
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:19,310
runners, they're much more
likely to have run to,

133
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,890
to and from school long distances
like 10 k to and from school.

134
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,740
But there are millions of kids in Kenya
who run to and from school or who live

135
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,420
in altitude.

136
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,440
The problem with all of these is that
these are not specific to the Collagen.

137
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,410
Yeah. So then you get the
socioeconomic arguments.

138
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,930
The salary of a runner is
a, is attractive, you know,

139
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:43,680
10 or $20,000 a year seems like
a fortune worth striving for,

140
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,370
but the country's not so poor that it
can't send competitors to the athletic

141
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,710
competitions. This is Malcolm Gladwell's
argument actually. Very close. Yeah.

142
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:54,090
There's a, there's a social pressure
to it. This is how you get out. Yeah.

143
00:08:54,091 --> 00:08:57,620
And there's so many role. I mean every
village has some kind of champion. Yeah.

144
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,320
The problem with that argument,

145
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:01,530
I mean there's actually no problem
with the argument. It makes sense,

146
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:04,890
but it doesn't say how the calendar and
got so good in the first place that they

147
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,710
created these role models. I mean,
where did the role models come from?

148
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:13,130
So the idea you're left with is maybe
there's something genetically different

149
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:15,870
about them that makes them better than us.

150
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:18,910
[inaudible]

151
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,240
this is obviously a
dangerous idea. And in fact,

152
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:25,330
when David Epstein was writing his
book about sports and athletics,

153
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,910
almost backed out of writing the book
because I realized I was going to have to

154
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:31,070
address ethnic differences
and gender differences. I,

155
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,160
I really did almost back out of it.

156
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,790
There were scientists who confessed
to me that they were withholding data,

157
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,340
that they had studies that
show to genetic advantage,

158
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,000
but they wouldn't show him because they
were afraid that they'd lose tenure.

159
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,780
But he says you have to
acknowledge the obvious.

160
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,640
One aspect of innate biology that
clearly helps Calonge and a that's been

161
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:53,320
studied by scientists
is their bodybuilding.

162
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,210
So the calendar and what's called
a, a lot of people they're from,

163
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:00,730
they have ancestry in very low latitude.

164
00:10:00,731 --> 00:10:03,140
I was criss crossing the equator
when I was visiting their track,

165
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,520
their training camps, and when you have
your ancestry in a hot and dry climate,

166
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,460
you have have a certain body type
for cooling and we know this,

167
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:13,120
we've known this for over a century.
It's called Alan's rule. That organisms,

168
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:13,841
not just humans,

169
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:17,350
all organisms that evolved and hot and
dry climates have a certain body type,

170
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,640
namely very long and thin limbs so that
there's a lot of surface area through

171
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:23,230
which he can dissipate their limbs,

172
00:10:23,231 --> 00:10:27,370
get thinner the farther away they
get from their center of gravity.

173
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:31,030
So they have extremely thin
ankles and extremely thin calves,

174
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,230
which is particularly important because
your leg is like a pendulum and the more

175
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:38,020
weight you have farther away
from your center of gravity,

176
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:41,440
the more difficult it is to swing. This
has been tested in the lab too, right?

177
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,680
So you take a runner and put eight
pounds of weight around their waist,

178
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,340
it increases the energy they have
to use to run at a given pace.

179
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,240
But if you take that same eight pounds
and put it in the form of two four pound

180
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:56,380
weights around their ankles, it's
like over 25% the increase in energy,

181
00:10:56,381 --> 00:10:59,890
they need to run at the same
pace. So if you have fed ankles,

182
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,370
find a different sport, right?

183
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,570
You're not going to win the New York
marathon if you have a thick ankles.

184
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,110
And so it gets you to this place
where you think, well, I dunno,

185
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:12,930
maybe halogen from these area, maybe
they have this built in advantage. Hmm,

186
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,980
it's physics. I don't know. Somehow like
I to Sorta just peg it all on physics

187
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,920
smells like an argument that I really
don't like. Oh, nobody likes it.

188
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,440
I don't think it's a
question of like or dislike.

189
00:11:23,441 --> 00:11:27,820
I think it's just not the reason I
watched the Olympics. I mean, you know,

190
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,300
going back to Kipp Kaino. Yeah.

191
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,140
Why? Huh? Who

192
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,330
overcame a gallbladder infection to
break the Olympic world record in 1968 he

193
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:38,670
didn't win because he had thin ankles.

194
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,720
He won because of something which is
the reason we watch sports. You know,

195
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:46,950
it's dead essence that will power
or triumph over adversity. Right?

196
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,170
The triumph of the human
over everything. Yes.

197
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,740
And this is where I ran
across a completely new,

198
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,350
fascinating and somewhat terrifying way
of explaining why the [inaudible] are so

199
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:02,080
good and it's an idea that eventually
led me to go to calendar and country

200
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:02,914
myself.

201
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,640
That's perfect way of beginning a little
cow hoot to get to 10 which is in the

202
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:12,400
mountains. The air is cool.
There's a lot of cows,

203
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,390
lot of people and it around
5:36 AM all you hear is the,

204
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:19,120
the pitter patter of feet

205
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,730
and then all these people just pass
you all of a sudden and then you know,

206
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,810
you wait for a few more seconds to two
people pass you again because everybody's

207
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:32,590
running. I even started morning
jogging when I was there.

208
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:35,650
I'm not really a morning jogger, but
it just kind of got into the flow.

209
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,430
Anyway, while I was there, I met this guy,

210
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,380
his name's brother Cole McConnell
Colombo. I'm Irish of course,

211
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,500
came to Kenya in 1976
famous running coach.

212
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:51,490
He works with a lot of Kenyan runners.
So I met him in an Irish pub in Eldoret,

213
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:56,500
which is, um, there's only one
when I asked him this question,

214
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,160
what is it that bakes the calendar so
good. This is what he told me. When you,

215
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:04,450
when you're train an
athlete, um, to a high level,

216
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,390
you need to remember that they
live on the edge of injury.

217
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,670
They live on the edge of overtraining.
They leave on the age of paint,

218
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,980
paint, paint, television,
CSF. They look to some degree.

219
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,570
Everybody has a runner, talks about
this insidious protean nature of pain,

220
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:26,860
how it finds all the places you become
breathless and in your lungs have

221
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:27,490
needles.

222
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,750
The best runners have to learn to mentally
override these distress signals to

223
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,430
run. Despite the page. He actually
calls it expanding your pain barrier,

224
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,740
but Columbo, Connell
says for the calendar,

225
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,740
pain is something else entirely. You
know your ability to withstand pain,

226
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,220
that that in a sense into
[inaudible] tradition made you a man.

227
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,000
Quite literally the central event of
their young lives will come up when they

228
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:58,140
are going to be initiated into the
tribe. That's John Manners. Again,

229
00:13:58,141 --> 00:14:02,040
remember he spent part of his childhood
in calendaring territory and he says

230
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,470
when he was a boy, say 12 years old,

231
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,370
he would notice his friends had
scars on their arms and legs,

232
00:14:08,371 --> 00:14:12,540
marks of having burned their
arms and legs with the hot coals.

233
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,920
He soon learned they were practicing for
this initiation moment. And you know,

234
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:21,120
you're facing it for 10 years at least
because as a calender and teenager,

235
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:25,230
boy or girl, you have to go through
an experience which is so painful.

236
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,800
It's a kind of theatrical orgy of pain.

237
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,263
And here's what happens.

238
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,430
First you have to crawl naked
through stinging nettles, um,

239
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,840
which is like formic acid, you know,
and African stinging nettles are much,

240
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:43,980
much skinnier than the western
stinging nettle. But then your, your,

241
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,080
your fingers are squeezed together.

242
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,460
Then you get beaten on that bony part
of your ankle where it really hurts.

243
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,410
But that's just warm up because then

244
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,673
one morning

245
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,513
calms the circumcision.

246
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,620
Now we have some idea of
how circumcision works.

247
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,880
Maybe some of us are circumcised. So
you perform it on a baby and it's,

248
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,390
it's one kind of experience. I've gone
through that myself. I've seen it done.

249
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,180
I've had to hold the legs
also my nephew, it's hard,

250
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,530
but the calendar can circumcise
somewhere right after puberty.

251
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:21,360
So around age 13 to 17 mm
oh, they're four skin is,

252
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,980
is not only cut, but it's tied
into a bow. The more than that,

253
00:15:25,981 --> 00:15:28,800
the tied into the boating thing.
Got To stop there. I kind of froze.

254
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:32,660
I don't really know how to describe
it past there. I believe that

255
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:33,950
of the,

256
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,580
either the top or the bottom
of the foreskin is pierced
and then the head of the

257
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:39,410
penis has pushed through the opening.

258
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,990
Uh, and the thing is
it's not just the cut.

259
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,870
Actually when he undergoes the operation,

260
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,530
he is obliged be absolutely
stoical still unflinching.

261
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,720
So in some versions of this ceremony,

262
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:57,750
mud is caked on the face and
then the mud is allowed to dry.

263
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,610
If a crack appears in the mud,
your cheek may twitch your,

264
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:05,530
your forehead may crinkle.
And if that happens,

265
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,180
a little crack will appear in the mud.

266
00:16:07,181 --> 00:16:10,270
And all the people around will know to
immediately start beating you with large

267
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:14,920
sticks. So worst part though
is not just the beating,

268
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,340
it's that after that moment,

269
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:22,240
if you don't make it through this
ceremony, you get labeled a cabby.

270
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:26,710
Tet a coward. You're a pariah in
society. You're not part of society.

271
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,730
In the olden days,

272
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,080
you didn't have access to the economic
opportunities to afford what's called the

273
00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:35,710
bride price, which is what you, what
you need to get a wife. However,

274
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,390
if you show yourself to be a true warrior,

275
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:39,310
if you make it through this
experience, then then hey,

276
00:16:39,311 --> 00:16:42,370
you get the rights of reproduction.
You may even have two or three wives.

277
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,150
So manners wondered then
he's just speculating here.

278
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:51,180
But maybe if you have 2000 years of this
sexual selection of ensuring that the

279
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:56,620
stoical tough guy types get to have
babies, the sensitive types don't.

280
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,390
Maybe it's not just that the
calendar are built for speed,

281
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,840
it's not just that they
have the body type.

282
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:07,110
Maybe they have some sort
of innate ability mentally
to persevere through pain.

283
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,950
Huh.

284
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:13,950
And is that a cultural ability or would
he say that all that selection has

285
00:17:14,591 --> 00:17:18,880
filtered into their DNA in some way?
Well, so manners this, he isn't sure,

286
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,960
and there's certainly no gene for
stoicism that that's been discovered.

287
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,490
And any athletic success has to
be ascribed to a host of factors.

288
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,830
But W can I play one cut?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's here.

289
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,790
So, um, all right. So I was in Eaton,

290
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,720
I was thinking about that question and
I met this kid named Ellie kip cocaine.

291
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,230
He's 19 years old. So self-described
bookwork from the very beginning.

292
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,770
I never wanted to go through
the traditional form of
circumcision cause I knew

293
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,970
the ordeal as in it was so,

294
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,230
and actually what he said was please
circumcise me in the hospital.

295
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,320
I want to do the cowardly way.
But his relative said no, you,

296
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,950
you chain the entire family
and if you don't do it, yeah

297
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,230
you're not a fool man.
That's how they put it.

298
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:07,710
So he felt like he had to just do
it cause I still had this beatings.

299
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,660
You're supposed to stay for night.
I was inside the Coldwater then, uh,

300
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,530
early in the morning, around seven in the
morning. It's a conversation they use,

301
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:21,370
I sharp stick. I hope you
understand that. A sharp stick.

302
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,440
So it's just,

303
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,250
and he said the whole initiation ritual
actually went on for a couple of weeks.

304
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:30,270
It was more than just the cut.

305
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,140
And during the whole time he was kept in
a hut on the outskirts of the village.

306
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,980
Is faced with powdered white
like a ghost, and he was told,

307
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,000
whenever you leave this hut,
you are not allowed to work.

308
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,860
You're not allowed to walk. So
you're supposed to run very fast.

309
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,280
So you only [inaudible]
having the opinion.

310
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,890
And before the circumcision, Ellie
was never a runner. Afterwards,

311
00:18:55,891 --> 00:19:00,000
when he was done with initiation and
he was back in high school, I said, Oh,

312
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,270
let me give it a try so I could
run and I feel pain. I feel pain,

313
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:06,280
I'm feeling pain and I wanted
to stop [inaudible] let me try.

314
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,530
Let me just tell you.

315
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,760
They didn't tell him I one one one 21
one time and two minutes later I was at

316
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,500
school. Ellie joined his track team,

317
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:18,120
started running to school and during his
lunchtimes and after 24 two weeks and

318
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:18,954
three weeks,

319
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,830
I became an expert and I was known
as the school cliff after how long?

320
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,740
After two weeks salon to Salon.
Two weeks. That's how we began.

321
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,220
That's a crazy stories. That
really true. Yeah, that's true.

322
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,640
So probably my ability of running
was a bit higher than dressed.

323
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,640
Turns out Ellie's mom was an
accomplished athlete. Okay,

324
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,650
so you're saying you had
some physical ability to run,

325
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:41,340
but you just didn't really do it before?
I never realized that I could run.

326
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,890
So we didn't talk at all about women,

327
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,520
but calendars and girls also
go through an initiation,

328
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:51,930
right of their own female genital
mutilation, the same type of ritual,

329
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,860
not the same ceremony, but a similar
type of stoical testing ceremony.

330
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,530
And to me this made no sense.
This is John Manners again.

331
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,100
Obviously the women are not the
warriors, they don't need to be brave.

332
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:07,101
Why is it important for them to
show courage during this operation?

333
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,040
And when I asked this question of my
calendar and friends many years ago,

334
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,510
they were kind of astonished at the
question as though the answer should have

335
00:20:18,511 --> 00:20:19,231
been self evident.

336
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:23,130
And the answer they gave me was a
woman who chose cowardice during this

337
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:26,460
operation might bear cowardly sons.

338
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,890
So some Collagen might say that Ellie
actually got two things from his mom.

339
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,490
One was his physical prowess,
his speed on the track.

340
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,330
The other was a mental ability
to persevere through pain.

341
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,350
People usually say it's
called a blessing in college.

342
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,850
[inaudible] blessing is what
you get. Probably a father,

343
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,830
probably a grandmother. So you wish
he blesses you with that activity.

344
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,680
That's what you used to
see the blessing. That's,

345
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,730
that's pretty interesting,
right? It's interesting,

346
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,390
although we're using inheriting
words are blessing words.

347
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,480
What we're really talking about is the
pressure of a culture that is simply

348
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,670
choosing to deeply,

349
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:16,671
psychically reward certain behaviors and
create expectations for those behaviors

350
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,640
and create success around those
behaviors. Those are all cultural,

351
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:25,470
not biological things, but they, they
are the equivalent. I think it's both.

352
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,080
Uh,

353
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,080
and I don't know what proportion each
contributes to the ultimate result.

354
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,780
I, it's, I have no way of judging,

355
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,050
but whatever the mechanism
and whatever it is,

356
00:21:39,051 --> 00:21:43,880
it'll probably stay a mystery of all the
explanations out there for why this one

357
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:46,100
group of people is so good at running.

358
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,170
This is the first one that's
made me want to run. Hmm.

359
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,530
Once I met Ellie and talk
to these runners in Kenya,

360
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,010
you know, this is a embarrassing
story because I don't run very fast,

361
00:21:58,011 --> 00:22:01,340
but I got to the gym and I was
on the treadmill and I was like,

362
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,520
I'm taking it up to seven you
know, seven miles an hour,

363
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,030
like 7.1 actually I went and you
know that's not like very fast,

364
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,500
but that would usually be my end run like
at the last five minutes I'm I do with

365
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:16,430
them. But it went, but I did the whole
25 minutes at 7.1 and I thought, how did,

366
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:19,070
why did I ever think that
this was undoable before?

367
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:23,900
Why was I staying at like 6.8 if we're
trying to figure out what makes these

368
00:22:23,901 --> 00:22:28,700
runners so great? And our first
answer is a totally scientifically,

369
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:29,870
factually true,

370
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,370
but somehow demoralizing absolute.

371
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,020
That puts one set of people over
there and the rest of us over here,

372
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,420
we all have our body type
that we're born with.

373
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,530
But then if the second explanation
of this Calonge in advantage,

374
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,070
maybe just as inaccessible
to the rest of us,

375
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,120
but still it feels like a more
egalitarian version of advantage,

376
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,970
even if we're talking about a very
specific culture. Yeah. I think the,

377
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,980
if you run with this extreme pain for a
month after having been circumcised and

378
00:23:02,391 --> 00:23:07,391
somehow that gave you a certain culturally
troubling but also real relationship

379
00:23:08,991 --> 00:23:11,090
to pain, that feels like
a fair advantage to me.

380
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,390
Not that I would wish
it on anyone. Actually.

381
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,810
Even Ellie does not wish it
on his kids when he has kids.

382
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,710
The system is changing from
the traditional format to
the new format right now.

383
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,110
I mean, he's part of a new
generation of Collagen.

384
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,730
He says for his contemporaries,

385
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,470
the painfree hospital circumcision
is becoming slowly less of a stigma.

386
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,830
And I can't imagine my son going through
the same procedure as their father.

387
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,890
So my son, one of my sons went to go
through the same procedure as I did,

388
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,400
but um, didn't, I mean, don't
you want your son to be,

389
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,850
to have the benefits of what
you, the benefits only a boot.

390
00:23:48,851 --> 00:23:52,250
The perseverance part of it and they
believe [inaudible] can get through many

391
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:56,600
ways. He tells himself he's going to be
able to pass on those Calonge and values

392
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,500
without resorting to the ancient rituals.
I will teach him how to persevere

393
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,110
and he thinks his kids will still be able
to be champion runners if that's what

394
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:08,954
they want to be.

395
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:24,580
[inaudible]

396
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,240
thanks to Gregory Warner, NPRs
East Africa correspondent. Also,

397
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:32,050
we should say thanks to FIA Beneen
for production help on this piece.

398
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,930
Thank you for you and thank you guys
for listening. I'm Chad. I'm Robert.

399
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:35,860
We'll see you next time.
