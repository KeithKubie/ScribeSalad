but we have to address them today
 

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.370
but we have to address them today
I think again we need to approach it at

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:05.380
I think again we need to approach it at
 

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.340
I think again we need to approach it at
multi levels I think we have to have the

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:08.350
multi levels I think we have to have the
 

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.770
multi levels I think we have to have the
laws that protect women the laws that

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:10.780
laws that protect women the laws that
 

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.100

whatever that may be that's very
 

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.400
whatever that may be that's very
important and then not only have the

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:17.410
important and then not only have the
 

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.150
important and then not only have the
laws but also respect those laws and

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:20.160
laws but also respect those laws and
 

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.560
laws but also respect those laws and
take them to action so that people feel

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:22.570

that they're going to be responsible for
 

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.310
that they're going to be responsible for
their actions and then we need to work

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320
their actions and then we need to work
 

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.070
their actions and then we need to work
with the women themselves empower them

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080

this is not what should happen that this
 

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:36.450
this is not what should happen that this
is actually aberrant behavior that

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:36.460
is actually aberrant behavior that
 

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:38.400
is actually aberrant behavior that
should be stopped and to enable them

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:38.410
should be stopped and to enable them
 

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:41.280
should be stopped and to enable them
through working we do it through working

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:41.290
through working we do it through working
 

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.650
through working we do it through working
of women's groups for example women come

mother to child prevention of
 

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:27.170
mother to child prevention of
mother-to-child transmission should be

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:27.180
mother-to-child transmission should be
 

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.480
mother-to-child transmission should be
done by thinking of the mother by

action and in shaping the interventions
and shaking the program so actually it

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040
and shaking the program so actually it
 

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.210
and shaking the program so actually it
can be a family approach so that women

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:41.220

nonetheless I think in in many ways we

00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:58.740
nonetheless I think in in many ways we
 

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:00.890
nonetheless I think in in many ways we
fail to make the connections that every

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:00.900
fail to make the connections that every
 

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.780
fail to make the connections that every
single woman every single pregnant woman

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:02.790
single woman every single pregnant woman
 

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:04.130
single woman every single pregnant woman
get that said every single pregnant

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:04.140
get that said every single pregnant
 

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.170
get that said every single pregnant
woman gets the care she needs and every

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:06.180
woman gets the care she needs and every
 

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.730

to get the access to the treatment that
 

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:13.790
to get the access to the treatment that
they need and that's where I think we

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800
they need and that's where I think we
 

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.220
they need and that's where I think we
need to continue to mobilize the

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:16.230
need to continue to mobilize the
 

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:19.040
need to continue to mobilize the

around prevention or transmission I
 

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:32.150
around prevention or transmission I
think it has that in many ways

families with HIV and maybe if we put it
 

00:38:45.529 --> 00:38:47.559
families with HIV and maybe if we put it
in the framework and bring it into the

00:38:47.559 --> 00:38:47.569
in the framework and bring it into the
 

00:38:47.569 --> 00:38:49.870
in the framework and bring it into the
mainstream of HIV programs we actually

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:49.880
mainstream of HIV programs we actually
 

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.680
mainstream of HIV programs we actually
might be more effective in reaching in

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:53.690
might be more effective in reaching in
 

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:55.630
might be more effective in reaching in
prevention new transmissions but also in

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640
prevention new transmissions but also in
 

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:59.140
prevention new transmissions but also in
bringing children who are already

00:38:59.140 --> 00:38:59.150

those treatments but I think that it's
 

00:39:08.839 --> 00:39:11.019
those treatments but I think that it's
going to require a concerted effort and

00:39:11.019 --> 00:39:11.029
going to require a concerted effort and
 

00:39:11.029 --> 00:39:12.160

00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:38.970
prevention I think roughly the budget
 

00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:42.290
prevention I think roughly the budget
now allows roughly about 4% for

00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:42.300
now allows roughly about 4% for
 

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:46.760
now allows roughly about 4% for
prevention and when we invest in

00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:46.770
prevention and when we invest in
 

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:49.640
prevention and when we invest in
prevention to make sure the resources

00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:49.650
