00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:07.609
Vsauce, Kevin here, with a slot car race track
to visualize how fast I can safely drive without

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:08.780
getting pulled over.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.960
What’s my maximum speed without wreaking
havoc on the justice system?

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.830
And how can we use game theory to find the
answer?

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.420
Here we go.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.830
Oops!

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.240
Oops!

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.340
Alright that didn’t really work out very
well.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.610
Honestly, I don’t even have enough room
to properly setup this track on this table

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.610
so...

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.190
Um, I'm gonna need some help.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.450
Luckily, I partnered with CuriosityStream,
and I know just the guy...

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.810
Hey, Sean!

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.070
As host of the awesome new CuriosityStream
show, Speed, I was hoping that you could help

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.170
me visualize speeding but.. it looks like...
you already have the track here.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.170
Yeah, well.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.480
Kevin, to do just that, I have magically manifested
exactly the same track that you have, right

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.480
here on my table.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.480
That's super convenient.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.480
Yeah, boom!

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.480
Okay so.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.480
Let's race.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.970
I will be the cop car and you will be the
civilian driver.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.280
I wouldn't have it any other way.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.950
Okay, do I get a head start?

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:06.950
Yes.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:07.950
I'm gonna pull you over.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.950
Let's go!

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.950
Let's go.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.930
Okay, so I'm racing ahead.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.510
There's a turbo button, which you can use
kinda in the straightaways, that's helping

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.002
me gain on you, actually.

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:21.002
Oh...

00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:22.002
But...

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:23.002
Ahhh....

00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:24.002
If you turbo in the corner it's too much speed
and you fly right off.

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:25.002
Why did that happen, though?

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:28.060
Okay, that happens because, in this case,
you exceeded the coefficient of friction between

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.610
the tires, the slot, and the top of the track.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.250
Now, these cars, they can go around the corner
a lot faster than a normal car can.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.830
Because they have this little peg that's riding
in that slot.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.830
Yeah.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.620
So when they go around the corner, they're
resisting centripetal force which wants to

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.580
sling it off... the car wants to keep going
in a straight line.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.580
Right.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.030
But this slot helps drag it around the corner.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.810
Now in our cars, we don't have a slot.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.670
So if we go around a corner too fast we slide
off when we exceed the coefficient of friction

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.670
of our tires.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.310
And our tires, although they look kinda big,
they really don't have that much space on

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.310
the road.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.310
And I'm gonna show ya that.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.630
I brought one of the tires off one of my motorbikes
here.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.370
I'm just gonna sharpie the top here and this
looks like a pretty big, round tire.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.370
Right?

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.370
Rides down the road...

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:16.540
Only when it's riding down the road, on the
street, it's really only got about 1 inch.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.540
Wow!

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.540
Right?

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.540
If we take a look at that, there.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.950
There's really only about 1 inch wide and
maybe 3 inches long.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.550
That's the contact between me, and the motorcycle,
and the ground.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.170
The same is true on the tires on your car,
right?

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.510
The tire's all the way around but the only
part that's actually touching the ground is

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.050
that little bit on the bottom.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.990
And if you have your tire's overinflated,
you're getting a much smaller contact patch.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.990
That makes sense.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.990
Because your tire's not deforming.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.990
Yeah, yeah!

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.410
So that little contact patch is important
to understand.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.330
You got four of these little contact patches
that are maybe 4 inches by 5 inches wide on

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.540
your four tires and the weight of that car
pushing down on that contact patch is the

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.070
only thing that keeps you from sliding off
the road when you go around a corner.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.000
The weight of the car, the inertia of the
car, wants it to keep going straight, when

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.250
you turn the car, the front wheels move off
in one direction and the friction makes those

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.940
tires track around the corner.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.700
The reason that's important, is because you're
also using that same friction, not only to

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.480
go around a corner but you're using it to
accelerate and to brake.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.560
If you accelerate too fast, you overcome the
coefficient of friction between your tire

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.510
and the ground with that little contact patch
and you do a burnout.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.510
Mmm hmm.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.520
Which can actually be a lot of fun, in a controlled
environment.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.520
But!

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.640
The more important thing for all of us driving
around, that's really, really pertinent to

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.959
our safety is that the faster you go, you're
asking more and more of that little tiny contact

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.099
patch to help slow you down when you hit the
brakes.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.500
So if you're going way faster, you have to
be easier on the brakes.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.590
If you lock up the brakes, you'll slide the
whole car forward and that's what's happening

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.590
here.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.110
Is you're just having it carrying too much
speed into the turn, tires and the slot can't

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.090
take it, and it's sliding right off the track.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.090
Okay.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.099
Wanna try it again?

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.099
Yeah, yeah!

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.250
Umm.. where's the cop car?

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.319
Let's restore the...

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.319
Go ahead!

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.319
Okay!

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.319
Here we go.

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.730
So that's a technical reason why you don't
wanna speed but there's lots of other reasons

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.500
why you don't wanna speed too, right?

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.730
Yeah, I mean, that's why it's dangerous to
speed but also, in society, y'know, we have

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.730
to have..

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.730
Oops.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.730
There we go.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.730
In society, we can't have that happening.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.730
No, can't have that happening.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.239
Y'know, we want everyone to be safe and we
have rules, regulations, and law enforcement

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.669
in place to make sure that everyone is acting
safely.

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:26.800
The thing we don't really think about is that
driving in a system governed by law enforcement

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.949
is actually a two player game.

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.120
And both the driver and the police officer
are playing this game.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.680
Let's say that the speed limit is 65 miles
per hour.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.639
What's the fastest you've ever driven because
I have a feeling it's a lot more than that.

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.180
I've drive about 130 miles per hour.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.180
Okay.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.180
Yeah.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.039
But my question is, what is a sensible speed
to drive on the highway?

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.180
The answer to that question is somewhat complicated
because it really depends on the highway,

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.449
and the conditions, and if it's raining, and
the state of your car.

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:58.449
Right?

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.240
But, in general, for roads that are, we collectively
deem we need to go slower in because either

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.939
it's near a neighborhood, or because the road
itself is twistier, we have lower speed limits.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:07.939
Right?

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:08.939
Yeah.

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.659
And we have big, straight superhighways where
we can all do 75 or whatever the limit is

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:12.930
in your area.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:19.469
But, the point is that, cops can't pull over
single driver just for going one mile per

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:24.569
hour over whatever that limit is because,
not only is that logistically impossible,

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:29.490
but that level of law enforcement would probably
make everyone pretty angry.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:36.129
So, when we drive and the police monitor us,
we're playing a game of recursion, to get

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:37.430
the best result.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.779
Both of the police and the drivers are sort
of playing this game from different sides.

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:41.779
Exactly, exactly.

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:44.099
We've got a couple of basic rules in this
game.

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:49.319
We have a legal speed limit of, let's say
65 miles per hour, and we have common sense

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:55.089
rules that tell us that we can only go so
fast before it gets dangerous and we're flying

00:05:55.089 --> 00:06:01.100
off the edge of the road and the police officer
has a threshold at which he or she will ticket

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.100
the driver.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:09.479
So each player is deciding what to do based
on what they think the other player will do.

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.069
Yeah, there's a gray area, isn't there?

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:12.939
Yeah, it basically works like this.

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:20.050
As the cop, I'm thinking how fast does Sean
think he can go without getting pulled over.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.249
Right, and as the driver, I'm thinking, how
fast can I get away with, without getting

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:26.249
pulled over.

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:27.249
Exactly!

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:28.249
Exactly!

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:33.580
And as the cop, I'm also thinking how fast
does Sean think I think he thinks he can go?

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.649
And he's thinking, how fast do I think he
thinks he can go?

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:39.819
And that's recursion.

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:47.020
At the end of this process, which can be infinite,
both the driver and the cop decide their best

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.430
course of action.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.729
For the driver, that's, like you said, how
fast he can go safely without getting a ticket,

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:57.919
and for the cop, that's how fast he'll let
the driver go before pulling him over.

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:00.219
Right, and this whole game takes place in
that gray area.

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:03.409
I mean I know if I stay under 65, I'll never
get pulled over.

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:04.939
That's the easy way to do it.

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:05.939
Right?

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:09.530
And I know if I go 130, I'm gonna get pulled
over.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.580
So there's this strip there, and that's the
gray area where that game you're talking about

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.580
is getting played.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.599
Ultimately, so, what do you think would be
an exact value if the limit was 65 miles per

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:21.219
hour that we could get.

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:27.039
That you could drive, without getting pulled
over, and so that you're happy with the speed

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:28.039
that you're going.

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:34.340
I think it's general wisdom that you can get
away with about 5 miles over the speed limit,

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.819
especially on the highway when there's no
chance of coming across a stop sign or someone

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:39.819
on the road, right?

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:43.559
So when there's... in a safe environment like
that I think everybody pretty much feel like

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:48.709
they can go 5 miles over the speed limit and
not get pulled over or somewhere in that gray

00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:49.709
area.

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:54.349
Both the police and the speeder, are playing
this game from their own sides, right?

00:07:54.349 --> 00:07:57.659
The speeder trying to figure out how fast
they can get away with, the police trying

00:07:57.659 --> 00:08:00.499
to figure out how much they'll allow, but
they both have an incentive to make the whole

00:08:00.499 --> 00:08:01.499
system work.

00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:05.810
So when they both play the game and they find
this place where they get to speed a little

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:09.129
and don't get pulled over they're in that
gray area and they find a balance.

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:12.449
And that balance is called a Nash Equilibrium.

00:08:12.449 --> 00:08:17.400
What Sean described is the best reply to another
player’s best action, and when neither player

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:22.039
has an incentive to deviate from their decision,
they’ve reached a Nash Equilibrium.

00:08:22.039 --> 00:08:29.061
Okay, I need to talk more about Nash Equilibrium
but I need my whiteboard table, so, thank

00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:30.949
you so much, Sean for all of your help.

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:35.950
Make sure you watch his show, Speed on CuriosityStream,
I know that you guys will love it.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:36.950
But for now...

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:37.950
I have to...

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:38.950
I have to...

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:39.950
I have to go.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:46.200
Okay, now one of the most famous Nash Equilibrium
scenarios comes in the form of the well-known

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.690
Prisoner’s Dilemma.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:51.720
The scene is simple: two people get arrested
for a crime.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.210
They’re separated and can’t communicate
with each other.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:09:01.530
The police can convict both on a lesser charge,
but they need more proof to convict them on

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.680
the big one.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.530
That means one has to testify that the other
did the crime.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:12.920
So, is it in each prisoner’s best interest
to rat on the other one or to stay quiet?

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.370
Here’s how it plays out:

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:22.770
If both Prisoners A and B rat on each other,
they’ll each get 2 years in prison.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:30.340
If A blames B, but B stays quiet, A goes free
and B gets 3 years in prison -- and vice versa.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:35.640
If both A and B stay quiet, they’ll each
get 1 year in prison.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:42.020
The rational prisoner rats, because that’s
the only way he’s going to go free… and

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:47.100
when he rats, it always gives him a better
result than if he doesn’t rat regardless

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.200
of what the other prisoner does.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.950
That’s called a dominant strategy, and the
Nash Equilibrium in the Prisoner’s Dilemma

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.110
is achieved by… betrayal.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:03.201
But if the other prisoner also behaves rationally,
he would rat as well, and they’d both get

00:10:03.201 --> 00:10:04.940
2 years.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:12.130
The best course of action here is cooperation
where both stay quiet, serve a lesser sentence,

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.330
and have the least bad outcome.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:20.490
In the Prisoner’s Dilemma, not betraying
the other guy goes against the Nash Equilibrium

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:25.660
-- but it gives the best possible result for
both players combined.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:31.740
Because if one rats and the other doesn’t,
3 years are served, if both rat 4 years are

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:37.690
served, and through cooperation only 2 years
are served.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:44.000
Political scientist Robert Axelrod asked 14
game theory experts to submit computer simulations

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.470
of the Prisoner’s Dilemma.

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:51.630
The ones that advocated more self-interest
by betrayal were noted as “not nice” players,

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.220
while the ones that focused on cooperation,
they were “nice.”

00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:01.880
After running them all, the top half of the
performers were all “nice” models, while

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.100
the bottom half were all “not nice.”

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:13.460
So, it pays to be nice… as long as the other
player thinks it pays to be nice, too.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:19.120
We play these 2-player games all day long,
not just with the police.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.210
When we give a gift, we’re playing a game.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:26.890
For example, say you’ve just met someone,
and you kinda like them.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:31.230
Giving them a spatula is probably not a great
gift.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:36.930
Giving them a diamond ring on the second date
is probably a bit much.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:39.220
Pump the brakes, there...

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.220
Billy.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:45.240
In the gift-giving game, you want to send
the right message based on what you feel and

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.160
the recursive process that happens with what
you think they’ll feel.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.150
You want to feel good about the gift you gave
and they want to feel good about the gift

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.160
they’ve received.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:02.730
And whether you’re driving down the highway
or trying to impress your crush, you’re

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:10.870
almost always in some kind of two-player game,
and sometimes you’re in several at once.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.380
The best way to play is to be smart.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.430
To pay attention.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.090
And keep your best interest in mind.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:26.510
But you’ll usually win the most when you
make sure to be nice.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.860
I guess grandma was right.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.130
And as always -- thanks for watching!

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:42.620
