00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.620

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.240
by University of California Television.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.640

00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:23.122
(lively music)

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.980
- Good afternoon and welcome.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.790
It's delightful to see
such a gigantic crowd.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.800
We are pleased, along
with the Graduate Council,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.670
to present Svante Paabo,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.380
this year's speaker in the
Foerster Lecture series.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.630
Which I should tell you,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.530
according to the terms of the agreement,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.740
is dedicated to an exploration

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.740
of the immortality of the soul
or other kindred subjects.

00:01:08.797 --> 00:01:10.050
(attendees laughing)

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.600
I'll get back to the kindred subject part

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.100
at the end of my introduction.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.610
Now I know there are a
lot of scientists in here

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.710
so you'll forgive me, because I'm not one.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.490
I have never forgotten the
excitement that I experienced

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.590
when I read the opening pages
of Donald Johanson's Lucy

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.310
about 30-odd years ago.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.850
In fact when I left Australia,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.210
I took a handful of books with me,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.403
and one of them was was Lucy.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.630
On the morning of
November 30th, he writes,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.420
1974, I woke as I usually
do on a field expedition

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.680
at daybreak.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.210
Johanson and his team as we
all know were in Ethiopia

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.980
in a place called Hadar.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.700
An ancient lake bed in the Afar Desert.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.740
They were looking for fossils

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.590
at a place called Location 162.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.280
Having found nothing that
day, they headed back to camp

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.600
but stopped on the way
to survey a little gully.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.357
There was nothing to be found
until Johanson called out,

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:08.327
"That's a bit of hominid arm."

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:10.270
"Jesus Christ!" exclaimed Tom Gray,

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.030
the graduate student with
Johanson at the time.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.200
One piece led to another and another

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.330
until a pretty intact skeleton
of a young female was found,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.363
who became known to the world as Lucy.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.100
Reading Svante Paabo's recently published

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.080
Neanderthal Man: In
Search of Lost Genomes,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.560
I experienced that same
sense of exhilaration again.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.210
He begins.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.788
Late one night in 1996,
I just dozed off in bed

00:02:36.788 --> 00:02:38.690
when my phone rang.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.820
The caller was Matthias
Krings, a graduate student

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.080
in my laboratory at the
Zoological Institute

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.080
at the University of Munich.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.690
All he said was, "It's not human."

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.970
I'm coming, I mumbled,
threw on some clothes,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.710
and drove across town to the lab.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.350
That afternoon, Mattias had started

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.310
our DNA sequencing machines,

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.080
feeding them fragments
of DNA he had extracted

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.550
and amplified from a small
piece of a Neanderthal arm bone

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.940
held at the Rheinisches
Landesmuseum in Bonn.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.890
It had been discovered
about 140 years ago.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.440
Here it was, another hominid
arm was about to reveal

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.493
another piece of the grand
story of human evolution.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.920
Just as the dry earth at Hadar,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.320
disgorged one bone after
another belonging to Lucy,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.290
Professor Paabo writes
that when he got to the lab

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.990
Mattias and a young
archeologist, Ralf Schmitz,

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.830
Could hardly control their delight

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.780
as they showed me the string of As, Cs,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.370
Gs and Ts coming out of the sequences.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.350
And just as had been true
for Johanson and Gray,

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.117
Paabo writes of his coworkers,

00:03:43.117 --> 00:03:46.757
"Neither they nor I had ever
seen anything like it before."

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.615
Aside from the fact that
paleoanthropologists

00:03:49.615 --> 00:03:53.710
and paleogeneticists seem to
have some of their best moments

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.883
when either just getting out
of bed or slipping into it,

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.720
what the best of them are able to do

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.760
is convey to those of
us not in those fields

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.080
but deeply interested in them

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.460
is their giddy excitement at discovery

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.840
and the high-minded
purpose of their research,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.790
the quest for human origins.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.420
And it is indeed as
important as it sounds.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.530
Svante Paabo is a Swedish,
as you know, biologist

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.510
and evolutionary anthropologist,

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.230
best known as one of the
founders of paleogenetics.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.800
Since developing a method
of isolating and sequencing

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.000
the DNA of long-extinct species,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.780
Professor Paabo and his
lab have worked extensively

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.850
on Neanderthal DNA.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.820
In 2010, they succeeded in
mapping the Neanderthal genome.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.520
Professor Paabo's work has demonstrated

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.040
that Neanderthals interbred
with Eurasian humans,

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.420
resulting in traces of Neanderthal DNA

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.603
that remain in the genomes
of many humans alive today.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.870
He was born in Stockholm,
earned his PhD in 1986

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.430
from the Department of Cell Biology

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.140
at the University of Uppsala.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.760
And from 1987 to 1990 he
was a postdoctoral fellow

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.130
in UC Berkeley's
Department of Biochemistry.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.740
And I'm sure there may
be still some people here

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.050
from that time.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.470
He became a full professor
of general biology

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.550
at the University of Munich in 1990

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.900
and remained there until 1998.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.640
But since 1997, he has
actually served as director

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.641
of the Max Planck Institute
for Evolutionary Anthropology

00:05:16.641 --> 00:05:17.863
in Leipzig.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.410
He's received many honors
and awards for his work,

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.400
including the Gruber
Genetics Prize in 2013,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.330
the Theodor Bucher Medal from
the Federation of European

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.820
Biomedical Societies in 2010.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.650
And the Kistler Prize in 2009.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.410
In 2007, Time magazine
named Professor Paabo

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.273
one of the hundred most
influential people in the world.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.300
Since their founding in
1928, the Foerster Lectures

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.340
have been delivered by such
distinguished individuals

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.930
as Oliver Sacks, Thomas
Kuhn, and Aldous Huxley.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.600
This evening, Svante
Paabo will join that list

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.310
with a lecture that is
certainly a kindred subject

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.120
to the immortality of the soul

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.230
in that it might be said to be

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.180
on the immortality of Neanderthal DNA.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.500
It is entitled a Neanderthal
Perspective on Human Origins.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.695
Please join me in welcoming
Svante Paabo to Berkeley.

00:06:07.695 --> 00:06:10.945
(attendees applauding)

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.200
- Well thank you very, very much

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.840
for that very kind introduction.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.990
And it's really a wonderful pleasure

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.200
to be back in Berkeley,

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.580
that still feels a little
bit like home to me.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.290
And it's of course also a great honor

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.670
to be allowed to deliver
the Foerster Lecture here.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.450
But I must say also that
I'm a little bit intimidated

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.190
by the subject matter,
when I got this letter,

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.140
about the immortality of the soul.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.840
And I think I sort of have to
announce right at the start

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.943
that I will not talk about
the soul at all, really.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.810
So what I will then discuss is our attempt

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.013
to study the genome,
the DNA of Neanderthals.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.380
And as you will know these are
the closest extinct relatives

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.140
of present day humans, they
are the closest relatives

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.460
that are extinct to all humans

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.780
that are around on the planet today.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.700
This is a Neanderthal skeleton on the left

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.010
compared to a modern human skeleton.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.970
There are this sort of
robust forms of humans

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.590
that appear in the fossil record

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.970
around three or 400,000
years ago in Europe

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.890
and Western Asia where they then lived

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:39.210
till they disappeared around
40,000 years ago or so.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.556
And what I will focus
on are the comparisons

00:07:42.556 --> 00:07:47.015
between the genomes of Neanderthals
and present day humans.

00:07:47.015 --> 00:07:50.610
Particularly with a view to
then seeing what is unique

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.730
to fully modern humans compared
to our closest relatives.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.930
But also then on what DNA

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.750
Neanderthals have contributed
to present day humans.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.840
So as was said in the
introduction, I will then perhaps,

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.230
if you like not talk about
the immortality of the soul

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.120
but a little bit about the
immortality of Neanderthals,

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.120
if you like, in the sense of
how they live on a little bit

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.533
in some people today.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.650
But before I then start, I
thought I should just remind you

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:24.640
about what you all know,
that our genome, the DNA,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.830
is stored in almost all cells in our body

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.760
in the form of DNA.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.300
Which is replicated every
time new germ cells are formed

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.323
and a new individual is formed.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:41.470
And this DNA is made out of
about three billion letters

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.010
in the genetic code that are
then replicated very faithfully

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.420
but sometimes errors are made.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.920
So when a new germ cell is formed,

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.780
sometimes, the wrong base is built in

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.650
in the daughter molecule.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.820
So every baby that's formed,
born, carries something like

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.040
50 or a hundred new mutations

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.733
that's neither there in
the mother nor the father.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.250
So when we, and these mutations then,

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.150
we can observe as sequence differences

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.520
between individuals in the population.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.070
So if you compare two genomes

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.940
between two people in this room,

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.960
we will have something like
three million differences

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.870
between two random genomes we choose.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:28.760
And if you then want to
reconstruct the history

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.510
of a piece of DNA or the genome

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.340
you can use these differences

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.110
that you will see between two humans.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.100
You can add in a chimpanzee.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.080
You will find more differences,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.080
about 10 times more
differences to a chimpanzee.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.730
And you can reconstruct the
history of that piece of DNA

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.740
with the help of these
differences you observe.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.230
And you can depict this in
the forms of these trees.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.620
Very simply here the two human sequences

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.790
go back to a common
ancestor quite recently.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.710
Quite much further back
is a common ancestor

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.063
shared with a chimp too.

00:10:02.085 --> 00:10:05.650
And if you now go and
study on a worldwide scale

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.820
human genetic variation.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.680
The surprising finding
that actually much came out

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.890
of Berkeley and Allan Wilson's lab here

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:17.980
is that most of the genetic
variation you find in the world

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.310
is found in Africa.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.380
Although there are cost a lot less people

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.470
living in Africa today
than living outside Africa.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:30.100
Those people outside Africa
have less genetic variation.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.460
And for most of the genome it is true

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.240
that the variants you find outside Africa

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.450
have close relatives inside Africa.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.920
But there is a component of
the genetic variation in Africa

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.940
that's found only there.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.210
And the interpretation of
that is that modern humans

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:52.520
evolved in Africa, accumulated
genetic variation there,

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.210
and a part of that variation so to say

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.650
went out and colonized
the rest of the world.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.350
And with some genetic
tricks you can also estimate

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:05.140
approximately when this exodus happened.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.070
And it's less than a
hundred thousand years ago,

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.763
probably more 50, 60,000 years ago.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:16.690
So this is the recent African
origin model of modern humans.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.963
Much designed, as I said,

00:11:18.963 --> 00:11:23.963
here, by Allan Wilson
and people in his lab.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.400
But there is if you like then
a problem with this model.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.887
And that is that when modern humans

00:11:30.887 --> 00:11:32.970
then come out of Africa,

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.400
they were not at all alone on the planet.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.260
There were other forms of humans
also living outside Africa

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.400
since almost two million years.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.670
Most famously, the Neanderthals in Europe

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.163
and other forms that are
less well described in Asia.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.010
So a big debate in paleontology
since many many years

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.420
was then what happened when
modern humans met Neanderthals?

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.423
Did one mix with each other or not?

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.690
And many years ago there were people

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.520
that even believed in total continuity,

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.810
that Neanderthals would
be the direct ancestors

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:08.990
of Europeans today.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.990
I think no one believed
that for a long time.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.260
There were many people,
particularly based on genetic data,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.738
that thought there was
a total replacement,

00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:21.220
0% contribution from Neanderthals.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.007
And you can imagine anything
in between here of course.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:30.560
So our first chance then
to test this came in '97,

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.660
as you heard in the introduction,

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.790
when we were able to determine
the first DNA sequences

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.870
from a Neanderthal specimen,

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.810
And not just any Neanderthal,

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.950
actually the Neanderthal
from Neanderthal, so to say.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:46.290
That was found in 1856 and gave its name

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.760
to this group of hominids.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.750
And I can also perhaps say
that we're very lucky I think

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.270
that our first Neanderthal we studied

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.560
was the type specimen that gave its name

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.350
to this group of hominids.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.200
Because almost invariably
what other Neanderthals

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.420
we ever have started since then,

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.170
there's always some paleontologists
that come to us and say,

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:08.613
oh it's a bit too robust,
it's a little too gracile,

00:13:08.613 --> 00:13:09.790
there's something wrong with it,

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.560
it's not quite a typical Neanderthal.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.660
But if this is not a Neanderthal
then they don't exist,

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.650
so to say.
(attendees laughing)

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.800
So at the time, we took a
sample from the humerus up here.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.430
At the time quite a big
sample, not this big,

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.470
this was both for carbon
dating and for the DNA.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:31.260
Nowadays we take much
smaller samples than this.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.520
You work under clean room conditions

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.300
to avoid contaminating your samples

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.228
that contain only traces of degraded

00:13:39.228 --> 00:13:41.920
and chemically modified DNA.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.060
Much less DNA often in
your sample then in say

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.320
a skin fragment that may
be like a dust particle

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.483
in the air in a normal room.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.580
And we focused on a
tiny part of the genome,

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.950
the mitochondrial genome that's
inherited only from mothers

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:03.520
to offspring, a particular
variable part of that.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.490
Reconstructed it cumbersomely at that time

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.750
with a technique of the time,

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.260
amplifying short pieces,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.480
seeing those differences
that are consistently there,

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.240
and then estimating such
a tree of relationships

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.620
for this part of the genome,

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.163
for the mitochondrial genome.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.897
And what we found was then
that the mitochondrial genomes

00:14:26.897 --> 00:14:29.886
all present in humans go
back to a common ancestor

00:14:29.886 --> 00:14:32.630
between a hundred and 200,000 years ago,

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:36.900
as had been found by Allan
Wilson here at Berkeley.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.580
But the mitochondrial
genome of this Neanderthal

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.290
went much much further
back to common ancestor

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.860
shared with present day humans,

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.263
about half a million years ago or so.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.544
And since then others,

00:14:49.544 --> 00:14:52.800
we have looked at many
more mitochondrial genomes

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.240
from Neanderthals, they all fall together

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.090
outside the variation of present humans.

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.810
So it's quite clear
there is no people today

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.070
that walk around with
Neanderthal mitochondria

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.330
in their bodies.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.303
So in this sense it is
total replacement here,

00:15:09.303 --> 00:15:10.873
0% contribution.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.230
But of course this is this
tiny part of the genome.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.810
The vast majority of our
DNA is in the nucleus.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.710
And it's inherited from the mothers

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.100
as well as from fathers to the offspring.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.270
And the chance to begin to look at that

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:31.270
came in the mid, around 2005 or so,

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.390
with new technology.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.470
High throughput DNA
sequencing technologies

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.410
that allows you to sequence
millions and even billions

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:43.013
of DNA molecules rapidly
and inexpensively.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.910
So you can then just extract
all the DNA from such a fossil,

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:51.420
sequence randomly all
the DNA molecules in it,

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.840
make yourself a little DNA database,

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.020
and compare it to say, the human genome,

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.423
to bacterial genomes,
chimpanzee genomes, and so on.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.190
The first place where this worked

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.370
was in southern Europe in Croatia.

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:07.780
Vindijua Cave, here.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:11.450
From this bone here, it's
very late Neanderthal,

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.513
around 40,000 years old.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.930
And the first thing that
you will notice then

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.050
in this DNA fragment is that
they are very, very short,

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.700
50, 60 bases long.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.430
Whereas from a blood sample from me,

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:29.300
you could easily get 10,000
base pair long fragments.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.690
You will also notice that
only a tiny proportion

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.130
of all the DNA in the bone
come from the Neanderthal.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:39.410
Our very best bones,
something like three or 4%.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:42.830
All the rest are from bacteria and fungi

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:45.810
that colonized the bone after
the death of this individual

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.423
40,000 years ago.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.550
So we were very lucky than to get funding

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:52.920
for a five year project

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.720
to try to reconstruct a complete
genome of a Neanderthal.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.350
So we worked very hard
on methods to improve

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.640
how we extract DNA from the bone

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.150
and make it into a form

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.690
that we can feed into
the sequencing machines.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.820
And they also got more efficient

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:14.600
in how many molecules they
could sequence over this time.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.339
We looked through many archeological sites

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:20.940
and many bones and focused on three bones

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.710
from that cave in Croatia

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:25.843
from three different
Neanderthal individuals.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.980
We sequenced a bit over
a billion DNA fragments

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.223
from those bones, most of
them from microorganisms.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.850
And then matched these
fragments to the human genome,

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.960
taking into account that some of these

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.650
had chemical modifications

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:46.020
that may give errors in the sequences.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.290
And at the time,

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:52.290
we then had about three
billion base pair sequenced.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.960
So we had random fragments
from all over the genome.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.580
Sometimes we had one fragment

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.510
covering a piece in the
human genome for comparison.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.630
Sometimes two, sometimes even three,

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:05.090
but we also missed big parts.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.963
So at that time, we then had
a little over half the genome.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.850
But it allowed us to get an overview

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.980
and begin to ask these
questions one was interested in.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.110
So the first question was this thing,

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:21.470
what happened when modern
humans came out of Africa

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.090
and met Neanderthals?

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:24.793
Did one mix or not?

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.680
And we put together a big
consortium of different groups,

00:18:31.131 --> 00:18:35.870
sort of theoretical groups
that helped us study this.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:38.950
Particularly Monty Slatkin and
his group here at Berkeley,

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:40.800
Rasmus Nielsen here at Berkeley,

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.980
David Reich and his group at Harvard.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.570
And addressed this question

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.260
in actually three
different, independent ways

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.100
because we knew this was a
very controversial question

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.733
so we wanted to get it right.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.810
I will just present one of
them, the most direct one here,

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.760
saying that an expectation if Neanderthals

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.340
mixed with ancestors to Europeans would be

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:07.230
that Europeans should share
more genetic variants today

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.690
with Neanderthals than Africans today

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.400
would share with Neanderthals.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.690
Because Neanderthals
had never been in Africa

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:15.520
so there's no reason to assume

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.113
they would have contributed
anything to Africans.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.870
So it's this idea here.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:24.387
If there was a contribution
from Neanderthals to Europeans,

00:19:24.387 --> 00:19:28.290
Europeans would on average
be closer to Neanderthals

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.183
than Africans here, let me go back here.

00:19:30.183 --> 00:19:32.140
There's no contribution,

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.210
the Neanderthal is equally
far from people in Africa

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.393
as people in Europe.

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.140
So we then sequenced not
only the Neanderthal genome

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.280
but five people from
different parts of the world

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:48.310
to be sure we had exactly the
same types and frequencies

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.600
of errors in the sequences.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.060
A European, two Africans,
a Chinese person,

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.340
and one from Papua New Guinea

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.290
and did a very simple analysis.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:03.090
So just to test this first
if you take two Africans.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.460
We just compare those two African genomes

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.380
and find all places where
they have differences.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.900
Then we take the Neanderthal
and see how often

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.190
does the Neanderthal match one
African or the other African.

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.870
Since Neanderthals had never
been here, there's no reason

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.530
to assume the Neanderthal
would have contributed more

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.350
to one African than the other.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:24.840
So this should be 50-50 matching.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.540
And indeed statistically
speaking that's 50-50,

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:29.390
it's no difference between these two.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.530
But it was then different

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.670
when we looked at a
European and an African.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:39.640
Now we found statistically
significantly more matching

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.100
to the European individual
than the African individual.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.470
Which surprised me at the time.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.710
I was really biased toward thinking

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.940
there had been no contribution.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.080
But I was even more surprised then

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.460
when we compared the Chinese individual

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.140
to an African individual.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.000
We again found more matching
to the Chinese person.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.060
Although most people would say

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:05.340
there had never been
Neanderthals in China.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.500
And even more surprising
then Papua New Guinea,

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.530
where for sure there had
never been Neanderthal,

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:15.070
we again see more matching to Papuans

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.340
than to Africans.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.660
So the hypothesis that came out of this

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.480
was to say that if modern
humans come out of Africa

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.110
they presumably passed by the Middle East.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:29.610
And we know there has been,
so this was the question,

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:30.720
how could this be?

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.400
And the model was we knew
there had been Neanderthals

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.980
in the Middle East.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.020
So if this early modern
humans that came out

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.500
mixed with Neanderthals and
then became the ancestors

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.630
of everybody outside Africa.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.810
These modern humans could
have carried with them

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.580
this Neanderthal contribution so to say

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.730
out to the rest of the world.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.530
Even to areas where they
hadn't been Neanderthals.

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:55.890
To the extent that somewhere

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.360
between one and 2% of the genomes

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.723
of everyone outside Africa
today come from Neanderthals.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.063
So what you can see that there is

00:22:06.063 --> 00:22:11.030
this sort of part of the
variation in Europe, for example,

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.320
that matched Neanderthals.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:16.010
This isn't so easy to see,
this is a schematic picture

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:20.220
of variation among a couple
of hundred Europeans.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:23.330
Any sequence difference
is indicated in the genome

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:24.780
by yellow here.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.480
On the bottom is the Neanderthal genome.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.910
And you will see there
are a few European here,

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:33.400
for this region that's almost
identical to Neanderthal

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.870
and quite different from everyone else.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:39.360
So these types of fragments,

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.623
they sort of make up
the evidence for this.

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.300
But this was not the only
possible model to explain this.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.430
There was also the possibility
that that could go back

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:53.690
much further to substructure
populations in Africa.

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:56.230
If we imagine that Neanderthals,

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.480
maybe half a million years ago or so,

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.180
have an origin in Africa, leave Africa,

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.010
and become Neanderthals in Europe here.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:07.420
And that this substructure
survives in Africa,

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.130
and that then modern humans evolved

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:13.270
in the same corner of Africa
where the Neanderthals did,

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:18.270
leave Africa and meet the Neanderthals.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:22.090
And these modern humans also
spread around rest of Africa

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.810
and absorb this variation we
could arrive at a situation

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:30.810
where Neanderthals are
closer to Europeans today

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.410
then Africans are.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:35.640
This is a more complicated explanation

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.490
but it's a possible explanation.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.360
But the difference here is then

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.120
the similarities between the
Neanderthals and non-Africans

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.780
would be quite old, several
hundred thousand years old.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.570
Here it would be quite recent,

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.700
Less than a hundred thousand.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.520
So a very big question early on became

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.283
when did this admixture happen?

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.227
And David Reich and Nick Patterson

00:24:00.227 --> 00:24:01.190
and their Pulsetrons,

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:06.190
Sriram Sankararaman came up
with a way to address this.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.790
And that is to say that if Neanderthals

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.370
and modern humans mixed,

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.427
the first generation,
the hybrids so to say,

00:24:14.427 --> 00:24:16.760
would of course have one chromosome

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.420
that come from Neanderthals
and one from modern humans.

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:23.580
If these individuals then
continue to have babies

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.530
with the modern humans,
there will be recombination

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:30.450
in each generation so that
information is crossed over

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.810
between these two chromosomes.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:35.250
So there will then be mosaic chromosomes

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:38.230
with part Neanderthal, part
modern human parts here.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.010
And as the generations go on,

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.430
there is more and more
crossing over happen,

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:46.610
so these pieces get smaller
and smaller with time.

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:49.070
So you can actually look
at the size distribution

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.830
of Neanderthal fragments and estimate

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:54.570
how many generations
back were they introduced

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.440
into the modern human gene pool.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.720
So look at the sizes of these things.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.240
So you have to make a
number of assumptions here

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.040
about generation time,
recombination landscapes and so on.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.210
And making those assumptions
they came up with a date

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:13.230
somewhere between 40 and 90,000 years ago,

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.080
so quite recently.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.640
Only compatible with this recent
admixture to modern humans

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.113
when they come out of Africa.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.410
But I'm a sort of a
really practical person.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:26.567
These are of course,
theoretical considerations

00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:29.390
that rely on a number of assumptions.

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:32.050
And maybe some of those
assumptions are wrong.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.230
So I really like to go back in time

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:37.670
and try to find actual evidence
for when this happened.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.190
And that is beginning to be possible now.

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:45.590
Because there was a bone
found just two years ago

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:48.280
in a river in Western Siberia here,

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.590
at the place called Ust'-Ishim
at the Irtysh River.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:56.360
And there was a bone washed
up on the shore there.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.830
A femur like this.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:03.500
That looks very much like
a modern human femur.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.890
And we were very lucky to
get this femur to our lab

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:11.410
in Leipzig and we were shocked
when we radiocarbon dated it.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:15.020
Because it turned out
to be 45,000 years old.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.910
So it's actually older than
any other directly dated

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.380
modern humans outside the
Middle East and Africa.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:27.160
So this is a very early modern
human, 45,000 years old.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:31.730
So it falls actually in this
range, 40 to 90,000 years ago

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.800
when this mixture with
Neanderthals could have happened.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.520
And certainly this
individual lived at a time

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.940
when there was also Neanderthals around.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:44.460
So now we can, and this is
a sort of unpublished part

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.760
of what I'm telling you,
look for the first time

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.880
in an early modern human that
lived at this time and say,

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:56.260
have this individual met and
bred with Neanderthals or not?

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.200
So if you first look here
on just one chromosome,

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.350
a number of European
and Asian people today,

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:05.060
Neanderthal fragments
are indicated by red,

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.900
when they're homozygous
they are green here.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.830
You can actually see a difference here

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:12.900
between Europeans and Asians.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.100
If you squint a bit, you can almost see

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.400
that Asians have slightly
more Neanderthal fragments

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.090
and that's actually true.

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:23.650
There's evidence from
Monty Slatkin's lab here

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:26.360
that Asians and others also have shown

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:30.220
that Asians seem to have an
additional Neanderthal component

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.160
that you don't see in Europe.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.110
But the big question for us now

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.920
is this Ust'-Ishim individual
here, 45,000 years,

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.280
does that have any Neanderthal
contribution or not?

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.770
And the answer to that is yes, it does.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:47.180
And actually a lot, if you like.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.908
Overall, not more than this individual,

00:27:49.908 --> 00:27:53.210
but it's distributed
in much bigger chunks.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:56.130
As you would expect right,
when you go back in time,

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:57.020
there should not have been

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.893
so much recombination having happened.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.020
It's this thing again, so we
can go back to this scheme

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.987
and look at the length, if you like, here.

00:28:07.987 --> 00:28:10.620
The genetic lengths on the chromosomes

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.130
of Neanderthal fragments.

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:16.370
And how well the Neanderthal
variants correlate

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:19.230
over lengths in the chromosomes.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:22.190
If you look at these, these
are present day humans here

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:23.583
that arrived at 40 to 90,000.

00:28:24.744 --> 00:28:29.744
This is a 45,000 year old human
that allows us to estimate

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:34.670
that somewhere in the order
of 300 or 400 generations

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:36.523
before this individual lived,

00:28:37.594 --> 00:28:39.670
Neanderthals contributed here.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:42.010
So that would then allow
us to estimate this

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:44.920
to somewhere 50 to 60,000 years ago.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.233
So we're narrowing in
on when this happened.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.940
But very clearly, it's this
model that is right then,

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:56.175
there's genes from
Neanderthals to modern humans

00:28:56.175 --> 00:28:59.153
after one comes out of Africa.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:02.120
So there are a number of questions

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.120
you'll often get about this.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.360
Some people ask, is this a lot

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.100
of Neanderthal ancestry I have or a little

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.543
when we say one or 2% of our genome?

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:16.010
And one way to think about
that in very simple terms

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.710
is perhaps to think about
your own family tree.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:22.410
If this is you, you of
course share 50% of your DNA

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:24.420
with your mom and your dad,

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:28.190
25 with your great-great-great
grandparents,

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.410
12% approximate with
your great-grandparents,

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.054
with your great-great-grandparents 6%,

00:29:34.054 --> 00:29:37.620
3%, and if we now go back six generations,

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.620
you then on average 1.5% or so.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.520
So in some sense, in
the quantitative sense,

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.710
it is as if one of your
ancestors back here

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:49.020
was a Neanderthal.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.950
It's of course much further back

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.440
and it's distributed
differently in the genome,

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.430
but it might give you a feeling for

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.743
of how big a contribution is this.

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:01.820
So something else that
people often ask us is,

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:06.320
well were the Neanderthal the
same species as us or not?

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.500
So should we call them
separate species name,

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.760
Homo neanderthalensis or a subspecies?

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.630
And I always sort of dodge
that question and say

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:17.990
you can even cite Darwin about this,

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:21.380
and saying to discuss if two
things are rightly called

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.470
species or varieties before
they have a definition

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:28.610
of these terms is to vainly beat the air.

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:31.250
And we still don't have a
good definition of this.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.623
So I sort of don't answer that question.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:41.600
So another question then is sort of

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:47.000
how much of the Neanderthal
genome remains today?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.080
Because if your roots are outside Africa,

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.520
you have one or 2% of
your genome from them

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.880
but we carry different pieces, right.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:57.050
So if we walk across many people,

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:00.570
how much of the Neanderthal
genome can we reconstruct

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:02.210
from people today?

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:05.500
And there were two papers
that came out in January,

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.320
one from Josh Akey's lab in Seattle,

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.750
and one from David Reich's lab

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:12.590
that we were involved in.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.230
Sort of doing that in
the 1000 Genomes data.

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:18.490
So you can go across many
people on a chromosome here

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:20.680
and see which fragments
came from Neanderthals

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.960
and puzzle together pieces
of the Neanderthal genome

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.100
from people living today.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.090
And it's very, very clear
that you can get together

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:31.470
at least 20% of the genome.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:33.720
And probably twice that, I would think,

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.840
because we have big problems

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.220
recognizing short little pieces,

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.660
we probably miss several pieces.

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.910
So perhaps approaching half their genome

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:45.403
or something like that
is still going around

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:47.300
on the planet today.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.423
That's the immortality part of the talk.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:56.040
So, I also can never refrain from saying

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.330
that there are a lot of
people in the general public

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:02.440
that are fascinated by
this and write to us.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.000
Many people write to us and
self-identify as Neanderthals

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.468
and volunteer to give samples to us.

00:32:09.468 --> 00:32:12.330
And I started very early on

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.060
to notice a pattern in
this correspondence.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.750
And that it's mainly men who write to us

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:20.330
and say that they are Neanderthals.

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:23.767
And very few women who
claim they are Neanderthals.

00:32:23.767 --> 00:32:25.130
(attendees laughing)

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:29.737
So I sort of presented this
as my research to my group,

00:32:29.737 --> 00:32:32.700
you know, I counted emails.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.840
But people are getting critical

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.930
particularly when I
have ideas in the group,

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:38.950
so they said this is just ascertainment,

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:41.480
men are more interested
in molecular genetics

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.610
and they write to you, and
women are less interested.

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.150
But that's actually not true.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:49.480
If I go back and see, there
are actually quite a few women

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.315
who write to us and say they
are married to Neanderthals.

00:32:52.315 --> 00:32:55.015
(attendees laughing)

00:32:55.015 --> 00:32:58.090
And so far there is not a single man

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:00.840
whose has claimed he is
married to a Neanderthal woman.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:06.680
So that's of course quite
fascinating for a geneticist,

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.443
the type of inheritance that
go on here we try to do.

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:13.240
But something else that
we're also interested

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.100
in addition to counting emails is then

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:19.520
other extinct forms of humans.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.250
And particularly we are lucky
to work with people in Russia,

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:26.180
particularly at this
site in Southern Siberia,

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.590
Denisova Cave.

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:30.320
This beautiful place, close to the border

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.450
to Mongolia and China

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:36.760
where Anatoli Derevianko and
Michael Shunkov excavates

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.510
in several years.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:42.410
And they found this
tiny little bone in 2008

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:45.290
in this gallery in the cave here.

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:48.020
I think they were actually
very skilled realizing that

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.483
that might be a human bone.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:55.090
So we got this fragment
of this pinky of a child,

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:58.740
the last phalanx of the pinky of a child,

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.340
and analyzed its DNA.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.840
And it was quite unique
in actually having 70%

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:08.540
endogenous DNA, so very
little bacterial growth

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:09.570
in this bone.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:13.240
And we applied some new
technology we've developed

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:17.690
that actually starts out by
separating the two strands

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:20.240
of the DNA molecule and sequencing,

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.830
putting them into these libraries

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.320
for sequencing individually.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.180
So each double-stranded
molecule have two chances

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:30.060
to end up in the library,
one for each strand.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.180
And with this method, we
were then able to sequence

00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:36.800
a very good genome from this individual.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.390
So for the part of the genome
about 2/3 of the genome

00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:42.630
to which you can map these short fragments

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:45.093
we've sequenced it many many times over,

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.390
about 30 times over, so
we've seen every position

00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:50.663
several times.

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:54.380
And we were extremely
surprised them to find

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:57.860
that this was not closely
related to Neanderthals

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:00.563
and even further from present day humans.

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:05.570
It shared a common ancestor
here far back with Neanderthals,

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:09.060
but Neanderthals then have
a long independent history.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:13.320
It was clearly some other form of human,

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.790
related to Neanderthals.

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:19.170
And we, after much sort
of discussion about this,

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:23.070
we ended up calling them
Denisovans after this cave site

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.370
where they were first seen.

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:27.030
Just as Neanderthals
are called Neanderthals

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.030
after Neanderthal where they were found.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:33.040
And there are a number of
interesting things you can now do

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:35.950
when you start having
really high-quality genomes

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:39.170
from humans that lived long time ago.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:43.300
As high quality as you would
sequence from a patient today.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.370
You can, for example, start
seeing, as you would expect,

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:48.900
that this individual died

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.470
several tens of thousands of years back.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:54.210
So compared to people today
there are certain mutations

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:55.750
that have not happened here.

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:58.200
So it lacks mutations.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.120
So if you go back to the
common ancestor with the chimp,

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.677
a bit over 1% less substitutions
than you would expect.

00:36:05.677 --> 00:36:10.370
So you see sort of evolution
in action, if you like, here.

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:12.240
So if you now just make the assumption

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.130
this is 6.5 million years ago,

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:16.710
we can even date the bone here

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:18.747
to somewhere 60 to 80,000 years.

00:36:18.747 --> 00:36:21.030
This is with big caveats.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:23.900
I don't have much faith
in this number at all.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:26.613
We'll also see variation here

00:36:26.613 --> 00:36:29.820
showing we have problems
with sequence accuracy

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.050
in the modern humans for example.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:34.160
But it anyway gives an indication

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.280
of what will be possible in the future.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:40.050
So this bone is far too small
to be able to do a carbon date

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:41.820
but when we can do a good genome from it

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.740
we can actually, in the future,

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:48.520
even date it with genetic means.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.560
You can ask, for these Denisovans,

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.670
have they contributed to people today?

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.013
And indeed, they have.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.470
Surprisingly, although the
bones are found here in Siberia,

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:02.860
we find very little
contribution in mainland Asia.

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.630
There's now new evidence,
just a little bit,

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:08.420
but the major contribution
is out in the Pacific,

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.180
Papua New Guinea, Aboriginal Australians,

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:15.493
have up to 5% even Denisovan DNA.

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:20.260
So if we just summarize
then what we believe

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.370
from studying genomes about
the origin of Neanderthals

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:25.330
and Denisovans first,

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:28.080
we believe there's an origin in Africa.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:32.370
They come out of Africa
and in Western Eurasia

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:35.520
evolved into what we called Neanderthals.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:40.160
And in Eastern Eurasia to
what we call the Denisovans.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.640
This is not that all to say

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.030
they were this widely
distributed at any one time.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:48.299
Also note that there are not
other forms of hominins here.

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:50.500
He have the hobbits in
Indonesia for example

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.683
that we know about.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:55.460
We don't know where the
borders between these have been

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.160
but we do know that in
this part in Siberia,

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.830
there had been Neanderthals
as well as Denisovans

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:02.123
at some time in history.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:06.460
Then modern humans evolved in Africa.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.780
Start spreading out of Africa seriously

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.940
50, 60,000 years ago.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.480
Mix with Neanderthals in the Middle East.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:20.480
Continue to spread out and mix
again at least once it seems,

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.460
perhaps somewhere in Central Asia,

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:27.760
so with the ancestors
of present day Asians.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.980
And mix in Southeast Asia
somewhere with Denisovans

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.410
and continue out in the Pacific.

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:37.720
And these old forms then became extinct

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.840
but live on if you like, a little bit,

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:44.230
in that one or 2% in
all non-Africans today

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:47.763
and an additional 5% or so in the Pacific.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:52.410
Now we have studied two genomes

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.313
of two extinct forms of humans.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.570
I wouldn't be at all surprised if one find

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:01.450
additional admixture events,
for example, in China.

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:05.070
And I would also not be
surprised if it was the case

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:07.647
that in Africa when
modern humans spread there

00:39:07.647 --> 00:39:09.630
there was also admixture.

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.300
There is some indication of that

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.160
in present day variation in Africa.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.540
But it's much harder to really demonstrate

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:19.990
when you don't have these old genomes.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.800
But so in this sense
then we clearly disproven

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.210
total replacement.

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:29.210
We have something like
7.5% maximally so far.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:33.110
But the big picture is still
one of replacement, right.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.220
So to not lose track of that,

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.240
to sort of like suggest a sort of model

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:41.660
called leaky replacement
or so for modern humans,

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:45.493
spread with some gene flow
there from these other forms.

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:50.040
So I think it's sort of interesting,

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.830
this is a copy of this little bone

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:55.260
that from such a tiny little bone,

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:58.050
one can actually get a lot of information

00:39:58.050 --> 00:39:59.780
about the population history,

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:04.090
of the population from
this individual came.

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:05.220
But very frustratingly,

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.160
we don't know how this individual look,

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.190
we don't have no other
part of the skeleton

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:12.000
except three teeth, thankfully.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.070
We don't know what stone tools they made,

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:18.150
we don't know anything
about them except the genome

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:19.930
and much of the population history.

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:22.470
And I think this is an indication about

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:25.200
how it will be in archeology
a lot in the future.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.450
That when you can retrieve DNA,

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:30.670
also from small and
diagnostic pieces like this,

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:33.193
you will be able to get
a lot of information.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.320
So this cave, Denisova Cave,

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.470
had also yielded more
interesting fragments,

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:45.470
this is a toe bone that was
found in 2010, deeper down.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:49.060
This turned out to be a Neanderthal bone.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.760
So we now also have a
good Neanderthal genome

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.170
that we published in January this year.

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:58.690
We have very high quality
Neanderthal genome.

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:01.490
So you can look at different
aspects of this also.

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:04.420
You can look for example
on heterozygosity,.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.350
So how much variation there is

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:08.430
between the two versions of the genome

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:09.830
that this individual inherited

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:12.010
from the father and the mother.

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:15.560
You will see present day
Africans here have more variation

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.200
than non-Africans

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:22.190
and here is a Neanderthal and
a Denisovan having even less.

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:24.320
And not only that,

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.900
when one looks at the chromosomes

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.980
of this Neanderthal individual,
you find something amazing.

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:34.120
You find long, long segments,
19 million base pairs

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.500
on this chromosome,

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.603
where the two chromosomes
are identical to each other.

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:41.650
And that, of course, indicates

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:44.833
that the parents of this
individual were closely related.

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.180
And Monty Slatkin and his
group here at Berkeley

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:56.208
had modeled what the
relationships must have been

00:41:56.208 --> 00:42:00.100
between the parents of this individual.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:03.560
And it has to been one of
these four scenarios here.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.406
The parents were half
siblings or grandfather,

00:42:06.406 --> 00:42:10.140
granddaughter or some of these
things, double first cousins,

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.420
I can't even reconstruct what it is.

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.610
But they were clearly closely related.

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:18.270
So I think it will be very
interesting in the future

00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:21.530
when we get good genomes also
from other Neanderthal sites

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:24.570
to see if this is a
general pattern at the time

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:28.140
or this was something just
happening in this cave

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:29.273
at this one time.

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:34.890
So what we then have are these
good genomes from Siberia,

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:37.000
we have a bit of a genome from Caucasus

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.800
and this one from Croatia.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.520
So we can now start to look at gene flow

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.710
not only from these
groups into modern humans

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:46.233
but also between them.

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:49.900
So what we find then is
what we already know,

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.870
this gene flow of non-Africans
from Neanderthals,

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:55.630
from Denisovans into
people in the Pacific.

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:57.830
We find a little bit of gene flow

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:01.047
from Denisovans into Mainland Asians.

00:43:01.047 --> 00:43:03.300
The people in China, for example,

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.620
also have a little bit of Denisovan DNA.

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:11.620
We find gene flow, a few
percent from Neanderthals

00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:13.750
into Denisovans.

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:16.520
And quite interesting, an old component

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:20.020
in the Denisovan genome not
seen in the Neanderthals.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.560
There is some gene flow, someone else here

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:25.420
of a few percent into Denisovans.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:28.300
Something that split a
million years or more

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:29.890
from the human lineage.

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:33.720
It's very tempting to say that
this unknown contributor here

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.933
is Homo erectus or so
in Asia contributing.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:42.300
So the conclusion is human
groups are always mixed

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.753
at least a little bit today.

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:49.643
And in the end, then I wanted
to bring up four things,

00:43:49.643 --> 00:43:53.233
sort of consequences of this gene flow.

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.890
So a question is then,

00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:59.810
we have this Neanderthal
component in the genome

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:01.010
outside Africa today.

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:03.940
Does that have any
functional consequences?

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.540
And there are some hints,
beginning to be some hints

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:10.420
in the last few years
that that may be the case.

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:14.405
So there was paper in January

00:44:14.405 --> 00:44:19.405
which looked across the genome
in Europeans and in Asians

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:24.000
finding that there were
some parts of the genome

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.990
that actually where
there are contributions

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:28.260
from Neanderthals that have
reached high frequency,

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:32.593
60, 70% people in Asia
and this thing here,

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:36.640
60, 70% of Europeans and
that sometimes is shared

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:39.020
between Asians and Europeans,
sometimes it's unique

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:39.933
to one group.

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:42.610
So, of course, one interesting thing

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:45.150
is to look in these
segments and see what genes

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.660
are particularly located there.

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.400
If you look for groups of genes,

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.160
the only thing that stand out

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:55.980
or actually structured growth
is keratins in skin and hair.

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:59.640
So it may well be that
something in the structure

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:04.640
of the skin or the hair
in Europeans and Asians

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.750
actually is a contribution
from Neanderthals.

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:10.203
Well, we'll then find out
in the future what that is.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.900
Something else that Peter
Parham's group found

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:18.480
early on 2011 already is that
transplantation antigen genes,

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.460
some variants of genes

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.387
and involved in regulating
the immune system

00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:26.510
came from Neanderthals
and also from Denisovans

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:29.060
and have sometimes reached high frequency

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:30.900
in certain regions of Europe.

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:35.870
These are the proteins
that present peptides

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:38.250
from bacteria and viruses
to the immune system.

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:40.420
So they are important in regulating

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:45.060
how well we respond to infections.

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:46.980
So it's quite tempting then to say

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.450
that this is something
to do with these Africans

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:52.430
coming out, meeting people that had lived

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:53.850
for hundreds of thousands of years

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:56.480
in the environment in Asia and Europe

00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:00.060
picking up immune
regulatory genes from them

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.393
and when they are advantageous,
they rise to high frequency.

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.460
So a group in in Shanghai who have shown

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:11.140
that if you look at genes
involved in lipid catabolism,

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:15.200
so how do you degrade lipids,
they have a big tendency

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.650
to come in Europe from the Neanderthals

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:21.320
that you don't see in Asia
and, of course, not in Africa.

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:25.050
We don't know at all what
this means metabolically

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:27.180
but something may be going on.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:30.880
There was another study
in January this year

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:34.740
that identified a risk
variant for type 2 diabetes.

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:38.100
So the type of diabetes
you get at old age.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.600
And this risk gene encodes
a lipid transporter

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.870
that sits in the membrane

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:45.100
that have four amino acid differences

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.170
to the protective allele.

00:46:47.170 --> 00:46:51.750
And quite strikingly, this
risk allele is high frequency

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:54.410
in Asia and also in Native Americans,

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:57.810
very little in Europe and not in Africa.

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:01.220
And if you look at the
risk alleles here in red

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.850
and the protective alleles in blue,

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:06.940
you find the Neanderthal
variant in the middle here.

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:10.560
So this is clearly a
variant that have come over

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.120
to modern humans from Neanderthals

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:16.400
have risen to 25, 30% frequency

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.480
in Asia and Native Americans.

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:22.870
Today, it's associated with
risk for type 2 diabetes

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:24.380
but probably in a situation

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.110
where you have periodic
starvation, for example,

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:30.080
such variance may be
actually advantageous.

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.030
So this may be that this is some kind

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:35.163
of Neanderthal adaptation to starvation.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.230
You can, of course, also ask,

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:40.873
have there contribution
from Denisovans too?

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:46.710
And quite fascinatingly, it
has come out quite recently

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:50.390
that it was already known that people

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:54.300
on the high plateau in
Tibet are adapted to living

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:57.080
at low oxygen tensions.

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.940
And that one of the major
genes involved in that

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.223
is this transcription factor EPAS1.

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:07.040
And Rasmus Nielsen's
group here in Berkeley

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:10.830
have now shown that this variant of EPAS1

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:15.790
that exists in 70, 80% of
Tibetans come from Denisovans.

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:18.950
It's identical to Denisovans here.

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:23.210
So this variant then
carry over from Denisovans

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:25.470
into Tibetans.

00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:27.720
So it's quite fascinating that even life

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.180
on the high plateau Tibet

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:33.150
might actually not have been
possible or so easily possible

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:36.910
without the synaptic
contribution from Denisovans.

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:40.740
So this sort of fits
into sort of a pattern

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:43.830
of adaptive introgression if you like

00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:46.239
where these earlier forms of humans

00:48:46.239 --> 00:48:49.830
who lived for a long time
in these other environments

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:53.106
and these newcomers from Africa
may have picked up variants

00:48:53.106 --> 00:48:55.600
that were then positively selected

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.733
and that rose to high frequency.

00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:04.530
So you can, of course,
also ask what is not coming

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:05.650
from the Neanderthals.

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:09.110
So you can look across the
genomes and look for things

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:12.430
where you statistically
see a lack of contribution

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:13.263
from Neanderthals,

00:49:13.263 --> 00:49:16.090
or you would expect to see it there.

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:19.040
And David Reich's group had identified

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:23.100
a number of these regions and
when we looked where genes

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:27.020
in these regions are expressed
in the body and what tissues,

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:30.060
the only thing that
stands out are testicles.

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:32.653
So the male organ.

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:38.500
So it's very tempting then to
speculate that the hybrids,

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:42.110
Neanderthal-modern human hybrids
may have had some problem

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:44.780
for male fertility
because that's, of course,

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:49.780
a common pattern when closely
related populations or species

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.480
have hybrids, it's often the males

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.610
have problems with fertility if you think

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:58.260
about horses and donkeys, for example,

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:01.030
the male mules are infertile,

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:04.910
the females can have offspring.

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:09.830
And finally, the thing
that interests me very much

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:13.410
is what can we say about
uniqueness in modern humans now

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:17.590
when we compare ourselves
our closest extinct relative?

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:20.500
So what has changed here in modern humans

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.530
in the short time since we
separated from Neanderthals

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:26.370
maybe three to 400,000 years ago?

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:29.280
And that may be an
interesting set of things

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.810
because I think we all
agree that our technology,

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:36.640
for example, we, modern humans
have changed very rapidly.

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:40.447
Neanderthals lived for
three 400,000 years,

00:50:40.447 --> 00:50:42.467
the technology were not that different

00:50:42.467 --> 00:50:45.370
in the beginning of that
time and in the end,

00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:49.080
modern humans have existed
for perhaps 100,000 years

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.890
and I think our technology
today, we agree,

00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:54.333
is quite different from
what it was back then.

00:50:56.490 --> 00:51:00.050
Art that really depict things
that we recognize as art

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:05.040
counts with modern humans
spreading across the world,

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.210
becoming extremely numerous,
spreading across water

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:12.600
over long distances, countless
modern humans and so on.

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:16.750
So it's very interesting
now to make this catalog

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:18.990
of all the changes in the human genome

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:20.410
that have come since that time.

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:24.270
So now focusing on these
things that exist in all humans

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:26.600
no matter where we live on the planet

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:29.440
but where the Neanderthals
look like the apes.

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:32.820
And that's not a very long list of things.

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:37.430
These things that had
happened here became 100%.

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:40.270
It's in total, just a little over 30,000

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:41.710
single nucleotide change.

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:45.210
Some insertions and deletions and so on.

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:48.040
So it's very sort of fascinating

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.410
that you can look through
this list in an afternoon

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:52.310
in a computer actually.

00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:54.050
You can, of course, for most part of it,

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:55.210
not make sense of it.

00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:58.700
We don't know what
these things, of course.

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:00.740
But among them, I believe,

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:02.893
there will be some
important things hiding.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.780
So for example, if you look at
the amino acid changes there,

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:10.010
only 96 amino acid
changes in this category

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:12.710
that affect 87 proteins

00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:15.760
and this is a list of these proteins here.

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.960
So we are of course biased to think

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.260
that something with cognition
is particularly interesting

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:22.883
so the developing brain was something

00:52:22.883 --> 00:52:25.070
we were very interested in looking at

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:27.800
together with the people at
the Allen Brain Institute

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:32.800
and originally, I was very
excited to say that 88%

00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:35.600
of these proteins were expressed

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.350
in the developing cerebral cortex.

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:40.170
But we then did some controls,

00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:44.150
for example, finding genes
with no amino acid change

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:47.930
but a silent change as obtained
in exactly the same way.

00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:51.630
And 100% of them are expressed
in the cerebral cortex.

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:53.850
This just goes to say
that almost everything

00:52:53.850 --> 00:52:57.390
is expressed in the developing brain.

00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:59.560
But with appropriate controls,

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.190
only one that sort of seems to stand out

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:06.120
or things that are expressed
in a ventricular soul

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.960
of the developing cortex

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.850
and that have some kind of gradients

00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:12.150
from the temporal gradients.

00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:16.410
So in the layer of the
developing cerebral cortex

00:53:16.410 --> 00:53:20.660
where cells divide, stem
cells divide and form neurons,

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:25.020
we see significantly more
of these genes expressed.

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:27.850
And this relies on very few genes now.

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:30.920
It's actually only six
genes that are responsible

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:35.430
for the signal, all in all
it was only 87 genes, right?

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:38.500
And strikingly, three of these genes,

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:42.530
two of them are in the kinetic
core and one in the spindle.

00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:45.370
So this is sort of where
the spindle attaches

00:53:45.370 --> 00:53:47.890
to the chromosomes and
pull the chromosomes apart

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:50.620
of cell division which
surprised me very much.

00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:53.190
I thought cell division
would be so conserved,

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:57.070
that not have changed the modern humans.

00:53:57.070 --> 00:54:00.330
But of course, there are evidence

00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:02.470
that in the developing cortex here,

00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:05.560
how the stem cells divide
the plane of division,

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:08.440
for example, determines
a number of neurons

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:10.570
and types of neurons that are formed.

00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:13.760
So it may be this is all
speculation, of course,

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.830
but that these three
genes with their changes

00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:19.160
is something we should
look particular careful at

00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.053
in the future.

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:26.480
So we can also now begin
to look taking variation

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:29.700
in Neanderthals into account.

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:33.330
So we have then genomes
from three Neanderthals here

00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:35.810
and the Denisovans and
we can begin to look

00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:38.340
for groups of genes that have changed,

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:41.483
particularly one group of
hominids and the other.

00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:44.760
And if we look in
Neanderthals and the others,

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.900
only one such category of
genes that seem to stand out

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:50.280
and these are genes
involved in hyperlordosis,

00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:53.880
so how much your spine is curved.

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.767
And here are more things back here

00:54:55.767 --> 00:54:59.950
and sort of morphology and in metabolism.

00:54:59.950 --> 00:55:01.360
But this is quite interesting

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:03.370
because this is something we can look at

00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:05.000
in the fossil record.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.500
So the curvature of the spine and indeed,

00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:11.550
Neanderthals differ from modern humans

00:55:11.550 --> 00:55:16.350
in having less of a
curvature in the spine.

00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:19.300
So since this sort of makes some sense,

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.760
we were quite interesting to
see what categories come here

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:27.120
in modern humans and they come
only two categories there.

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.900
One is sort of behavior
and one is pigmentation.

00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:33.400
And again, it relies on very few genes.

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.780
Just five genes.

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:37.780
Two of them had to do with pigmentation

00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:40.040
but they are not actually totally fixed

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:43.040
when we now have gone
on and looked in Africa

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.200
much more carefully.

00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:48.260
A few percent of people in
Africa have ancestral variant

00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:49.710
so this is not so interesting.

00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:52.541
It probably have to do with
differences in pigmentation

00:55:52.541 --> 00:55:55.730
but these genes involved in behavior

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:58.410
seemed to be really fixed in humans.

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:00.630
You can of course look
at what they are involved

00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:03.996
in the processes, what
diseases they are involved

00:56:03.996 --> 00:56:08.630
and you then arrive at
the last question here.

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:11.470
How will we, in the
future, study these things

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:14.563
that may have to do with
human specific traits?

00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:17.740
And I've sort of gone around for 10 years,

00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:20.610
now making jokes and talk
saying what we want to do

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:22.597
is of course to put Neanderthal alleles

00:56:22.597 --> 00:56:26.460
into transgenic humans and human alleles

00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:29.780
into transgenic chimps
and study their phenotypes

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:32.160
and that we have problems
with ethics committees

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:35.463
and things like so we'll
never be able to do that.

00:56:36.323 --> 00:56:37.730
But this is sort of been a joke

00:56:37.730 --> 00:56:42.690
but it's almost less of joke
now because there are people

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:44.766
who have sort of stood
yes, that we should now use

00:56:44.766 --> 00:56:48.120
stem cell technology and
high throughput mutagenesis

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.340
to actually clone Neanderthals.

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:53.600
George Church, for example, at Harvard.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:57.030
So I think we have exactly
the same issues there

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:58.670
for many, many reasons.

00:56:58.670 --> 00:57:01.650
Technical and ethical,
we will never do that

00:57:01.650 --> 00:57:03.220
but this is not just a joke.

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:05.980
This is of course what one
would have done in drosophila

00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:08.090
or in some other model animals.

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:11.190
So what can we hope to do in the future?

00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:13.080
I think one thing we will be able to do

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:15.680
is find back mutations in humans.

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:17.800
As we said in the very beginning,

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:22.200
every baby that's born has
50 or 100 new mutations.

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:25.140
There are seven billion
people on the planet.

00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:28.200
The genome is just
three billion base pairs

00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:31.310
so every mutation
compatible with human life

00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:32.880
exists out there.

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.550
We just have to find
them and start in them.

00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:38.270
And that I think will be
possible in the future

00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:40.150
when we all have our genome sequence

00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:41.910
when we go to the doctor.

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:44.520
But that's a little bit away.

00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:47.670
I think we can introduce
these things into stem cells

00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:49.753
and study cells in vitro

00:57:49.753 --> 00:57:53.880
and I think we can also
introduce them into mice

00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.380
and sometimes make sense of it

00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:57.710
and I see that have grown over time

00:57:57.710 --> 00:58:02.590
so I will sort of not really
show you then one such thing

00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:05.560
which has changed is
that happened back here

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:10.290
and seems to have to do with
language and articulation.

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:12.870
Those mutations we have,
sort of, as a model

00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:14.870
put into transgenic mouse.

00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:18.670
So the mouse now makes a
human version of this protein

00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:21.160
that seems to have
something to do in humans

00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:23.400
with language and speech.

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.690
And you can then study that mouse,

00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:29.180
the brain of it,
electrophysiologically, for example,

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:33.520
and find that you have
certain electrical features

00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:36.370
of the neurons have changed.

00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:38.650
And you can also see that these neurons

00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:41.930
make longer connections in
certain parts of the brain

00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:45.440
and those parts of the brain
are involved in motor learning

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:48.890
so these are these
cortico-basal ganglia circuits

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:50.670
that seems to be changed.

00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:54.337
So you can then develop a
theory about what this caused

00:58:54.337 --> 00:58:57.540
and there's some new data
now that's now published

00:58:57.540 --> 00:59:01.610
by Christiane Schreiweis
together with Ann Graybiel at MIT

00:59:01.610 --> 00:59:04.950
where they studied motor
learning in this humanized mice

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:07.800
that have this humanized protein in them.

00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:10.510
So these are experiments
where the mouse have to learn

00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:12.940
that it should go towards
a certain light signal

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:14.910
to get some reward there.

00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:16.860
And if it should always go to the left,

00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:20.650
after a while, you can
take away the visual cue

00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:23.210
and the mouse will
automatically go to the left.

00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:25.680
It has sort of automated this.

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:29.790
And if you look at how quickly
you come to this automation

00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:32.160
of the thing, it's quite a difference

00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:37.020
between the humanized mice
to the wild-type littermates.

00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:40.010
They learn in seven to
eight days to do this

00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:44.510
what takes 11 and 12 days in
their wild-type littermates

00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:47.270
bringed by the same mother, et cetera.

00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:50.110
So this is sort of the switch

00:59:50.110 --> 00:59:52.700
from this sort of declarative
to the procedural.

00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:56.540
It sort of automation on
motor learning if you like.

00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:59.770
So if you think about learning
to bike when you're a kid,

00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:03.240
you first think about what you
do and you're very bad at it

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:06.200
and after a while, you
sort of automate the thing

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.890
and then you get very good at bicycling.

01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:10.780
And there's this switch here

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:13.400
to sort of automating motor movements.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.180
And you can of course sort of speculate

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:18.210
and say that that's exactly what we do

01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:20.300
when we learn to speak as children.

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:24.030
We learn to automate
very complex coordination

01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:26.840
of motor movements in our vocal cords,

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:30.437
our lips, our tongues to
produce articulate speech.

01:00:30.437 --> 01:00:34.580
Something that no other ape can do.

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:38.590
So there's an hypothesis
that these changes alters

01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:42.980
these cortical-basal circuits
to allow for faster automation

01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:45.980
of motor movements and
perhaps some aspects

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:47.930
of language and speech.

01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:49.810
So I think this is very encouraging

01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:53.830
that one can perhaps
sometimes develop models

01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:58.640
of humanizing aspects
of brain and a mouse.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:01.160
Dresen trying to do
that with these things,

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.040
for example, for modern human changes now

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:09.930
and for a number of other
things that may be of interest.

01:01:09.930 --> 01:01:12.580
So to end then, I'm going to say

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:17.100
that if you're interested
then in modern human origins,

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:20.050
I hope I sort of convinced
you that is quite useful

01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:23.910
to have the genome of
our very closest relative

01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:26.660
'cause you then can focus
on what's really unique

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:30.070
to modern humans relative to them.

01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:31.990
In the future, when we
have more Neanderthals,

01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:36.560
we'll also be able to study
what's unique to Neanderthals

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.840
but that will not be enough.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:39.190
We will have these changes

01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:42.210
and we will have to go
after them functionally

01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:47.210
and a way to do that would be
to modify human and ape cells

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:49.100
in tissue culture, I think,

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:53.260
but also then to modify
and humanized mice.

01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:54.120
(attendees laughing)

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:58.310
And with that, I should
say that many, many people

01:01:58.310 --> 01:01:59.143
are involved in this.

01:01:59.143 --> 01:02:01.130
More people than I can mention.

01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:02.660
I'll pick up one person.

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:05.840
Matthias Meyer who
developed the technology

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.770
to make these ultra sensitive libraries

01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:11.590
that allowed us to get
these high quality genomes

01:02:11.590 --> 01:02:14.560
from Denisovans and Neanderthals.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:19.560
Many, many people have been
involved in analyzing the data.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.940
I mentioned them in
the talk several times.

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:23.690
Monty Slatkin and his group here

01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:25.560
and David Reich and his group here.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:29.000
Janet Kelso who coordinates
all the bioinformatics

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.920
in Leipzig and Kay Prufer
who particularly then

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:34.680
worked on the Neanderthal genome.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.690
And we wrap up then.

01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:37.138
Thank you for your attention.

01:02:37.138 --> 01:02:40.471
(attendees applauding)

01:02:52.281 --> 01:02:55.170
- [John] Thank you very
much for a fascinating talk

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:59.132
and Svante will take questions.

01:02:59.132 --> 01:03:03.230
- [Attendee] Dr. Paabo, it
really makes sense to compare

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.510
Neanderthal technology

01:03:08.132 --> 01:03:13.132
with later human technology,

01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:16.830
with the technology we have
now or that we had 10,000 years

01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:18.823
after Neanderthals disappeared.

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:23.961
As opposed to comparing
Neanderthal technology

01:03:23.961 --> 01:03:27.410
40,000 years ago when they went extinct

01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:31.120
to the technology that humans,

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.600
that modern humans had at the time

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:38.180
which I understand that recently,

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:42.460
some researchers have compared Neanderthal

01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:48.870
hunting instruments with modern
human hunting instruments

01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:53.280
of that age and found that actually,

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.380
neither was more efficient than the other.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.880
And I think that you'll find precious

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.160
little representational
art made by modern humans

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:08.650
that's that old.

01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:09.570
- Yes.

01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:13.553
- [Attendee] So do we?

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:19.680
Are we sure that Neanderthals
wouldn't be making

01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:23.820
satellites now if they had
been the surviving species?

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:27.420
- No, that is a good question.

01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:31.840
Of course, my take on it
would be that Neanderthals

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.840
had three, 400,000 years to
do this yet they didn't do it.

01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:41.550
And humans had hundred
thousand years or even less

01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:43.650
and actually did it.

01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:47.433
But that's not to say, it's
not so to clear what is,

01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:50.650
it's not clear that this, for example,

01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:53.180
individual intelligence that differs.

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:55.370
Some people have the
idea that it's something

01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:57.670
with human sociality,

01:04:57.670 --> 01:05:00.520
that we have sort of developed

01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:04.633
sort of, what should I say?

01:05:04.633 --> 01:05:08.600
A sort of compulsion to
communicate and teach

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.060
that allows us to have an accumulative,

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:15.110
that's ratchet effect
where we sort of convey

01:05:15.110 --> 01:05:18.550
all our technological advances
to the next generation

01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:21.450
so they can just continue
to build on that.

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:25.570
And that may be the key
why technology and culture

01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:28.270
took off in modern humans to that extent.

01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:31.290
It may be that the
Neanderthal could learn it

01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:33.480
but they would not have as a society,

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:37.920
this sort of compulsion to pass it on,

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.340
but, you know, yes, it's
also a criticism of this

01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:45.040
can be to say yes, sure,
only Europeans had firearms

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.740
and Native Americans didn't,

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:49.170
that doesn't mean that there's
a difference genetically

01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:51.040
between the groups.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.067
But there is still some
difference in sort of having

01:05:53.067 --> 01:05:57.150
300,000 years and not doing
it, I would say, madame.

01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:02.090
One can have different
opinions about that.

01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:03.740
Yeah.

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:05.530
- [Attendee] I've been wondering,

01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:07.913
do Neanderthals have a myostatin gene?

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:09.953
A myostatin.

01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:12.360
I don't know if you're familiar with.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:15.420
If you delete a myostatin
gene from a human,

01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:17.350
they lose almost all their body fat

01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:19.610
and they gain 40 percent
more skeletal muscles

01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:23.040
so they become like incredibly athletic

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:26.070
and there's a few people
who have this mutation

01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:27.589
and there are super athletes.

01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:29.660
There's one construction worker in Germany

01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:31.889
who could pick up 320-pound
slabs of concrete by hand

01:06:31.889 --> 01:06:33.493
and carry 'em around.

01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:37.540
So I'm curious, you know,
they're they're known

01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:40.120
for being much stronger than human.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.900
- Yes, we haven't looked at that gene.

01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:44.410
Someone should look at it.

01:06:44.410 --> 01:06:47.810
It's all out there of
course in the public domain.

01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:51.330
I maybe more regulation
of the gene or something.

01:06:51.330 --> 01:06:53.200
I'm sure they have it.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.187
It sort of popped up otherwise but yes.

01:07:01.075 --> 01:07:02.530
- [Attendee] A couple of months ago,

01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:04.680
I was at Atapuerca and they showed us

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:09.450
a pre-Neanderthal skull and
said that they had found

01:07:09.450 --> 01:07:11.720
Denisovan mitochondrial DNA in it

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:15.000
and I was wondering if
you could confirm that.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.693
- Yes, that's actually our work, yes.

01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:23.610
So yeah, so this, Atapuerca
Sima de los Huesos,

01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:26.823
one finds 400,000-year-old hominis.

01:07:26.823 --> 01:07:30.740
So it's a big, 20 or I forget how many

01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:32.910
and we have looked at,

01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:36.000
so these are almost 10 times
older than the Neanderthals

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.550
we have looked at.

01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:40.540
So we've been able to retrieve
from some of the bones

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:43.240
tiny, tiny amounts of short pieces of DNA

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:46.190
and only been able to look
at the mitochondrial genome

01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:50.770
so far but we will for
sure get some nuclear DNA

01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:52.952
this year or next year.

01:07:52.952 --> 01:07:56.180
But the surprise was that
the mitochondrial genome

01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:58.120
actually goes back to common ancestor

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.540
with the Denisovan mitochondrial DNA

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:01.870
but far back.

01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:04.900
So I wouldn't call this
Denisovan mitochondrial DNA.

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:07.777
It's still a deeper divergence

01:08:07.777 --> 01:08:12.090
between any two living humans
in the mitochondrial DNA today

01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:14.100
but yes, it's sort of surprising

01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:16.560
and we certainly thought
that these were if anything

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:19.160
the ancestors on Neanderthals

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:22.390
and would go back to common
ancestor with Neanderthals.

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:25.840
It may just be that we're so far back

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.507
so we're close to a common
ancestral population

01:08:28.507 --> 01:08:32.020
on both Denisovans and
Neanderthal at that time

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:33.683
but the nuclear genome will tell.

01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:37.230
- [Attendee] One more quick question.

01:08:37.230 --> 01:08:39.680
I understand that there's evidence

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.840
that the Neanderthal used,

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:47.840
the maturation rate for
children was considerably faster

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.600
than humans and I wonder if you guys

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:54.980
have any insight into the
genetic basis for that.

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:59.010
- No, but I know people in
Philipp Khaitovich's group

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:02.898
in Shanghai, for example,
is looking into that.

01:09:02.898 --> 01:09:04.073
Yes, I think it might be
something coming on that, yes.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.803
- [Attendee] Hi, great talk.

01:09:11.879 --> 01:09:16.879
I'm wondering, you showed
three different mutations,

01:09:18.105 --> 01:09:23.105
it were Neanderthal in brain chemistry

01:09:24.670 --> 01:09:27.960
and you listed, I believe autism

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.250
as one of the possible consequences

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.570
and schizophrenia is another one

01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:37.170
and there was one in the middle,

01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:41.130
some kind of glycolysis and
I was wondering, what that--

01:09:41.130 --> 01:09:45.840
- We have Tourette syndrome but it's not,

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:50.430
the differences to Neanderthals
don't cause those diseases.

01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:53.035
It's when those genes are not out

01:09:53.035 --> 01:09:56.210
and they've one copy of
them, you have those diseases

01:09:56.210 --> 01:09:58.340
but the Neanderthal difference

01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:00.410
is that are the difference
to the Neanderthal

01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:03.730
in modern humans is sort of a
subtle difference in the gene

01:10:03.730 --> 01:10:06.820
but this just gives a hint that
it may have something to do

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:09.253
with cognition or
something like that, yes.

01:10:10.595 --> 01:10:13.867
- [Attendee] And also
Denisovans, the ones that went,

01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:19.070
are you saying the Neanderthals
are not the ones in China

01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:21.520
but the Denisovans?

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:26.163
- Yes, I certainly think
that whatever was in China

01:10:26.163 --> 01:10:28.580
could well have been Denisovans,

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:32.203
it was not Neanderthals,
I would think but yes.

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:36.150
But I think autism is very interesting.

01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:38.530
I mean our Mike Tomasello, for example,

01:10:38.530 --> 01:10:42.810
is a sort of comparative
psychologist who've suggested

01:10:42.810 --> 01:10:47.810
that the things affected
in autism maybe something

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:52.283
aspect of our cognition
that may be uniquely human.

01:10:52.283 --> 01:10:54.810
This sort of an enormous tendency for us

01:10:54.810 --> 01:10:57.100
to put ourselves in other people's shoes

01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:00.403
and others people's perspectives.

01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:07.590
- [Attendees] You showed a slide where,

01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:09.150
I'm not sure if I read it correctly

01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:10.887
but there was some,

01:11:10.887 --> 01:11:14.690
you're showing differences between humans,

01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:19.650
what humans had unique versus
Neanderthals and chimps.

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:21.488
And then you showed,

01:11:21.488 --> 01:11:24.170
I forget which group is unique to what

01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:26.440
but you showed differences,

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:30.533
there's differences in
pigmentation and behavior.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:33.590
I was just kind of
reminded this documentary

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:36.430
that I watched about the
domestication of dogs

01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:40.590
and they were, just by selecting
for docility or tameness,

01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:43.900
they see corresponding
changes in pigmentation

01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:46.510
like coat color and you see this

01:11:46.510 --> 01:11:48.320
in a lot of different mammals.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.737
Is there any parallels to that

01:11:49.737 --> 01:11:53.320
and to domestication
of mammals and humans?

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.130
- We would love to find such parallels.

01:11:56.130 --> 01:11:57.870
I think it's a great question.

01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:01.670
I mean this particular this
experimental domestication

01:12:01.670 --> 01:12:05.110
that has been done in
Novosibirsk by Belyaev

01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:08.900
and his followers, successors now,

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:13.900
domesticating silver
foxes and rats and mink

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:15.880
and they see exactly what you say.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:18.510
So we work with them, actually,

01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:21.350
and I'm looking for
example that correlates

01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:24.850
gene expression in the
brains of the docile

01:12:26.650 --> 01:12:28.420
and aggressive variants of these

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:31.120
and compare, for example,
humans and chimps

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:36.120
or bonobos and chimpanzees
and dogs and wolves, actually,

01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:39.370
to try to find some common theme there

01:12:39.370 --> 01:12:42.703
but so far, nothing really have stood out.

01:12:43.570 --> 01:12:46.833
Yes, it's certainly something
we're working on, yeah.

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.400
- [Attendee] Hello, thank you
for the wonderful presentation

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:54.130
and I had a question regarding
the function of mosaicism

01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:56.770
as we see, as it results in modern humans.

01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:58.356
So you mentioned that,

01:12:58.356 --> 01:13:00.281
my grandma six generations back

01:13:00.281 --> 01:13:03.890
contribute about 1.5% of our DNA

01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:05.940
and that's the same that
we have from Neanderthals.

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:09.120
So my question is talking about function,

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.840
is it all the same that
grandma was a Neanderthal

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.140
or is there some kind of difference

01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:14.653
in how this would manifest?

01:13:15.612 --> 01:13:18.520
- Yes, so I don't know if
that's such a good image.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.480
It's, of course, different
with the Neanderthals

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.750
because this happened a long time ago

01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:25.650
and these fragments are sort
of spread all over the genome

01:13:25.650 --> 01:13:27.810
and it's now is some kind of equilibrium.

01:13:27.810 --> 01:13:31.063
We all have it so it's
not decreasing anymore.

01:13:32.650 --> 01:13:36.333
So the the
great-great-great-great-grandmother's
part there

01:13:36.333 --> 01:13:38.540
will of course be in
big, big chunks, right?

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:39.373
- [Attendee] Yeah.

01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:42.070
- So there is certainly a difference

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:46.890
but yes, I didn't quite get the,

01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:48.470
perhaps, answered the question correctly.

01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:49.440
- [Attendee] Is there
something you could say

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.730
about how that difference
would manifest in function

01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:53.270
or is it just?

01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:54.770
- Well, so the only thing we know

01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:57.850
about the Neanderthal
contribution and function

01:13:57.850 --> 01:13:59.840
is really what I reviewed here.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:04.310
The immune response genes, the keratins,

01:14:05.785 --> 01:14:10.607
the lipid catabolism and type 2 diabetes.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:14.270
There will be more things coming
in the literature, I think

01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:16.700
but that's the only things
that are known today.

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:17.693
- [Attendee] Thank you.

01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:21.150
- [Attendee] Hi, I was just
curious how many high quality

01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:22.700
Neanderthal samples exists?

01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:25.160
So for example, if we wanted
to do a hundred or thousand

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:26.680
Neanderthal genome project,

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.810
do we buy more sequencers or more shovels?

01:14:28.810 --> 01:14:33.350
- Yes, so we actually thought
about launching next year

01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:38.020
to have something catchy to
say, 100K genomes projects

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:41.990
and they will not all
be high-quality then.

01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:44.900
We are working on a high quality genome

01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:46.500
from this site in Croatia.

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.030
I think there will be one.

01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:52.920
Might get a few more but
the rest will be 1x coverage

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.050
or something like that.

01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:56.780
Low quality things but
enough to reconstruct

01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:57.963
population history.

01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:04.190
- [Attendee] You mentioned
earlier in your talk

01:15:04.190 --> 01:15:08.970
that there are no
Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA

01:15:08.970 --> 01:15:10.790
in human populations.

01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:12.470
Later on in your talk, you mentioned

01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:15.030
that one of the findings
seemed to be a decrease

01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:18.020
in the hybrid male infertility.

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:20.020
And my question is have
you had the opportunity

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:24.650
to come up with any hypotheses
about the representational

01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:28.230
sexual selection in hybridization?

01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:32.620
- Yes, so we were quite
convinced from David's work

01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:33.920
that on the X chromosome,

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:37.920
there is less Neanderthal
contribution and less

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.480
in the rest of the genome.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:42.030
That made us think always is mainly men,

01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:44.680
Neanderthal men who contribute this

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:47.440
because they will of course
contribute less on X chromosome

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.469
because only half kids of a man

01:15:50.469 --> 01:15:53.330
gets an X chromosome from him.

01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:56.810
But then, we've seen
other parts of the genome

01:15:56.810 --> 01:16:00.510
where there also seems to be
less Neanderthal contribution

01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:02.620
and less regular chromosomes

01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:04.890
so there is big selection going on.

01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:08.640
There are some things that
are not accepted to come over

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:11.140
so that has made us very sort of shy away

01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:13.240
from saying anything about that.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:15.820
If I would just guess
from what we've seen,

01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:17.630
I would say if I will guess on one,

01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:19.830
it would be more man than females

01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:22.970
but we haven't shown that in any sense.

01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:23.943
- [Attendees] Thank you.

01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:28.680
- [Attendee] Thank you
for the wonderful talk.

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.290
What can we use?

01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:34.490
What can we infer about
socialization amongst Neanderthals

01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:35.580
from the evidence you had?

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:37.800
You showed us that this one small group

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:41.080
was pretty much related
and you also showed us

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.850
bone fragments that were split.

01:16:42.850 --> 01:16:44.650
- Oh, yes.

01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:48.630
- [Attendee] And so what
do we know about the bones

01:16:48.630 --> 01:16:49.490
that were split?

01:16:49.490 --> 01:16:51.230
What were their genders?

01:16:51.230 --> 01:16:52.640
How were they preserved?

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.850
- It's interesting that you
asked that question here

01:16:54.850 --> 01:16:58.240
because Tim White, I
don't know if Tim is here.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.530
The paleontologist here at Berkeley.

01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:05.530
He has shown that these
bones have been treated

01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:11.740
very much have been eaten
probably by other Neanderthals.

01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:14.240
So it's very telling for
example that the bones

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.140
with bone marrow have been crushed

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:18.293
and those without bone marrow are not.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.700
And there are cut marks, for example,

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:25.140
where muscles attach to the
bones and things like that

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.660
and there's a site in Spain at Sidrom

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:31.740
where is a social group
that have all been eaten.

01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:34.620
Children, adolescents and adults.

01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:37.030
So I do think one ate each other.

01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:39.010
One can of course discuss if that's part

01:17:39.010 --> 01:17:41.870
of some ritual burial or so.

01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:44.880
Tim has pointed out that
that it's very similar

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:49.320
to how one treats deer
bones or something like that

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:51.099
at these signs.

01:17:51.099 --> 01:17:54.303
But there are also other
sites where they had buried,

01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:58.800
intentionally buried,
it seems, each other.

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:02.543
So yes, I think there
were eating going on.

01:18:05.268 --> 01:18:07.017
They were clearly at ease in this site,

01:18:07.017 --> 01:18:10.410
but were very closely related parents.

01:18:10.410 --> 01:18:12.880
At the level of half seeds.

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.940
That's really everything, the latter

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:18.040
is the only thing we can really say about.

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:21.030
The population sizes seem
to have been very small

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:22.810
and isolated from each other.

01:18:22.810 --> 01:18:25.483
So not only do they have
little genetic variation,

01:18:25.483 --> 01:18:28.050
they also have lots of differences between

01:18:28.050 --> 01:18:31.230
say the carcasses, Grasham and Siberia.

01:18:31.230 --> 01:18:34.280
More so than present day humans.

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.993
That's really all we can
say from the genetic data.

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.193
So not so much.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.840
- [Attendee] Hello, I did,

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:49.420
Neanderthal and Denisovan,
where did they evolve?

01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:52.070
I guess it's number one and number two,

01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:56.882
did they both evolve from Homo erectus

01:18:56.882 --> 01:19:00.130
or do we have to wait for Homo erectus DNA

01:19:00.130 --> 01:19:01.440
to figure that out?

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:05.910
- So we believe their
ancestors evolved in Africa

01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:09.433
and came out of Africa then
half a million years ago or so.

01:19:09.433 --> 01:19:12.570
Not that that is shown very well

01:19:12.570 --> 01:19:16.630
but I think sort of, if we
say that is what paleontology

01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:20.137
called Homo heidelbergensis is
perhaps the ancestor of this

01:19:20.137 --> 01:19:23.790
and you find the sort of
Homo rudolfensis in Africa

01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:26.143
so probably come out of Africa.

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.640
They probably evolved out of something

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.230
but that is really a question
for the paleontologist

01:19:33.230 --> 01:19:35.430
if we then call that Homo erectus

01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:37.140
that they are on out of.

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:40.503
I would love to get to erectus genome.

01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:44.130
Maybe in Asia or so where there are things

01:19:44.130 --> 01:19:47.310
as a called erectus that survived late

01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:49.033
that it will become possible.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.333
- [Attendees] Two short questions.

01:19:52.333 --> 01:19:53.900
One is about the Ust'-Ishim skeleton.

01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:55.190
I was wondering, you said

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:57.750
that it has clear
Neanderthal contribution,

01:19:57.750 --> 01:20:00.330
does it also have Denisovan contribution?

01:20:00.330 --> 01:20:04.700
And the other part is the
possible Neanderthal adaptation

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:05.990
to starvation.

01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:07.483
What would that have consisted of?

01:20:07.483 --> 01:20:10.600
Sort of indication, what that
metabolically would have been?

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:13.900
- So, bit hard of hearing but we see this

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:18.150
Neanderthal contribution to Denisovans

01:20:18.150 --> 01:20:21.070
but we do not see it the other way.

01:20:21.070 --> 01:20:24.340
Sort of they might have
been some small thing

01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:26.320
we don't detect about this.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.140
- [Attendee] Ust'-Ishim
skelton was, we think,

01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:31.070
modern human but with a
Neanderthal contribution

01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:32.986
but not a Denisovan one?

01:20:32.986 --> 01:20:33.819
- To Denisovans.

01:20:34.813 --> 01:20:38.013
So from Neanderthals into Denisovans, so.

01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:41.810
And this yes, adaptation to starvation

01:20:41.810 --> 01:20:44.640
is a speculation from
saying that this risk allele

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:49.430
for type 2 diabetes
comes from Neanderthals

01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:51.350
but it's very curious of course if,

01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:54.340
it's probably not because
it gives you type 2 diabetes

01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:57.070
that is resistant to high
frequency in present day humans,

01:20:57.070 --> 01:20:59.620
it must have had some advantage.

01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:01.570
And I think it's reasonable to speculate

01:21:01.570 --> 01:21:05.670
that these variants sort of
make you store energy better

01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:08.610
and today in a situation
where with ample nutrition

01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:11.890
all the time, that
gives us type 2 diabetes

01:21:11.890 --> 01:21:14.490
but those individuals would
probably also do better

01:21:14.490 --> 01:21:16.433
in a situation of starvation.

01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:27.680
- Well, this one wonderful event

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:30.383
is coming to a rapid conclusion.

01:21:31.450 --> 01:21:32.860
Thank you very much for coming

01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:35.311
and please join me in
thanking Svante Paabo.

01:21:35.311 --> 01:21:39.311
(attendees applauding)

01:21:39.311 --> 01:21:41.978
(lively music)
