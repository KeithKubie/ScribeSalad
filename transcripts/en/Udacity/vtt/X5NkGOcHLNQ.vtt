Some of the characteristics of services are flexibility. That is,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.210
you are essentially refactoring, if, if you have an existing application, you

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.060
want to make that service oriented you factored into, into pieces that then you

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.470
could combine in interesting ways. Meaningful here on the slide means each of

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.790
the services is something that's meaningful to the end user. They're stateless,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.290
for the reasons described with web services. Stateless means that typically

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.190
the code is actually simpler than it would be if you have to remember variables.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.080
And also it's transparent with respect to middleware. Typically,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.310
there's a middleware technology solution that takes your descriptions.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.360
Takes your configuration information and

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.520
generates the the, the middle work pieces that need to be generated.
