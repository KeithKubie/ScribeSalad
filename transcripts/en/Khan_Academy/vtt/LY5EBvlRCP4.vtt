00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:01.784
- [David] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.784 --> 00:00:05.714
Today I wanna talk about
the concept of irony,

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:08.647
which is a very difficult
concept to nail down

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:10.406
because it means so many things.

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:14.697
But let's begin with the
best definition I can muster,

00:00:14.697 --> 00:00:16.738
which is that irony is
the difference between

00:00:16.738 --> 00:00:19.291
expectation and result.

00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:21.665
Now, this contains a lot within it.

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:22.790
So, that means that irony is

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.342
not only the engine of
surprise, but also jokes.

00:00:27.342 --> 00:00:29.759
All jokes in English function

00:00:31.444 --> 00:00:33.445
on this engine of the difference

00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:34.763
between expectation and result.

00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:36.400
You expect to hear one thing

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.059
and then a joke plays
with your expectations.

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.904
There's nothing less funny than

00:00:40.904 --> 00:00:42.625
explaining why things are funny.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.612
But this is why things are funny.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:46.881
So, today we're gonna talk about

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:49.249
three different kinds of irony.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.559
And I'm going to give
you an example of each.

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.724
Now, the first kind is
called situational irony.

00:00:55.724 --> 00:00:58.705
In situational irony, everyone is aware

00:00:58.705 --> 00:01:00.507
of the discrepancy of the difference

00:01:00.507 --> 00:01:02.509
between expectation and result.

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:04.797
And a really classic example of this is

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:08.630
the O. Henry short story
The Gift of the Magi.

00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:12.147
And it's about a couple who are very poor,

00:01:12.147 --> 00:01:14.846
but who love each other very much.

00:01:14.846 --> 00:01:16.237
And each one wants to get the other

00:01:16.237 --> 00:01:18.159
a really nice Christmas present.

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.529
The man has a very lovely watch

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:24.029
and the woman has really lovely long hair.

00:01:25.073 --> 00:01:27.240
And, unbeknownst to the other,

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.573
the woman buys her husband a watch chain

00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:34.786
and the man buys his wife a comb.

00:01:34.786 --> 00:01:36.505
But, in order to do that,

00:01:36.505 --> 00:01:39.330
he sells his watch to buy her the comb

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.213
and, in order to buy him the watch chain,

00:01:41.213 --> 00:01:43.296
the woman sells her hair.

00:01:44.306 --> 00:01:47.500
And so, they give each other
gifts that are now useless.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.083
This watch chain and this comb.

00:01:50.973 --> 00:01:52.488
For the hair that isn't there

00:01:52.488 --> 00:01:54.290
and the watch that isn't there.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.814
And the irony is that
they are now aware that

00:01:56.814 --> 00:01:59.921
the lengths that they
went to for the other

00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:02.754
kind of ruined each other's gifts.

00:02:03.892 --> 00:02:05.121
That's situational irony.

00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:06.227
It's kind of a happy ending,

00:02:06.227 --> 00:02:08.722
'cause it proves stuff is just stuff

00:02:08.722 --> 00:02:10.932
and they love each other very much.

00:02:10.932 --> 00:02:12.526
That's situational irony.

00:02:12.526 --> 00:02:16.245
Everyone is aware of the discrepancy.

00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:20.644
Irony variant number two
is called dramatic irony.

00:02:20.644 --> 00:02:24.324
This means that there's
an unevenly distributed

00:02:24.324 --> 00:02:25.919
awareness of the difference.

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.742
Specifically, that there's an audience.

00:02:28.742 --> 00:02:29.682
So, this is the sort of thing that

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:34.007
really only comes into play in
fiction or in dramatic work.

00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:36.747
So, we're talking about a
play or a movie or whatever.

00:02:36.747 --> 00:02:38.383
So, let's say we've got a play.

00:02:38.383 --> 00:02:39.281
Here's our stage.

00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:41.694
Here's our audience down here.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:45.052
We have one character here, character A,

00:02:45.052 --> 00:02:47.789
who really doesn't like bears

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:49.384
and is talking about if
he ever meets a bear,

00:02:49.384 --> 00:02:51.467
he's probably gonna punch
that bear right in the face.

00:02:51.467 --> 00:02:53.758
And here is character B, who is a bear,

00:02:53.758 --> 00:02:57.111
but is a bear in disguise
wearing a hat and a tie.

00:02:57.111 --> 00:03:00.623
Now, character B knows
that character B is a bear.

00:03:00.623 --> 00:03:02.915
The audience knows that
character B is a bear.

00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:04.832
Character A is unaware.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.587
So, we have this unevenly
distributed awareness

00:03:09.587 --> 00:03:11.958
of the difference between
expectation and result.

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:14.973
Character A expects that
character B is not a bear.

00:03:14.973 --> 00:03:17.224
But character B and the audience

00:03:17.224 --> 00:03:19.228
knows that the opposite is true.

00:03:19.228 --> 00:03:21.768
That's dramatic irony.

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:24.101
Now, the third kind of irony
we're going to talk about today

00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:26.500
is called verbal irony.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.744
So, the irony of words.

00:03:28.744 --> 00:03:30.384
And this one's a little different,

00:03:30.384 --> 00:03:32.101
because verbal irony is the difference

00:03:32.101 --> 00:03:35.318
between a stated meaning
and an actual meaning.

00:03:35.318 --> 00:03:38.064
And this means that it can
come in a couple of flavors.

00:03:38.064 --> 00:03:40.355
The most notable, and
perhaps the most confusing,

00:03:40.355 --> 00:03:41.855
is called sarcasm.

00:03:44.222 --> 00:03:46.599
And sarcasm is when you say a thing,

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.092
but it actually ends up meaning
something quite different,

00:03:49.092 --> 00:03:50.889
usually the opposite.

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.877
So, let's say an anvil,
very heavy metal object,

00:03:53.877 --> 00:03:55.685
falls on my foot, breaks my foot.

00:03:55.685 --> 00:03:58.001
I am in extraordinary pain.

00:03:58.001 --> 00:03:59.393
If you asked me how I was doing

00:03:59.393 --> 00:04:01.726
and I wanted to use sarcasm,

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.226
I would say something
like, "Oh, I'm just great."

00:04:06.226 --> 00:04:09.500
And I'm signaling, with
my tone and also context,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.667
to indicate that the opposite is true.

00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:15.371
To say, "I'm actually terrible.

00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:17.625
My foot is broken."

00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:18.875
That's sarcasm.

00:04:19.878 --> 00:04:23.460
Now, related to sarcasm is the pun,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.627
which is usually a joke that
plays on multiple meanings.

00:04:28.579 --> 00:04:29.929
So, again, let's take this case.

00:04:29.929 --> 00:04:31.855
Let's say my foot was crushed by an anvil

00:04:31.855 --> 00:04:33.820
You ask me how I'm doing.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.702
I would say, "I'm feeling
a little flat today."

00:04:36.702 --> 00:04:38.666
No, not a great joke, sure.

00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:40.302
But what I'm trying to express is that

00:04:40.302 --> 00:04:44.946
I am both playing on the
notion that I don't feel well,

00:04:44.946 --> 00:04:46.174
I feel a little flat,

00:04:46.174 --> 00:04:49.288
and that my foot has been
squished by a heavy object,

00:04:49.288 --> 00:04:52.116
literally rendering it flat.

00:04:52.116 --> 00:04:53.725
That's what a pun is.

00:04:53.725 --> 00:04:56.385
And, again, I recognize
that, by explaining the joke,

00:04:56.385 --> 00:04:58.427
I have made the joke unfunny.

00:04:58.427 --> 00:04:59.427
I apologize.

00:05:00.554 --> 00:05:03.628
So, to review, let's put
all of these together

00:05:03.628 --> 00:05:06.295
into one giant ironic situation.

00:05:09.591 --> 00:05:12.947
So, let's say you're watching
a sitcom on television.

00:05:12.947 --> 00:05:15.522
And this sitcom takes place
in someone's apartment

00:05:15.522 --> 00:05:18.503
and that apartment has a
thing called a Murphy bed.

00:05:18.503 --> 00:05:20.306
Now, what a Murphy bed is is a bed that

00:05:20.306 --> 00:05:23.696
folds up into the wall to save
space in a small apartment.

00:05:23.696 --> 00:05:24.919
It's got this little handle up here.

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:25.916
You grab it, you pull it down,

00:05:25.916 --> 00:05:28.411
it becomes just a regular bed.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.991
Otherwise, it's kept
folded up into the wall.

00:05:30.991 --> 00:05:33.244
So, let's say we're watching a sitcom

00:05:33.244 --> 00:05:37.411
that takes place in a small
apartment that has a Murphy bed.

00:05:38.297 --> 00:05:41.077
Let's say that our main
character has just come home

00:05:41.077 --> 00:05:43.777
from the airport with her visiting cousin.

00:05:43.777 --> 00:05:45.044
So, again, this is a sitcom.

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:48.461
This is all happening on your television.

00:05:49.447 --> 00:05:52.197
So, this is all inside the frame.

00:05:55.996 --> 00:05:58.411
Now, unbeknownst to our
protagonist, let's call her Anna,

00:05:58.411 --> 00:06:00.620
and her cousin, let's call her Bella,

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.953
a lion has crawled into the Murphy bed

00:06:02.953 --> 00:06:06.024
while the two of them were out.

00:06:06.024 --> 00:06:08.274
I promise this has a point.

00:06:11.032 --> 00:06:15.199
So, hidden behind this wall
is a lion on top of this bed.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.382
Now, ignorant of all of this,

00:06:21.382 --> 00:06:24.901
Bella asks her cousin "Is
the Murphy bed comfortable?"

00:06:24.901 --> 00:06:27.351
To which Anna replies "Yeah.

00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:30.340
It's perfect for lyin' on."

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.526
I think you see where I'm going here.

00:06:31.526 --> 00:06:33.109
So, dramatic irony.

00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:37.738
We, the audience on the
other side of the screen,

00:06:37.738 --> 00:06:39.013
are aware that this entire that

00:06:39.013 --> 00:06:42.114
this entire time there's a
lion hiding in the Murphy bed.

00:06:42.114 --> 00:06:43.300
We know this.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.856
Anna and Bella do not.

00:06:44.856 --> 00:06:46.982
Bella asks if the bed is comfortable.

00:06:46.982 --> 00:06:48.531
Anna assures her that it is.

00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:50.393
We know, as the audience, it is not.

00:06:50.393 --> 00:06:53.866
There is a dangerous
savanna predator in the bed.

00:06:53.866 --> 00:06:55.380
That's dramatic irony.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.701
Situational irony, when they
pull that Murphy bed down

00:06:59.701 --> 00:07:01.457
and expose the lion,

00:07:01.457 --> 00:07:03.029
they will see the difference between

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:06.078
these expectations and this result.

00:07:06.078 --> 00:07:08.290
And that is situational irony.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.639
You thought one thing was true

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:12.030
and now something very
different has happened.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.237
That's the difference between
expectation and result.

00:07:14.237 --> 00:07:15.997
Beds don't usually have lions in them.

00:07:15.997 --> 00:07:17.717
You expect them not to have lions in them.

00:07:17.717 --> 00:07:18.550
You pull down the bed.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.909
Boom, there's a lion in it.

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:21.464
Situational irony.

00:07:21.464 --> 00:07:24.381
Finally, it's perfect for lyin' on.

00:07:25.477 --> 00:07:27.416
Now, Anna does not realize this,

00:07:27.416 --> 00:07:29.912
but she is unwittingly punning

00:07:29.912 --> 00:07:33.599
on the fact that there is
a lion on the Murphy bed.

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:35.682
So, this is verbal irony.

00:07:37.239 --> 00:07:41.406
Because, in fact, there is
a lion lyin' on the bed.

00:07:43.497 --> 00:07:44.398
So, there you have it.

00:07:44.398 --> 00:07:47.198
Encapsulated in one ridiculous case,

00:07:47.198 --> 00:07:50.947
here are all three
basic examples of irony.

00:07:50.947 --> 00:07:55.523
So, situational irony, dramatic
irony, and verbal irony.

00:07:55.523 --> 00:07:57.607
You can learn anything, David out.
