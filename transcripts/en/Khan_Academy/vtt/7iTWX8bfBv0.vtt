00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.100
- [Instructor] We're now going
to explore hypothesis testing

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.000
where we're thinking about the difference

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.630
between proportions of
two different populations.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.610
So here it says, here are the
results from a recent poll

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.620
that involved sampling voters from each

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.470
of two neighboring districts,
District A and District B,

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.500
and folks were asked
whether they supported

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.700
a new law or not, and from each district,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.470
we took a sample of 100 voters.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.020
And then we were able to
calculate the proportion

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.110
from that sample that supported the law.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.200
And then here we have the combined data,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.920
including the combined proportion.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.900
And we're asked, does this suggest

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.910
a significant difference
between the two districts.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.140
And so this is asking
for a hypothesis test,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.780
and the way we would do that is

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.880
we would set up our null hypothesis,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.850
and remember our null
hypothesis is the one

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.110
that we would assume that
there is no difference.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.890
So we would assume that the
true proportion of folks

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.120
in District A that support
the new law is equal

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.900
to the proportion in District
B that support the law.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.320
Or another way to think about it is that

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.030
the difference would be equal to zero.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.450
And our alternative hypothesis

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.080
is that the absolute difference between

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.400
the proportions is not equal to zero.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.360
And if we were doing an
all out hypothesis test,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.620
we would set a significance level,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.540
which we usually denote with an alpha.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.060
Often times it might be
a 10% significance level

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.580
or a 5% significance level.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.400
Let's say we set it at
a 5% significance level.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.007
And what we would do is, we would say,

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:30.207
"All right, let's assume that
the null hypothesis is true,

00:01:30.207 --> 00:01:33.247
"and assuming the null hypothesis is true,

00:01:33.247 --> 00:01:36.587
"what is the probability of
getting a difference between our

00:01:36.587 --> 00:01:40.067
"sample proportions this extreme or more?

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:42.727
"And if that probability is
less than our significance

00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:45.487
"level, then we reject
the null hypothesis,

00:01:45.487 --> 00:01:48.240
"which would suggest the alternative."

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.770
Now before we go deeper
into our inference,

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.880
we want to test our
conditions for inference,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.400
and we've seen these many times before.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.900
You have the Random condition,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.910
where you would need
to feel good that both

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.650
of these samples are truly random.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.420
You would have your Normal condition,

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.910
which is that you would
have at least 10 successes

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.300
and failures in each of these samples,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.460
and we see that we do
indeed have at least 10

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.450
successes and at least 10
failures in each of those samples.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.930
And then you have your
Independence condition,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.860
and the Independence condition,

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.220
you're either sampling with replacement

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.530
or you need to feel good that
each of these sample sizes

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.390
are no more than 10% of
the entire population,

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.080
and so I guess we will assume that there's

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.000
at least 1,000 folks in District A

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.980
and at least 1,000 folks in District B

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.190
and that will allow us to meet
the Independence condition.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.570
And so with that out of the way,

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.620
let's assume the null hypothesis,

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.040
and let's just start
thinking about the sampling

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.860
distribution of the difference between

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.390
the sample proportions
assuming that null hypothesis.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.440
So the first thing I wanna think about is

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.290
what is going to be the standard deviation

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.230
of the difference in the
sampling distributions.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.320
Well, we have seen in a previous video

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.840
when we talked about
differences of proportions.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.450
We can think about the variance,

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.723
so the variance of the
sampling distribution.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.300
There's a lot of notation here.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.670
So the variance, this
is going to be equal to

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.980
the variance of the sampling distribution

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.540
of the sample proportion from District A

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.980
plus the variance

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.250
of the sampling distribution

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.260
of the sample proportion from District B.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.160
Now in general, you can
figure out the variance

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.160
of the sampling distribution of a sample

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.310
proportion with the following formula.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.400
We've seen this before.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.640
The variance of the sampling distribution

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.920
of the sample proportion
is going to be equal to our

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.300
true proportion times one
minus our true proportion,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.550
all of that over your sample size.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.730
Now in either situation, we don't know

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.260
the true proportions for
District A or District B.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.760
That's why we are in this,
that's why we're even

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.380
doing this hypothesis test to begin with.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.190
But we can try to estimate it.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.930
Remember, we're assuming that
the true proportions are equal

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.940
even though we might
not know what they are.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.070
And what is going to be our best estimate

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.110
of that true proportion if
we assume that District A

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.950
and District B have no difference in terms

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.440
of the number of people
who support the new law?

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.250
Well the best estimate would actually be

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.500
the combined sample, the combined sample

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.310
proportion right over here.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.740
And so to estimate these values,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.290
we use this combined sample proportion

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.450
in the place of P over here.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.110
So we could say that this is going to be

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.970
our combined sample proportion

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.473
times one minus our
combined sample proportion,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.963
all of that over our sample size.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.880
And since we're assuming
that there's no difference

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.880
between District A and District B,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.983
this would also apply to
that right over there.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.110
So let me rewrite this again,

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.050
the standard deviation of
the sampling distribution

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.900
of the difference of
the sample proportions

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.120
from District A and District
B is going to be roughly.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.160
Remember we weren't able
to calculate it exactly,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.750
but we're using this combined

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.680
proportion as our best estimate.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.860
Let me do a big square root
right over here, a big radical.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.670
And so underneath that, we
are going to have our estimate

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.270
of this, which is 0.55

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.580
times one minus 0.55, so 0.45,

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.910
over 100

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.300
plus our estimate of this,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.760
which is

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.210
0.55.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:51.730
It's the same thing again.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.650
Times 0.45, and remember
that's because we're assuming

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.650
the null hypothesis is true.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.310
All of that over this sample size.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.750
All of that over 100.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.410
And now we can get our calculator out

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.940
to actually calculate it.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.203
And so we get the square root of

00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:14.203
0.55 times 0.45 divided by 100.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.380
Now I could add that whole thing again

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.320
or I could just multiply by two.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.400
So times two is equal to

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.993
approximately 0.07.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.220
So this is going to be

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.720
approximately equal to 0.07,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.687
and now using this, we
can calculate a z-score,

00:06:36.687 --> 00:06:37.880
and then we could think
about, what's the probability

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.010
of getting a z-score that extreme or more.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.170
And so our z-score, or our z-value,

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:47.017
would be equal to the
difference that we got.

00:06:47.017 --> 00:06:51.210
P hat sub A, minus P hat sub B,

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.200
all of that over our estimate of

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.530
the standard deviation of
the sampling distribution

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.560
of the difference between
the sample proportions,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.883
so all of that over 0.07.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.380
Now this up here in
yellow, 0.58 minus 0.52,

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.340
this is going to be equal to 0.06

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.110
over 0.07.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.230
0.07.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.560
We can get our calculator
out for this again,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.450
and so we have

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.500
0.06 divided by 0.07

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.113
is going to be, it's approximately 0.86,

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.400
so this is approximately 0.86.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.740
Now what's the probability of getting

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.160
something this extreme or more extreme?

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.300
Let me just make sure we
can visualize it properly.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.090
So if this is our sampling distribution

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.320
of the difference between
our sample proportions,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.830
and we're assuming the null hypothesis,

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.110
so the mean of our sampling distribution

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:57.010
is going to be zero, is
going to be zero right there,

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.650
we just got a result that is

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.930
less than a standard
deviation above the mean.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.070
So we just got a result.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.110
So this is one standard deviation,

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:06.940
two standard deviations above the mean.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.500
One standard deviation below the mean.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.400
Two standard deviations below the mean.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.950
We just got a result that is,

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.620
that puts us right there,

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.450
and if we asked ourselves,
what's the probability

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.740
of getting result at least that extreme,

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.540
we would say, okay, it would
be, what's the probability

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.710
of getting a result all of
this area right over here,

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.190
and would also be what's this area

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.680
on the other side of the mean.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.620
And we know that this is over 30%

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.670
because even if you just
exclude one standard deviation

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.760
above and below the mean, if
you say anything more extreme

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.890
than that, so if you put
this area and this area,

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.960
you're looking at roughly 31 or 32%.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.660
So the probability of getting something

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.430
at least this extreme
is going to be over 30%,

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.580
and so it's definitely going to be higher

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.340
than our significance level.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.690
It's actually completely reasonable

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.940
to get a difference this extreme

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.190
if we assume the null hypothesis is true.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.320
In future videos, we can go even deeper,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.050
where we can actually just look this up

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.860
on a z-table to calculate
these areas more precisely,

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.140
and we can compare them
to the significance level,

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.810
but here it's not even close.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.280
We're nowhere close to being able to

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.330
reject the null hypothesis.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.980
So to answer the question,
does this suggest

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.860
a significant difference
between the two districts?

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.133
No, no it doesn't.
