00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.570
 

00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.470
We're asked to solve the
right triangle shown below.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.140
Give the lengths to
the nearest tenth.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.920
So when they say solve
the right triangle,

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.810
we can assume that
they're saying,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.680
hey figure out the
lengths of all the sides.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.500
So whatever a is equal to,
whatever b is equal to.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.180
And also what are all the
angles of the right triangle?

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.410
They've given two of them.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.550
We might have to figure out
this third right over here.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.070
So there's multiple
ways to tackle this,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.460
but we'll just try to
tackle side XW first,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.920
try to figure out what a is.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.229
And I'll give you a hint.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.600
You can use a calculator,
and using a calculator,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.540
you can use your
trigonometric functions

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.735
that we've looked
at a good bit now.

00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:40.360
So I'll give you a
few seconds to think

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.629
about how to figure
out what a is.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.090
Well, what do we know?

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.610
We know this angle
y right over here.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.839
We know the side
adjacent to angle y.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.410
And length a, this
is the side that's

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.699
the length of the side that
is opposite to angle Y.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.239
So what trigonometric
ratio deals

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.680
with the opposite
and the adjacent?

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.990
So if we're looking at angle
Y, relative to angle Y,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.910
this is the opposite.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.024
And this right over
here is the adjacent.

00:01:14.024 --> 00:01:16.315
Well if we don't remember,
we can go back to SohCahToa.

00:01:16.315 --> 00:01:21.240
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.660
Sine deals with
opposite and hypotenuse.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.420
Cosine deals with
adjacent and hypotenuse.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.320
Tangent deals with
opposite over adjacent.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.889
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.150
So we can say that the
tangent of 65 degrees,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.250
of that angle of 65 degrees,
is equal to the opposite,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.050
the length of the
opposite side, which

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.750
we know has length a over the
length of the adjacent side,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.170
which they gave us in the
diagram, which has length five.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.010
And you might say,
how do I figure out a?

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.350
Well we can use our
calculator to evaluate

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.734
what the tangent
of 65 degrees are.

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:00.899
And then we can solve for a.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.320
And actually if we just want to
get the expression explicitly

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.960
solving for a, we
could just multiply

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.500
both sides of this
equation times 5.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.930
So let's do that.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.120
5 times, times 5.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.410
These cancel out,
and we are left with,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.230
if we flip the
equal around, we're

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:26.489
left with a is equal to 5 times
the tangent of 65 degrees.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.780
So now we can get our
calculator out and figure out

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.760
what this is to
the nearest tenth.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:41.733
That's my handy TI-85 out and
I have 5 times the tangent--

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:43.900
I didn't need to press that
second right over there,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.890
just a regular
tangent-- of 65 degrees.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.649
And I will get, if I
round to the nearest tenth

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.800
like they ask me to, I get 10.7.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.290
So a is approximately
equal to 10.7.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.730
I say approximately
because I rounded it down.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.519
This is not the exact number.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.870
But a is equal to 10.7.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.070
So we now know that this has
length 10.7, approximately.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.450
There are several ways that
we can try to tackle b.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.290
And I'll let you pick
the way you want to.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.420
But then I'll just do it
the way I would like to.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.890
So my next question
to you is, what

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.829
is the length of the side YW?

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.560
Or what is the value of b?

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.229
 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:35.770
Well there are
several ways to do it.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.860
This is the hypotenuse.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.900
So we could use
trigonometric functions

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.510
that deal with adjacent
over hypotenuse or opposite

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.840
over hypotenuse.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.750
Or we could just use
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.770
We know two sides
of a right triangle.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.320
We can come up with
the third side.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.799
I will go with using
trigonometric ratios

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.280
since that's what we've
been working on a good bit.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.710
So this length of b, that's
the length of the hypotenuse.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.734
So this side WY
is the hypotenuse.

00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:09.400
And so what trigonometric
ratios-- or we

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.691
can decide what we want to use.

00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:12.500
We could use opposite
and hypotenuse.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.660
We could use adjacent
and hypotenuse.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.427
Since we know that
XY is exactly 5

00:04:16.427 --> 00:04:18.510
and we don't have to deal
with this approximation,

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.750
let's use that side.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.250
So what trigonometric
ratios deal

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.850
with adjacent and hypotenuse?

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.670
Well we see from
SohCahToa cosine deals

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.080
with adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.940
So we could say that
the cosine of 65 degrees

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.090
is equal to the length of
the adjacent side, which

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.690
is 5 over the length of
the hypotenuse, which

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.910
has a length of b.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.010
And then we can
try to solve for b.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.120
You multiply both
sides times b, you're

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.910
left with b times cosine of
65 degrees is equal to 5.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.290
And then to solve for b,
you could divide both sides

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.910
by cosine of 65 degrees.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.100
This is just a number here.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.820
So we're just dividing--
we have to figure it

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.570
out what our calculator,
but this is just

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.120
going to evaluate
to some number.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.950
So we can divide both sides by
that, by cosine of 65 degrees.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.680
 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.290
And we're left with
b is equal to 5

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.470
over the cosine of 65 degrees.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.740
So let us now use our calculator
to figure out the length of b.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:35.210
Length of b is 5 divided
by cosine of 65 degrees.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.719
And I get, if I round to
the nearest tenth, 11.8.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.290
So b is approximately equal
to, rounded to the nearest

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.210
tenth, 11.8.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.099
So b is equal to 11.8.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.730
And then we're almost done
solving this right triangle.

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.105
And you could have figured
this out using the Pythagorean

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:57.480
theorem as well, saying that
5 squared plus 10.7 squared

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.750
should be equal to b squared.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.950
And hopefully you would
get the exact same answer.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.616
And the last thing
we have to figure out

00:06:02.616 --> 00:06:07.919
is the measure of angle
W right over here.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.560
So I'll give you a
few seconds to think

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.170
about what the
measure of angle W is.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.910
Well here we just
have to remember

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.500
that the sum of the angles of a
triangle add up to 180 degrees.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.940
So angle w plus 65 degrees,
that's this angle right up

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.420
here, plus the right angle,
this is a right triangle,

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.280
they're going to add
up to 180 degrees.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.371
So all we need to do
is-- well we can simplify

00:06:37.372 --> 00:06:38.830
the left-hand side
right over here.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.539
65 plus 90 is 155.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:48.380
So angle W plus 155 degrees
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.920
And then we get angle W-- if we
subtract 155 from both sides--

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.590
angle W is equal to 25 degrees.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:03.123
And we are done solving the
right triangle shown below.

00:07:03.124 --> 00:07:03.624
