really one of the things I really try to

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360
really one of the things I really try to
 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.860
really one of the things I really try to
do very consciously in the book is to

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:13.870
do very consciously in the book is to
 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.570
do very consciously in the book is to
track a particular evolution of that

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580
track a particular evolution of that
 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.700
track a particular evolution of that
process and part of what I show is that

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710
process and part of what I show is that
 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.790
process and part of what I show is that
even though we had all these asylums in

the 1930s and 40s and 50s where we

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980
the 1930s and 40s and 50s where we
 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.249
the 1930s and 40s and 50s where we
locked away all of these people there

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259
locked away all of these people there
 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.040
locked away all of these people there
was this and often for long periods of

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050
was this and often for long periods of
 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.080
was this and often for long periods of
time but not always there was this

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090
time but not always there was this
 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.299
time but not always there was this
assumption that we were kind of treating

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309
assumption that we were kind of treating
 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.889
assumption that we were kind of treating
people in a certain kind of way that

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899
people in a certain kind of way that
 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.260
people in a certain kind of way that
there was a possible recuperation or

cure obviously didn't happen for a lot
 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.740
cure obviously didn't happen for a lot
of people but you know there was an

of people but you know there was an
 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.270
of people but you know there was an
investment I mean people were being

investment I mean people were being
 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.119
investment I mean people were being
locked away but they were also seen as

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129
locked away but they were also seen as
 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.959
locked away but they were also seen as

they're also threats to the state
 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.210
they're also threats to the state
particularly with schizophrenia you see

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220
particularly with schizophrenia you see
 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.610
particularly with schizophrenia you see
a lot of concern that these people could

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620
a lot of concern that these people could
 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.190
a lot of concern that these people could
escape and kill people or they could

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200
escape and kill people or they could
 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.290
escape and kill people or they could
threaten our political order and

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300
threaten our political order and
 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.960
threaten our political order and
particularly in the 1960s when

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970
particularly in the 1960s when
 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.760
particularly in the 1960s when
schizophrenia becomes linked to civil

schizophrenia becomes linked to civil
 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.150
schizophrenia becomes linked to civil
rights protests it's also schizophrenia

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160
rights protests it's also schizophrenia
 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.690
rights protests it's also schizophrenia
can bring down the state in a very you

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700
can bring down the state in a very you
 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.830
can bring down the state in a very you
know if this has happened in other

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840
know if this has happened in other
 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.600
know if this has happened in other
country so it's not surprising but we

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610
country so it's not surprising but we
 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.740
country so it's not surprising but we
don't often think about that in the

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750
don't often think about that in the
 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.680
don't often think about that in the
United States but I think part of why

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690
United States but I think part of why
 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.610
United States but I think part of why
schizophrenia got linked to civil rights

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620
schizophrenia got linked to civil rights
 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.900
schizophrenia got linked to civil rights
protests in the 60s was because

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910
protests in the 60s was because
 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.670
protests in the 60s was because
mainstream society was coding threats

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680

mainstream society was coding threats
against the smooth running of the state

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040
against the smooth running of the state
 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.570
against the smooth running of the state
as insanity and treating it as such and

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580
as insanity and treating it as such and
 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.080
as insanity and treating it as such and
so as that happens you see the evolution

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090
so as that happens you see the evolution
 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.030
so as that happens you see the evolution
of a process in which people with

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040
of a process in which people with
 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.460
of a process in which people with
schizophrenia are increasingly feared

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470
schizophrenia are increasingly feared
 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.170
schizophrenia are increasingly feared
and our hospitals particularly the kind

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180
and our hospitals particularly the kind
 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.690
and our hospitals particularly the kind
of hospital that I look at in the book

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700
of hospital that I look at in the book
 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700
of hospital that I look at in the book
become to look more and more like like

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710
become to look more and more like like

including the one I talked about

including the one I talked about
 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.490
including the one I talked about
actually become prisons and that's

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500
actually become prisons and that's
 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.930
actually become prisons and that's
something that didn't just happen near

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940
something that didn't just happen near

institution and it's something that
 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.000
institution and it's something that
happened across the country and that

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010
happened across the country and that
 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.460
happened across the country and that
happened obviously for many reasons but

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470
happened obviously for many reasons but
 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.289
happened obviously for many reasons but
part of it is this transformation in

part of it is this transformation in
 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.320
part of it is this transformation in

which prisons became our de facto mental
hospitals and we saw mental illness as

hospitals and we saw mental illness as
 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.800
hospitals and we saw mental illness as

in some way threatening not just to the

in some way threatening not just to the
people who suffered from it but also to
