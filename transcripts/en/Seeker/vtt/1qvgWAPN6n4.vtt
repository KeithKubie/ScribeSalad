00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.610
There's an old Viking saying, "A family that
pillages together, villages together."

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:11.829
I couldn't think of anything better that rhymed
with 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:15.730
"pillages."

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.590
Vikings were a fantastic seafaring people
from Northern Europe who landed in North America

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.070
1000 years ago.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.449
We know they did because of archeology, a
science not often covered on DNews, sadly.

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:32.140
In the 60s, a theory was presented that Vikings
landed in Canada in 1000 CE, and in 2002 the

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.190
finding was confirmed when they found a Viking
longhouse in Newfoundland.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.770
Once they identified the structure, the claim
that Cristobal Colon â€¦ a.k.a, Columbus,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.810
was the first from Europe to show up here
was debunked.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:45.810
Thanks, science!

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.870
Now, new research shows they didn't come alone,
either.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.730
According to research in The Royal Society
Philosophical Transactions B, DNA evidence

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.250
shows the gentleman Vikings brought lady Vikings
with them!

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.460
Not necessarily to the New World, but during
their conquests, at least!

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.220
Previously, research held that Viking women
stayed home, while the men headed out to sea

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.159
to establish colonies, pillage and plunder
around the North of Europe; and then later

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.320
they'd move over too, but thanks to DNA, now
we know better.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.070
The researchers from the University of Oslo
took the mitochondrial DNA of 45 Norwegian

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.159
skeletons from 769 and 1066 CE.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.401
Mitochondrial DNA is ONLY passed via the mother,
because it comes from the cytoplasm of the

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:30.401
egg cells.

00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:35.979
They compared this DNA to previously analyzed
DNA of ancient Icelanders -- Norway is 914mi

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.400
(1,472km) from Iceland, btw -- so this is
a pretty good distance.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.460
They THEN compared the DNA of those two groups
to 5,000 modern people from Scotland and their

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.460
northern islands, England, France, Germany,
Sweden and, of course, Norway!

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.210
What they found was the mitochondrial DNA
was too similar to be a coincidence.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.539
Viking women would have have been taken along
with the men as they spread along the coast,

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.250
colonizing and pillaging as a big happy family.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.799
All this is fine and dandy, but before you
start picturing people who look like they

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.390
came from the Iron Islands in Game of Thrones,
MORE research in the journal Viking Archaeology

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.030
found Vikings were not defined as dirty, brutal,
cruel, people.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.410
They were settlers and explorers, sending
their ships across the curve of the horizon

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.750
to spread their culture.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.440
Instead of pillaging, this new research showed
Longhouses were built to help integrate the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.940
culture of their new land into their own.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.940
The research excavated longhouses dating from
900 CE and discovered the vikings wielded

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.070
politics, diplomacy and public relations to
show their wealth and power -- not just their

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.070
swords.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.400
According to the author of "The Vikings" which
was published in 2010, these conquerors weren't

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.530
ONLY pirating seafarers (they were a bit),
but were also politicians, explorers, navigators

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.530
and craftsmen.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.630
Now we know they were family oriented too,
and not unlike NASA these were the people

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.920
probing the mysteries of the farthest reaches
of their world.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.480
No wonder we're still fascinated by them today!

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.800
What do you think of Vikings?

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.030
Are they cool?

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.610
More into Conquistadors?

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.610
Byzantines?

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.610
Ancient India?

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.080
Get historical...
