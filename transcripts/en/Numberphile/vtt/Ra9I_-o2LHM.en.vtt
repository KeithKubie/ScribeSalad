00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
Another interesting presentation of the Borromean link is this.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.100
I have brought here two loops, blue and pink.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.980
And I'll hold them up through my fingers like so.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.980
There are three loops here. At the bottom, the blue loop.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.340
In the middle, the pink loop.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.660
And at the top, the loop consisting of my fingers, the index finger and thumb, like so.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.600
One, two, and three.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.320
Now, it seems very intuitive that the blue and my finger loops are not linked at all.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.040
I mean, they are far apart in space.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.260
In contrast, the blue and pink are linked, and the pink and my fingers are linked.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.640
But then I grab this part and pull...

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.320
And they exchange places! Huh?

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.020
This time, the blue, which seemed unlinked to my fingers, is linked to my fingers,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.800
but the pink, which used to be on my fingers, is now the other way, at the bottom.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.480
And the pink and blue are still linked.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.420
And I can keep doing this. I just grab this part and pull, and they exchange places.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.840
They exchange places. This is very meditative, and it's kind of Zen.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.300
You can keep doing this and they keep exchanging places.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:28.980

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.040
Now, this is a Borromean link, in the sense that these are three loops that are, of course, stuck together.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.880
You can't take them apart, as you can see.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.900
But if you make any of the three loops disappear, the other two can fly apart.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.040
Indeed, if I release my fingers, well, of course these two can be pulled apart.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.300
Next, if you imagine that pink has disappeared, well, blue and my fingers are far apart, so they are unlinked.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.240
And finally, if I remove the blue,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.020
you can see that had it not been for the blue, I could pull the pink one off my fingers.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.220
So any two of these loops are mutually unlinked, but three together are linked, and that is a Borromean link.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.600
And this is some operation on the Borromean link which exchanges two of the loops

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.980
while keeping the third one fixed.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.860
