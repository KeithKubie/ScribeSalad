00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:07.399
The following trailer is rated 'S' for spoilers.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.340
Based on the book everyone's mom read on the
beach comes the best-acted, coolest-looking,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.599
most well-written Lifetime movie ever made:

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.179
Gone Girl.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.779
Meet Nick and Amy, two successful good-looking
people in love.

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.390
She's the basis for a beloved series of children's
books

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.510
"Your wife is Amazing Amy?!"

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.230
and he's a caring son who moves to Missouri
to take care of his sick mother.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.040
They seem like they're the perfect couple,
but there's just one problem:

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.230
she's batsh*t f***ing crazy.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.980
Settle in for the film that had audiences
everywhere wondering if their significant

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.710
other was planning to kill them,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.830
in this cold-hearted look at how all men are
pigs or how all women are monsters.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:58.970
Or both?

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.600
Either way, you probably shouldn't see it
on the first date.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.730
"I picture cracking her lovely skull, unspooling
her brains."

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.520
Ben Affleck stars as a guy everyone loves
to hate.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.000
"You look like human sh*t."

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.100
"You're a f***ing coward."

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.220
"You f***ing idiot."

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.820
"Asshole."

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.000
"F***ing asshole!"

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.740
When his wife Amy disappears, he'll respond
by acting as guilty as humanly possible

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.090
"You filed the paperwork!"

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.020
"Because she told me to!"

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.000
and banging the hot chick from the Blurred
Lines video.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.159
Mmmm, blurred bewwwwbs.

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.500
Rosamund Pike shines as the most well-organized
crazy person ever,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.760
a murderer who's sick and tired of acting
cool just to please a man

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.060
even though, unlike the book, we never see
her do anything cool.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.680
Ever.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.270
"All we did was resent each other and try
to control each other."

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.799
"That's marriage."

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.780
Follow along as she escapes her cheating husband
by

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.780
creating fake money troubles,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.220
befriending the local pregnant idiot so she
can steal her pee to fake a pregnancy,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.140
staging a crime scene with gallons of her
own blood,

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.269
creating a five year diary of fake abuse stories,

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.469
then planning to kill herself so she can frame
him for her murder...

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.670
instead of, I don't know, divorcing him?

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.329
Seems a lot easier to me!

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.260
Experience the film critics are still debating
for being either pro- or anti-feminist

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.209
even though its message boils down to:

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.129
don't have sex with crazy people,

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.349
a lesson that Neil Patrick Harris clearly
didn't pay attention to.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.609
"A girl is allowed to be crazy as long as
she is equally hot. You want a girl to be

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.459
above this line."

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.400
Oops.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.870
Witness director David Fincher at the height
of his powers,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.799
as he reveals each twist and turn with his
trademark futurisms, like

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.029
smooth camera pans,

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:50.480
a cool color palette,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.700
a dank abandoned building,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.629
nihilism,

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.290
"Life: I don't remember the point."

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.180
sociopaths,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.959
low-lit interiors,

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.959
ambient music,

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.319
haze,

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.980
and general f***ed-upedness.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.240
Wait, is she putting that in her...

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:11.499
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:13.549
Man, this movie is messed up!

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.650
So, settle in for a nearly three hour movie

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.299
that will keep you on the edge of your seat,

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.159
full of manipulations,

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.999
murder,

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:22.989
and deceit,

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.900
until Ben Affleck finally gets his revenge
by...

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.079
staying with her to start a family?

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.939
"You want to stay with her."

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.880
What?! Why would he do that?

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:34.230
Run, dude!

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.949
And... is that his dick?!

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.389
What is happening?

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.370
Man, this ending is weird.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.640
Starring...

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.940
Adnan Syed,

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.760
Chasing Amy,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.299
Madea Good Movie For Once,

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.049
Safesearch Off,

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.689
Doogie Housed Her,

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.430
Nancy Grace,

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.519
and Still Almost Famous.

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.479
Your Wife Probably Wants To Kill You.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.120
"I swear, you two are the most f***ed up people
I've ever known."

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.260
This movie really could've used more Tyler
Perry.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.160
Ugh, did I really just say that?
