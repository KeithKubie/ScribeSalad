00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.330
Let's try to learn a thing
or two about ratios.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.290
So ratios are just expressions
that compare quantities.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.850
So that might just be a fancy
way-- let me just --of saying

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.800
something that you may
or may not understand.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.060
So let me give you
actual examples.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:21.170
If I have 10 horses
and I have 5 dogs.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.880
And someone were to come to
me and say Sal, what is the

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:36.670
ratio is of horses to dogs?

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.010
So I want to know how many
horses do I have for

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.430
some number of dogs.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.910
So I could say I have 10
horses for every 5 dogs.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.470
So I could say the ratio of
horses to dogs is 10:5.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.320
Or I could also write
that as a fraction.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.730
I could say the ratio of
horses to dogs is 10/5.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.370
Or I could just write it out.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.910
I could say it is 10 to 5.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.080
These all are saying
the same thing.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.610
And the thing I write first,
or the thing that I write on

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.620
top, is the number of horses.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.800
So this is the number
of horses right there.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.000
That's the number of horses.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.230
And that's all the
number of horses.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.860
If I wanted to talk about the
number of dogs, this is the

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.620
number of dogs, that's the
number of dogs, or that's

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.430
the number of dogs.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.720
I'm just-- These are all
just expressions that are

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.140
comparing two quantities.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.600
Now, I just said I have 10
horses for every 5 dogs.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.740
But what does that mean?

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.320
That means I have 5
horses for every 1 dog.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.770
Sorry.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.400
Not 5 horses for every 1 dog.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.110
It means I have 2 horses
for every 1 dog, right?

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.370
If for 5 dogs I have 10, that
means that for every 1 of these

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.240
dogs, there are 2 horses.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.660
For every one of-- every 2 of
these horses, there's 1 dog.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.490
I just kind of reasoned
through that.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.820
So this is-- I have 2
horses for every 1 dog.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.030
But how do you get there?

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.460
How do you get
from 10:5 to 2:1?

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.830
Well you can think of what's
the biggest number that divides

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.080
into both of these numbers?

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.890
What's their greatest
common divisor?

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.320
I have a whole video on that.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.460
The biggest number that divides
into both of these guys is 5.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.190
So you divide both of them by 5
and you can kind of get this

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.210
ratio into a reduced form.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.130
And if I write it here, it
would be the same thing

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.090
as 2/1 or 2 to 1.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.590
And so what's interesting about
ratios, it isn't literally, or

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.130
doesn't always have to be
literally, the number of horses

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.180
and the numbers of
dogs you have.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.420
What a ratio tells you
is how many horses do

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.570
I have for every dog.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.650
Or how many dogs do I
have for every horse.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.500
Now, just to make things clear,
what if someone asked me what

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.335
is the ratio of dogs to horses?

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.100
So what's the difference
in these two statements?

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.070
Here I said horses to dogs.

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.920
Here I'm saying dogs to horses.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.520
So, since I've switched the
ratio-- What I'm looking for--

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.160
I'm looking for the ratio
of dogs to horses, I

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.960
switch the numbers.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.090
So dogs-- For every 5
dogs, I have 10 horses.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.260
Or if I divide both of
these by 5, for every 1

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.840
dog, I have 5 horses.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.100
So the ratio of dogs to
horses is 5:10 or 1:5.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.080
Or you could write it this way.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.840
1 to-- I can write it-- Let
me write it down here.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.280
1/5.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.750
Or I could write 1 to 5.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.180
And the general convention--
This wouldn't be

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.170
necessarily incorrect.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.280
That's not wrong.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.230
But the general convention is
to get your ratio or your

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.520
fraction, if you want to call
it that, into the simplest

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.360
form or into this reduced
form right there.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.890
Let's just do a couple
of other examples.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.385
Let's say I have 20 apples.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.205
Let's say I have 40 oranges.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:20.505
And let's say that I
have 60 strawberries.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.760
Now what is the ratio of apples
to oranges to strawberries?

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.900
I could write it like this.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.920
I could write what is the ratio
of-- I'll write it like this

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.305
--apples:oranges:strawberries?

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.530
Well I can start off by
literally saying, well for 60

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.820
strawberries-- for every 60
strawberries, I have 40

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.520
oranges and I have 20 apples.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.500
And this would be legitimate.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.620
You could say the ratio
of apples to oranges to

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.190
strawberries are 20:40-- Sorry.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.720
20:40:60.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.960
And that wouldn't be wrong.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.710
But we saw before, we could
put into reduced form.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.450
So we think of what's the
largest number that divides

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.550
into all three of these?

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.050
We can't just do it into two of
these now because now my ratio

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.190
has three actual quantities.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.150
Well the largest number
that divides into all

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.970
of these guys is 20.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.170
If we divide all of them by 20,
we can then say for every 1

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.620
apple, I now have-- you divide
this guy by 20 --I have 2

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.740
oranges, and I have
3 strawberries.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.760
So the ratio of
apples to oranges to

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.660
strawberries is 1:2:3.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.200
And I got that, in every
case, by just dividing

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.580
these guys all by 20.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.760
I divided by 20.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.170
I think you get
the general idea.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.660
If someone were to ask you
what's the ratio of-- Let me

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.870
just write it down because it
never hurts to have a little

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.270
bit more clarification.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.920
If someone wanted to know
the ratio of strawberries

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.010
to oranges-- Let me get
into my orange color.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.685
Strawberries to
oranges to apples.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.980
I thought I was going
to do that in yellow.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.900
To apples.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.580
What is this ratio going to be?

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:29.100
Well for every 3 strawberries,
I have 2 oranges

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.580
and I have 1 apple.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.070
So then it would be 3:2:1.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.790
The general idea is whatever
order someone asks you for the

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.430
different items, you put-- the
ratio is going to be in

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.330
that same exact order.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.370
Now, in all of the examples so
far I gave you the number of

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.690
quantity-- the quantity of
things we had and I-- we

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.170
figured out the ratio.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.810
What if it went the other way?

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.470
What if I told you a ratio?

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:07.920
What if I said the ratio of
boys to girls in a classroom

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.920
is-- Let's say the ratio
of boys to girls is 2/3.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.190
Which I could've also written
as 2:3 just like that.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.360
So for every 2 boys, I have
3 girls or for every 3

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.200
girls, I have 2 boys.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:34.253
And let's say that there are
40 students in the classroom.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.430
And then someone were to ask
you how many girls are there?

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:50.320
How many girls are
in the classroom?

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.320
So this seems a little
bit more convoluted than

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.210
what we did before.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.550
We know the total number of
students and we know the ratio.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.080
But how many girls
are in the room?

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.390
So let's think
about it this way.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.876
The fact that the ratio
of boys to girls-- I'll

00:08:01.876 --> 00:08:02.900
write it like this.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.510
Boys-- Maybe I'll be
stereotypical with the colors.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:14.490
The ratio of boys to
girls is equal to 2:3.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.020
Hate to be so stereotypical,
but it doesn't hurt.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.120
2:3.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.860
The ratio of boys
to girls is 2:3.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.850
So this stands for every
3 girls, there's 2 boys.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.345
For every 2 boys,
there's 3 girls.

00:08:25.345 --> 00:08:27.080
But what does it also say?

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:39.490
It also says for every 5
students, there are what?

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.315
There are 2 boys and 3 girls.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.550
Now why is this
statement helpful?

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.540
Well how many groups of
5 students do I have?

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:01.240
I have 40 students in my
class right there, right?

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.250
I have 40 students in my class.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.720
And for every 5 students,
there are 2 boys and 3 girls.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.320
So how many groups of
5 students do I have?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.920
So I have a total
of 40 students.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.490
Let me do it in
this purple color.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:24.030
I have 40 students and then
there are 5 students per group.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.510
And I figured out that group
just by looking at the ratio.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.130
For every 5 students, I
have 2 boys and 3 girls.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.390
How many groups of 5
students do I have?

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:43.285
So that means that I have 8
groups-- 40 divided by 5 --I

00:09:43.285 --> 00:09:48.105
have 8 groups of 5 students.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.260
Now we're wondering how
many girls there are.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.835
So each group is going
to have 3 girls.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.610
So how many girls do I have?

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.950
I have 8 groups, each
of them have 3 girls.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:17.770
So I have 8 groups times 3
girls per group is equal to

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:22.960
24 girls in the classroom.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.080
And you could do the same
exercise with boys.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.120
How many boys are there?

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.600
There's a couple of
ways you could do it.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.530
You could say for every
group, there are 2 boys.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:31.300
There's 8 groups.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.780
There's 16 boys.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.860
Or you could say
there's 40 students.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.560
24 of them are girls.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.350
40 minus 24 is 16.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.860
So either way you
get to 16 boys.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.760
And if you want to pick
up a fast way to do it.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.670
It would be identical.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.940
You'd say look, 2 plus 3 is 5.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.090
For every 5 students,
2 boys, 3 girls.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:53.360
How many groups are there?

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.200
You say 40 divided by 5
is equal to 8 groups.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.080
Every group has 3 girls.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.680
So you do 8 times 3 is
equal to 24 girls.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.130
Let's do one that's a little
bit harder than that.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:16.800
Let's do one where I say that
the ratio of let's say--

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:21.150
Well let's go back
to the farm example.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.930
The ratio of sheep--
I'll do sheep in white.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:35.980
The ratio of sheep to--
I don't know --chickens

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.350
to-- I don't know.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:38.960
What's another farm animal?

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.920
--to pigs.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.510
The ratio of sheep to chicken
to pigs-- Maybe I should just

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.560
say chicken right there.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.830
The ratio of sheep to chicken
to pigs-- Or chickens.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.390
I should say chickens.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:12:02.130
Is-- Let's say the
ratio is 2:5:10.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.990
And notice, I can't
reduce this anymore.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.470
There's no number that
divides into all of these.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:10.110
So this is the ratio if
sheep to chickens to pigs.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.880
And let's say that I have
a total of 51 animals.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.230
And I want to know how
many chickens do I have.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.490
Well we do the same idea.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:38.400
For every 2 sheep, I have 5
chickens and I have 10 pigs.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:48.770
That tells me for every 17
animals-- So every group of

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.350
17 animals, what do I have?

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:52.730
And where did I get 17 from?

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.590
I just added 2 plus 5 plus 10.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.370
For every 17 animals,
I'm going to have-- Let

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.010
me pick a new color.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:12.330
I'm going to have 2 sheep,
5 chickens, and 10 pigs.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:16.290
Now, how many groups of
17 animals do I have?

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:18.600
I have a total of 51 animals.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.820
So if there's 17 animals per
group, 51 animals divided

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.840
by 17 animals per group.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:30.470
I have 3 groups of 17 animals.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.140
Now I want to know
how many chickens.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.960
Every group has 5 chickens.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.020
We already know that.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.630
And I have 3 groups.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.560
So I have 3 groups.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.970
Every group has 5 chickens.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:49.110
So I'm going to have 3
times 5 chickens, which

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:52.085
is equal to 15 chickens.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:55.800
Not too bad.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.660
All I did is add these up and
say for every 17 animals,

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.120
I've got 5 chickens.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.270
I've got 3 groups of 17.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.260
So for each of those
groups, I have 5 chickens.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.540
3 times 5 is 15 chicken.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.380
You could use the same process
to figure out the number sheep

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.630
or pigs you might have.
