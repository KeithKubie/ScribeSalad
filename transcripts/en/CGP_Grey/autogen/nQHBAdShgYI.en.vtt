00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 In Star Trek, Vector Dimensions takes you from one place to another, saving fuel (and the budget of special effects). 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.160
 In the universe, it is a "safe way to travel." 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.440
 Yes, sometimes, two people die horribly in rare circumstances ... 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.540
 ... but trillions of people move to work every morning without problems. 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.800
 But, what if the dimension carrier is not as safe as ... 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.299
 ... What if the mortality rate does not indicate almost anything, but one hundred percent ... 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.100
 Because the vector is a box for suicide. 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.260
 First, how does the vector work? 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.120
 There is technical evidence, with pages and pages of tedious details ... 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.220
 That says very little. 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.980
 Star Trek considered nothing if it was not constantly inconsistent, however, with the most common elements: 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.280
 First, the dimension vector scans completely down to the smallest material, takes away the atoms and sends your pieces to the destination for reassembly. 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.980
 But, is it you on the other end? Or a version that you think it? 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.700
 okay, who are you ? 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.500
 This is a big question, but let's try to be good scientists on this subject: 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.840
 ... We do not assume that there is a magic part within you that can not be measured. 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.319
 After all, if it can not be measured, it means by definition that it can not affect anything. 

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:11.179
 Away from the hypotheses let's take you as they are: a set of atoms arranged in the thought that they are you. 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.500
 Because the order of the atoms in the post-transport you is exactly the same as the pre-transport ... 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.700
 You must be. The case was closed. 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.300
 But ... maybe you still have this annoying feeling that your experience in the vector will be ... 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.380
 ... funny voice, bright light - then the eternal nothingness .. 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.320
 ... while on the planet, a new life, with all your memories until the moment before your death 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.860
 ... came into being I assumed it was you ... 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.179
 How else? 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.160
 Live life as short as task ... 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.920
 ... and a new creature with memories of you returning to the ship. 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.220
 If true, multiply these by all life forms in all ships in all planets ... 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.560
 ... This technology is a silent holocaust ... 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.140
 ... which makes watching the episode of "Star Trek" a bleak watch. 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.980
 And it's a simple mercy when a crew member takes a rapid elevator instead of a transmission 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.480
 But again, the measurements are correct and maybe we are just confused, and we are already late to spend a holiday on a beautiful planet. 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.400
 But regrouping is an optimistic version and can not be the way the vector really works ... 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.320
 ... because sometimes accidents combine two crew members into one - or split one into two. 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.500
 There are not enough atoms you have to make you again, so it's a vector that converts atoms into energy and energy into atoms. 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.620
 You are destroyed, used to charge the battery, then create it again. 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.959
 This really sounds like death. 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.260
 But the philosophers in the room &lt;i&gt; are anxious &lt;/ i&gt; to talk about the "Tessius" now - well. 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.920
 Take this ship in an adventure. When some parts become damaged, you can replace them all until eventually there are no original parts. 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.440
 When you return, is the "ship of Thessius" still the same ship "Thessius" in which sailed? 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:52.600
 It seems so - this is what your body does daily by eating (bringing in new atoms) and taking out (loss of atoms). 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.640
 Compare with "Katy Sark", a British ship that was burnt and restored with new parts. 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.940
 Are you still the same as "Katy Sark"? 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.720
 The result is the same: all new parts - only the time it took is different. 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.720
 If you are happy with the philosophy of "Thessius Ship" through life (as you do previously), ... 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.640
 If it happens to you as it happened to "Katy Sark" by the vector it should not matter. Yeah...? 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.959
 But ... go into a conveyor belt with an assembly of idle atoms - and death will come to an end: 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.200
 ... before the transfer and after the transfer you can differ on who is you. 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.280
 And when Scottie (you're pre-transport) says to you, "Sorry, there's an error in the atoms complex, give me a minute to fix it," you will not wait. 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.520
 That the copy of you arrived at the destination is not a good thing. 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.900
 The vector should be a suicidal box. 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.120
 Well, why worry about the physics implications of the imaginative technology? 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.980
 Because the vector of dimensions points us to the problem of consciousness. 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.760
 We were quick to muddle the idea of ​​non-measurable before - because everything we can measure from a copy is identical ... 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.620
 ... but there is something completely different. 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:04.579
 The dimension vector forces us to face the possibility that there is something about being a living creature that can not be measured from the outside 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.380
 Do we not contain minds conscious of ourselves, how do we know that the rest of minds are conscious? 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.880
 Truth be told, only you can really know that you are conscious ... 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.519
 - It seems polite to give other people the benefit of doubt. 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.880
 But it was a computer because he pretended to be conscious, how would you know? 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.380
 You have a constant stream of awareness is your life. 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.880
 You are the only one who can feel it, who can know if it exists and if it continues. 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.200
 The dimension vector is scary because it causes a break in consciousness. 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.140
 Make a copy that lives the life that you have left, without anyone knowing. 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.200
 And with no one to know. 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.340
 Although the vector dimensions are not real, but the breaks in consciousness are. 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.140
 If you go for surgery, when you are under anesthesia, you can not be sure if you are the one who woke up. 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.120
 For this matter, your bed may be a suicide machine. 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.400
 Every night you go into a state of loss of consciousness, welcomes the reaper of souls ... 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.500
 ... Every morning, the first and only day of the life of the consciousness of a new creature. 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.520
 It is impossible to know. 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.880
 Sleep well tonight. 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.560
 still here? 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.700
 You can not stay awake forever.
