00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.330
One track you might want to take in
this course is a track on research.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.500
Research is contributing to
human's broader understanding of

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.340
some phenomenon.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.370
Or in this class, contributing to our
understanding of education and learning.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.560
For example, you might want to
investigate how a particular tool

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.800
changes the learning process.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.070
Or maybe you want to investigate how
different demographics or backgrounds

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.410
change a person's perceptions of
an online program like this one.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.170
But research is very much it's own
language, it's own community and

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.215
in order to participate in research,
there's a lot you need to understand.

00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:32.409
This is going to be a kind of a crash
course in everything you need to do

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.450
research, at least at
the level we're looking at.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.250
We'll talk about some of
the vocabulary of research.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.610
We'll talk about validity and
reliability and

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.500
some of the things you need to
be aware of during research.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.940
And especially, we'll talk about
different research designs.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.850
How to set up an experiment or
set up some research that

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.536
will actually answer the questions
that you want to answer.
