want to remind everybody what the show
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.359
want to remind everybody what the show
is all about so on Android design in

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369
is all about so on Android design in
 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.310
is all about so on Android design in
action we take a look at apps that have

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320
action we take a look at apps that have
 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.990
action we take a look at apps that have
been previously reviewed on the App

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
been previously reviewed on the App
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.390
been previously reviewed on the App
clinic which is on Fridays and we take a

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400
clinic which is on Fridays and we take a
 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.970
clinic which is on Fridays and we take a
look at how we can improve some of the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
look at how we can improve some of the
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.920
look at how we can improve some of the
screens some of the visual designs in

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
screens some of the visual designs in
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.950
screens some of the visual designs in
the screens of those abs and then more

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960
the screens of those abs and then more
 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.410
the screens of those abs and then more
recently we've been diving into specific

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
recently we've been diving into specific
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.060
recently we've been diving into specific
topics for example a few weeks ago we

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070
topics for example a few weeks ago we
 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.209
topics for example a few weeks ago we
did responsive design meaning designing

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219
did responsive design meaning designing
 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.490
did responsive design meaning designing
for tablets and phones and basically any

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500
for tablets and phones and basically any
 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.160
for tablets and phones and basically any
any of any screen size on a spectrum of

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170
any of any screen size on a spectrum of
 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.610
any of any screen size on a spectrum of
devices and today like I said we're

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
devices and today like I said we're
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.840
devices and today like I said we're
going to be talking about the contextual

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850
going to be talking about the contextual
 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.760
going to be talking about the contextual
action bar so let's jump in with the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770
action bar so let's jump in with the
 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.380
action bar so let's jump in with the
very first step that will look at which

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390
very first step that will look at which
 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.020
very first step that will look at which
was done last week we reviewed last week

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
was done last week we reviewed last week
 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.990
was done last week we reviewed last week
on the App clinic and that app is

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000
on the App clinic and that app is
 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.080
on the App clinic and that app is
grocery IQ so Before we jump into the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090
grocery IQ so Before we jump into the
 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.760
grocery IQ so Before we jump into the
redesign let's talk about what this app

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770
redesign let's talk about what this app
 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.460
redesign let's talk about what this app
does and so this app basically lets you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
does and so this app basically lets you
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.039
does and so this app basically lets you
manage a number of different lists or

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
manage a number of different lists or
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.859
manage a number of different lists or
shopping lists so let's say you have you

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869
shopping lists so let's say you have you
 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.749
shopping lists so let's say you have you
know a favorite bakery nearby or

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759
know a favorite bakery nearby or
 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.780
know a favorite bakery nearby or
favorite supermarket nearby and you know

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790
favorite supermarket nearby and you know
 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.880
favorite supermarket nearby and you know
that they sell certain products so we

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890
that they sell certain products so we
 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.080
that they sell certain products so we
can do is you can actually create a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
can do is you can actually create a
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.530
can do is you can actually create a
shopping list and create or add items to

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
shopping list and create or add items to
 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.080
shopping list and create or add items to
your list that are broken up by the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090
your list that are broken up by the
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.030
your list that are broken up by the
different stores in which you would buy

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
different stores in which you would buy
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.120
different stores in which you would buy
them so the bakery may have breads and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
them so the bakery may have breads and
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.370
them so the bakery may have breads and
cereals and things like that and the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380
cereals and things like that and the
 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.899
cereals and things like that and the
grocery store supermarket may have other

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909
grocery store supermarket may have other
 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.300
grocery store supermarket may have other
things so one of the key differences

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
things so one of the key differences
 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.399
things so one of the key differences
between this app and other shopping list

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
between this app and other shopping list
 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.469
between this app and other shopping list
apps is the ability to kind of break

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
apps is the ability to kind of break
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.830
apps is the ability to kind of break
things up in that way also it lets you

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
things up in that way also it lets you
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.539
things up in that way also it lets you
let's just zoom into the screens here it

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
let's just zoom into the screens here it
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.060
let's just zoom into the screens here it
lets you look at some coupons for

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070
lets you look at some coupons for
 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.039
lets you look at some coupons for
different I guess for different products

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
different I guess for different products
 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.109
different I guess for different products
that you may want to buy may be

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119
that you may want to buy may be
 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.260
that you may want to buy may be
contextually relevant or not it lets you

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270
contextually relevant or not it lets you
 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.690
contextually relevant or not it lets you
store favorites lets you do a lot of

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700
store favorites lets you do a lot of
 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.389
store favorites lets you do a lot of
different

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399
different
 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.130
different
things so it's basically a shopping list

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140
things so it's basically a shopping list
 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.830
things so it's basically a shopping list
that lets you kind of neatly categorize

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840
that lets you kind of neatly categorize
 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.530
that lets you kind of neatly categorize
your different items and lets you also

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540
your different items and lets you also
 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.449
your different items and lets you also
look at coupons as well Before we jump

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459
look at coupons as well Before we jump
 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.309
look at coupons as well Before we jump
in have you guys used this app at all or

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319
in have you guys used this app at all or
 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.770
in have you guys used this app at all or
give any other thoughts on on the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780
give any other thoughts on on the
 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.869
give any other thoughts on on the
initial initial background on the scent

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879
initial initial background on the scent
 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.990
initial initial background on the scent
nope no not really actually um I did try

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000
nope no not really actually um I did try
 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.649
nope no not really actually um I did try
it a little while back and unfortunately

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659
it a little while back and unfortunately
 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.630
it a little while back and unfortunately
for me when I see the design looked kind

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640
for me when I see the design looked kind
 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.789
for me when I see the design looked kind
of dated like this I usually go and just

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799
of dated like this I usually go and just
 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.170
of dated like this I usually go and just
sort of uninstall it immediately so I

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180
sort of uninstall it immediately so I
 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.640
sort of uninstall it immediately so I
didn't get to sort of try it out too

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650
didn't get to sort of try it out too
 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.559
didn't get to sort of try it out too
much unfortunately yeah in this app is

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569
much unfortunately yeah in this app is
 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.899
much unfortunately yeah in this app is
to be fair I mean like it's it's using

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909
to be fair I mean like it's it's using
 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.789
to be fair I mean like it's it's using
some of the older patterns some of the

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799
some of the older patterns some of the
 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.140
some of the older patterns some of the
gingerbread styling with the tabs

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150
gingerbread styling with the tabs
 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.390
gingerbread styling with the tabs
actually you know about a year or so ago

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400
actually you know about a year or so ago
 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.149
actually you know about a year or so ago
they'd probably or maybe two years ago

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159
they'd probably or maybe two years ago
 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.520
they'd probably or maybe two years ago
those would be perfectly normal tabs and

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530
those would be perfectly normal tabs and
 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.110
those would be perfectly normal tabs and
they're actually using the correct

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120
they're actually using the correct
 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.539
they're actually using the correct
guidelines for the for the icons and so

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549
guidelines for the for the icons and so
 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.119
guidelines for the for the icons and so
on and so forth for tabs but it's really

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129
on and so forth for tabs but it's really
 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.770
on and so forth for tabs but it's really
just kind of dating that's exactly how I

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780
just kind of dating that's exactly how I
 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.910
just kind of dating that's exactly how I
put it and of course the the menu button

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920
put it and of course the the menu button
 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.869
put it and of course the the menu button
yeah I don't know Shane down the bona

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879
yeah I don't know Shane down the bona
 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.309
yeah I don't know Shane down the bona
that the other the guys from the app

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319
that the other the guys from the app
 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.470
that the other the guys from the app
clinic mentioned as well yeah the legacy

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480
clinic mentioned as well yeah the legacy
 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.369
clinic mentioned as well yeah the legacy
menu button is something that should

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379
menu button is something that should
 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.110
menu button is something that should
really just go away and we have we have

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120
really just go away and we have we have
 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.839
really just go away and we have we have
a solution for that anyway but yeah and

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849
a solution for that anyway but yeah and
 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:20.009
a solution for that anyway but yeah and
the other the other issue here is that

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019
the other the other issue here is that
 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.839
the other the other issue here is that
it's using some of the kind of the

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849
it's using some of the kind of the
 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.520
it's using some of the kind of the
gradients that you'd find on other

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530
gradients that you'd find on other
 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.039
gradients that you'd find on other
platforms kind of those stark gradients

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049
platforms kind of those stark gradients
 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.589
platforms kind of those stark gradients
and also just these kind of one pixel

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599
and also just these kind of one pixel
 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.059
and also just these kind of one pixel
tech shadows this is something we

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069
tech shadows this is something we
 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.140
tech shadows this is something we
haven't really talked about before in

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150
haven't really talked about before in
 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.490
haven't really talked about before in
the show but another thing that

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.439
you know why not make coupons a
secondary section at the bottom right

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:04.449
secondary section at the bottom right
 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:06.749
secondary section at the bottom right
either you know let's say I have no list

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:06.759
either you know let's say I have no list
 

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:08.610
either you know let's say I have no list
items I have nothing on my shopping list

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620
items I have nothing on my shopping list
 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.770
items I have nothing on my shopping list
why not just show coupons hey you know I

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:10.780
why not just show coupons hey you know I
 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.020
why not just show coupons hey you know I
forgot to get soup the the other week

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:13.030
forgot to get soup the the other week
 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.240
forgot to get soup the the other week
and there's a coupon for soup so let me

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.250
and there's a coupon for soup so let me

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:17.289
just you know pop that into my shopping
 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:20.040
just you know pop that into my shopping
list but also if you do have lots of

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050
list but also if you do have lots of
 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.230
list but also if you do have lots of
shopping list items then you're probably

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240
shopping list items then you're probably
 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.330
shopping list items then you're probably
not so much worried about other products

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:24.340
not so much worried about other products
 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.830
not so much worried about other products
you probably want to just get rid of

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840
you probably want to just get rid of
 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.719
you probably want to just get rid of
those products and buy those you know

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:27.729
those products and buy those you know
 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:29.399
those products and buy those you know
and not worry about anything else and so

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:29.409
and not worry about anything else and so
 

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:30.870
and not worry about anything else and so
coupons moves all the way to the bottom

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880
coupons moves all the way to the bottom
 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.610
coupons moves all the way to the bottom
of that and then we use a different

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:32.620
of that and then we use a different
 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.420
of that and then we use a different
visual indicator this kind of almost fo

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:36.430
visual indicator this kind of almost fo
 

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.110
visual indicator this kind of almost fo
torn edge and this is borderline

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.120
torn edge and this is borderline
 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.219
torn edge and this is borderline
skeuomorphic but it doesn't really

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:41.229
skeuomorphic but it doesn't really
 

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:44.219
skeuomorphic but it doesn't really
matter it's kind of the second the

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:44.229
matter it's kind of the second the
 

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:46.619
matter it's kind of the second the
secondary part of the screen that shows

00:07:46.619 --> 00:07:46.629
secondary part of the screen that shows
 

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:49.769
secondary part of the screen that shows
you that this is clearly a different

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:49.779
you that this is clearly a different
 

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:52.080
you that this is clearly a different
part of the app and a different set of

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.090
part of the app and a different set of
 

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.070
part of the app and a different set of
items so it's a clear visual delineation

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080
items so it's a clear visual delineation
 

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.899
items so it's a clear visual delineation
and then we've also used kind of this

00:07:57.899 --> 00:07:57.909
and then we've also used kind of this
 

00:07:57.909 --> 00:08:01.050
and then we've also used kind of this
this blue accent color throughout to

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:01.060
this blue accent color throughout to
 

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.149
this blue accent color throughout to
indicate that this is a coupon kind of

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:03.159
indicate that this is a coupon kind of
 

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:06.269
indicate that this is a coupon kind of
like on google com you see the ads the

00:08:06.269 --> 00:08:06.279
like on google com you see the ads the
 

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:08.459
like on google com you see the ads the
text ads in search results on a yellow

00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:08.469
text ads in search results on a yellow
 

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:10.170
text ads in search results on a yellow
background this would be kind of similar

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:10.180
background this would be kind of similar
 

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.619
background this would be kind of similar
so you present a visual theme throughout

00:08:13.619 --> 00:08:13.629
so you present a visual theme throughout
 

00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:16.379
so you present a visual theme throughout
that says hey blue is advertising or

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:16.389
that says hey blue is advertising or
 

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:17.100
that says hey blue is advertising or
blue is

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:17.110
blue is
 

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.590
blue is
ponds and green is your stuff so it's

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:19.600
ponds and green is your stuff so it's
 

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.210
ponds and green is your stuff so it's
kind of one of one of the ways to think

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:21.220
kind of one of one of the ways to think
 

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.890
kind of one of one of the ways to think
about that and the last thing i want to

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:22.900
about that and the last thing i want to
 

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.360
about that and the last thing i want to

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.620
want to chime in is this bar at the top
and this is something that adam and i

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:28.630
and this is something that adam and i
 

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.320

I believe it is really like how do you

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:32.950
I believe it is really like how do you
 

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.760
I believe it is really like how do you
present adding items or searching for

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:35.770
present adding items or searching for
 

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.890
present adding items or searching for
stuff and in this case searching and

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:37.900
stuff and in this case searching and
 

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.330
stuff and in this case searching and
adding is really part of the same flow

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:39.340
adding is really part of the same flow
 

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.430
adding is really part of the same flow
and we decided to make it kind of a

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440
and we decided to make it kind of a
 

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.200
and we decided to make it kind of a
first class citizen rather than an

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:43.210
first class citizen rather than an
 

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.690
first class citizen rather than an
action button we've put it in line at

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:45.700
action button we've put it in line at
 

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.230
action button we've put it in line at
the very top of the list so yeah so

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:49.240
the very top of the list so yeah so
 

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.250
the very top of the list so yeah so
that's that's all i wanted to mention

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:50.260
that's that's all i wanted to mention
 

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.470
that's that's all i wanted to mention
Adam remember you had thoughts on on

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480
Adam remember you had thoughts on on
 

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.420
Adam remember you had thoughts on on
search and add need to talk about some

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:54.430
search and add need to talk about some
 

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.880
search and add need to talk about some
alternatives or yeah I guess one thing I

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:56.890
alternatives or yeah I guess one thing I
 

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.250
alternatives or yeah I guess one thing I
wanted to sort of talk about was um you

00:08:59.250 --> 00:08:59.260
wanted to sort of talk about was um you
 

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.330

know you can always have an action item

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:00.340
know you can always have an action item
 

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.370
know you can always have an action item
but if the if the action is really

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:02.380
but if the if the action is really
 

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.660
but if the if the action is really
important you can put it in line like

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:03.670
important you can put it in line like
 

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.780
important you can put it in line like
Roman has shown here but I guess if you

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:06.790
Roman has shown here but I guess if you
 

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.280
Roman has shown here but I guess if you
did want to you could move that sort of

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:08.290

the sort of contextual search that shows

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.010
the sort of contextual search that shows
 

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:16.530
the sort of contextual search that shows
actually directly in the action bar

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:16.540
actually directly in the action bar
 

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.540
actually directly in the action bar
itself so you know that's just an

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:18.550
itself so you know that's just an
 

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.490
itself so you know that's just an
alternative you know totally up to the

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:20.500
alternative you know totally up to the
 

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.780
alternative you know totally up to the
designer of the app as to how they

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:21.790
designer of the app as to how they
 

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.490
designer of the app as to how they
actually want to implement this yeah

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:23.500
actually want to implement this yeah
 

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.900
actually want to implement this yeah
almost kind of like like an expanding

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:24.910
almost kind of like like an expanding
 

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.490
almost kind of like like an expanding
search food but maybe it's an expanding

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:26.500
search food but maybe it's an expanding
 

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.040

add view yep an interesting approach

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:29.050
add view yep an interesting approach
 

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.650
add view yep an interesting approach
yeah and in some of the later and one of

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:31.660
yeah and in some of the later and one of
 

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.900
yeah and in some of the later and one of
the later apps Nick will talk about all

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:33.910
the later apps Nick will talk about all
 

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.580
the later apps Nick will talk about all
some similar ways in which we approach

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:35.590
some similar ways in which we approach
 

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.430
some similar ways in which we approach
this in out of milk but anyway let's

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:38.440
this in out of milk but anyway let's
 

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.690
this in out of milk but anyway let's
move on to the next screen for the

move on to the next screen for the
 

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.850
move on to the next screen for the
interest of time so the next screen

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:41.860
interest of time so the next screen
 

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.560
interest of time so the next screen
again since this is about the contextual

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:43.570
again since this is about the contextual
 

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.510
again since this is about the contextual
action bar this is just briefly showing

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:45.520
action bar this is just briefly showing
 

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.640
action bar this is just briefly showing
that you know let's say I wanted to

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:47.650
that you know let's say I wanted to
 

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.560
that you know let's say I wanted to
immediately you know take action on

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:49.570
immediately you know take action on
 

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.420
immediately you know take action on
three or four of those items I can just

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:51.430
three or four of those items I can just
 

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.270
three or four of those items I can just
long press to start selection and that

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:54.280
long press to start selection and that
 

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.800
long press to start selection and that
pops up the contextual action bar at the

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:55.810
pops up the contextual action bar at the
 

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.520
pops up the contextual action bar at the
top and then keep single touching

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:58.530
top and then keep single touching
 

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.260
top and then keep single touching
different items in my list to add or

different items in my list to add or
 

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.450
different items in my list to add or
remove from the selection and then take

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:03.460
remove from the selection and then take
 

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.250
remove from the selection and then take
action on that entire selection so in

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:05.260
action on that entire selection so in
 

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.500
action on that entire selection so in
this case I've selected hoegaarden and

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:07.510
this case I've selected hoegaarden and
 

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.240
this case I've selected hoegaarden and
McAllen I hopefully it's spelled McAllen

McAllen I hopefully it's spelled McAllen
 

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.670
McAllen I hopefully it's spelled McAllen
right hoegaarden McAllen and then let's

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680
right hoegaarden McAllen and then let's
 

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.530
right hoegaarden McAllen and then let's
say I've gone ahead and bought those

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:13.540
say I've gone ahead and bought those
 

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.420
say I've gone ahead and bought those
items at the store I can just select

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:15.430
items at the store I can just select
 

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.140
items at the store I can just select
both and press mark purchased two to

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:19.150
both and press mark purchased two to
 

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.280
both and press mark purchased two to
take action immediately on those two

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:20.290
take action immediately on those two
 

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.460
take action immediately on those two
items

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:22.470
 
 

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.440
 
in the next in the next screen this is

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:25.450
in the next in the next screen this is
 

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.660
in the next in the next screen this is
an example of that drop down and this is

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:27.670
an example of that drop down and this is
 

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.430
an example of that drop down and this is
kind of interesting this is something

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440
kind of interesting this is something
 

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.940
kind of interesting this is something
that we we took a few liberties with a

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:31.950
that we we took a few liberties with a
 

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.560
that we we took a few liberties with a
spinner I guess drop-down / spinner

navigation usually you just see you know

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:36.940
navigation usually you just see you know
 

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.240
navigation usually you just see you know

the items which you're switching between
 

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.190
the items which you're switching between
right so in a normal case you can see

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200
right so in a normal case you can see
 

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.590
right so in a normal case you can see
you know grocery store bakery or any

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600
you know grocery store bakery or any
 

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.440
you know grocery store bakery or any
store meaning like all of the above but

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:46.450
store meaning like all of the above but
 

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.160
store meaning like all of the above but
in this case since I thought that since

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:49.170
in this case since I thought that since
 

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.900
in this case since I thought that since
since this is like the single place

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:51.910
since this is like the single place
 

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.050
since this is like the single place
where users see their list of stores

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.060
where users see their list of stores
 

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.940
where users see their list of stores
this is like the most the most visible

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:56.950
this is like the most the most visible
 

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:58.290
this is like the most the most visible
place in the app where they see their

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:58.300
place in the app where they see their
 

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.170
place in the app where they see their
list of stores let's make it easy to to

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:01.180
list of stores let's make it easy to to
 

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.970
list of stores let's make it easy to to
also then take action on those little

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:02.980
also then take action on those little
 

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.190
also then take action on those little
that list so then maybe add a store to

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200
that list so then maybe add a store to
 

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.320
that list so then maybe add a store to
that list right from here and this is

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:07.330
that list right from here and this is
 

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.390
that list right from here and this is
something that Ian mentioned last week

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:09.400
something that Ian mentioned last week
 

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.400
something that Ian mentioned last week
on the App clinic you know it's it's a

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:11.410
on the App clinic you know it's it's a
 

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.470
on the App clinic you know it's it's a
missed opportunity if you see a list of

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:13.480
missed opportunity if you see a list of
 

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.850
missed opportunity if you see a list of
things and you know you want to add one

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:14.860
things and you know you want to add one
 

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.830
things and you know you want to add one
but you then can't figure out how to do

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:16.840
but you then can't figure out how to do
 

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.510
but you then can't figure out how to do
it so this way it makes it very obvious

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:18.520
it so this way it makes it very obvious
 

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.580
it so this way it makes it very obvious
it's a slight deviation from the

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:20.590
it's a slight deviation from the
 

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.860
it's a slight deviation from the
standard pattern but you know I

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:22.870
standard pattern but you know I
 

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.840
standard pattern but you know I
personally feel that it's it's a fairly

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:24.850
personally feel that it's it's a fairly
 

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.450
personally feel that it's it's a fairly
fairly reasonable deviation and then the

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:27.460
fairly reasonable deviation and then the
 

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.830
fairly reasonable deviation and then the
other thing is that there's also

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:28.840
other thing is that there's also
 

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.260
other thing is that there's also
favorites and history and to navigate to

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:31.270
favorites and history and to navigate to
 

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:32.610
favorites and history and to navigate to
those items and again there's still

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:32.620
those items and again there's still
 

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.740
those items and again there's still
lists of tasks really at the end of the

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:34.750
lists of tasks really at the end of the
 

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.200
lists of tasks really at the end of the
day you can jump into favorites in

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:37.210
day you can jump into favorites in
 

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.850
day you can jump into favorites in
history right from here with this kind

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:38.860
history right from here with this kind
 

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.850
history right from here with this kind
of separate section so any any

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:41.860

criticisms or thoughts or alternatives

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:44.590
criticisms or thoughts or alternatives
 

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.560
criticisms or thoughts or alternatives
but why don't we throw it over to to me

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:46.570
but why don't we throw it over to to me
 

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:50.310
but why don't we throw it over to to me
quickly yeah yeah for me like I'm

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320
quickly yeah yeah for me like I'm
 

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.720
quickly yeah yeah for me like I'm
looking at the original designer just

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:51.730
looking at the original designer just
 

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.030
looking at the original designer just
kind of screen gingerbread to me it

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.040
kind of screen gingerbread to me it
 

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.910
kind of screen gingerbread to me it
always a I think the Refresh that you've

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:56.920
always a I think the Refresh that you've
 

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.950
always a I think the Refresh that you've
given it makes it look much more modern

00:11:58.950 --> 00:11:58.960
given it makes it look much more modern
 

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.710
given it makes it look much more modern
much more home on my online device

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:01.720
much more home on my online device
 

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.000
much more home on my online device
running jelly bean or whatever the

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.010
running jelly bean or whatever the
 

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.820
running jelly bean or whatever the
latest OS everyone is running and also

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:05.830
latest OS everyone is running and also
 

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.380
latest OS everyone is running and also
it just it feels easier to use because

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:07.390
it just it feels easier to use because
 

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.390
it just it feels easier to use because
the standard iconography understand the

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:09.400
the standard iconography understand the
 

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.820
the standard iconography understand the
controls from a modern palette just a

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:11.830
controls from a modern palette just a
 

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.650
controls from a modern palette just a
very familiar to me so I think this is a

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:13.660
very familiar to me so I think this is a
 

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.100
very familiar to me so I think this is a
really lovely redesign yeah and thank

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:17.110
really lovely redesign yeah and thank
 

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.840
really lovely redesign yeah and thank
you and I one other things that we

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:18.850
you and I one other things that we
 

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:19.890
you and I one other things that we
should probably talk about at the end is

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:19.900
should probably talk about at the end is
 

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.900
should probably talk about at the end is
the difference between selection and

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:21.910
the difference between selection and
 

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.790
the difference between selection and
checkboxes and there's lots of different

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:23.800
checkboxes and there's lots of different
 

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.900
checkboxes and there's lots of different
ways you can go about this and I think

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:24.910
ways you can go about this and I think
 

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.070
ways you can go about this and I think
Nikki tried an alternative

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:28.080
Nikki tried an alternative
 

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.560
Nikki tried an alternative
in out of milk but we should definitely

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:30.570
in out of milk but we should definitely
 

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:31.760
in out of milk but we should definitely
talk about at the very end afraid of

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:31.770
talk about at the very end afraid of
 

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.080
talk about at the very end afraid of
some time since that's something that

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.090
some time since that's something that
 

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.540
some time since that's something that
like that specifically with task list

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:35.550
like that specifically with task list
 

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.570
like that specifically with task list
apps or list apps that can you know be

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:38.580
apps or list apps that can you know be
 

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.940
apps or list apps that can you know be
confusing in some cases so the last

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:40.950
confusing in some cases so the last
 

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.370
confusing in some cases so the last
screen that we have here is with editing

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:43.380
screen that we have here is with editing
 

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.750
screen that we have here is with editing
a store and then we'll jump over to Adam

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760
a store and then we'll jump over to Adam
 

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.820
a store and then we'll jump over to Adam
milk so when editing a story of the

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:46.830
milk so when editing a story of the
 

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.040
milk so when editing a story of the
option to edit the store name and then

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:49.050
option to edit the store name and then
 

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.200
option to edit the store name and then
if you'll notice here you can add or

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:51.210
if you'll notice here you can add or
 

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:55.100
if you'll notice here you can add or
reorder aisles as well as hi dials but

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:55.110
reorder aisles as well as hi dials but
 

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:56.150
reorder aisles as well as hi dials but
it seems like in this case this is

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160
it seems like in this case this is
 

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.340
it seems like in this case this is
really kind of like a sub dashboard

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:58.350
really kind of like a sub dashboard
 

00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.990
really kind of like a sub dashboard
pattern rather than giving you the

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000
pattern rather than giving you the
 

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.820
pattern rather than giving you the
content immediately the list of aisles

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:01.830
content immediately the list of aisles
 

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.890
content immediately the list of aisles
it just gives you the options in which

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:03.900
it just gives you the options in which
 

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.350
it just gives you the options in which
you can take on the on that list so

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360
you can take on the on that list so
 

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.910
you can take on the on that list so
rather than doing that we felt that it

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920
rather than doing that we felt that it
 

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.170
rather than doing that we felt that it
would be just a better user experience

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:11.180
would be just a better user experience
 

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.380
would be just a better user experience
to show everything at once so you can

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:15.390
to show everything at once so you can
 

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.930
to show everything at once so you can
immediately edit the name as well as

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:17.940
immediately edit the name as well as
 

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.740
immediately edit the name as well as
reorder and hide aisles so and yet we're

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:21.750
reorder and hide aisles so and yet we're
 

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.050
reorder and hide aisles so and yet we're
also using this done discard pattern at

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:24.060
also using this done discard pattern at
 

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.330
also using this done discard pattern at
the very top so rather than seeing like

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:26.340
the very top so rather than seeing like
 

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.250
the very top so rather than seeing like
a save button or anything like that we

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:28.260
a save button or anything like that we
 

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.400
a save button or anything like that we
see very clear options to either cancel

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:30.410
see very clear options to either cancel
 

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:34.280
see very clear options to either cancel
what we just did or save by pressing the

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:34.290
what we just did or save by pressing the
 

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.260
what we just did or save by pressing the
done button and then here you'll notice

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:36.270
done button and then here you'll notice
 

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.210
done button and then here you'll notice
that we use these subtle drag handles to

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.220
that we use these subtle drag handles to
 

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.820
that we use these subtle drag handles to
allow you to reorder items and then the

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:40.830
allow you to reorder items and then the
 

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.370
allow you to reorder items and then the
entire the rest of the list item the

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:43.380
entire the rest of the list item the
 

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.380
entire the rest of the list item the
rest of that touch area is a single

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:45.390
rest of that touch area is a single
 

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.720
rest of that touch area is a single
touch target to show or hide so touching

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:47.730
touch target to show or hide so touching
 

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.330
touch target to show or hide so touching
it basically toggles its visibility and

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:50.340
it basically toggles its visibility and
 

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.370
it basically toggles its visibility and
you'll notice that there isn't a

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:52.380
you'll notice that there isn't a
 

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.980
you'll notice that there isn't a
separator between this visibility marker

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:54.990
separator between this visibility marker
 

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.930
separator between this visibility marker
and the rest of the list item and that's

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:56.940
and the rest of the list item and that's
 

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.400
and the rest of the list item and that's
to indicate that it's a single touch

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:58.410
to indicate that it's a single touch
 

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.330
to indicate that it's a single touch
target not two separate targets and then

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:02.340
target not two separate targets and then
 

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.680
target not two separate targets and then
obviously you can you can add an aisle

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:03.690

there should be you know contextual

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:09.900
there should be you know contextual
 

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.090

thoughts for a grocery IQ guys I think

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:17.190
thoughts for a grocery IQ guys I think
 

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.920
thoughts for a grocery IQ guys I think
the direct manipulation is much better

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:18.930
the direct manipulation is much better
 

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:20.480
the direct manipulation is much better
than having to go through each level I

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:20.490
than having to go through each level I
 

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.400
than having to go through each level I
think the same way you surface coupons

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:22.410
think the same way you surface coupons
 

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:24.410
think the same way you surface coupons
up to a high level it's you know makes

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:24.420
up to a high level it's you know makes
 

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.700
up to a high level it's you know makes
it easier to use if you don't have to

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:25.710
it easier to use if you don't have to
 

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.620
it easier to use if you don't have to
pogo stick as they say in and out of

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:27.630
pogo stick as they say in and out of
 

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:30.380
pogo stick as they say in and out of
different screens camp yeah I also like

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:30.390
different screens camp yeah I also like
 

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.940
different screens camp yeah I also like
that coupons tear off that you have at

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:31.950
that coupons tear off that you have at
 

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:34.280
that coupons tear off that you have at
the bottom there just because as you say

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:34.290
the bottom there just because as you say
 

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.420
the bottom there just because as you say
it's probably important to their

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:35.430
it's probably important to their
 

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.250

business the company itself is called

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:37.260

business the company itself is called
coupons

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:37.750
coupons
 

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.310
coupons
but also like it sort of dynamically

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320
but also like it sort of dynamically
 

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.110
but also like it sort of dynamically
grows and shrinks based on what the real

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120
grows and shrinks based on what the real
 

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.030
grows and shrinks based on what the real
content is on that particular screen so

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040
content is on that particular screen so
 

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.410
content is on that particular screen so
I think it's a nice way of showing

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:46.420
I think it's a nice way of showing
 

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.540
I think it's a nice way of showing
everything at one screen yeah the other

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:48.550
everything at one screen yeah the other
 

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.860
everything at one screen yeah the other
thing is that you know if you have no

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:49.870
thing is that you know if you have no
 

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.930
thing is that you know if you have no
empty or if you have a empty list if you

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:51.940
empty or if you have a empty list if you
 

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.120
empty or if you have a empty list if you
have no items in that list then I mean

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:54.130
have no items in that list then I mean
 

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.530
have no items in that list then I mean
naturally you think oh let's just show

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:55.540
naturally you think oh let's just show
 

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.840
naturally you think oh let's just show
no items in this list text and that's it

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:57.850
no items in this list text and that's it
 

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.550
no items in this list text and that's it
right so the user opens up the app and

00:14:59.550 --> 00:14:59.560
right so the user opens up the app and
 

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.160
right so the user opens up the app and
they immediately see an empty list and

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:02.170
they immediately see an empty list and
 

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.230
they immediately see an empty list and
so showing coupons is another way of

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240
so showing coupons is another way of
 

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.090
so showing coupons is another way of
presenting more useful information

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:06.100
presenting more useful information
 

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.100
presenting more useful information
without having to fill the space with

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:08.110
without having to fill the space with
 

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:11.610
without having to fill the space with
like useless stuff so and likewise if

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:11.620
like useless stuff so and likewise if
 

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.260
like useless stuff so and likewise if
the list is really really long those

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:13.270
the list is really really long those
 

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.760
the list is really really long those
coupons aren't going to get directly in

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:14.770
coupons aren't going to get directly in
 

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.650
coupons aren't going to get directly in
your way they get pushed down off the

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:16.660
your way they get pushed down off the
 

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.940
your way they get pushed down off the
screen and the content is still going to

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:17.950
screen and the content is still going to
 

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:21.570
screen and the content is still going to
be seen there at the front and I mean

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:21.580
be seen there at the front and I mean
 

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.520
be seen there at the front and I mean
worst case if you find that users don't

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:23.530
worst case if you find that users don't
 

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:25.230
worst case if you find that users don't
like interact with coupons as much

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:25.240
like interact with coupons as much
 

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.550
like interact with coupons as much
because of that then you can always have

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560
because of that then you can always have
 

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.740
because of that then you can always have
like a an overflow item or something

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:28.750
like a an overflow item or something
 

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.900
like a an overflow item or something
else in the action bar or something that

functionality in there so you can see he
 

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.550
functionality in there so you can see he
in the action bar you have the ability

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560
in the action bar you have the ability
 

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.200
in the action bar you have the ability
to use a barcode scanner which is kind

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:10.210
to use a barcode scanner which is kind
 

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:11.760

to pick up at the bottom so yeah I've
dived in flow you you come in on a

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:29.770
dived in flow you you come in on a
 

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.350
dived in flow you you come in on a
dashboard pattern I've dived into one of

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360
dashboard pattern I've dived into one of
 

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.940
dashboard pattern I've dived into one of
the main screens like managing like

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:32.950
the main screens like managing like
 

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.380
the main screens like managing like
viewing a list and you have this kind of

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:34.390
viewing a list and you have this kind of
 

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.300
viewing a list and you have this kind of
spin and navigation for flip flitting

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:36.310
spin and navigation for flip flitting
 

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.850
spin and navigation for flip flitting
between the two I think when I look at

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:38.860
between the two I think when I look at
 

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.470
between the two I think when I look at
the screen the first thing and that

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480
the screen the first thing and that
 

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.090
the screen the first thing and that
stands out to me is that

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:43.100
stands out to me is that
 

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.860
stands out to me is that
and despite the fact they're using an

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:44.870
and despite the fact they're using an
 

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.860
and despite the fact they're using an
action bar and have an overflow button

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:47.870
action bar and have an overflow button
 

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.560
action bar and have an overflow button

halfway with the skeuomorphic thing but

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:22.970
halfway with the skeuomorphic thing but
 

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.150
halfway with the skeuomorphic thing but
not all the way which is almost worse

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:25.160
not all the way which is almost worse
 

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.440
not all the way which is almost worse
than just getting all the way if you ask

to me that the greater issue here I

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:44.450
to me that the greater issue here I
 

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.350
to me that the greater issue here I
think is with kind of the the extra

00:19:59.860 --> 00:19:59.870
Galaxy Nexus it's that many overflow
 

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.040
Galaxy Nexus it's that many overflow
options which I found and to be a bit of

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:03.050
options which I found and to be a bit of
 

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.640
options which I found and to be a bit of
bit could have overloaded me and yeah

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:06.650
bit could have overloaded me and yeah
 

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:08.680
bit could have overloaded me and yeah
and using I mean this is kind of the

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:08.690
and using I mean this is kind of the
 

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:10.390
and using I mean this is kind of the
against the the concept of direct

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400
against the the concept of direct
 

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.460
against the the concept of direct
manipulation which is one of the direct

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:12.470
manipulation which is one of the direct
 

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.020
manipulation which is one of the direct
I guess the design principles and a

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:14.030
I guess the design principles and a
 

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.270
I guess the design principles and a
design guide you know items should be

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.280
design guide you know items should be
 

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.190
design guide you know items should be
manipulable you should be able to touch

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.200
manipulable you should be able to touch
 

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.260
manipulable you should be able to touch
them to interact with them rather than

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:20.270
them to interact with them rather than
 

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.470
them to interact with them rather than
choosing actions somewhere else to do

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:23.480
choosing actions somewhere else to do
 

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.750
choosing actions somewhere else to do
things like trigger selection or like

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760
things like trigger selection or like
 

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.880
things like trigger selection or like
select all deselect all anything like

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:27.890
select all deselect all anything like
 

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.450
select all deselect all anything like
that should really be more contextual

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:30.460
that should really be more contextual
 

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.280
that should really be more contextual
and in general I mean if you look at

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:33.290
and in general I mean if you look at
 

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:34.660
and in general I mean if you look at
just for a long press think that's

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:34.670
just for a long press think that's
 

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.430
just for a long press think that's
particularly egregious in this case

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:36.440
particularly egregious in this case
 

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.260
particularly egregious in this case
where you know long press we've tried to

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:38.270
where you know long press we've tried to
 

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.630
where you know long press we've tried to
standardize on what long press means and

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640
standardize on what long press means and
 

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.940
standardize on what long press means and
really it means selection it trigger it

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:42.950
really it means selection it trigger it
 

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:44.920
really it means selection it trigger it
triggers selection and then potentially

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:44.930
triggers selection and then potentially
 

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.240
triggers selection and then potentially
you know showing actions on your

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:46.250
you know showing actions on your
 

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.820
you know showing actions on your
selection I'm so using it for anything

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:48.830
selection I'm so using it for anything
 

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:52.360
selection I'm so using it for anything
else like you know marking an item is

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:52.370
else like you know marking an item is
 

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:54.340
else like you know marking an item is
complete it's kind of

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:54.350
complete it's kind of
 

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.680
complete it's kind of
beyond what the standards are and it's

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:56.690
beyond what the standards are and it's
 

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:57.970
beyond what the standards are and it's
just another thing that users have to

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:57.980
just another thing that users have to
 

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.310
just another thing that users have to
learn one other thing that I guess we

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320
learn one other thing that I guess we
 

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.570
learn one other thing that I guess we
use for long presses when you long press

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:01.580
use for long presses when you long press
 

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.779
use for long presses when you long press
on an action button when on an icon only

00:21:04.779 --> 00:21:04.789
on an action button when on an icon only
 

00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:06.760
on an action button when on an icon only
button it shows your little tool tip but

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:06.770
button it shows your little tool tip but
 

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.010
button it shows your little tool tip but
that's kind of a secondary use for it

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:09.020
that's kind of a secondary use for it
 

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.020
that's kind of a secondary use for it
it's not as a as important to use a

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.030
it's not as a as important to use a
 

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:16.060
it's not as a as important to use a
selection so in the Nick I just wanted

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:16.070
selection so in the Nick I just wanted
 

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.250
selection so in the Nick I just wanted
to mention that I've been showing your

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:18.260
to mention that I've been showing your
 

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.980
to mention that I've been showing your
your redesign already by accident so

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:20.990
your redesign already by accident so
 

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.750
your redesign already by accident so
unfortunately we don't have a big reveal

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:22.760
unfortunately we don't have a big reveal
 

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:28.390
unfortunately we don't have a big reveal
but but go ahead and jump it okay yep so

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400
but but go ahead and jump it okay yep so
 

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.669
but but go ahead and jump it okay yep so
if we do take a look at the redesign

00:21:30.669 --> 00:21:30.679
if we do take a look at the redesign
 

00:21:30.679 --> 00:21:31.720
if we do take a look at the redesign
that you've been looking at for all this

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:31.730
that you've been looking at for all this
 

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:35.590
that you've been looking at for all this
time then we can see and we've applied

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600
time then we can see and we've applied
 

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.000
time then we can see and we've applied
some holo styling to it so we've used

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.010
some holo styling to it so we've used
 

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.310
some holo styling to it so we've used
some familiar language visual language

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.320
some familiar language visual language
 

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.810
some familiar language visual language

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:40.820
in the application to make it a bit
 

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:41.919
in the application to make it a bit
easier to see is actually quite

00:21:41.919 --> 00:21:41.929
easier to see is actually quite
 

00:21:41.929 --> 00:21:43.360
easier to see is actually quite
interesting that Roman and I did our

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:43.370
interesting that Roman and I did our
 

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.430
interesting that Roman and I did our
redesigns in isolation and refused and

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440
redesigns in isolation and refused and
 

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.020

handles and so on and throughout but I

00:21:49.899 --> 00:21:49.909
handles and so on and throughout but I
 

00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:51.039
handles and so on and throughout but I
guess that's why their standard right

00:21:51.039 --> 00:21:51.049
guess that's why their standard right
 

00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:53.890

mmm but then the other thing I did we
 

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.180
mmm but then the other thing I did we
mention is there's some really cool

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:55.190
mention is there's some really cool
 

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.070

I've also broken down the the user

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:30.470
I've also broken down the the user
 

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.049
I've also broken down the the user

kind of ways of adding an item to your

the less use and much smaller set of
 

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.320
the less use and much smaller set of
alternative actions under yoga flow so

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:03.330
alternative actions under yoga flow so
 

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.120
alternative actions under yoga flow so
we've also changed up the interaction a

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:05.130
we've also changed up the interaction a
 

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.830
we've also changed up the interaction a
little bit here as well you can see I've

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840
little bit here as well you can see I've
 

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.810
little bit here as well you can see I've
placed some checkboxes next to the items

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:08.820
placed some checkboxes next to the items
 

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.990
placed some checkboxes next to the items
and which allow you to go into a

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000
and which allow you to go into a
 

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.980
and which allow you to go into a
selection mode and so I've actually kind

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:15.990
selection mode and so I've actually kind
 

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.240
selection mode and so I've actually kind
of flipped the concept or change the

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:17.250
of flipped the concept or change the
 

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.160
of flipped the concept or change the
concept a little bit and got rid of the

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:19.170
concept a little bit and got rid of the
 

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:21.920
concept a little bit and got rid of the
idea of like a a semi kind of strict

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:21.930
idea of like a a semi kind of strict
 

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.360
idea of like a a semi kind of strict

00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919
the contextual action bar you can and
 

00:26:30.919 --> 00:26:33.320
the contextual action bar you can and
edit or the second icon any action bar

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:33.330
edit or the second icon any action bar
 

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:34.850
edit or the second icon any action bar
there's you can you know move it to

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:34.860
there's you can you know move it to
 

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.649
there's you can you know move it to
another list or delete the item straight

00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:36.659
another list or delete the item straight
 

00:26:36.659 --> 00:26:39.619
another list or delete the item straight
from there and the power of using the

00:26:39.619 --> 00:26:39.629
from there and the power of using the
 

00:26:39.629 --> 00:26:41.299
from there and the power of using the
contextual action bar i believe is not

00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:41.309
contextual action bar i believe is not
 

00:26:41.309 --> 00:26:43.580
contextual action bar i believe is not
only this like you next very consistent

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:43.590
only this like you next very consistent
 

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.200
only this like you next very consistent
with a platform way of handling

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:45.210
with a platform way of handling
 

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.539
with a platform way of handling
selection but it's also great for

00:26:47.539 --> 00:26:47.549
selection but it's also great for
 

00:26:47.549 --> 00:26:48.919
selection but it's also great for
dealing with multi select so here you

00:26:48.919 --> 00:26:48.929
dealing with multi select so here you
 

00:26:48.929 --> 00:26:51.200
dealing with multi select so here you
can see the limiter which says one item

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:51.210
can see the limiter which says one item
 

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.450
can see the limiter which says one item
selected it's actually a drop-down so

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.460
selected it's actually a drop-down so
 

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.980
selected it's actually a drop-down so
right here I could dispose that and you

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:54.990
right here I could dispose that and you
 

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.749
right here I could dispose that and you
might get options to select all or in

00:26:56.749 --> 00:26:56.759
might get options to select all or in
 

00:26:56.759 --> 00:26:58.129
might get options to select all or in
this example here I've tapped another

00:26:58.129 --> 00:26:58.139
this example here I've tapped another
 

00:26:58.139 --> 00:27:00.169
this example here I've tapped another
and another item in the list and it's

00:27:00.169 --> 00:27:00.179
and another item in the list and it's
 

00:27:00.179 --> 00:27:01.940
and another item in the list and it's
let me do contextual action so here you

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:01.950
let me do contextual action so here you
 

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:03.200
let me do contextual action so here you
can see because I'm dealing with two

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:03.210
can see because I'm dealing with two
 

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:04.310
can see because I'm dealing with two
items select

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320
items select
 

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.659
items select
rather than one and we've actually

00:27:05.659 --> 00:27:05.669
rather than one and we've actually
 

00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:08.149
rather than one and we've actually
refined the selection so we said that

00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159
refined the selection so we said that
 

00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:10.129
refined the selection so we said that
edit might not be applicable to multiple

00:27:10.129 --> 00:27:10.139
edit might not be applicable to multiple
 

00:27:10.139 --> 00:27:12.680
edit might not be applicable to multiple
items and and it's refined it dances

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:12.690
items and and it's refined it dances
 

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:14.360
items and and it's refined it dances
using two actions here so it's a really

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:14.370
using two actions here so it's a really
 

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:16.070
using two actions here so it's a really
kind of very neat way of performing

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080
kind of very neat way of performing
 

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.779
kind of very neat way of performing
quite powerful kind of selection actions

00:27:17.779 --> 00:27:17.789
quite powerful kind of selection actions
 

00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:20.269
quite powerful kind of selection actions
yeah so unless you're like a batch edit

00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279
yeah so unless you're like a batch edit
 

00:27:20.279 --> 00:27:22.249
yeah so unless you're like a batch edit
mode or something where like you batch

00:27:22.249 --> 00:27:22.259
mode or something where like you batch
 

00:27:22.259 --> 00:27:24.799
mode or something where like you batch
apply a tag or something then yeah

00:27:24.799 --> 00:27:24.809
apply a tag or something then yeah
 

00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:28.720
apply a tag or something then yeah
removing that edit icon Mick sent cool

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:28.730
removing that edit icon Mick sent cool
 

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.340
removing that edit icon Mick sent cool
and just a fun to stick with the

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:31.350
and just a fun to stick with the
 

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.139
and just a fun to stick with the
metaphor we've been using of using the

00:27:33.139 --> 00:27:33.149
metaphor we've been using of using the
 

00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:34.730
metaphor we've been using of using the
swype so mark something is completed

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:34.740
swype so mark something is completed
 

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.560
swype so mark something is completed
before we keep it wet if you are

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:36.570
before we keep it wet if you are
 

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:38.419
before we keep it wet if you are
selecting multiple items at once you

00:27:38.419 --> 00:27:38.429
selecting multiple items at once you
 

00:27:38.429 --> 00:27:41.210
selecting multiple items at once you
could then still swipe across on one of

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:41.220
could then still swipe across on one of
 

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.950
could then still swipe across on one of
these items and it would mark each of

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960
these items and it would mark each of
 

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.990
these items and it would mark each of
them is completed that's cool I've never

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000
them is completed that's cool I've never
 

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.240
them is completed that's cool I've never
seen that done before but that looks

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:47.250
seen that done before but that looks
 

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:48.649
seen that done before but that looks
like it might work really really well

00:27:48.649 --> 00:27:48.659
like it might work really really well
 

00:27:48.659 --> 00:27:52.249
like it might work really really well
it's very cool just a fun idea to be

00:27:52.249 --> 00:27:52.259
it's very cool just a fun idea to be
 

00:27:52.259 --> 00:27:54.200
it's very cool just a fun idea to be
kind of called the hint that you can do

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:54.210
kind of called the hint that you can do
 

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:55.879
kind of called the hint that you can do
that by you know when the user selects

00:27:55.879 --> 00:27:55.889
that by you know when the user selects
 

00:27:55.889 --> 00:27:57.710
that by you know when the user selects
the actual contextual action item you

00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720
the actual contextual action item you
 

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.180
the actual contextual action item you
could have the animation play and have

00:27:59.180 --> 00:27:59.190
could have the animation play and have
 

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:01.730
could have the animation play and have
the Unruh in place still and that way

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:01.740
the Unruh in place still and that way
 

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:02.810
the Unruh in place still and that way
they know next time they could probably

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:02.820
they know next time they could probably
 

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.430
they know next time they could probably
just go and swipe themselves I like that

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:04.440
just go and swipe themselves I like that
 

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.539
just go and swipe themselves I like that
it's cool yeah this might be one of

00:28:05.539 --> 00:28:05.549
it's cool yeah this might be one of
 

00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:06.799
it's cool yeah this might be one of
those cases we talked about the showcase

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:06.809
those cases we talked about the showcase
 

00:28:06.809 --> 00:28:10.490
those cases we talked about the showcase
view last week where you know if it

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:10.500
view last week where you know if it
 

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.379
view last week where you know if it
isn't so completely apparent by a wats

00:28:12.379 --> 00:28:12.389
isn't so completely apparent by a wats
 

00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:14.629
isn't so completely apparent by a wats
on screen like a gesture you had to

00:28:14.629 --> 00:28:14.639
on screen like a gesture you had to
 

00:28:14.639 --> 00:28:16.669
on screen like a gesture you had to
perform I think it's okay to hint it the

00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679
perform I think it's okay to hint it the
 

00:28:16.679 --> 00:28:17.990
perform I think it's okay to hint it the
first time the user sees it that you

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000
first time the user sees it that you
 

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.700
first time the user sees it that you
could you know show some pie lamination

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:19.710
could you know show some pie lamination
 

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:21.289
could you know show some pie lamination
animation saying you know kids so

00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:21.299
animation saying you know kids so
 

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:22.879
animation saying you know kids so
quarter to do this the marks I'm going

00:28:22.879 --> 00:28:22.889
quarter to do this the marks I'm going
 

00:28:22.889 --> 00:28:25.519
quarter to do this the marks I'm going
on so I think this it would be to agree

00:28:25.519 --> 00:28:25.529
on so I think this it would be to agree
 

00:28:25.529 --> 00:28:26.990
on so I think this it would be to agree
just to show on the first run and then

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000
just to show on the first run and then
 

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.269
just to show on the first run and then
let the you know and teaches a dummy

00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279
let the you know and teaches a dummy
 

00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:31.549
let the you know and teaches a dummy
mm-hmm I can work and also just wanted

00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559
mm-hmm I can work and also just wanted
 

00:28:31.559 --> 00:28:33.529
mm-hmm I can work and also just wanted
to point out that that's a great thing

00:28:33.529 --> 00:28:33.539
to point out that that's a great thing
 

00:28:33.539 --> 00:28:34.850
to point out that that's a great thing
that you pointed out is that you know

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:34.860
that you pointed out is that you know
 

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.789
that you pointed out is that you know
showing an animation hint at a gesture

00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799
showing an animation hint at a gesture
 

00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:40.639
showing an animation hint at a gesture
so for example when you have a tab or

00:28:40.639 --> 00:28:40.649
so for example when you have a tab or
 

00:28:40.649 --> 00:28:42.740
so for example when you have a tab or
tabs with a view pager when you switch

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:42.750
tabs with a view pager when you switch
 

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:45.139
tabs with a view pager when you switch
tabs you call like you know pager that

00:28:45.139 --> 00:28:45.149
tabs you call like you know pager that
 

00:28:45.149 --> 00:28:48.049
tabs you call like you know pager that
set current item but calling that it

00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:48.059
set current item but calling that it
 

00:28:48.059 --> 00:28:50.840
set current item but calling that it
actually slides the contents so it's a

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:50.850
actually slides the contents so it's a
 

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:52.519
actually slides the contents so it's a
subtle hint that you can actually then

00:28:52.519 --> 00:28:52.529
subtle hint that you can actually then
 

00:28:52.529 --> 00:28:54.499
subtle hint that you can actually then
you know throw your finger on this on

00:28:54.499 --> 00:28:54.509
you know throw your finger on this on
 

00:28:54.509 --> 00:28:56.720
you know throw your finger on this on
the glass and start swiping across the

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:56.730
the glass and start swiping across the
 

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:59.060
the glass and start swiping across the
different tabs so that's a toughy a good

00:28:59.060 --> 00:28:59.070
different tabs so that's a toughy a good
 

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.399
different tabs so that's a toughy a good
way to to hint at a gestures to show an

00:29:01.399 --> 00:29:01.409
way to to hint at a gestures to show an
 

00:29:01.409 --> 00:29:03.529
way to to hint at a gestures to show an
animation that that replays the gesture

00:29:03.529 --> 00:29:03.539
animation that that replays the gesture
 

00:29:03.539 --> 00:29:06.269
animation that that replays the gesture
basically without the user interacting

00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279
basically without the user interacting
 

00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:08.940
basically without the user interacting
cool all right so let's jump into a few

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:08.950
cool all right so let's jump into a few
 

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.409
cool all right so let's jump into a few
other examples of the contextual action

00:29:10.409 --> 00:29:10.419
other examples of the contextual action
 

00:29:10.419 --> 00:29:11.549
other examples of the contextual action
bar since we wanted to talk about it

00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:11.559
bar since we wanted to talk about it
 

00:29:11.559 --> 00:29:16.879
bar since we wanted to talk about it
before we before we jump into all the

00:29:16.879 --> 00:29:16.889
before we before we jump into all the
 

00:29:16.889 --> 00:29:19.560
before we before we jump into all the
details oh wow we're super low on time

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:19.570
details oh wow we're super low on time
 

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:20.749
details oh wow we're super low on time
so we're taught to fly through this

00:29:20.749 --> 00:29:20.759
so we're taught to fly through this
 

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:23.279
so we're taught to fly through this
contextual action bar basically lets you

00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:23.289
contextual action bar basically lets you
 

00:29:23.289 --> 00:29:25.979
contextual action bar basically lets you
show multiple actions on a selection or

00:29:25.979 --> 00:29:25.989
show multiple actions on a selection or
 

00:29:25.989 --> 00:29:28.669
show multiple actions on a selection or
it enters a mode basically where you can

00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679
it enters a mode basically where you can
 

00:29:28.679 --> 00:29:32.039
it enters a mode basically where you can
you can you know take action on

00:29:32.039 --> 00:29:32.049
you can you know take action on
 

00:29:32.049 --> 00:29:34.979
you can you know take action on
selections anybody else have anything to

00:29:34.979 --> 00:29:34.989
selections anybody else have anything to
 

00:29:34.989 --> 00:29:38.609
selections anybody else have anything to
add on and we're going okay you know

00:29:38.609 --> 00:29:38.619
add on and we're going okay you know
 

00:29:38.619 --> 00:29:40.019
add on and we're going okay you know
what rather than do that let's just fly

00:29:40.019 --> 00:29:40.029
what rather than do that let's just fly
 

00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:41.249
what rather than do that let's just fly
through some of these these are some
