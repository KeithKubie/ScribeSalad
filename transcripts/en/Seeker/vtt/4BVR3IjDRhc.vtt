00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
W8MI! Whiskey right Mexico India… Dennis, do you read me?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.200
Can I just, like, text you next time? This is weird...

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.979
Can 
you read me DNews, what's your 20?

00:00:15.979 --> 00:00:18.430
Sciencemen Trace here hamming it up for DNews.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.429
Remember that time Eleven needed to talk to
Will in the upside-down?

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.910
The kids were excited because they got to
use a ham radio.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.300
Ham radio is an amateur radio broadcasting
system -- people who operate ham radios are

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.610
called "hams!"

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.050
There are nearly three million ham licenses
worldwide: with major populations of hams

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.690
in Japan, Germany, England, Indonesia, South
Korea2.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.640
According to the National Association for
Amateur Radio, there are more than 727,000

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.360
licensed ham radio operators (called hams)
in the U.S. -- making us the second largest

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.360
community.2

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.040
I say community, because that's what amature
operators says it's all about.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.660
Ham radios are exactly like any other radio,
but instead of your local rock, country, or

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.940
Beyonce station playing nothing but the hits,
nothing but the hits…

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.200
Instead, it's Jenny from the block, Sloan
from Canada, or Siso from Swaziland; right

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.640
there, in your radio!

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.630
Aside from the fun community aspect, in times
of disaster, when cell towers and internet

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.509
are down, hams can still communicate with
each other and emergency services.

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.909
All radio works the same, even ham radio.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.119
When electricity travels through an antenna
of some kind, another antenna can pick it

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.539
up and decode it.

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.689
Tune a radio to a static AM station, grab
a nine volt battery and a coin, hold them

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.539
near the antenna and connect the studs with
the coin.

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.530
The radio will pick something up!

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.529
The electricity is "broadcasting" radio5.

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:45.509
The battery will only go a few inches, but
with more power, the signal can go farther.

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.119
Thanks to advances in technology, we can pinpoint
exact frequencies to broadcast on, where the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.819
radio waves are precisely tuned so they don't
interfere with each other.

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.389
According to HowStuffWorks, ham bands are
"above the AM radio band (1.6 MHz) to just

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:03.049
above the citizens band (27 MHz) (also known
as CB radio!)"

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.380
And on those ham bands, the FCC says people
can send 1,300 different types of communication

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.540
using voice, video, digital, telegraphy (morse
code!)... you name it -- it's all shared space,

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.540
though.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.900
So if someone else is using that frequency,
it becomes a party line.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.610
There are three main Ham radio bands: HF,
VHF, and UHF.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.810
With UHF or "ultra high frequency" the waves
leave the antenna and bounce off buildings

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.730
and around solid things, but can't go2 around
mountains.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.040
VHF "very high frequency" waves can pass around
some obstacles, but can still be blocked.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.800
These are mainly "line of sight" antennas.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800
Straight lines.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800
Think FM radio.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.519
Which is why it doesn't work over the curve
of the Earth or behind a mountain.

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.319
But, that doesn't stop all radio.

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.420
HF "high frequency" waves are my favorite
in this scenario…

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.010
Because, starting about 50 kilometers above
you is the ionosphere -- an electrically charged

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.700
layer of the atmosphere.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.140
Ham radios using the HF range can bounce their
waves off the ionosphere, creating a Sky Wave.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.090
That wave "skips" to another point on the
Earth… or hits another antenna -- which

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.920
might rebroadcast it!

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.390
All ham signals can be rebroadcast… someone
can pick it up, and send it out again.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.390
Like a relay!

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.780
I wasn't kidding when I said Swaziland!

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.950
But Swaziland isn't the furthest radio can
reach.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.330
In 1969, an operator in Louisville, Kentucky
picked up radio between Armstrong and Aldrin

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.659
on the moon during Apollo 11.

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.010
He even recorded President Nixon's message
to them!

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.349
You can still talk to astronauts with amature
radio today.

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.260
The ionosphere doesn't bounce all signals!

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.889
On the International Space Station, the crew
has access to a ham radio.

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:43.370
When they're overhead, their 2-meter FM transceiver
allows the ground can have a chat with space.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.680
You can see for yourself that the astronauts
are overhead, talk to them while they're there,

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.359
and then they fly away.

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:51.359
TAKE THAT

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:52.359
If you're fascinated by how far afield ham
radios can reach, the new CW show, Frequency

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.359
takes that even further.

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:54.359
In the show, a female police detective in
2016 discovers she can reach her estranged

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.359
father over the airwaves of her ham radio.

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.359
Plot twist: He's in 1996!

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:57.359
Don’t miss the Series Premiere of Frequency,
Wednesday October 5th, at 9/8c only on The

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.359
CW.

00:03:58.359 --> 00:03:59.359
It's pretty amazing that we can do all this
with waves of electromagnetic energy.

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:00.359
The more you think about it, the cooler it
gets.

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:01.359
Which is why DNews Plus did a whole thing
on LIGHT!

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:02.359
What is it anyway?!

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:03.359
Wait, what?

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:04.359
You don't know DNews Plus?

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:05.549
It's like DNews, but ten times longer.

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.819
We take a big topic, like Artificial Intelligence,
Leaving Earth, or Light -- and get nerdy with

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:10.819
it.

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.900
If you're smelling what we're cookin' subscribe
to DNews Plus on YouTube, or listen to it

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:21.100
as an audio podcast on Soundcloud or iTunes.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:38.240
Have you ever tried a ham radio?
