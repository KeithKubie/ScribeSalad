00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.560
&gt;&gt; Manuel Roig-Franzia: My
name is Manuel Roig Franzia.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.940
I'm a reporter at
the Washington post.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.020
And I'd like to welcome you
all to this very special event.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.750
First off, we wanted to thank
our cochairman of the festival,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.950
David Rubenstein and other
sponsors of this event

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.510
and wanted to point out that
if you are also interested

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.130
in supporting the festival,
you can look in your program

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.130
for information about
doing that.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.480
Also, we're very fortunate

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.540
that today Professor Jackson has
agreed to take some questions.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.110
So if after his presentation,
you would like to ask him

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.010
about this very interesting
work of his,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.770
please come to the
microphones and smile pretty

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.350
because I'm told that it
may be appearing later

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.260
on videos or on television.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.760
It's my pleasure to introduce
you to Lawrence P. Jackson,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.930
prolific author and professor.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.420
He has produced a
very comprehensive

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.770
and interesting biography of
an author we should all know

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.330
about named Chester Himes.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.860
Now, Professor Jackson
knows a bit

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.850
about well-known authors
in the United States.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.780
He also is the author of a
biography of Ralph Ellison.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.440
And myself as a person born in
Spain, I was interested to learn

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.360
that Chester Himes spent a
good deal of time in Spain

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.600
in the City of Alicante, just
one of the many surprises,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.230
I think, that you'll find in
this very interesting work.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.970
So with no further ado,
I will hand the stage

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.870
to Professor Jackson and I think
you will look forward to hearing

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.510
about this book that has
really shined a light

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.970
on a very interesting
figure in American Letters.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.770
Professor Jackson.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.080
[ Applause ]

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.850
&gt;&gt; Lawrence P. Jackson:
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.520
Can you hear me?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.420
Thank you so much for coming.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.810
I really appreciate it.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.190
I brought my book, the other
books that I've written before

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.940
because yesterday I
realized that no one knew

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.980
who Chester Himes was and I was
pretty sure they didn't know

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.690
who Professor Jackson
was either.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.150
And you have come to the
National Book Festival

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.110
and unfortunately you're
going to get something

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.410
of an academic lecture.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.210
So please bear with me because
I have a number of slides

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.030
that I think are fascinating.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.040
I will go through them very
rapidly so that we can have time

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.820
for a dialogue and I
really look forward

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.070
to hearing from your questions.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.310
So I started work
on this project,

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.500
biography of Chester Himes,
you know, sort of the unknown

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.590
of the four famous mid 20th
century African-American

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.610
writers, Richard
Wright, Ralph Ellison,

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.090
James Baldwin and Chester Himes.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.890
I started collecting
research in 2003

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.530
and it's been an
amazing journey.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.670
So Chester Himes was born
in Jefferson City, Missouri

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.740
and his claim to fame was that
he came from what amounted

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.760
to an upper-middle-class
African-American family.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.640
You can see Chester in
the christening dress

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.750
with his older brothers and
the two brothers, Chester

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.420
and Joseph Sandy Himes Jr.,
they were only separated

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.400
by about 18 months, so
they really grew up in sort

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.360
of close companionship.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.070
And Chester's father was
a blacksmithing instructor

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.780
at Lincoln University.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.800
Lincoln and if you've just come

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.210
from the Ron Chernow lecture
was founded by members

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.830
of the United States
Colored Troops.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.940
So, African-American
soldiers at the end

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.420
of the Civil War actually
founded a college in Missouri

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.620
and it was explicitly
designed to cater to the needs

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.920
of freed people, right?

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.480
It was going to-- as we, you
know, we're talking yesterday,

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.320
David M. Rubenstein was
talking about the crisis

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.280
of functional illiteracy in the
United States and the connection

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.800
between illiteracy and
social income inequality.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.880
This was actually on the agenda
of African-American soldiers

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.280
at the end of the Civil War.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.820
So Joseph Sandy Himes was
a blacksmith instructor.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.500
He's in the center
of this photograph,

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.520
sort of the small man with
the apron in the back.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.510
And he design things
for his family.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.320
He was sort of the apple
of his children's eye.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.090
But things were not always
easy in their household

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.080
and they left Lincoln after sort

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.160
of the Booker T. Washington
machine, I think, you know,

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.460
decided that maybe he was
a little bit too radical

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.910
and they went to Mississippi.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.270
Now, of course, it was also--
they're going there about 1913.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.610
So it's also at that
time that his expertise

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.320
in blacksmithing was becoming
absolutely outmoded, right?

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.180
So I say that he went some place

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.000
where the 19th century
was on more sure-footing.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.320
So they went to Alcorn,
Mississippi.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.720
So Chester's mother was
a very, very accomplished

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.130
and extremely well-educated
African-American woman named

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.660
Estelle Bomar Himes.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.510
And I-- you know, you can't
see his dad but so well

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.450
in the picture, but his father
was a dark brown skinned

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.730
African-American man and
his mother was very, very--

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.160
well, we used to use the
euphemism fair skinned, very,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.550
very light complexioned
African-American woman

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.950
who sometimes chose to pass
for white to avail herself

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.710
of services like the
dentist in Mississippi

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.010
that were unavailable

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.530
to African-Americans
she very strongly chafed

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.370
against the restrictions
of racial segregation.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.540
Chester Himes always
said that his father more

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.260
or less accepted the
second-class citizenship.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.060
Some of us believe that
there's only citizenship or not,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.370
but nonetheless, that
he accepted the role

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.030
of subservience that you
had to play for survival.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.770
And that his mother
absolutely rejected it.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.390
And of the two parents
when he was a child,

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.150
he began to be really drawn
towards his mother's point

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.450
of view.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.070
However, it created a great deal
of friction inside of their home

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.700
and they moved again
to Pine Bluff,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.280
Arkansas to another
African-American normal school,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.960
which is today a
branch of the University

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.900
of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.210
And in 1924, Chester
Himes's brother was very,

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.160
very badly injured in a
chemistry experience gone awry.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.420
So his brother was
only 18 months older,

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.740
wound up losing his sight.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:02.870
So the family moved to St.
Louis to go to the hospital

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.980
that was available
to African-Americans

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.410
for really complicated
surgical operations,

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.120
the Barnes Hospital
in St. Louis.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.250
And they bought a house not
far from Sumner High School

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.050
where Chester Himes
would go to school.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.620
But as you can sort of see

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.700
from this pattern already he
was moving around quite a bit

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.670
as a young person and
becoming a little bit unmoored.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:31.280
The family-- The Himes
family had two branches.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.300
And one of the branches of the
family had moved to Cleveland,

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.360
Ohio where there was a
great deal of opportunity

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:42.060
for African-Americans in
the early 1910s and 1920s.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:47.280
Roddy and Ella and Leo Moon
were his aunt and uncle.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.580
Roddy Moon was a
paterfamilias kind of a guy.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.370
He was one of the founders
of the NAACP in Cleveland.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:59.000
He had a federal government job
as a meat inspector, you know.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.240
And he let everybody know,
you know, that he wasn't going

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.500
to accept second-class
citizenship.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.300
They also moved beyond the
bounds of segregated Cleveland

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.110
and into sort of
an early version

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:12.930
of an affluent neighborhood.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.640
And after Joseph's sight
was completely lost,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.490
the family relocated
again to Cleveland

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.980
to this house at Everton Avenue.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:23.280
And even though, you
know, sort of went

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.670
through the Cleveland
slides quite quickly,

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.910
you know that by the time you
get to sort of the mid-1920s,

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.750
Cleveland is the sixth largest
metropolis in the United States.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.350
It was big city.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.340
Chester Himes, you know,
sort of grown up in this sort

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:43.360
of small country towns, you
know, not so far from Vicksburg

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.760
and Lorman, Mississippi.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.620
He'd lived for a little
while in Augusta, Georgia.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.090
St. Louis was a big city,
but still, you know,

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.790
maybe in a smaller neighborhood.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.850
And to heavily industrialized
Cleveland,

00:08:55.850 --> 00:09:00.710
his family bought a house in
a Jewish neighborhood in many

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.930
of the northeastern
and midwestern cities,

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.740
that's the pattern of migration.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.910
African-Americans
followed Jewish Americans

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.930
into somewhat suburban
neighborhoods often.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.990
And Himes graduated
from high school,

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:18.720
one of a very few black students
at an integrated high school

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.600
in the Jewish neighborhood
in Cleveland.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.690
It's worthwhile to remember that
Langston Hughes also has sort

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.220
of a similar academic career

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.780
and it's just a few years
older than Chester Himes.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.670
In the summer of 1926,
Chester Himes graduated

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.700
from high school-- he graduated
in January and he's working

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:42.320
at this really posh hotel,
the word park Manor Hotel.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.730
And African-Americans had all
the service jobs, the busboys,

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.960
the porters, the
custodial staff.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.790
And one day he was flirting
with two young white women,

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.730
and I sort of mention this
because it's going to wind

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.010
up coming up again and
again in the work and life

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:00.580
of Chester Himes'
interracial desire.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:05.430
He was flirting and he steps
backwards towards the elevator

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.820
doors and the doors open,

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.120
but the elevator car had
passed to the next floor.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:16.700
Himes free fell about 20
feet and he hit the bottom

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.590
of the elevator shaft.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.540
He broke several
of his vertebrae,

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.090
he broke his wrist off
in half, he chipped all

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.470
of his teeth, he broke his jaw.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.680
I think he ruptured his spleen.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.070
It was an incredible-- I mean it
was incredible that he survived.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:38.160
He was rushed to a hospital
and he was put in a body cast

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:45.250
and he had to convalesce for
a period of about 10 weeks.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.750
During this period
of convalescence

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:55.090
on the hospital ward, he's
surrounded by people who died,

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.550
one person from blood
poisoning, another person

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:01.200
from heart attacks, sudden heart
attack, and he also started

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.560
to receive, you know,

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.220
very powerful opiates
to reduce the pain.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.000
Himes then matriculate
to Ohio State University.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.230
He again is about
four years ahead

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.560
of someone like Jesse Owens.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:21.670
And Ohio state, the state of
Ohio, if you graduated from one

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:25.010
of the high schools, you could,
you know, sort of make your way

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:30.790
into the freshman class and they
did not bar African-Americans.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.760
What they did was they prevented
you from participating in sort

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.270
of the fullness of college life.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.290
You couldn't live
in the dormitories.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.610
They only had dormitories
for men at that time.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:43.510
You couldn't turn the social
clubs or eating clubs.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:48.190
You know, your social existence
was completely separate.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.690
And it was sort of
during this moment

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:55.350
that Chester Himes really
began a lifelong rebellion

00:11:55.350 --> 00:12:02.380
and also an incredible sense
of criticism and circumspection

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.370
about the African-American
middle class and black strivers.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:11.410
And there's some sort of really
remarkable stories that come

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:17.080
about helping us understand the
resilience of black social life

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.160
in the 1910s and the
1920s like the founding

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.040
of the famous black
fraternities and sororities.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.020
And some of us think that the
most famous of them were founded

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.670
in 1911 and have
the colors crimson

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.990
and cream, but there are others.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:35.070
And Chester Himes, you know,
was striving to belong to one

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.380
of the others Alpha Phi Alpha
which is found at Cornell.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:41.530
Kappa Alpha Psi was founded
at Indiana University.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:46.160
Omega Psi Phi is also founded
in 1911 at Howard University.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.480
And so he was sort of in
this group of black strivers.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.190
The son of Oscar Depriest,

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.730
the first African-American
congressmen

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.410
in the 20th century
representing Chicago is one

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.710
of his classmates.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.160
And, you know, he's
thinking, hey, you know,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.880
I'm going to be a doctor,
I'm going to be a doctor.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.610
But as I said, Chester
really started dealing

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:10.140
with some rebellion and some
0rebelliousness and also,

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.470
he's still sort of getting like
all of this pain medication

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:18.160
and he received a
compensatory stipend

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.180
from the Ohio Industrial
Commission.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:27.690
So then he was also like a super
wealthy freshman in college.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:32.750
This is at the same
moment that Josephine Baker

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:39.050
and Ethel Waters are wowing
and tantalizing audiences

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.340
with this new music
and these new dances

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.540
and the strong sexuality

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.010
of the 1920s also was
right there for Chester.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.360
It's a great picture.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.940
This is the-- it's not the--
This is the earliest picture

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.460
where you have sort of
a close-up of his face.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.170
This is Chester about 17, 18.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.910
He is a nice-looking young man.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:09.200
He flunked out of school
and returns to Cleveland

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.690
where his parents have divorced.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:17.140
They've sold the elegant home
in the Jewish neighborhood.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.940
They're constantly bickering

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.970
over what the child
support payments should be.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.950
His father who had been an
esteemed professor is now a

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.120
custodian at a nightclub.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:33.120
And on the portion of Cleveland
that Chester would know best,

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:38.990
you have a series of bars,
salons, gambling dens

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:41.340
and brothels really very close

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:46.190
to where the African-American
middle class would have been

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.590
if you were in the
segregated neighborhood.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.930
And the-- you know,
I want to say sort

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.320
of like the environment
pulled him in.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.620
And Chester started frequenting,
especially gambling club

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.990
and he became good at black
jack and he became good at craps

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.080
and he started to
get a reputation.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:12.180
And soon enough, Chester
was a part of like a--

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:18.450
not a syndicate, but a part of
a crew of, you know, robbers.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:23.360
And they decided to steal
pistols from the YMCA.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.560
Now, why they used to
store pistols at the YMCA?

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.000
I can't tell you.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.300
But they-- you know, sort of--

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.950
they got some pistols
from the YMCA,

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.020
they drove to Youngstown
to sell the pistols.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:40.530
He was arrested and he goes
to trial with short pants on

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:44.240
and the judge says, oh look
at this clean cut young guy.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.640
You know, he never would
have done anything, you know,

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.810
sort of this dastardly
or what have you.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.500
He was paroled to the
care of his parents.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.800
His mother and father
were fighting

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.190
about how he should
be disciplined.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:03.330
And in the late fall
Thanksgiving of 1928,

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:08.650
Chester decided on a lark after
getting a tip about some money

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:12.490
and jewels at the home
of Mr. and Mrs. Miller

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.870
that he would try
a daring robbery,

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:19.000
and he conducts a home invasion.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.840
He waits for them in the garage.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.730
He forces his way in, he steals
the money and the jewels.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:31.360
And he goes to Chicago
where he was arrested

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.710
and brought back to Cleveland.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:39.220
And here again, Chester
is-- he's 19.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:43.460
And, you know, he had received
a lot of support from his family

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.400
when he'd had these
other sort of--

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.680
I wouldn't say criminal
peccadilloes, but, you know,

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.750
were the-- all of the
stolen items were returned

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.520
and they paid restitution
and, you know,

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.670
he promised never
to do it again.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.710
And Chester went before a judge.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.190
One of the rulings I did notice

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.410
from Judge McMahon was
upholding racial segregation

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.750
in housing in 1928 in Cleveland.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:12.930
But he does before judge
McMahon shortly after or just--

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.700
it's right around
Christmas 1928.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.570
And the judge throws
the book at him.

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:22.880
And if you look at the ledger of
who came before Judge McMahon,

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.110
you know, sort of on that
day, Chester gets basically

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:31.230
as much time behind bars
as everybody else combined.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:37.640
So before he was 20, before
he had graduated from college,

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.220
I mean he never returned to
college, he was an inmate

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.830
at the Ohio State Penitentiary.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:50.040
Prison in the 1920s is
somewhat similar, I mean more

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.010
or less similar to prison today
with perhaps two exceptions.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:59.020
It was designed to break the
will of incorrigible men.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.740
And one of the things that
the guards did to do that was

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.810
that they used fairly
vigorous corporal punishment

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.050
that would have been
a steady part

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:12.160
of one's experience
of incarceration.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.270
And, you know, he's very
regimented, very harsh

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.930
and also African-Americans
were expected

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.920
to work in the coal company.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:26.170
They basically crushed coal
and fed coal to the boilers.

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.470
It was outside work and it
was considered the lowest

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:32.710
and most degrading of the
jobs that one had in prison.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.340
Because of his injuries, Chester
did not work in this company.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.250
He was in a company that they
called the "Crippled Company".

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.380
And they had somewhat
preferential treatment.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.650
So-- But in 1929 and 1930,

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:49.580
this wasn't really the
thing that consumed him.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:55.170
What happened was on April
21st, 1930, the largest fire

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.820
in American prison history broke

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.600
out at Ohio State Penitentiary
taking the lives of more

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.580
than 320 men, many of
whom were burned alive.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.910
Many-- probably the
majority, you know,

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.290
suffocated from smoke
inhalation.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:14.630
And it was a classic
case of really a--

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:20.290
an invertible tragedy and
also a very painful kind

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.170
of travesty, if you will.

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.870
What happened was once
the fire broke out

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.070
and the guards understood what
was going on, they started

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.640
to let some of the
prisoners out and they began

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.570
at the bottom tiers and
worked their way up.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.120
And ss you can imagine
by the time,

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.760
it's the sixth tier cell block.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.160
And by the time they got
up to the third floor,

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.460
the heat was unbearable.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.080
And so everybody
perished, you know,

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.680
if you were on the
fifth and sixth blocks.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.900
And the prison guards--

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.110
rather the prison
superintendent's point

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.300
of view was he was standing
on the outside of the gates

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.760
with a machine gun
trained at the entrance.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:05.500
And so it's sort of this
experience of seeing

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:10.530
such catastrophic loss of life
that Chester Himes really began

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:16.050
to turn inward and to think
of himself in a literally way.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:21.050
Almost immediately he
begins producing incredible

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.350
short stories.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:28.980
By 1934, Esquire magazine is
founded either right at the end

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:31.900
of 1932 or in the
beginning of 1933.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:36.720
By 1934, African-American
Chester Himes is publishing

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:41.270
short fiction in Esquire
magazine alongside Ernest

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:44.530
Hemingway, John Dos Passos.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.940
They are, you know,
sort of bringing

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:51.670
out a Leon Trotsky has
something in Esquire.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:55.930
Langston Hughes is the other
African-American writer.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.470
Esquire is definitely sort of
a transformative publication

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.720
for American literary
sensibilities

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:08.380
and it really begins to sort
of present the American male,

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.250
not necessarily as
the breadwinner

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.750
and father figure but, you
know, sort of more as the sort

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:18.710
of like a hip-- James
Bond kind of a figure.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:21.450
I'm looking for a metaphor.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:26.740
Himes becomes one of their
most highly regarded artists

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:30.710
and he publishes during
this time in venues

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.700
like Esquire what we call
"White Life Stories".

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.490
So there are only secondary
African-American characters.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.320
The protagonists to
the short stories read

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:45.420
into what Red Hill are white
American men and they're all,

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.230
you know, sort of enraged
and you're sort of dealing

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:53.490
with their inner world and
the struggles that they have

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:57.650
about confinement and, you know,
sort of longing and desires,

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.970
sexual desire but
especially, again,

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.510
this rage at being in prison.

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:08.920
And Chester then starts to think
about what his career would be

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.060
like as a novelist,
somebody who sort

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:14.410
of writes his way
out of incarceration.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:19.250
He has a couple of
really strong advantages.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:23.750
One of them was his cousin
Henry Lee Moon, this is the son

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:27.170
of Roddy and Leah, so
it's his first cousin.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:31.770
Henry Lee Moon winds up
being the press secretary

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:35.950
for Robert Weaver who is the
first African-American, sort of,

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:38.730
like the housing secretary in
the Roosevelt administration,

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:42.980
he-- Weaver is the highest
ranking black cabinet person

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.860
in the 1930s.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:49.000
You all have heard of the what
they call the kitchen cabinet

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.630
led by Mary McLeod Bethune that
includes people like Weaver

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.860
and with also, you
know, sort of gesture

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:59.240
to other African-Americans who
would have been sort of leaders

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.230
in either the union movement
like a Philip Randolph or people

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:07.300
like Walter White,
the secretary of NAACP

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.780
and then his deputy Roy Wilkins

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.570
and then the sterling
attorney Thurgood Marshall.

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:16.870
But Henry Lee Moon knows
all of these people, right?

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.110
They're all actually
intimates of his

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.590
and he's this important
journalist,

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:24.100
he's the first person to break
the story in the New York Times

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.190
and really international
press about the shift

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:29.030
in electoral voting patterns

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.090
that will enable
African-Americans who've moved

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:36.800
to major Northern
Metropolis to be able

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:38.620
to shift the balance
of power, right?

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:42.080
If the African-Americans get
behind the Democratic candidate,

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.050
then those candidates will
win because the balance

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:47.930
of power has shifted with
this new black migration.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.990
And, sort of, Henry Lee Moon
brings that out in a series

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:52.600
of articles in New York Times.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:57.210
And he really inspires Chester
who wants to sort of, you know,

00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:01.010
stay even with his
brother who earns a PhD

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.550
and then also his cousin,
you know, sort of a big shot

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:07.040
in New York, and Himes starts
thinking once I can get

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.490
out of prison, you know,
I can sort of make it.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.670
What happens also
with the fire is

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:14.570
that the Ohio State
Parole Board begins

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.830
to take its work seriously
and they start to parole men.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.480
So all of a sudden, he has
this 20-year sentence hanging

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.510
over him and it's reduced
to a seven-year sentence.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:29.350
So Chester comes out in 1936,
he goes back to Cleveland

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.510
where he's, you know, trying
to make it as a writer and sort

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:35.030
of hitting his head against
the wall as all writers do,

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:37.310
right, as all writers must.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:41.840
In the company of a really
progressive white couple

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.290
who have founded
a playwright house

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:49.470
for African-American artists,
the zealous, they introduced him

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:51.920
to one of the most popular
writers in United States,

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.510
Louis Bromfield who has this
sort of remarkable place

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.170
in Ohio called Malabar Farm.

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:05.500
Katharine Hepburn and
Humphrey Bogart get married

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.460
at Malabar Farm in 1945, right?

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:14.350
So, Bromfield is, you know,
highly regarded, he is rich,

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.080
he seems to know what
he's talking about.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:20.610
He says, hey, Chester, you and
your wife Jean, you will come

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:24.170
out to Malabar for the summer, I
will introduce you to the people

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:28.770
in Hollywood, I'll take
your manuscript to New York

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.140
to my publishing
friends and, you know,

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:34.130
I will sort of make your career.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:35.890
One of the things that's
fascinating is that one

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:38.830
of his great friends, Louis
Bromfield's great friends,

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:43.100
was Edna Ferber the author
of "Showboat", you know,

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.800
that sort of brought Paul
Robeson really to the floor

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.830
of American culture when
he sings "Ol' Man River".

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:53.610
And Edna Ferber had
a hand in the career

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.020
of the African-American
novelists Waters Turpin

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:59.520
who publishes several novels
at the end of the 1930s.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.240
Waters Turpin's mother
had work for Edna Ferber

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.480
and Turpin himself had soft
of served during the summers

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.890
when he was in college as,
you know, sort of a help

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.810
around the house or at
parties, that sort of thing.

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:16.320
My mother is here with us
today and she had Waters Turpin

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.910
at Morgan State University
as one

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.570
of her English professors,
right?

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:24.070
So I think that Bromfield wanted
to do Edna Ferber one better.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.010
And he said, I'm going to take
this African-American ex-con

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:28.340
and I'm going to
make him, you know,

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.570
big major literary celebrity.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:35.810
And so Chester took him at his
word and he goes to California.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.400
That's what Bromfield said.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.840
He said, you know, you need
to go out to Los Angeles

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.790
where they're making
all these prison movies

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:46.860
in the summer of 1940, 1941.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.160
And so, Himes moves out there
and he gets the door shut

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.840
in his face every
place that he goes.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.140
People love Esquire.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:54.440
They know him from Esquire.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.800
They think that this sort of
tremendous work, but they say,

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.990
hey, man, you're way too black
to be in these places, OK?

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:05.400
And so, Chester becomes
quite bitter about, you know,

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.660
his rejection and
it's more than that.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.200
In fact, he had learned
that the--

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.560
that the racial integration
practices

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.930
with the war services
industries in California

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.530
where specially you have,
you know, you've got shipyard

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:24.240
and then you also have
these air force industries,

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.530
and these places are as
segregated as if you're

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.920
in Louisiana or Texas
or Alabama.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.170
And he says the only
thing that's different is

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:34.470
the attitude.

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:35.770
He says that whites

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:37.360
in California expect
you to be grateful.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.400
And he was absolutely disgusted.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:44.020
He at this time becomes more
and more closely connected

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.600
and enamored of the
very far left

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.920
but especially the
communist party.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.150
In the book I wrote called
"Indignant Generation" I say

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:56.960
that we should really think
about sort of three institutions

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.970
that have given us the
indignant generation.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.360
The generation of black writers

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:06.130
who really change national
attitudes towards issues of race

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:09.540
and also some issues of
what I think could be called

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.050
American imperialism.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:14.440
But the Communist Party,
the Julius Rosenwald fund

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.040
and the Federal Writer's
Project would be the three.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.000
The Communist Party
is very significant

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.440
as the first interracial
organization genuinely

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.950
interracial organization

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.240
that cultivates African-American
writers.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.000
And so Himes gets to
know this sort of side

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.400
of the world more
intimately in Los Angeles.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.540
He had worked as Federal
Writers' Project writer

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:45.060
in Cleveland in the end of the
1930s, at the end of 1930s.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:48.880
And you know, all of
these ironies they get--

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.740
he and Jean get this house.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:54.100
Sorry, I should go
back because I didn't--

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.770
excuse me, so that's
his wife, Jean Himes.

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:03.380
They meet when she's 16 and
he's 19, and Chester Himes,

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:07.900
the taller too, and then the
shorter couple are the leaders

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.500
of the communist party.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.620
I-- This is not in the book,
I only learned this actually

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.950
after the publication
of the book,

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:16.470
somebody identified
the photograph,

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.100
but that's the two couples.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:24.150
But the nicest house that
they ever lived in was one

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.890
that became available to them.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:34.430
Why? Because of the
Relocation Act

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:41.010
that removed Japanese citizen
from Los Angeles, right?

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:44.350
And this is halt off by
1943 in what we call--

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.270
sometimes we call them
the Zoot Suit Riots.

00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:55.440
In 1943 is as incendiary a year
as 1968 but we don't remember it

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:58.640
that way, which is interesting.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:05.640
In Los Angeles you had groups of
servicemen combing neighborhood,

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:10.750
beating Latinos and blacks who
are wearing the latest fashion

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.720
of the day, the Zoot Suit.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.690
And Chester said, he sat at this
house with a riffle on his knee

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:21.760
and he did that in
preparation of white mobs coming

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.520
to drag him and Jean out.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:30.610
You see a dramatic shift in
his writing in 1943, 1944.

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:32.970
He published in the NAACP

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:37.670
and in the Urban League's
journals fairly what I would

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:40.930
call fairly conservative
publications, you know,

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:44.530
I mean geared towards
the black middle class,

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:49.530
geared towards the white
philanthropic interest

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:53.500
and he's starting to
publish these really biting,

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:58.050
trenchant pieces that
advocated direct assault,

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:02.430
revolutionary practice against
the regime of segregation.

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:07.460
During in act-- during wartime,
remember this is sedition.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.300
So negro marauders are
needed, you know, at that time

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.780
for revolution is now.

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.880
And again they're coming out in
these mainstream publications.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.500
As you know, this didn't sit
well with the powers that be

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.450
and so you get-- he
started to be a target

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:25.190
of the FBI right at this point.

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:27.260
Chester Himes was undaunted.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:32.810
These kinds of being
surveilled or rejection,

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.840
sometimes even more direct
kinds of persecutions,

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:40.520
he never faced him and he wrote
what many people consider his

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.240
most daring and outrageous work

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.890
"If He Hollers Let Him
Go" let him go right

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:48.860
at this moment 1944, 1945.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:52.800
And if you think of "Native Son"
by Richard Wright, you know,

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.180
this book that sells
500,000 copies in 1940

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:59.490
as having an undercurrent
of sexual tension

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:01.790
between Bigger and Mary Dalton.

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:04.440
Remember Mary Dalton is
accidentally suffocated

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.630
as Bigger as carrying
her or he has carried her

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:08.010
into her bedroom, her mother,

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.530
sightless mother
appears in the doorway.

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:15.210
This novel "If He Hollers
Let Him Go" is about the

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:19.300
over current of interracial
sexual desire.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:23.240
And in fact it's a very dramatic
story in the book where I talked

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:26.370
about what he's done to
this book when it is going

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:29.080
through the process
of publication.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.820
Chester does meet Richard Wright
and he moves to New York or,

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.740
you know, sort of relocates
to New York where he

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.410
and Wright become friends.

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:40.430
Chester also, unlike other
writers who were sort of,

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:44.490
you know, playing the game
with publishers and reviewers,

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:47.870
he was combative if you,
you know, sort of came out

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:49.530
and you said hey, you know,

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:53.300
"If He Hollers Let Him Go"
was not sophisticated literary

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.840
technique, but especially
people who disagreed

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.680
with his politics,
he had words for you.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:03.810
And he often put them in print
in mainstream publications.

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:06.830
And he could sort of show
himself well for photographers

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:10.230
when he wanted to but he was
also widely known as a person

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:16.800
who was very fond of
a taste of whiskey.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:21.960
He became friends with Carl Van
Vechten, a literary tastemaker.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.850
Van Vechten, you know, sort

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:26.270
of gave us this really
remarkable photograph

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.800
in 1946 that's on the
cover of the book.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:33.010
Van Vechten was probably
the white man

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:34.730
that Himes was closest to.

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:38.680
They remained friends throughout
the rest of Van Vechtens's life,

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:43.750
he died in 1964 and Chester
always needed not just sort

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:46.600
of emotional or spiritual
support, but he often

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.210
like most writers
needed financial support,

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:51.260
and Van Vechten was
very good that way.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:54.920
Chester also got to know Ralph
Ellison and Fanny Ellison.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.640
In fact this is Chester's
shot of Ralph

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:01.600
and Fanny while they
are sharing Thanksgiving

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:06.610
in 1946 together--
1947 together.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:09.190
They were very close
friends, 1946, excuse me,

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:10.720
I'm looking at that thing.

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.670
Don't look at your own slides.

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:17.060
So the novel that I think
he should be best known

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.130
for is called "Lonely Crusade".

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:21.920
"Lonely Crusade" never
comes out in paper back

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.650
in an American edition.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:26.710
So that's part of the reason why
we sort of don't really know it.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.640
The books that are
available now are ones

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.960
that are-- they're UK editions.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:36.870
Chester around this time
really began the most snarled

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:40.550
and complex and combative
antagonistic hostile

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:44.330
relationship with publishers of
any writer I'm familiar with,

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:47.550
but certainly among
African American writers.

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:51.830
And he wanted this
book to be, you know,

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:55.040
sort of the great prize
winner and bestseller,

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.220
but unfortunately it flopped.

00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:00.520
And this was the-- in some
ways, this is the book I think

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.530
that we still need to digest.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:07.900
I mean, this is the book about
the difficulty of black labor

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:13.020
and the creation of a bonafide
black middle-class and,

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:17.660
you know, basically this is
a suggestion that we have,

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:20.300
you know, great distance
to travel.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.130
When his friend Ralph
Ellison read it, he said,

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:26.090
you know Chester you've
betrayed me intellectually

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:30.370
and they fell apart as friends.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:32.720
Ellison was becoming
known at the end

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.130
of the 1940s is really the--

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:39.480
not just the great black
intellectual, but somebody who,

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.950
you know, understood
themselves to be, you know,

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:42.590
sort of the great
artist and it's sort

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:44.280
of like Langston Hughes
and Chester Himes,

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.320
he's still like peasants
in some ways of, you know,

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.510
sort of a lofty picture
of Ralph Ellison.

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:52.460
And Ellison would often
say to admirers, you know,

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:55.240
that he thought that Chester
was intellectually dishonest.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:36:00.040
And it was sort of interesting,
Chester featured a, you know,

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:03.870
sort of kind of ad
hominem attack on Ellison

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:05.780
in the novel "Lonely Crusade".

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:09.460
It's hilarious, you
really must read it.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.930
Chester who was also was friends
with the guy in the center,

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:14.100
was Horace Cayton,
one of our sort

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:18.340
of under known African American
reviewers, intellectuals,

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:21.980
writer in his own
right from Chicago.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:26.170
But despite the support of
a really a group of people,

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:30.050
Chester still could not sort of
make it in the United States.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:34.330
And so, in 1953, he left the
United States really never

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:39.820
to return with the exception
of, you know, sort of 10 months,

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:45.900
11 months and it's really
coming down in 1955,

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:49.690
but he would take the
United States as a tourist.

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:52.140
And so, he had this
sort of, you know,

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.340
pretty good early success
when he went abroad.

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.850
He had some of his
novels translated like

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:59.360
"Lonely Crusade",
which is called

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.300
"La Croisade de Lee Gordon".

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:05.830
And then he also was able to
finish writing another work

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:07.570
of his, which is
incredibly import called

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:11.070
"The Third Generation" and that
was completed while he was sort

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:13.890
of traveling Europe,
living in Spain,

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.530
living in the United
Kingdom, living in France.

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:21.190
And it's sort of funny that
when they advertised this book,

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:24.310
even though Chester and
Ralph Ellison had a--

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:26.740
some people say it's
a night fight.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.260
They had a night fight
on New Year's Day,

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:32.780
1953 just before Chester leaves.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:36.920
And they still had to go to
Ralph Ellison for a quote

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:40.340
when they advertise the book
in "The New York Times."

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:45.140
On his way overseas, Chester
met this woman, Willa Thompson,

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:48.470
who was sort of from
an American blue blood,

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:53.190
blue vein social register
kind of a background.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:56.800
She was a Smith College
graduate, you know,

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.780
she had relatives
who were ambassadors.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:03.520
She lived in Belgium and
had a family in Belgium

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.800
and she had distinguished
herself also during the Second

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.100
World War.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:10.630
And they had this sort of torrid
love affair where, you know,

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.240
they wanted to get married

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.780
and be an interracial
married couple,

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.900
but the burden really
was quite extraordinary

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:22.160
in the early 1950s, even for
people living abroad certainly

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:26.440
for people trying to make a
living as a writing couple.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.740
And I think that one

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.970
of the reasons why Chester
didn't publish a book

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:33.420
in 1955 was that he spent
so much time writing letters

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.400
to Willa Thompson and she
certainly sent him about 100

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:39.550
of these, you know, four or five
pages single-spaced documents,

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.040
you know, it is sort
of exhaustively go

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.480
through every dimension
of their relationship.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.840
And what's fascinating was
that Chester was often accused

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.760
of using people and
it's not clear

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.090
to me how he would've
been able to use her.

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:53.960
I mean I think in
someway she got the better

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.260
of the relationship.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:39:00.160
But in 1967, he was asked by
the New York Times book review

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:02.840
to talk about his
work of fiction

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.100
that he enjoyed the most, and
he used that as an opportunity

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:09.330
to really expose some
of the intimacies

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:12.620
of their relationship.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.520
Overseas, we have
the reconstruction

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.500
of really unimportant and
very, very significant milieu

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.890
of writers and intellectuals,
which would write James Baldwin,

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:25.010
Chester Himes, Oliver
Harrington,

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:26.890
William Gardner Smith.

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:29.690
And that was a shot of Wright
and Harrington at the café,

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:33.430
James Baldwin is there,
there's William Gardner Smith,

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.730
he was from Philadelphia.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:39.060
And smith is, again, far left
African-American novelist,

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:41.510
political figure
in Philadelphia,

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:45.950
he's a youth organizer against
segregation and then, you know,

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:47.290
sort of goes overseas.

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:50.490
And then also more recently
sort of the man of the hour,

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:55.430
Richard Gibson, another really
a literary protégé person

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:59.200
who wins fellowships
and prizes at 19 and 20

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.040
and then goes overseas.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:08.030
When the Trump administration
released the JFK files,

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:12.600
the last batch 19,000 documents
were released in January

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.610
or at the end of December.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:17.180
It was revealed that Richard
Gibson actually was a Central

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.340
Intelligence Agency agent.

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:24.670
And this had been something that
he had been accused of mainly

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:29.770
by Chester Himes
as early as 1957.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:33.410
And the documents that we
have from the agency files,

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:36.600
I don't know that it's
necessarily the total release

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.590
of Gibson material.

00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:42.080
I requested these materials in
2004 and was told, you know,

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.200
that there was really
nothing to find,

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.180
but that Gibson began
certainly a formal

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:53.540
and official relationship as
a clandestine agent in 1965.

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:58.260
So as I said, Chester
was the overseas person.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:00.540
And so I'll get to
the punch line.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:03.640
The final shift in his career--
we would have called him sort

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.830
of a naturalist writer,
a social realist writer

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:08.890
in the language of
James Baldwin.

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:14.370
But in 1956 living overseas even
though he just published the

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:16.510
novel called "The Primitive",

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.510
which is about a weekend
interracial love affair

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:22.400
that ends in violence
and murder.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:26.050
But he had sort of
fallen in like

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:31.330
with a young German
actress, Regine Fischer,

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:35.920
and they live together in
Paris in the poor quarter.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.900
I mean, he always talked
about eating dog meat

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.170
because that's what to be
thrown out and, you know,

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:42.090
they were surviving on that.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:44.720
And she fell madly
in love with him.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.830
She esteemed him, this
is also at the time

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:50.870
of the famous black writer's
conference in Paris in a 1956

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:53.880
and she attempted suicide
several times that fall

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:59.190
and was eventually sent
to her parents in Germany.

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:04.190
And it's right at that
moment that French publisher,

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:07.720
editor of the Gallimard
publishing company,

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.280
Marcel Duhamel, approached
Chester Himes again

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.380
for the second time
in about two years

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:16.180
about writing a detective
fiction.

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:20.310
And Himes thought that it was
really low work beneath him,

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:23.760
but he was starving and
so he agreed to do it.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:27.180
And Regine Fischer she backed
him up and she would say,

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.830
you know, you can turn it into
great literature and, you know,

00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:32.170
sort of go ahead and,
you know, give it a try.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:36.330
And the result was a novel
called "For Love of Imabelle"

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:39.370
or "A Rage in Harlem"
turned into a film

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:43.150
in the late 1980s
starring Forest Whitaker,

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:45.980
Gregory Hines, and Robin Givens.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:50.020
And the plot was given Chester
by my Baltimore home boy,

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.580
Walter Coleman who
was an artist.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.510
And Walter said that the
plot is about the scam

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:58.600
where you say you're
going to turn, you know,

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:02.420
$500 into $25,000 and
it's called the blow

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:05.710
and Chester developed this plot

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:13.720
into a really absurdist
novel giving you the crisis

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:17.380
of black urban life
at the same time

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.900
that you can see
the hopelessness

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:23.410
of liberal American
political solutions

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.600
to that sort of crisis.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:29.720
And this is what took Chester
forward to a new generation

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:35.600
and made him so influential in
the 1960 because unlike many

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.280
of his peers, maybe
especially Ralph Ellison

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.370
who had sometimes a very
difficult relationship

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:46.460
with the writers of the
1960s and early 1970s,

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:50.150
Chester was beloved
by these writers.

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:52.380
I just want to get to a couple--

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.340
I'll show you a couple
of slides.

00:43:54.340 --> 00:44:00.200
For one thing, Chester Himes was
thought well loved and was sort

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.840
of connected to Malcolm
X because he continue

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.590
to write political journalism
even though living abroad

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:11.100
and he would always make this
really, really cutting remarks

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:15.930
about the capacity of the United
States to overcome its history

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:18.430
of slavery and racial
segregation.

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:22.770
And you can see Chester really
taking in some ways in France

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:25.830
at the time, remember that
Charles de Gaulle was the victim

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:29.760
of an assassination attempt
in, I think it's 1962

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:35.180
and Chester is sort of calling
out the French far right

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:40.500
and is also comparing them
to the state of Mississippi,

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.800
and he was always, you know,

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.180
sort of very outspoken,
very vigorous.

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:47.480
And when Malcolm
X visits in 1964,

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.110
in November 1964
interestingly enough, right?

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:52.100
He goes to see Chester Himes.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:54.430
Chester Himes had become--

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:57.730
he said when this magazine
cover was published in French,

00:44:57.730 --> 00:45:01.260
he said, everybody thought that
it was Nasser, and he'd sort

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:05.430
of become like these elder
statesmen of the, you know,

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.670
Pan-African, Pan-Arab world.

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:09.450
Pan-African world,
I mean, you know,

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:16.490
Nasser is the Prime Minister
of Egypt but that this was sort

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:22.730
of a kind of a literary cultural
and political statesmanship

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:26.340
that had the sort of
transnational boundaries.

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.500
And I'll leave you
with one final image.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.350
I actually, I really
love this photograph.

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:34.430
This is-- Chester
Himes died in 1984.

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:38.040
He was bed ridden pretty much
the last year of his life.

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:44.770
And because of the fall
from about 1973 onward,

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:47.080
I mean it was very difficult
for him to get around.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:52.190
And he went into a wheelchair,
I think, sporadically at the end

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:54.230
of the '70s and then more

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:56.920
or less permanent
confinement for the 1980s.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:02.030
But this photograph gives you
a sense of the indomitable will

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:06.640
of this black man from
Cleveland, from Jefferson City,

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:12.480
from Lorman, from Augusta, from
the Penitentiary and then also

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.680
who scaled the absolute heights
of American literary stardom,

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.480
as well as international
literally stardom.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.140
He always said that
people always talk a lot

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.440
about James Baldwin.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.430
I think James Baldwin was so
great there but I'm better known

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:26.890
in France than James Baldwin is.

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:28.690
Thank you very much.

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:42.010
[ Applause ]

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:44.460
We have time for some questions.

00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:00.460
&gt;&gt; I had a question.

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.510
What happened to his wife, Jean?

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:06.760
[ laughter ]

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.060
&gt;&gt; Lawrence P. Jackson:
Thank you.

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:11.800
So, Chester met Jean, as
I said, as sort of right

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:16.250
after he leaves school.

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:20.240
And they meet at
kind of a wild party,

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.170
and the wild parties were
always in the alleyway.

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:25.500
And he said he first started
carrying a pistol because he had

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:30.440
to protect the two of them, but
especially men that wanted to,

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:32.720
you know, sort of take
advantage of her and turned her

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.750
out onto the street
as a prostitute.

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:38.790
She married while
he was in prison.

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:44.570
She married one of the people
who was in his burglary gang,

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:48.580
who was as a fellow burglar
and part of the gang.

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:51.190
And they got divorced shortly

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:53.450
after Chester Himes
was released.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:56.640
And then he and Jean
really began what seem

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.260
like a genuine partnership.

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:01.250
I mean well beyond
romance that lasted

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:04.600
until he left the United
Stated through the 1940s.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.920
But what was fascinating
about the relationship,

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:12.450
and that was a source of deep
bitterness and strong insecurity

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:16.410
for Chester Himes
was that arguably

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:20.050
because of his prison record but
he believes that it actually had

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:24.230
to do with the preference
of American institution,

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:25.770
but especially American
liberals,

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:28.120
maybe just American liberals,
the strong preference

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.970
that they had for black
women over black men.

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:36.440
She had a flourishing career
in what was originally--

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:41.630
first she worked for sort of
nascent social welfare agencies,

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:45.440
the USO during the Second
World War, recreation

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:49.500
and social services at
women's confinement facilities.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.370
And he always, you know, again
was quite bitter and insecure

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:56.220
about the success that
she had more or less

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:59.700
in the white color
white world that he felt

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:02.010
like he was consistently denied
and it had something to do

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:04.290
with again this bitter wrangling

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:06.150
that he always had
with publishers.

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:09.210
And they also had a tremendously
tempestuous relationship.

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:12.640
Both were heavy drinkers
and did and said things

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:15.840
under the influence of alcohol
that they then later regret it.

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:18.740
And they, you know, sort of
went back and forth in the--

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:23.030
from 1948 for the five years

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:28.170
until basically the
relationship collapsed in 1952.

00:49:28.170 --> 00:49:32.740
And then they were
formally divorced in 1976

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:35.540
and he remarried Leslie Packard.

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:38.470
I'll show you the
slide of her who was--

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:40.880
became the caretaker
of his literary estate.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.180
Thank you for the question.

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:45.040
&gt;&gt; If I understood correctly,

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:48.780
if I understood you correctly
the rest of his life,

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:53.370
he spent in Paris,
was he buried there?

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:55.740
Did they ever go back
to United States?

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:57.560
And would he have
had more impact

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:00.140
if he would have
come back to America?

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:02.970
&gt;&gt; Lawrence P. Jackson: To begin
at the end, yeah, I have to

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:05.910
or I would hope that he
would have had more impact

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:08.700
in the United States if
he lived here, you know,

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:10.500
for the rest of his career.

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.830
He was the kind of
person temperamentally

00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:18.300
who found really any
residue or vestige

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:22.920
of the condescending attitude
of racism and the practices

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:26.070
of racial segregation
absolutely unbearable.

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:28.570
So he felt like he needed
to leave the United States,

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:31.750
I'm not to be able to endure
that, so in '53 he goes

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:33.430
to Paris really just
for vacation.

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:37.620
He lived in London for about
six months and they moved

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:41.950
to Spain for, you know,
a couple of months,

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:43.720
then he came back to Paris.

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:48.540
He goes to the US for more
or less all of 1955 and back

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:53.170
to Paris for about three years,
moving around Europe quite a bit

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:57.500
and then he settles
in Spain in 1969.

00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.330
That's when the house
that he started building

00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:02.940
in 1967 was complete and then he
completely relocated to Spain.

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:06.680
He spent with several amounts
time in places like Amsterdam,

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.570
wherever he sort of
met friends and people

00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:10.490
who were conducive to, you
know, sort of the things

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:12.010
that he was interested in.

00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:13.310
&gt;&gt; Was he buried?

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:14.610
&gt;&gt; Lawrence P. Jackson: Yeah.

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:15.910
And he's buried in Spain.

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:17.460
He's buried in Moraira in Spain.

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:18.760
Thank you so much.
