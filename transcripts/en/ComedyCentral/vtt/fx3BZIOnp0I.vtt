WENT ON THAT COOKING METH
BENDER WITH NICK NOLTE.

00:00:58.424 --> 00:00:59.392 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT WOULD BE HORRIBLE.

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:00.293 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT WOULD BE HORRIBLE.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:06.799 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.034 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S IT.

00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:43.135 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO WHAT HAPPENED.

00:01:43.168 --> 00:01:46.105 size:88% position:44% line:91%
HOW DID THIS ESCALATE TO THE
POINT WHERE A MAN IS DEAD?

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:48.708 size:81% position:41% line:91%
CNN, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
ANOTHER CHANCE HERE, SHED

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:50.009 size:81% position:41% line:85%
SOME LIGHT ON THIS FOR US.

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:52.712 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AN OFFICER CAN ORDER
SOMEONE OUT OF A CAR FOR

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.780 size:81% position:41% line:85%
JUST A VALID TRAFFIC STOP.

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:58.751 size:84% position:42% line:91%
I WOULD ARGUE THAT RIGHT UP
UNTIL THAT EXIT ORDER, HE'S

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:00.786 align:start position:0% line:91%
PROBABLY ACTING
CONSTITUTIONALLY.

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:08.728 size:88% position:44% line:91%
AND THEN OF COURSE, HE PULLS
HIS GUN AND HE SHOOTS HIM.

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:11.797 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, RIGHT, THAT
LITTLE  DETAIL.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.235 size:75% position:38% line:91%
IT TAKES A KEEN JUDICIAL
EYE TO SEE IT BUT YEAH,

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:20.273 size:88% position:44% line:91%
WE'RE LIKE 95% SURE THE PART
WHERE IT ALL GOES WRONG IS

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.575 size:78% position:39% line:85%
THE SHOOTING IN THE FACE.

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:26.112 size:88% position:44% line:91%
SO IT IS ALL GOING ACCORDING
TO A FAMILIAR SCRIPT SO FAR.

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:27.914 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS STORY.

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:30.783 align:start position:0% line:91%
HERE IS HAMILTON COUNTY
PROSECUTOR JOE DETERS

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:32.451 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT'S JUST SENSELESS.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:37.190 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THIS IS THE MOST ASSININE
ACT I'VE EVER SEEN A POLICE

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:37.957 align:start position:0% line:85%
OFFICER MAKE.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.992 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS IS WITHOUT QUESTION A
MURDER.

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:42.762 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M TREATING HIM LIKE A
MURDERER.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:43.463 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHOOO!

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:46.432 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; YES!

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:52.572 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH MY GOD LAM!

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:55.608 size:88% position:44% line:91%
THE COP WHO MURDERED THE GUY
IS ACTUALLY GETTING TREATED

00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:58.578 align:start position:0% line:85%
LIKE A MURDERER?

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.913 align:start position:0% line:85%
[BLEEP] MAN!

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:03.249 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE'S A  STRANGE PATTERN, I
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:06.852 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT IS LIKE THE COPS ARE
ENGAGED IN SOME DARK GAME OF

00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:09.388 align:start position:0% line:91%
TRIVIAL PURSUIT WITH BLACK
PEOPLE OR SOMETHING.

00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:13.125 size:88% position:44% line:91%
I MEAN SANDRA BLAND PULLED

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:23.569 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND WHAT REALLY TAKES IT TO
THE NEXT LEVEL N THIS

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:26.038 size:84% position:42% line:91%
CINCINNATI CASE IS WHEN YOU
START TO LOOK AT HOW THIS

00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:27.473 align:start position:0% line:85%
COULD HAVE PLAYED OUT.

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:30.476 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND ONE OF THE MOST
CONCERNING THINGS IS THIS

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:33.946 size:88% position:44% line:91%
POLICE INCIDENT REPORT FROM
THE UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.348 align:start position:0% line:91%
TAKEN SHORTLY AFTER THIS ALL
HAPPENED.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.251 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND IT SAYS THAT THE OFFICER
TENSING SAYS THAT HE WAS

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:41.754 size:84% position:42% line:91%
BEING DRAGGED BY THE CAR AS
THE DRIVER WAS TAKING OFF.

00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:44.690 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THAT HE WAS ALMOST
KILLED AND RUN OVER BY THE

00:03:44.723 --> 00:03:47.760 align:start position:0% line:85%
DRIVER OF THE HONDA.

00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:50.763 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WELL, THAT SOUNDS
TERRIBLE, OF COURSE, THAT'S

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:51.864 align:start position:0% line:85%
JUST WHAT HE SAID.

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:53.432 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOLD ON.

00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:56.335 align:start position:0% line:91%
IS ANYONE ELSE CORROBORAT
ING THIS.

00:03:56.368 --> 00:03:58.671 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; TWO OFFICERS
THAT ARRIVED AT THE SCENE

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:02.174 align:start position:0% line:91%
SEEM TO CORROBORATE THAT IN
THEIR

00:04:02.207 --> 00:04:02.575 align:start position:0% line:85%
STATEMENTS.

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:03.075 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:04:03.108 --> 00:04:04.009 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:07.647 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS IS PRETTY WELL
CORROBORATED, YOU GUYS.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.050 size:84% position:42% line:91%
IS THERE ANYTHING OUT THERE
THAT CAN UNCORROBORATE ALL

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:12.084 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS CORROBORATION.

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:14.654 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE FACT IS, PROSECUTING
ATTORNEY SAYS THERE IS

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:17.456 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOTHING IN THAT VIDEO
THAT SHOWS THAT AT ALL.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.359 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, THERE'S A
VIDEO.

00:04:20.392 --> 00:04:23.996 size:78% position:39% line:91%
WELL, LET'S JUST SEE WHAT
THIS VIDEO HAS TO SAY.

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:26.966 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN NOT LIKE ALL VIDEOS
ARE INNOCENT, RIGHT?

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:31.637 size:84% position:42% line:91%
YOU KNOW VIDEO DID KILL THE
RADIO STAR, YOU KNOW THAT.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.707 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SEVERAL MORE TIMES
TENSING ASKED DUBOSE FOR HIS

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.010 align:start position:0% line:91%
LICENCE AND THEN SOMETHING
HAPPENED.

00:04:38.043 --> 00:04:38.978 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:40.713 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT IF
YOU HAVE A LICENCE.

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:44.250 align:start position:0% line:91%
GO AHEAD AND TAKE YOUR SEAT
BELT OFF.

00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:46.585 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; GO AHEAD AND TAKE YOUR
SEAT BELT OFF.

00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:47.619 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; STOP, STOP.

00:04:47.653 --> 00:04:50.356 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LESS THAN TWO MINUTES
AFTER TENSING APPROACHED,

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.826 size:84% position:42% line:91%
TENSING FIRES A SINGLE SHOT
HITTING DUBOSE IN THE HEAD,

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:56.562 align:start position:0% line:91%
KILLING DUBOSE AS THE CAR
STARTS TO MOVE.

00:04:56.595 --> 00:05:02.535 line:91%
TENSING CHASES AFTER THE CAR,
AND ANOTHER OFFICER ARRIVES.

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:05.237 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OKAY SO, BASICALLY
MOTHER [BLEEP] YOU JUST

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.772 align:start position:0% line:85%
LIED.

00:05:06.805 --> 00:05:07.673 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:08.574 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:11.410 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
&gt;&gt; Larry: IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:12.712 size:75% position:38% line:85%
IT'S REALLY THAT SIMPLE.

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:15.548 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THEN YOUR BUDDIES
COVERED UP YOUR LIE.

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS IS WHAT IS SO [BLEEP]
INFURIATEING TO ME.

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:22.888 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THIS ISN'T THE FIRST
TIME A BLACK MAN HAS DIED AT

00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:25.057 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE HANDS OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF CINCINNATI POLICE

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.426 size:84% position:42% line:91%
DEPARTMENT IT IS JUST THE
FIRST TIME IT WAS CAUGHT ON

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:28.427 align:start position:0% line:85%
BODY CAM.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.563 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND I KNOW THERE WAS A
DEBATE ABOUT BODY CAMERA,

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:35.668 line:85%
BUT I'M PRO GOPRO, ALL RIGHT?

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:38.037 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT?

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.441 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF THIS HADN'T BEEN CAPTURED
ON CAMERA, SAMUEL DUBOSE

00:05:42.474 --> 00:05:45.177 size:78% position:39% line:91%
WOULD STILL BE DEAD, RAY
TENSING WOULD STILL BE ON

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.280 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THE STREET AND THIS EPISODE

00:05:48.313 --> 00:05:52.818 line:91%
ALL BE ABOUT BSG WHERE BLOOMER
SHOOTS ADAMA AND YOU WOULD BE

00:05:52.851 --> 00:05:55.454 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:06:13.672 --> 00:06:14.740 align:start position:0% line:85%
WAS.

00:06:14.773 --> 00:06:16.675 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY ARE NOT USED TO HEARING
OFFICIALS TALK LIKE THAT.

00:06:16.708 --> 00:06:18.844 size:84% position:42% line:91%
ACTUALLY, THEY'RE NOT USING
TO HEARING THIS OFFICIAL

00:06:18.877 --> 00:06:19.779 align:start position:0% line:85%
TALK LIKE THAT.

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:21.914 align:start position:0% line:91%
BECAUSE JUST RECENTLY HE
SOUNDED LIKE THIS.

00:06:21.947 --> 00:06:24.884 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HERE'S HOW PROSECUTOR
DETERS DESCRIBED A GROUP OF

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:27.153 align:start position:0% line:91%
AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO
ALLEGEDLY BEAT UP A WHITE

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:29.121 align:start position:0% line:91%
MAN, QUOTE, THEY WILL HURT
YOU.

00:06:29.154 --> 00:06:30.723 size:88% position:44% line:85%
THEY WILL HURT YOUR GRANDMA.

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:33.192 size:78% position:39% line:91%
THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS IS
THERE IS NO DISCIPLINE IN

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:34.260 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE HOME.

00:06:34.293 --> 00:06:36.362 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY DON'T GO TO SCHOOL, YOU
KNOW, THEY LIVE OFF THE

00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:36.996 align:start position:0% line:85%
GOVERNMENT.

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:38.197 size:84% position:42% line:85%
NO PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:45.371 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY JUST BEAT PEOPLE UP AND
FOR NO REASON.

00:06:45.404 --> 00:06:47.673 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: NOW HE SAID THIS
LAST MONTH, NOT YEARS AGO

00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:50.709 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHEN RACISM WAS COOL.

00:06:50.742 --> 00:06:53.446 size:81% position:41% line:91%
NOW LOOK, WHEN THIS IS HOW
YOU TALK ABOUT AN ENTIRE

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:55.314 align:start position:0% line:91%
COMMUNITY THAT YOU ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING WITH,

00:06:55.347 --> 00:06:58.350 line:91%
WHEN YOU PAINT THEM AS "THEY"
AND YOU TALK ABOUT THEM LIKE

00:06:58.383 --> 00:07:01.487 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY ARE LESS THAN HUMAN, IS
IT ANY WONDER THAT IT HAS

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.689 align:start position:0% line:91%
LEAD TO INCIDENTS LIKE THIS
IN THAT VERY COMMUNITY.

00:07:03.722 --> 00:07:07.059 size:78% position:39% line:91%
I MEAN SERIOUSLY, DID WE
