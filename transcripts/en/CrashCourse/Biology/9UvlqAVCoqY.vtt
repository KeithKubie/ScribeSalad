00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.660
Plants are freaking great because
they have this magical wizard power that allows

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.220
them to take carbon dioxide out of the air
and convert it into wonderful, fresh, pure,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.300
oxygen for us to breathe.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.719
They're also way cooler than us because,
unlike us and every other animal on the planet,

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.240
they don't require all kinds of Hot Pockets
and fancy coffee drinks to keep them going

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.680
The only thing plants need to make themselves
a delicious feast is sunlight and water. Just

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.440
sunlight and water!

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.859
Paula Deen can't do that and she makes fried-egg
bacon donut burgers.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:32.329
I'm telling you this is surprisingly good.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.350
This is a different kind of magic.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.449
But you know, part of this is plants! And
everything in it, in fact, everything that is in this McDonalds

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:44.329
in fact, everything that you have ever eaten
in your life is either made from plants, or

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:45.499
from something that ate plants.

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:52.499
So, let's talk about plants!

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.399
Plants probably evolved more than 500 million
years ago. The earliest land-plant fossils

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.379
date back more than 400 million years ago.
These plants were lycophytes which are still

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.729
around today and which reproduce through making
a bunch of spores, shedding them, saying a

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.090
couple of Hail Marys and hoping for the best.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.359
Some of these lycophytes went on to evolve
into "scale trees," which are now extinct,

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:19.469
but huge, swampy forests of them used to
cover the Earth.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.320
Some people call these scale tree forests
"coal forests" because there were

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.729
so many of them and they were so dense and
they covered the whole Earth

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.670
and they eventually fossilized into giant
seams of coal, which are very important to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.820
our lifestyles today.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.749
So this is now called the Carboniferous Period.

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:36.600
See what they did there? Because Coal is made
out of carbon, so they named the epoch of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.869
geological history over how face-meltingly
intense and productive these

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:40.719
forests were.

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:47.719
I would give my left eyeball, three
fingers on my left hand -- the middle ones,

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.119
so that I could hang loose -- and my pinky
toe if I were able to go back and see these

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.189
scale forests because they were freaking awesome.

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.679
Anyway, Angiosperms, or plants that use flowers
to reproduce, didn't develop until the end

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.109
of the Cretaceous Period, about 65
million years ago, just as the dinosaurs were

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.729
dying out.

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.599
Which makes you wonder if in fact the first
angiosperms assassinated all the dinosaurs.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.569
I'm not saying that's definitely what
happened, I'm just saying it's a little bit

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.090
suspicious.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.319
Anyway, on the cellular level, plant and animal
cells are actually pretty similar. They're

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.930
called eukaryotic cells, which means they
have a "good

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.260
kernel." And that "kernel" is the nucleus. Not "new-cue-lus." And the nucleus can

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.180
be found in all sorts of cells.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.870
Animal cells, plant cells, algae cells.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.689
You know, basically all of the popular kids.

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.430
Eukaryotic cells are way more advanced than
prokaryotic cells. We have the eukaryotic

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.819
cell and we have the prokaryotic cell.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.439
Prokaryotic basically means "before the kernel."
Pro-kernel.

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.129
And then we have eukaryotic, which means "good
kernel!"

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.310
The prokaryotes include your bacteria and
your archaea, which you've probably met

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.849
before in your lifetime, every time you've
had strep throat, for example, or if you've

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.290
ever been in a hot spring or an oil well or
something. They're everywhere. They covered

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.209
the planet. They cover you!

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.860
But like I said, eukaryotes have that separately
enclosed nucleus. That all important nucleus

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.010
that contains its DNA and is enclosed by a
separate membrane

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.709
Because the eukaryotic cell is a busy place
-- there's chemical reactions going on in

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.579
all different parts of the cell -- it's important
to keep those places divided up.

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.939
Eukaryotic cells also have these little stuff-doing
factories called organelles. I guess we decided

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:25.599
we would name everything something weird...

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.200
But, organelles. And they're
suspended in cytoplasm, continuing with the

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.519
really esoteric terminology that you're going
to have to know.

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.769
Cytoplasm is mostly just water, but it's some
other stuff too. Well basically if you want

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.780
to know about the structure of the eukaryotic
cell you should watch my video on animal cells.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.849
Let's just link to it right here.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.269
Plant and animal cells are very similar environments.
They control themselves in very similar ways,

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.590
but obviously, plants and animals are very
different things.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.810
What are the differences in a plant cell that
makes it so different from an animal?

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.930
Well that's what we're going to go over now.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.370
First, plants are thought to have evolved
from green algae, which evolved from some

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.930
more primitive prokaryotes, and something
plants inherited from their ancestors was

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.230
a rigid wall surrounding the plasma membrane
of each cell.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.269
So, this cell wall of plants is mainly made
of cellulose and lignin, which are two really

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.799
tough compounds.

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.590
Cellulose is by far the most common and easy
to find complex

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.190
carbohydrate in nature, although if you were
to include simple carbohydrates as well, glucose

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.910
would win that one.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.110
And this is because, fascinating fact:
cellulose is just a chain of glucose molecules!

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.070
You're welcome.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.000
If you want to jog your memory about carbohydrates
and other

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.260
organic molecules, you can watch this episode
right here.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.050
Anyway, as it happens, you know who needs
carbohydrates to live? Animals. But you know

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.060
what's a real pain in the ass to digest?
Cellulose. Plants weren't born yesterday.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.130
Cellulose is a far more complex structure
than you will generally find in a prokaryotic cell,

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.150
but it's also one of the main things
that differentiates a plant cell from an animal cell.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.030
Animals cells don't have this rigid cell
wall--they have just a flexible membrane that

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.350
frees them up to move around and eat
plants and stuff. However, the cell wall gives

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.690
structure to a plant's leaves, roots and
stems, and it also protects it to a degree.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.530
Which is why trees aren't squishy and don't
giggle when you poke them.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.400
The combination of lignin and cellulose is
what makes trees, for example,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.760
able to grow really, really freaking tall.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.860
Both of these compounds are extremely strong
and resistant to deterioration.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.060
When we eat food, lignin and cellulose is
what we call "roughage" because we can't

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.300
digest it. It's still useful for us in certain
aspects of our digestive system, but it's

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.360
not nutritious.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.570
Which is why eating a stick is really unappetizing.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.160
And like, your shirt. This is a 100% plant
shirt, but it doesn't taste good.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.320
We can't go around eating wood like a beaver
or grass like a cow because our digestive

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.140
systems just aren't set up for that.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.960
However, other animals that don't have access
to delicious donut burgers

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.370
have either developed gigantic stomachs like
sloths or multiple stomachs like goats in

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.280
order to make a living eating
cellulose.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.480
These animals have a kind of bacteria in their
stomach that actually does the digestion of

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.790
the cellulose for it. It breaks the cellulose
into individual glucose molecules, which can

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.060
then be used for food.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.480
But other animals, like humans -- mostly carnivores -- don't have any of that kind of bacteria,

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.510
which is why it's so difficult for us to digest
sticks.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:18.920
Ah! But there is another reason why cellulose
and lignin are very very useful to us as humans:

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.800
It burns, my friends!

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.090
This is basically what would happen in our
stomachs. It's oxidizing. It's producing the

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.180
energy that we would get out of it if we were
able to, except it's doing it very very quickly.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.500
And this is the kind of energy, like, this
energy that's coming out of it right now,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.860
is the energy that would be useful to us if
we were cows.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.530
But we're not. So instead, we just use it
to keep ourselves warm on the cold winter

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.620
nights.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.640
Ow! It's on me! Ow! Ahh!

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.080
Anyway, while we animals are walking around,
spending our lives searching for ever more

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.720
digestible plant materials, plants don't have
to do any of that. They just sit there and

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.110
they make their own food. And you know how
they do that? They do it with photosynthesis!

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.030
Another thing that plant cells have that animal
cells just don't have are plastids, organelles

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.940
that plants use to make and store compounds
that they need. And you wanna know something

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.650
super interesting
about plastids?

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.430
They and their fellow organelles, the mitochondria
that generate

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.520
energy for the cell, actually started as bacteria
that were absorbed

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.150
into plant cells very early in their evolution

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.830
like maybe some protist-like cell absorbed
a bacteria, and it found that instead of digesting

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:31.350
that bacteria for the energy that it has,
it could use that bacteria. That bacteria

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:36.550
could create energy for the cell or convert
light into lovely glucose compounds, which

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.490
is crazy!

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.510
Nobody's really, precisely sure how this happened,
but they know that it did happen because plastids

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.820
and mitochondria both have double membranes.
One from the original bacteria, and one from

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.580
the cell as it wrapped around it. Cool, huh?

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.700
Anyway, the most important of the plastids
are chloroplasts, which convert light energy

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.690
from the sun into the sugar and
into oxygen, which the plant doesn't need,

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:58.570
so it just gets rid of it.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.190
All the green parts of a plant that you see
-- the leaves, the non-woody

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:06.260
stems, the unripened oranges -- are all filled
with cells which are filled with

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.370
chloroplasts, which are making food and oxygen
for you.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.790
You're very welcome, I'm sure.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:15.270
Another big difference between a plant cell
and an animal cell, is the large,

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:20.730
central vacuole. Plant cells can push water
into vacuoles which provides turgor pressure

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.860
from inside the cell, which
reinforces the already stiff cellulose wall

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.120
and makes the plant rigid
like a crunchy piece of celery or something.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:33.169
Usually when soil dries out or a celery stalk
sits in your refrigerator for too long, the

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:36.550
cells lose some water,
turgor pressure drops, and the plant wilts

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:37.430
or gets all floppy.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:41.310
So, the vacuoles are also kind of a storage
container for the cell. It can contain water,

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:44.459
which plants need to save up, just in case.
And also other

00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:48.139
compounds that the cell might need. It can
also contain and export stuff the cell

00:08:48.139 --> 00:08:52.170
doesn't need anymore, like wastes. Some
animal cells also have vacuoles,

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.329
but they aren't as large and they don't have
this very important job of giving the animal shape.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.870
So now, let's do this. Let's just go over
the basics of plant cell anatomy:

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:04.319
1. They've got a cell wall that's made
out of cellulose and so it's really rigid

00:09:04.319 --> 00:09:05.610
and not messing around.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.870
2. They've got a nucleus in its own little
baggie that's separate from all the other

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.230
organelles. This is basically the headquarters
of any eukaryotic cell: it

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:18.569
stores all the genetic information for the
plant and also acts as the cell's activities

00:09:18.569 --> 00:09:22.870
director, telling it how to grow, when to
split, when to jump and how high...that sort of thing.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.579
Animal
cells have this kind of nucleus too, but prokaryotes

00:09:25.579 --> 00:09:29.129
don't. Which is why they're stuck hanging
around in oil wells and stuff.

00:09:29.129 --> 00:09:34.540
3. They've got plastids, including chloroplasts,
which are awesome green food-making machines.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:39.860
4. They've got a central vacuole that stores
water and other stuff and helps give the cell

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.209
structural support.

00:09:41.209 --> 00:09:44.779
And so, stack these cells on top of one another
like apartments in

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:45.509
an apartment building

00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:46.410
and you've got a plant!

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.370
And all of these unique features are what
make it possible for plants to put food on

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:55.370
our table and air in our lungs. So next time
you see a plant, just go ahead and shake its

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.040
hand and thank
it for its hard work and its service.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:02.060
Now, we went over that stuff pretty fast,
so if you want to go back and listen to any

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:06.569
of it, we have a review section over here
for stuff that you may not have totally picked

00:10:06.569 --> 00:10:08.329
up on or just want to watch again.

00:10:08.329 --> 00:10:12.699
It's not a huge piece of your life to re-watch
some stuff so go ahead and click on these things.

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:18.230
If you have questions to do with plant cell
anatomy, please leave them for us in the comments

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.410
and we will hopefully get to those.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:24.829
