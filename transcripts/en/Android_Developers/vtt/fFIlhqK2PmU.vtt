JOANNA SMITH: Many
Android users have

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.280
visual, physical, or age-related
limitations that prevent them

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.580
from fully seeing or
using a touch screen

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.110
or a hearing loss that makes
it difficult to perceive

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.640
audible alerts.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.180
I'm Joanna Smith, and I
want to help you understand

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.530
how much you can gain with
three basic accessibility

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.730
considerations.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.700
Because a few small
changes to your app

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.830
can make it accessible
to the majority of users.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.040
Not all Android users are able
to interact with their devices

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.230
in the same ways.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.390
But it is important to
make sure that your app is

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.310
usable by everyone.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.370
Your app's accessibility
can affect your number

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.680
of installs, the quality
of reviews for your app,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.430
and how long your users
will stick with you.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.090
Android makes it straightforward
for you to create accessible

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.690
apps, because it
already gives you

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.740
APIs for TextToSpeech, haptic
feedback, gesture navigation,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.212
trackball, and directional
pad navigation.

00:00:50.212 --> 00:00:51.920
And there are three
basic checks that you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.910
should make before
releasing any app that

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.360
will cover the majority of
accessibility scenarios.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.860
And while there are hundreds
of improvements you could make,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.790
it turns out that
focusing on these three

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.730
will take you most of the way.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.880
First, provide content
descriptions for user interface

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.540
components that do not
have visible speech This

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.700
is especially important
for ImageButton, ImageView,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.410
and CheckBox components,
because these elements often

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.210
influence the flow of the app.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.180
So use the
android:contentDescription

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.990
layout attribute or the
setContentDescription method

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.750
to provide this information
to the device's accessibility

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.870
services, so that they can
present it to the user.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.020
And to limit distractions
in your outflow,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.960
set the content description of
decorative graphics to null.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.780
I recommend using
the TalkBack app

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.580
to test each component for
logical content descriptions

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.890
and to be certain that nothing
in your app surprises you.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.970
Second, make sure that users
can navigate your screen layouts

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.120
using hardware-based
or software directional

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.070
controls, such as D-pads,
trackballs, keyboards,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.680
and navigation gestures.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.355
You should be
confident that your app

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:53.750
will support all of these.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.099
So be sure to test your app.

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:56.640
There are several
apps out there that

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.970
will help you simulate these
hardware controls for you,

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.700
such as the Eyes-Free Keyboard,
so that you can be certain

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.025
that every critical UI element
is reachable and focusable.

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.650
When a user cannot simply tap on
the component they care about,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.620
it becomes clear that the order
of each component is important.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.580
So check your app for
logical transitions

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.905
and adjust the focus
order as needed.

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:18.030
You can control the focus
order by setting elements

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.970
to focusable or not,
and explicitly stating

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.970
which element should
follow along a direction.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.460
Finally, you should
always provide feedback

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.490
using more than one mechanism.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.370
Combine audio feedback with a
secondary feedback mechanism

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.140
to support users who are
deaf or hard of hearing.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.980
For example, a sound alert
for the arrival of a message

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.760
must be accompanied by
a system notification,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.880
haptic feedback if available,
or some other visual cue.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.660
Now as I said earlier,
these three checks

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.374
will make your app
mostly accessible.

00:02:47.374 --> 00:02:49.540
But if you'd like to dive
deeper into our checklist,

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.380
you should check out
the documentation.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.310
There are plenty of
other considerations,

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.770
and you can even create your
own custom view controls

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.044
and accessibility services.

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:00.210
Now hopefully these changes
will help your app grow.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.960
But if you want to see what
other improvements you can

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.459
make, check out the rest of our

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.860
tricks, and help.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.740
But most importantly, just
continue to build better apps.
