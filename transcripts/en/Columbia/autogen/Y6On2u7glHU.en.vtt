this is work in progress but having said
 

00:43:00.569 --> 00:43:05.210
this is work in progress but having said
this you know the investment is

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:05.220
this you know the investment is
 

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.640
this you know the investment is
happening but you know we have to keep

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:07.650
happening but you know we have to keep
 

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:12.019

continent we will see a lot more intra

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:19.930

all of the international aid flowing
 

00:46:07.989 --> 00:46:10.649
all of the international aid flowing
into the continent and whether it has a

00:46:10.649 --> 00:46:10.659
into the continent and whether it has a
 

00:46:10.659 --> 00:46:14.279
into the continent and whether it has a
place in a developing Africa and whether

00:46:14.279 --> 00:46:14.289
place in a developing Africa and whether
 

00:46:14.289 --> 00:46:15.659

it in fact leads to sustainable

00:46:15.659 --> 00:46:15.669
it in fact leads to sustainable
 

00:46:15.669 --> 00:46:20.309
it in fact leads to sustainable
development well you can be cliche you

00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319
development well you can be cliche you
 

00:46:20.319 --> 00:46:22.649

can say but people have been saying more

00:46:22.649 --> 00:46:22.659
can say but people have been saying more

trade and less aid this has been the

00:46:25.769 --> 00:46:25.779
trade and less aid this has been the
 

00:46:25.779 --> 00:46:29.039
trade and less aid this has been the
mantra in many many agendas I think the

00:46:29.039 --> 00:46:29.049
mantra in many many agendas I think the
 

00:46:29.049 --> 00:46:31.559
mantra in many many agendas I think the
aid has been useful if you look at for

00:46:31.559 --> 00:46:31.569
aid has been useful if you look at for
 

00:46:31.569 --> 00:46:33.479

example the intervention in West Africa

00:46:33.479 --> 00:46:33.489

recently with Ebola crisis it has helped

00:46:36.929 --> 00:46:36.939

00:46:39.389 --> 00:46:39.399
bring the country that the region back
 

00:46:39.399 --> 00:46:42.389
bring the country that the region back
again to the fold but I think it's it's

00:46:42.389 --> 00:46:42.399
again to the fold but I think it's it's
 

00:46:42.399 --> 00:46:47.249
again to the fold but I think it's it's
also up to us nations African nations to

00:46:47.249 --> 00:46:47.259
