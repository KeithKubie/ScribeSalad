00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
For someone in the comedy space, I take things way too seriously

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.140
Mostly, games with my friends

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.720
Other times it comes from a place of caring

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.540
Like I'm hyperaware of everyone's feelings

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.880
And I feel this intense responsibility to make sure no one feels left out

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.440
Dude I love the one wheel. It feels like I'm flying

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.960
Right? All that terrain all the time!

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.920
I haven't quite figured out the dismount yet, but I'm getting there

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.680
We have to go to Santa Monica to ride at low tide. It is fantastic

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.720
Yesss

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.580
Wow... One wheels huh?

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.500
That sounds like too much fun

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.780
The two of you have one wheels?

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.000
I only have two wheels

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.820
You have two one wheels?!

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.820
No I have two wheels in one

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.240
Oh you mean like a bicycle?

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.960
A motorcycle

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.020
Oh! I mean - that's cool though

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.680
Cus it's like... If you have one that breaks, you have another

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.780
Yeah and you had to take a test for your two wheels whereas, we just bought our one wheels

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.440
Yeah but the two of you are having so much fun with one wheel

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.200
Oh my god D:

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.460
Thank you

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.400
One day I'll have one wheel

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.040
Today I just have two

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.660
Sometimes it's really stupid

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.700
Like I care about winning so much

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.820
More than any one person should

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.940
I am down to go above and beyond just for the knowledge that I won.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.940
*cringe*

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.620
You're gonna throw up

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.460
Throwing up

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.320
But taking things seriously is part of the reason why I'm here

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.380
I mean this shot looks kinda nice right?

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.720
Look how much effort it took

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.400
I take comedy seriously

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.500
NO! The punch line has to end with the word banana or the whole thing falls apart!

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.940
I take my friends seriously

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.340
Why didn't you attend movie night last Thursday?

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.520
You clicked attending on the Facebook event but you didn't attend.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.500
Anna

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.180
I'm sorry ;-;

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.760
Like you know how things are - it's Facebook

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.840
I'll make the next one

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.360
You didn't even post on the event wall

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.140
I'll die over a Facebook thing

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.540
You didn't even text me

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.380
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY EXTRA SNACKS I HAD?!

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.600
CAUSE TWO PEOPLE I THOUGHT WERE GONNA ATTEND DIDN'T SHOW UP

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.860
I even take masturbating seriously

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.520
Seriously, I have tried so many dildos; I've done so much research

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.500
Hehehe just kidding

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.360
What? Do you think I'm actually gonna do a masturbation cutaway?

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.960
Tch get the fuck out of here

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.300
*phone vibrates*

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.980
Seriously get the fuck out of here I have to stay on schedule

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.440
I've had people telling me to stop taking life so seriously

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.680
And I know what they mean

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.440
They mean don't stress yourself out over things that don't matter

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.700
But the problem is, only you can decide what matters

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.300
If Nerf games and role playing is something I'm passionate about, of course I'm going to treat it differently

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.960
And we all have those things, right?

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.880
Like I have a friend who's very intense about knitting

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.160
Or someone who's obsessed with metal music

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.560
I also have a friend who like loves and collects rocks so hard

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.340
And I think that this is a great thing

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.720
I think everyone's passions should be encouraged

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.060
Because think about it. If we didn't, then nothing would ever improve.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.180
Someone had to care about the Nerf darts so much that they created the Accustrike dart

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.280
Which has better range and doesn't wobble as much as the other one because of it's rubber tip no matter what Wren and Jake say

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.760
So no matter what you take seriously, keep it up

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.360
You know? Don't be worried that it makes you weird

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.240
Because it's also what makes you, you

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.540
I'm Anna Akana, stay awsome Gotham

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.200
Thank you so much for Wren and Jake for being on the episode today

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.180
Wren and Jake are from the Sam and Niko and the Corridor Digital channel

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.220
I've put a playlist together of a lot of my favorite videos of theirs

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.200
You can watch right here

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.320
And it includes a video of me in this ridiculous mushroom hat

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.840
So feel free to check it out
