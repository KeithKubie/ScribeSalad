00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.760
Welcome back.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.980
I'm now going to introduce
you to the

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.310
concepts of work and energy.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.490
And these are two words that
are-- I'm sure you use in your

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.220
everyday life already and
you have some notion

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.760
of what they mean.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.690
But maybe just not in the
physics context, although

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.340
they're not completely
unrelated.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.400
So work, you know
what work is.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.280
Work is when you do something.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.870
You go to work, you
make a living.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.480
In physics, work is-- and I'm
going to use a lot of words

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.500
and they actually end up being
kind of circular in their

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.350
definitions.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.220
But I think when we start doing
the math, you'll start

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.450
to get at least a slightly more
intuitive notion of what

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.250
they all are.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.580
So work is energy transferred
by a force.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.910
So I'll write that down, energy
transferred-- and I got

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.480
this from Wikipedia because
I wanted a good, I guess,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.780
relatively intuitive
definition.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.880
Energy transferred by a force.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.360
And that makes reasonable
sense to me.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.590
But then you're wondering, well,
I know what a force is,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.400
you know, force is mass
times acceleration.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.670
But what is energy?

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.069
And then I looked up energy on
Wikipedia and I found this,

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.190
well, entertaining.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.560
But it also I think tells you
something that these are just

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.770
concepts that we use to, I
guess, work with what we

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.900
perceive as motion and force
and work and all of these

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.630
types of things.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.160
But they really aren't
independent notions.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.380
They're related.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.150
So Wikipedia defines energy
as the ability to do work.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.430
So they kind of use each other
to define each other.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.090
Ability to do work.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.360
Which is frankly, as good of a
definition as I could find.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.520
And so, with just the words,
these kind of don't give you

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.390
much information.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.690
So what I'm going to do is move
onto the equations, and

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.000
this'll give you a more
quantitative feel of what

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.540
these words mean.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:55.470
So the definition of work in
mechanics, work is equal to

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.665
force times distance.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.030
So let's say that I have a block
and-- let me do it in a

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.720
different color just
because this yellow

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.540
might be getting tedious.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.840
And I apply a force of--
let's say I apply

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.740
a force of 10 Newtons.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.390
And I move that block
by applying

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.210
a force of 10 Newtons.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.770
I move that block, let's
say I move it-- I

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.960
don't know-- 7 meters.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.930
So the work that I applied to
that block, or the energy that

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.650
I've transferred to that block,
the work is equal to

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.880
the force, which is 10 Newtons,
times the distance,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.300
times 7 meters.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.150
And that would equal 70-- 10
times 7-- Newton meters.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.450
So Newton meters is one, I
guess, way of describing work.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.720
And this is also defined
as one joule.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.340
And I'll do another presentation
on all of the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.230
things that soon.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.920
Joule did.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.170
But joule is the unit
of work and it's

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.540
also the unit of energy.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.650
And they're kind of
transferrable.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.380
Because if you look at the
definitions that Wikipedia

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.620
gave us, work is energy
transferred by a force and

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.880
energy is the ability to work.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.900
So I'll leave this relatively
circular definition alone now.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.680
But we'll use this definition,
which I think helps us a

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.710
little bit more to understand
the types of work we can do.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.680
And then, what kind of energy
we actually are transferring

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.380
to an object when we do
that type of work.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.025
So let me do some examples.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.225
Let's say I have a block.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.290
I have a block of mass m.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.610
I have a block of mass m and it
starts at rest. And then I

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.200
apply force.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:09.070
Let's say I apply a force, F,
for a distance of, I think,

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.850
you can guess what the distance
I'm going to apply it

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.380
is, for a distance of d.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.500
So I'm pushing on this block
with a force of F for a

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.540
distance of d.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.290
And what I want to figure
out is-- well, we know

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.610
what the work is.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.630
I mean, by definition, work is
equal to this force times this

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.480
distance that I'm applying
the block-- that

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.930
I'm pushing the block.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.030
But what is the velocity going
to be of this block over here?

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.620
Right?

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.320
It's going to be something
somewhat faster.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.270
Because force isn't-- and I'm
assuming that this is

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.570
frictionless on here.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.040
So force isn't just moving
the block with a constant

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.420
velocity, force is equal to
mass times acceleration.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.430
So I'm actually going to be
accelerating the block.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.390
So even though it's stationary
here, by the time we get to

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.960
this point over here,
that block is going

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.290
to have some velocity.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.200
We don't know what it is
because we're using all

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.550
variables, we're not
using numbers.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.650
But let's figure out what
it is in terms of v.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.980
So if you remember your
kinematics equations, and if

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.120
you don't, you might
want to go back.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.060
Or if you've never seen the
videos, there's a whole set of

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.380
videos on projectile motion
and kinematics.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.170
But we figured out that when
we're accelerating an object

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.400
over a distance, that the final
velocity-- let me change

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.910
colors just for variety-- the
final velocity squared is

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.850
equal to the initial velocity
squared plus 2 times the

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.530
acceleration times
the distance.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.210
And we proved this back then,
so I won't redo it now.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.640
But in this situation, what's
the initial velocity?

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.525
Well the initial
velocity was 0.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.160
Right?

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.026
So the equation becomes vf
squared is equal to 2 times

00:05:50.026 --> 00:05:54.990
the acceleration times
the distance.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.830
And then, we could rewrite
the acceleration

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.180
in terms of, what?

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.050
The force and the mass, right?

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.010
So what is the acceleration?

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.260
Well F equals ma.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.450
Or, acceleration is equal to
force divided by you mass.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:18.910
So we get vf squared is equal
to 2 times the force divided

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.360
by the mass times
the distance.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.930
And then we could take the
square root of both sides if

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.930
we want, and we get the final
velocity of this block, at

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:37.140
this point, is going to be equal
to the square root of 2

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.780
times force times distance
divided by mass.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.760
And so that's how we could
figure it out.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.000
And there's something
interesting going on here.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.060
There's something interesting
in what we did just now.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.160
Do you see something that looks
a little bit like work?

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.910
Well sure.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.570
You have this force
times distance

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.090
expression right here.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.660
Force times distance
right here.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.290
So let's write another
equation.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:07.380
If we know the given amount of
velocity something has, if we

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.590
can figure out how much work
needed to be put into the

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.580
system to get to
that velocity.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.135
Well we can just replace force
times distance with work.

00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:15.690
Right?

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.370
Because work is equal to
force times distance.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.905
So let's go straight from this
equation because we don't have

00:07:20.905 --> 00:07:22.200
to re-square it.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.670
So we get vf squared
is equal to 2

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.370
times force times distance.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.150
That's work.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.230
Took that definition
right here.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.630
2 times work divided
by the mass.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.870
Let's multiply both sides of
this equation times the mass.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.150
So you get mass times
the velocity.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.290
And we don't have to write-- I'm
going to get rid of this f

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.530
because we know that we started
at rest and that the

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.180
velocity is going to be--
let's just call it v.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.390
So m times V squared is equal
to 2 times the work.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.090
Divide both sides by 2.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:03.380
Or that the work is equal
to mv squared over 2.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.860
Just divided both sides by 2.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.880
And of course, the unit
here is joules.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.570
So this is interesting.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:16.840
Now if I know the velocity of
an object, I can figure out,

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.590
using this formula, which
hopefully wasn't too

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.200
complicated to derive.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.110
I can figure out how much work
was imputed into that object

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:26.790
to get it to that velocity.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:31.270
And this, by definition, is
called kinetic energy.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.500
This is kinetic energy.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.760
And once again, the definition
that Wikipedia gives us is the

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:41.190
energy due to motion, or the
work needed to accelerate from

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.179
an object from being stationary

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:44.980
to its current velocity.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.490
And I'm actually almost out of
time, but what I will do is I

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.550
will leave you with this
formula, that kinetic energy

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.600
is mass times velocity
squared divided by

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.780
2, or 1/2 mv squared.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.150
It's a very common formula.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.030
And I'll leave you with
that and that

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.660
is one form of energy.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.680
And I'll leave you
with that idea.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.390
And in the next video,
I will show you

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.690
another form of energy.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.560
And then, I will introduce
you to the law of

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.590
conservation of energy.

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:11.220
And that's where things become
useful, because you can see

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.730
how one form of energy can be
converted to another to figure

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.190
out what happens to an object.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.640
I'll see
