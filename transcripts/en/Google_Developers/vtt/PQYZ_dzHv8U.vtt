KORY JEFFREY:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.745 --> 00:00:03.900
We are on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.816
I'm joined in the studio
right now by Michael.

00:00:05.816 --> 00:00:07.859
He is the VP of
Mobile at UserTesting.

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.150
Thanks for joining me, Michael.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.070
MICHAEL MACE: My pleasure.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.825
KORY JEFFREY: So let's start
with what UserTesting is all

00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:12.600
about.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.850
MICHAEL MACE: We are a really,
really, really, really,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.470
fast way to get user feedback
on an app or website.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.570
You come to our site, you
define the demographics

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.380
you need, the questions you
want people to answer, the tasks

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.560
that you want them to perform.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.150
And if it's an app or website,
you upload your build to us

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.752
or give us the
URL for the place.

00:00:30.752 --> 00:00:32.210
We then deploy it
out to our panel.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.856
They video themselves
doing what you've

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:35.980
asked for, so you get audio
and video of the screen

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.590
and of them talking.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.590
It's on a mobile device.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.850
We capture taps and swipes
and stuff like that.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.770
And then it gets sent back
to you so you can watch it.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.870
The turnaround time can
be as low as an hour.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.620
KORY JEFFREY: Wow.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.203
MICHAEL MACE: So it lets you get
user feedback within a design

00:00:49.203 --> 00:00:49.870
sprint.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.400
So you can do a new
build in the morning,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.384
you can then send it
out over lunch time

00:00:54.384 --> 00:00:56.050
and by the time you
get back from lunch,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.549
you're starting to
get those videos.

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:00.410
So really, really fast
feedback on usability

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.130
issues, or do they
understand stuff,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.540
or other things like that.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.400
KORY JEFFREY: Those
videos-- are they bite size?

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.145
Is there any way to
avoid data overload?

00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:13.520
MICHAEL MACE: So if you want,
you can do it all yourself.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.936
You come and define the test
and you watch all the videos,

00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:16.850
and that's fine.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.820
If you want, we can
do all that for you.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.680
So we'll watch the videos,
we'll pick out the highlights,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.970
and we'll explain--
OK here's the problem.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.721
Here are three little
30 second clips.

00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:28.220
So it's basically whichever way
you want to use the service.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.220
It's more expensive if
you have it full service,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.300
it's less expensive
if it's self service.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.600
KORY JEFFREY: So how does
that scale for you guys?

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.680
Obviously having to,
within an hour or two,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.987
be able to turn that around?

00:01:36.987 --> 00:01:38.320
You would need a lot of testers.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.670
Where do you source those?

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.550
How do you do that?

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.050
MICHAEL MACE: A lot of it has
been through part-time work

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.752
boards and other sorts of places
where we get word of mouth.

00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:48.460
So we haven't had to
advertise very much.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.980
It's kind of built
up itself over time.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.480
The company's about
eight years old,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.930
so we've had the luxury of being
able to grow it organically

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.430
over time.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.763
And we've got about a million
respondents available now,

00:01:57.763 --> 00:01:59.594
so it's turned into
a pretty big thing.

00:01:59.594 --> 00:02:01.010
We do thousands
of tests per week.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.120
KORY JEFFREY: Based mostly in
the US or all around the world?

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.220
MICHAEL MACE: English
speaking countries.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.820
So US, UK-- we're starting
to expand other places.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.550
We can do testing in
India, for instance.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.580
So if somebody needs
a particular country,

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.214
we can usually do some
custom recruiting for that.

00:02:14.214 --> 00:02:16.380
KORY JEFFREY: Having run
eight years' worth of tests

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.485
and seeing all of this
stuff, you must see a lot

00:02:18.485 --> 00:02:20.610
of interesting tidbits that
would be really helpful

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.160
for entrepreneurs as
they think about this.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.370
Can you share some of those?

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.161
MICHAEL MACE: Sure.

00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:27.250
A couple of greatest
hits, I guess.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.030
One would be-- never assume that
an icon or a particular word

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.150
is going to be
intuitive to your users

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.460
just because it's
intuitive to your team.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.370
You have no idea how many
weird icon designs we've

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.770
seen on buttons where
the designers think,

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.534
oh it'll be obvious that you
push this in order to do that.

00:02:45.534 --> 00:02:46.950
And when the users
get to it, it's

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.160
just like, what in the world
am I supposed to do here?

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.400
KORY JEFFREY: OK.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.275
MICHAEL MACE: So my
personal recommendation--

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:54.100
I know it's not pretty, but I
think the only two icons that

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.990
are universally recognized
on mobile devices

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.840
are the little magnifying
glass means search,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.820
and the question
mark means help.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.530
Everything else, including the
hamburger menu, a lot of people

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.570
will misunderstand.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.374
And so maybe you put
words underneath.

00:03:11.374 --> 00:03:12.790
Even though it's
not as pretty, it

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.620
makes your app look a
little more cluttered.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.453
The question is, are
you shooting for pretty

00:03:16.453 --> 00:03:19.040
or are you shooting for usable?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.752
When you have to choose, I
think you want to go for usable.

00:03:21.752 --> 00:03:23.710
The other thing we've
been seeing a lot lately,

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.334
that I think is a
really important one,

00:03:25.334 --> 00:03:28.810
is we are now able to
test out in the wild.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.700
So just recently we've
added the capability.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.040
We can deploy these tests
out directly to a smartphone,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.539
for instance, where somebody
who was walking down the street

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:36.950
can use your app.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.994
The level of distraction in
the real world when people

00:03:39.994 --> 00:03:42.160
are using mobile because
they've got stuff going on,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.243
and they're getting social
notifications and stuff

00:03:44.243 --> 00:03:46.140
like that-- it's
unbelievably high.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.600
So you'll see even a beautifully
designed app that is well

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.601
designed to convey information.

00:03:51.601 --> 00:03:54.100
People will see stuff that is
written right in front of them

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.630
on the screen, and
they just won't see it.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.564
It's this cognitive
distraction thing

00:03:58.564 --> 00:04:00.980
where they've got so much input
coming in when they're out

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.280
on the street that your
threshold for being obvious,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.880
being intuitive,
being usable, is much,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.430
much higher in the real world
than it is when you're doing

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.310
a design review
in some quiet room

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.990
where you project it up on
the wall and stuff like that.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.890
That's not reality.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.170
You need to be testing
stuff out in the real world.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.550
KORY JEFFREY: Interesting.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.720
So how do you get past that?

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.220
What are a few
little tidbits to get

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.169
past the design issue of having
so much information going in?

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.210
MICHAEL MACE: One thing
is the self-serving thing

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.760
of test stuff on UserTesting--
we'll set that aside.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.100
KORY JEFFREY: That's
good to start with that.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.860
MICHAEL MACE: I
think the big thing

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.340
is, being really sympathetic
to the situation that users

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.360
can be in and back stop them.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.900
So for instance, we tested out
one of the major restaurant

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.082
finding sites to see, OK, let's
have somebody actually pick out

00:04:47.082 --> 00:04:48.790
a restaurant and walk
to that restaurant.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.870
Let's watch their whole progress
as they walk down the street

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:51.800
and all that sort of stuff.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.410
We can turn on the
back side camera.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.540
We watch them as they
walk down the street.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.850
And what we found was,
one of the testers

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.540
ended up walking to a
restaurant that was closed.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.280
And when we looked
back at the app,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.420
it didn't notify them that
restaurant was closed.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.260
But it was just in one
spot on one of the panels,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.540
and it was just one word.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.190
And they flipped past it
because they were in a hurry.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.140
So if you're designing that
app, maybe what you want to do

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.330
is say, OK-- they went
from the app listing

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.640
to going to the map
function within the app.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.739
So they're obviously
walking to the restaurant.

00:05:21.739 --> 00:05:22.780
The restaurant is closed.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.140
Maybe we want to pop up a dialog
that says hey, just to remind

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.160
you, the restaurant's closed.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.480
Are you sure you want
to walk to it right now?

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.950
So you should assume
that people actually

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.910
don't see notifications
the first time.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.560
And if, by monitoring
their behavior,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.990
that tells you
that they probably

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.600
didn't get it the first time.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.100
You need to repeat
it several times.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.560
Sometimes that's going to
pester your users a little bit,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.740
so give them the chance to
opt out of that if you're

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.420
getting to be too annoying.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.770
But saving somebody 10
minutes when they're

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:52.770
walking down the street?

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.830
That's a huge deal
for a mobile app.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.340
KORY JEFFREY: In
that instance, we

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.405
talked about using the back side
camera and access to location

00:06:02.405 --> 00:06:03.840
and things like that.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.050
Do you deal a lot with
people and permission flows

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.569
on how they ask people
what they can use and when,

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.610
so that they're able to
do these types of things?

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.620
MICHAEL MACE: We get
permission ahead of time

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.970
so the users understand
exactly what's going on.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.315
We add a little red bar
at the top of the screen

00:06:17.315 --> 00:06:19.190
when we're recording so
that they're reminded

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.316
that recording is going on.

00:06:20.316 --> 00:06:22.773
And we also instruct them on
the things that they can't do.

00:06:22.773 --> 00:06:25.220
The big thing is, you're not
allowed to interview somebody

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.219
else without permission.

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:28.290
So you can record yourself
and that's just fine.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.660
But for instance, if
I had it running here

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.201
and I was pointing
the camera at you,

00:06:31.201 --> 00:06:33.470
I would have to ask you
permission under US law.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.551
Otherwise that's some horrible
wiretapping thing or something

00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:37.050
like that.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.304
It's awful, you don't
want to go there.

00:06:39.304 --> 00:06:41.470
KORY JEFFREY: I guess the
example I want to touch on

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.180
is-- if I'm building
an app, right?

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.990
And I have to ask for
permissions for things?

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.390
Do you ever come
to a point where

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.130
you have to actually
design for when you only

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.845
get partial permissions?

00:06:53.845 --> 00:06:56.220
MICHAEL MACE: Generally what
we do with the testers is we

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.850
get their permissions up front.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.870
If you're asking for special
permission within the OS,

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.846
like your app is asking
for their location.

00:07:03.846 --> 00:07:05.220
That permission
dialogue is going

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.730
to pop up the same as it would
any time other groups are

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.400
using that app.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.560
So they'll just do that.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.470
But for permission to
record their voice,

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.000
to record their image, take
information from their device?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.117
We've already cleared
all that stuff with them.

00:07:17.117 --> 00:07:18.200
KORY JEFFREY: Interesting.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.106
OK, so we're at Founder World.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:21.980
There's been thousands
of people walking here

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.380
over the past couple days.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.760
There's a lot of exciting
technology on the floor.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.754
What is it that you've seen
that's excited you here?

00:07:28.754 --> 00:07:30.170
MICHAEL MACE: In
general the thing

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.330
that's got me the most
excited, not just here

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.230
but in the industry in
general, is all the VR

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.560
and 3D stuff that's going on.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.014
I guess it's an
advantage of being

00:07:39.014 --> 00:07:40.180
in the industry for a while.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.784
I've seen some of
the former platforms

00:07:41.784 --> 00:07:43.200
since they became
really prominent

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.010
like the graphical interface
and the Web itself.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.320
The VR stuff-- when you combine
3D printing with all the VR

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.820
visualization we're
able to do now-- it

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.670
feels like the early
days of those platforms.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.620
As we dig in, we're
starting to be

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.550
able to create some really
surprising non-intuitive stuff.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.069
I had no idea.

00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:05.110
We don't know yet what to
do with the technology.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.693
To me, that's the most exciting
thing because these developers

00:08:07.693 --> 00:08:09.470
are literally creating
the future right

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.320
now If I weren't
working at UserTesting,

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.820
I'd be going digging
into that stuff

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.007
right now because I think
it has huge potential.

00:08:16.007 --> 00:08:17.090
KORY JEFFREY: Really cool.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.990
So a relevant, but maybe
side track question--

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.477
do you have a favorite
Google technology?

00:08:23.477 --> 00:08:24.810
MICHAEL MACE: It's hard to pick.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.690
I don't want to offend
any of the teams,

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.290
but since I'm a
mobile guy-- Android.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:28.960
KORY JEFFREY: Android?

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.751
MICHAEL MACE: Yeah.

00:08:29.751 --> 00:08:31.470
Because it's done so
much and has so much

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.230
impact around the world.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.380
KORY JEFFREY: Thank you
very much for joining us.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.750
MICHAEL MACE: My
pleasure, thank you.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.360
KORY JEFFREY: Lots of fun.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.776
And thank you guys
for joining us.

00:08:37.776 --> 00:08:40.319
We are on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:43.969
