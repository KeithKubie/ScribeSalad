00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.630
-Good afternoon
everybody and welcome

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.270
to this afternoon's
panel discussion,

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.040
Household Workers Unite, a
Conversation Between Scholars

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.510
and Activists, which
is a rare kind of event

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.170
here in the ivory tower.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.630
I want to tell you just a
little bit about the genesis

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.160
of this event and then
give our stellar panelists

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.390
a much briefer introduction
than they deserve,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.510
and then get out
of the way of what

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.730
I expect to be a discussion
that will educate, inspire,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.960
and challenge us.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.710
Household Workers
Unite takes its title

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.660
from the important book by
Premilla Nadasen, Household

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.570
Workers Unite, the Untold
Story of African American

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.800
Women Who Built a Movement.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.860
And at Radcliffe, we do not
have events that sell books,

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.770
so I'm going to show it to you
so that you can find it readily

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.870
in neighborhood
bookstores because I

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.370
think you will want it after
you hear about from its author.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.990
It's hard to overstate the
novelty of Professor Nadasen's

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.890
study.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.780
And in fact, when you look
in the Harvard online catalog

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.200
by its Library of
Congress subject headings,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.510
there are no other histories of
the domestic worker organizing

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.940
movement.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.190
In her story, an untold story,
ordinary domestic workers--

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.410
maids, cooks, nannies,
elder care volunteers,

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.480
and other household
technicians-- bond

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.730
together to become not the
victims who sometimes pop up

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.180
in our headlines but the
heroes of their own lives

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.590
and the founders of
an important movement.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.160
As Nadasen points
out, household workers

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.060
had long remained on the
margins of historical study,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.530
and marginalized three ways.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.130
Overlooked in histories of
the African American freedom

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.130
struggle, in histories
of the women's movement,

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.050
and in histories of the labor
movement in the post-World War

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.010
II era.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.970
In Nadasen's capable hands,
the organizing efforts

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.810
of household workers from
the 1950s through the 1970s

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.780
become a kind of hub
that ties together

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.460
these three major
strands of 20th century

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.750
history in a truly
intersectional and revelatory

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.400
way.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.740
Household Workers
Unite reminds us

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.510
that the home has long
been a central theater

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.890
of public combat,
peons to women's sphere

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.115
or the separation of household
and work to the contrary.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.270
So I'm the director of
the Schlesinger Library,

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.020
which is the premiere library
on the history of women

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.720
in America.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.580
And it's obvious why our library
would have an interest in such

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.960
a pioneering study.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.220
But we also have a
special relationship

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.580
to Household Workers Unite
because important parts

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.280
of Nadasen's research were
nourished by our collection,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.260
as you'll be able to read
about in this winter's

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.410
issue of Radcliffe Magazine
where Professor Nadasen has

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.340
written an article
about her hunt

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.420
for records of the silent
voices of often invisible actors

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.150
in our national stories.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.350
Today's conversation
uses Nadasen's book as a

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.260
jumping off point
for a discussion

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.970
about the current generation
of household labor

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.370
organizing and its relationship
to this long history.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.970
After Professor Nadasen makes
some brief framing remarks,

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.180
we'll proceed in
discussion format

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.000
first among the
panelists and then

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.891
between panelists and
this wonderful audience.

00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:41.390
I'm going to first introduce
the moderator of our discussion

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.220
who will be known
to many in this room

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.880
and to everyone on this campus.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.160
Rakesh Khurana wears an enormous
number of hats here at Harvard.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.090
He is professor of
sociology, Marvin Bauer

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.770
professor of leadership
development at the business

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.760
school, the master-- a role soon
to be retitled in part because

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.500
of his leadership--
of Cabot House,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.140
and the dean of Harvard College.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.430
He is the author or co-author
of five books and dozens

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.810
of articles and the
winner of many awards

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.680
both for his scholarship
and his teaching.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.370
His research specialties
include corporate governance

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.430
and leadership and the
sociological aspects

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.860
of labor market
economies, usually looking

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.910
from the very top down
and here having a chance

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.490
to talk about labor market
economies from the bottom up

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.970
and sideways.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.810
The activists of
our panel title are

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.930
a trio of sheroes, new
leaders in a movement

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.700
with a long history.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.030
The kind of people whose
papers-- hint, hint--

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.920
libraries like ours will
be collecting in future

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.830
so that researchers like
the descendants of Professor

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.180
Nadasen can tell their
story in decades to come.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.290
Seated next to Professor
Khurana is Lydia Edwards,

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.730
a movement attorney at
Greater Boston Legal Services

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.310
and implementation coordinator
for the Massachusetts Coalition

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.180
of Domestic Workers or MCDW.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.550
Edwards was part of a legal
and grassroots organizing team

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.830
that wrote and
successfully passed

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.800
the pioneering Massachusetts
Domestic Worker Bill of Rights,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.950
which became law in the
Commonwealth last April

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.930
and for which implementation
began just in the fall.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.260
With the MCDW, she
coordinates grassroots efforts

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.350
to implement the
new law, working

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.710
with domestic workers,
employers, labor,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.240
state agencies, and
academic institutions.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.200
She's been named one of the
city of Boston's rising star

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.860
attorneys under 40,
thereby reminding us

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.470
of her extreme youth, and The
Globe profiled her in December

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.120
as a Bostonian of the Year.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.920
She holds two law degrees, a
JD from American University

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.530
and an LLM from BU.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.000
She is currently running
for the state Senate, which

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.170
should give us all
hope for the future

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:11.330
of American politics at a moment
when hope is sorely needed.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.250
Monique Nguyen
Belizario, who formerly

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.640
worked with Ms.
Edwards at the MCDW,

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.250
has been since 2012
the executive director

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.030
of Mata Hari, a political
community dedicated

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.830
to advancing the rights of
and protections for women,

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.760
immigrants, and
domestic workers,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.510
three groups that often
overlap in the household.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.680
A strategist and
community organizer

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.740
known for using technology
in the service of advocacy

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.150
and movement building,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.510
Monique has spoken
on women's leadership

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.250
and empowerment, on
domestic worker rights,

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.830
racial justice, and immigrant
rights at campuses and events

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.790
across the country.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.080
She is the recipient
of many awards,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.500
including to name just a few
the May Takayanagi Making Waves

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.110
Award from the Asian
American Resource Workshop,

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.650
the Salt of the Earth Award
from Community Labor United,

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.500
and the Horace Seldon
then Emerging Leader

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.930
Award from Community
Change Incorporated.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.480
She notes that her
drive for social justice

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.455
is rooted in her own
personal experience

00:07:16.455 --> 00:07:21.270
as an immigrant and daughter
of Vietnam War refugees

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.760
who gave her a wonderful
education in the conditions

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.140
of the possible.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.400
Our third activist and leader
at the left end of the panel

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.520
here is Natalicia Tracy,
executive director

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.180
of the Brazilian Worker
Center, the nation's

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.830
largest Portuguese-speaking
workers' rights organization.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.030
Before heading up the BWC, she
worked with Edwards and Nguyen

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.230
as the Massachusetts Coalition
for Domestic Workers.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.060
So an incubator of
both legislative change

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.700
and a new generation
of leadership.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.100
In addition to her
work with the MCDW's

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.980
successful legislative campaign,
Tracy is leading a Connecticut

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.030
effort towards passage of a
Domestic Workers Civil Rights

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.650
Bill in the past
year, and she tells me

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.940
that there's reason
to be hopeful.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.690
She sits on the board of the
National Domestic Workers

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.310
Alliance, where she
is Vice President,

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:17.700
and on the boards of the
Women's Institute for Leadership

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:22.600
Development, Jobs With Justice,
Greater Boston Legal Services.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.460
She is also, somehow in
the middle of all this,

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.030
a Ph.D. Candidate in
sociology at Boston University

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.350
where she has been
lecturer in sociology--

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.059
or she's been
lecturer in sociology

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.580
at UMass Boston since 2010.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.929
That's almost as
many hats as Rakesh.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:42.630
In closing, let me circle back
to Premilla Nadasen, whose

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.450
work catalyzed this discussion.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.320
Dr. Nadasen is
Associate Professor

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.660
of History at Barnard College
where she writes, teaches

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.890
on the history of race, gender,
social policy, and labor.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:58.120
She is most interested in
the historic roots of visions

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.840
of social change and the ways
in which poor and working class

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.290
people, especially
women of color,

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.880
have fought for social justice.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.650
She has published extensively on
multiple meanings of feminism,

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.710
on alternative labor movements,
and grassroots community

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.150
organizing.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.850
In addition to
Household Workers Unite,

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.710
she is the author of the
award-winning Welfare Warriors,

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.750
which documents the
welfare rights movement's

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.940
claim to a basic minimum
income in the 1960s.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.090
She is also a believer
in the power of stories

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.820
to change the world
and she has recovered

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.690
the history of some of those
world-changing stories, some

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.420
of them at the Schlesinger.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.050
Please join me in welcoming
her and our other guests

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:41.870
to Radcliffe today.

00:09:45.493 --> 00:09:48.846
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:55.760
-So I've been asked to
give a few opening remarks,

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.480
and I just want to start by
saying thank you to all of you

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.060
for coming today.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.380
And to my co-panelists.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.320
And a special thank you to
Jane Kaminski for inviting me

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.010
and, I think, for having the
foresight to bring together

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.660
this panel of scholars
and activists.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.890
And finally, I want
to thank all the folks

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.350
at the Schlesinger
Library who did work

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.740
to put this panel together.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.310
Yours is the
invisible labor that

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.850
makes events like this happen.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.310
I want to begin by saying
a few words about why this

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:32.690
is such an opportune time to
talk about household worker

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.260
organizing.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.730
This is an issue that
touches all of us

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.060
in one way or
another, and something

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.620
that I've engaged with as
a scholar and an activist

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.430
for over a decade.

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.700
The domestic workers
I have come to know,

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.180
through observation
of their campaigns,

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.540
through attendance at
rallies and protests,

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.080
and through the sessions
of legislatures where

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.040
I have either
attended or testified,

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.940
have all been integral to
my intellectual development.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.010
And that is reflected in
the pages of the book.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.700
For me, it's tangible evidence
that theory and praxis

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.320
are inextricably intertwined.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.600
And theory emerges not
only from the ivory tower

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.180
but from the lives
of everyday people.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.280
And as an example
of the growing field

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.850
of socially-engaged scholarship.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.300
I feel enormously passionate
about this subject,

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.940
in part because of my own
family's history and connection

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.230
to this labor, but also
because of the inspiration

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.550
that I draw from the
worker leaders around me.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.910
This preoccupation his
even infected other members

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.930
of my family.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.220
I vividly remember
several years ago

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.910
when my daughter Indira,
at the age of six,

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.740
paraded around the house
with a sign that said,

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.740
dignity for domestic
workers, after I

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.916
asked her to clean her room.

00:11:58.916 --> 00:12:00.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.520
That's not exactly
the message I was

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.780
trying to convey to
her when I talked

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.730
to her about the rights
of domestic workers,

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:12.090
but it was a poignant example
of how, indeed, household labor

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.280
shapes our everyday lives.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.560
Despite the importance
of household labor--

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.410
and this is the cooking, the
cleaning, and the caring that

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.385
enables each and every one of
us to go to work or survive

00:12:23.385 --> 00:12:28.050
from one day to the next--
this is undervalued labor.

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:31.040
People-- usually women,
but not exclusively--

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.250
are expected to
do it without pay.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.970
In addition, this
work takes place

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.880
in the home, which
is not usually

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.210
considered a site of labor.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.350
Finally, as a paid
occupation, it's

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.270
performed by immigrant
women and/or women

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:50.430
of color, which has
profoundly shaped

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:55.640
the status of domestic workers
in law and social policy.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.040
In the 1930s, when basic
labor protections for workers

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.230
that we think of as
standard today were passed--

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.780
and this is minimum wage,
social security, overtime pay,

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.320
unemployment insurance,
as well as the right

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.440
to organize and
bargain collectively--

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.230
the vast majority of
domestic workers at the time

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.560
were African American women.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.560
And the racial and
gender politics

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.930
ensured that household
workers would be excluded

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.310
from the realm of labor rights.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.510
In many ways, the paid
household workers--

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.260
those people who we
hire to clean our homes

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.500
and take care of our children--
are outside the boundaries

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.130
of legitimate labor.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.590
And their work is
often unrecognized.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:43.250
Mainstream labor
unions rarely organized

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:48.150
to improve domestic workers'
labor conditions or wages,

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.790
and the common wisdom
among labor organizers

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:54.790
in the 20th century was that
they were unorganizable.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.330
Indeed, domestic workers
are hard to organize.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.980
They are what we
would call today

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.350
precarious workers, an
informal labor force

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:11.080
with very little job security
and with no benefits.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.450
Because they work
behind closed doors,

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.460
it's not always clear
which households

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.580
employee domestic workers.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.910
And even if we did
know, their workplace

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:23.170
would not be a strategic
space for organizing

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:27.470
the way a factory floor is
for manufacturing workers.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:31.140
The occupation is comprised
of women of color-- sometimes

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.720
documented, sometimes
undocumented--

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.076
and English may or may not
be their first language.

00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:38.450
And this is hardly
the image that

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.630
comes to mind when we think
about the stereotypical labor

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:46.320
organizer, but they are
labor organizers indeed.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.380
So despite these assumptions
and these realities,

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.860
there's a very long
history of domestic workers

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.420
who have organized successfully
and won rights for the sector.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.320
There was a national movement
in the 1960s and the 1970s.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.690
25,000 mostly African
American women

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:07.590
that I write about in my
book-- they had chapters

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:08.670
all across the country.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:12.240
In Atlanta, in San Francisco,
in Detroit, in New York,

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.630
in Cleveland.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.400
Many had ties to the
civil rights movement,

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.140
but, as I argue, perhaps their
most important contribution

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:25.160
was redefining the landscape
of labor organizing.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.700
They used storytelling as
a tool to organize much

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.840
like domestic workers
do today, and they

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:36.470
organized in public venues-- at
bus stops, on the city buses,

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.930
or in playgrounds.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:43.450
And in 1974, after nearly
40 years of exclusion,

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.970
they won federal
minimum wage protections

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:49.330
for household workers.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.760
More recently, in the
past 20 years or so,

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.600
we've seen an upsurge of
domestic worker organizing that

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.240
has pushed for bills of
rights around the country,

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.080
including here in
Massachusetts, that

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.210
is ensuring much needed
protections for the sector.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.950
In addition, in 2011, the United
Nations International Labor

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:14.270
Organization established a
Convention on Domestic Work

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.260
that set international
standards for this occupation.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.730
It's now left to countries
to ratify the Convention.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.390
So this is an opportune time
to talk about domestic worker

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.890
organizing because of the
way domestic workers locally,

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.820
nationally, and
internationally are standing up

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.270
and fighting for their rights.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:39.170
And contrary to messages
in novels such as The Help,

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.870
domestic workers are
not meek or fearful

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.480
but they are
outspoken and building

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.150
broad-based coalitions.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.240
We'll hear a little about
some of the work that's

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.550
taking place today
from women who

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:55.300
are at the forefront
of this struggle.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.590
But domestic worker organizing
is important not only

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.320
for the individuals
in this occupation.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.750
It also holds lessons for
other workers laboring

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.410
in a neoliberal economy.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.000
Workers today are
much more likely to be

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.490
independent contractors,
to work intermittently

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:18.579
or part-time, to not have health
insurance or pension benefits.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:21.560
In short, an increasing
number of American workers

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.145
are experiencing the conditions
under which domestic workers

00:17:25.145 --> 00:17:28.700
have labored for generations.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.880
Despite frequent laments
that the labor movement

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.510
is on the decline,
household workers and others

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:38.820
engage in nontraditional
labor organizing.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.070
And I would include the Fight
for 15 Movement, Uber drivers,

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.570
and adjunct faculty
are illustrating

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:49.110
that there is in fact a
growing, vibrant sector

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.860
of labor organizing led
by household workers.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.390
And that sector, I
believe, is through

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.340
their innovative
strategies can point

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.150
the way for other workers.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.029
Thank you.

00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:04.927
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.159
-Thank you.

00:18:14.159 --> 00:18:15.950
I really want to use
this as an opportunity

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:22.030
to really enable a conversation
and have the opportunity

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:25.076
to really do what Professor
Nadasen's book says,

00:18:25.076 --> 00:18:26.700
which is to let people
tell the stories

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:32.380
and let that really be the
driving force of our panel.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.912
But I have to say, I was
really excited, first of all,

00:18:34.912 --> 00:18:35.870
to moderate this panel.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.480
Thank you for the invitation.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.992
As was pointed out
earlier, I've been

00:18:41.992 --> 00:18:43.450
a dean for about
a year and a half,

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:45.200
so I've really been away
from my scholarship,

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.783
and it was really
great to sort of get

00:18:46.783 --> 00:18:51.730
an opportunity to sort of engage
in such a thoughtful book.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.684
And it also gave
me an opportunity

00:18:53.684 --> 00:18:56.100
to think more deeply about
what I normally study, which is

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.880
the tippy top of the pyramid.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.350
And at first thinking, why am
I being asked to moderate this?

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.504
But beginning to see the
relationship actually

00:19:03.504 --> 00:19:04.920
between what I've
been looking at,

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.020
which is the top of the pyramid
in terms of labor markets

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.450
and labor market
dynamics, with what's

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:13.460
happening at other parts and
less visible parts of the labor

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.510
market.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.750
In my own field of
organizational behavior

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.920
and sociology of
work, domestic work

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.380
has usually been sort of folded
into parts of the larger drama

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:27.975
and theater of social changee--
workplace demography or class.

00:19:27.975 --> 00:19:31.270
And in many cases,
what's really interesting

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.210
is that-- a very famous
sociologist who was pointed out

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:35.840
in your book-- Lewis
Coser predicted

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.810
the end of sort
of domestic work,

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.716
suggesting that that was
sort of-- between technology,

00:19:43.716 --> 00:19:45.090
social change that
was happening,

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.370
that we would basically
see the decline of it

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:49.310
in modern society.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.427
That it was no longer
central to modern society.

00:19:51.427 --> 00:19:53.510
That it was something more
associated with the age

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.810
of Downton Abbey
than it was now.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:59.410
And it is interesting
to see fascination

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.866
with the upstairs/downstairs
aspect set back

00:20:01.866 --> 00:20:03.490
in time, but in many
ways the mirroring

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.180
and the re-mirroring
of emergence

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.780
of domestic work in
contemporary society,

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.445
especially in
economies like ours

00:20:12.445 --> 00:20:13.820
where inequality has grown.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.470
To see some of the aspects
that we often would

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.430
associate with kind of
pre-industrial conditions

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.382
to sort of be reemerging.

00:20:23.382 --> 00:20:24.840
I think partly
because Coser failed

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.298
to predict the
growth of inequality

00:20:26.298 --> 00:20:28.100
and the slowing rate
of social mobility

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.790
that now confronts modern
post-industrial America

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.529
and the neoliberal world.

00:20:34.529 --> 00:20:36.820
And I think as a result of
that a new emergence of work

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.190
on the nature of
contemporary society

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.273
finds that domestic work
has really become central

00:20:40.273 --> 00:20:43.190
and reasserted itself, as
you beautifully pointed out

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.540
in the book on labor
market, stratification,

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:49.300
social movements, feminism,
and globalization.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.885
I think from that, the
growth in inequality,

00:20:51.885 --> 00:20:54.370
the decline of the middle
class, the differential class

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.670
positions of women,
and the division

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.440
of labor between--
increasingly we're

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.120
finding higher-educated
families married together

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.770
and how that is impacting the
nature of domestic work, who

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:07.670
performs domestic work-- I
think highlights, really,

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:11.190
that the domestic work itself
as a sort of system of work

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.610
can't be set apart
from an interlocking

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:16.480
system of understanding
race, class, gender,

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.440
and socioeconomic structure.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.570
So I think this is a
really rich possibility

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:22.710
to really talk about
how a history like this

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:26.896
really informs us of
the contemporary world.

00:21:26.896 --> 00:21:29.520
I think one of the other aspects
I would just sort of emphasize

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.030
before just sort of
jumping into the questions

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.850
is, I hope we have a chance
as panelists to discuss

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.990
the intersection of domestic
work on gender and feminism,

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.200
on class, and on
globalization because I

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.190
think those things can't
be decoupled in many ways.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:48.870
And I think it's also a
useful reminder that domestic

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:52.050
work itself was
originally done, when

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:57.300
you look at the
sociology of it--

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.720
and there has been actually
maybe less written in history,

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:04.500
but a lot written in
sociology-- in some ways, again,

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.510
partly not because I think it
was explored ethnographically

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.350
or narratively the
way you've done

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.420
so beautifully in the
book, but because it just

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.240
was linked to the
stratification of labor markets.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.505
And it was often lots of debates
about how should it figure in

00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:19.800
to understanding the economy.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.437
Does it count as work?

00:22:21.437 --> 00:22:23.520
What is the sort of cultural
system that binds it?

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.890
What's the role of
gender behind it?

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.981
Because for most
of human history,

00:22:28.981 --> 00:22:30.605
domestic work has
been an enduring part

00:22:30.605 --> 00:22:31.605
of the social structure.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:36.460
My understanding is
that the word familia

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.160
is derived from famulus, which
means house servant or house

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:39.790
slave.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:45.860
So you can't decouple all
of this in any easy way,

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:51.320
and it's historically associated
with social structures which

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.300
are sort of relatively
immobile, confined, socially

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:58.130
defined in very narrow ways.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.530
And as you point
out in your book,

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:06.060
and as we can read about in
the newspapers every day,

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.740
for many domestic
workers, especially

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.560
those that are sort
of completely isolated

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:13.380
and cut off, it's about
as close to wage slavery

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:17.840
as we have in sort of
contemporary United States.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.010
For too many people,
they still don't

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.530
have even what
minimal rights they

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.490
have protected by the state
in any meaningful way.

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:30.260
And as you point out in your
work, how vulnerable people are

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.310
to exploitation both
historically but in many ways

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.100
today.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:37.120
I think it's also
interesting to talk about,

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.470
when we say domestic
work, what does it mean?

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:43.530
Because I think it has a
wide-ranging definition.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.110
For some it might
immediately sort of

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:49.390
be thinking about defined
tasks like cleaning or ironing

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:53.430
or-- but then it gets into sort
of more complex things of child

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:56.860
rearing and shopping and
where it sort of relates

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:00.710
to the family or the group
or the household within which

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.504
it's operating.

00:24:03.504 --> 00:24:05.920
And it becomes sort of subject
to a very interesting thing

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.836
about what is the nature
of that relationship.

00:24:07.836 --> 00:24:11.690
Is it on that range
from contractual to kind

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:17.420
of gemeinschaft at least in
its illusion that somehow

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.590
it has community elements.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:21.630
Where does that exist
and how does that both

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:25.800
feed it's kind of continuation
as a part of the structure.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:29.050
So I think this is all
really wonderfully rich.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:31.490
I'm hoping to hear
from our panelists

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.729
on these and
obviously our speaker.

00:24:33.729 --> 00:24:35.770
So I guess one question
that just starts from me,

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:39.040
I'd like to direct
and then-- what

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.660
is the link between--
for you personally

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.370
on this link between
history and organizing--

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:49.510
and what lessons do
you think history holds

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:53.807
for organizers especially
as we see sort of shifts--

00:24:53.807 --> 00:24:55.390
and you were alluding
to this-- shifts

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:58.150
in the nature of our economy.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:59.700
-Well, it's interesting.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.720
I'm a historian, obviously, but
when I embarked on this project

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.730
I didn't fully
understand the ways

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:08.670
in which the African American
women who I write about

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:13.000
were invested in the history
of African American women.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.300
And I learned that they actually
initiated a history project

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:20.840
in their organization to
learn about the history

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.850
of domestic work, and they were
organizing at a very moment

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.060
when the field of women's
history, and the field

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.970
of African American women's
history in particular,

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:35.130
was emerging as part of
the discipline of history.

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:38.060
And so they attended
academic conferences,

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:41.030
they talked about this work,
they attended seminars,

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:45.220
and they were very invested in
this idea of rewriting African

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:49.630
American women's history
to include domestic workers

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:52.300
and working class
women in particular.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:57.950
But they also used history
as a way to organize.

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.960
They used history--
the history of the ways

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.210
in which African American
women have been confined

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:08.000
to this occupation-- as a way
to talk about how they could

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.580
imagine a different
kind of freedom

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.590
in the context of the
civil rights movement.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:14.380
How African American
women can begin

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:19.740
to forge a new set of politics,
a rejection of the old mammy

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:23.220
stereotype that had identified
African American women

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.550
primarily as domestic workers.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:29.490
-Is that something-- for our
panelists-- do you still see

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:30.240
that?

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.360
People using history as a way
of developing a communal story

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.040
outside of the African
American experience?

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:37.702
Monique?

00:26:37.702 --> 00:26:38.970
-Yeah.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:42.250
I definitely feel that history
is something that we always

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:43.810
start our stories from.

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:47.242
When we talk about our
story as in organizers

00:26:47.242 --> 00:26:48.950
of contemporary domestic
work organizing,

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:51.910
it always starts with why did
we get here in the first place.

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.300
Because historic exclusion.

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.810
And we always start
with that story.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.240
And along the way when we
were doing the campaign work,

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.490
we uncovered little
nuggets of history

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.350
that belongs as part of us too.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.260
Like whenever we discovered
Melnea Cass-- and Lydia can

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.120
speak more to that.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.980
Melnea Cass, in the 1970s?

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:08.700
-70s.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.469
-In the 1970s, she helped
pass domestic workers' ability

00:27:12.469 --> 00:27:14.343
to be covered under
minimum wage and overtime

00:27:14.343 --> 00:27:17.630
in the state, and also the
right to collectively bargain,

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:19.840
which was amazing to us in
the middle of our campaign

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.790
and it really gave us life.

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.380
So that's one of the examples.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:27.090
-So using histories of other
peoples, not just of the same--

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:30.990
and in the Brazilian, do you
find that or does it relate?

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:32.850
-Absolutely.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:36.640
We always are standing on
the shoulders of heroes to us

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.230
as we look back.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:42.850
Even something as recent as
the New York campaign, right?

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.900
So we're looking
at their history,

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.820
their process, their struggles.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.540
How did they put that
together for six years?

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.910
And you build on that.

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:55.740
And as Monique just
said, and then you

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.120
stumble on different
pieces of history

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:06.070
that in the 1800s or early
1900s under the worst conditions

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:09.030
that people were able
to rise and succeed.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.115
So that really starts to
energize the movement further.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.850
-Also in terms of--
I mean, not just

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:19.160
on the ground with the
organizing of workers--

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.150
but also with getting what
would be traditional opponents

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.180
to understand why this
is now their moment.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:30.010
This is their historical
moment to rectify a wrong.

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:32.610
And that was really what we
used a lot when we were talking

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:35.930
to legislators,
Republicans and Democrats

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.100
alike, to say this
group has been excluded.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.350
It was an intentional
exclusion to the 1930s.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:44.690
And it's now 2014
and someone could be

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.570
fired because she's pregnant.

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:48.710
Someone is excluded from
racial discrimination

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:49.820
under our state laws.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.190
She has no place to go.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:55.700
It is now our time to
collectively right this wrong.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:00.760
So using the historical--
the legal historical faults--

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:05.274
to actually rectify and
make that a galvanizing cry

00:29:05.274 --> 00:29:07.690
for the actual legislators,
it made them feel like a hero.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:09.990
It made them feel like they
wanted to do something.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.610
And OK, well this is-- I've got
to be part of the civil rights

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.850
movement, you know?

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:16.187
It was used that way as well.

00:29:16.187 --> 00:29:18.770
-I think it's really interesting
how the civil rights movement

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:21.150
analogy is used by
lots of movements now.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:25.120
And I think it's often framed--
when we look at the Supreme

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.830
Court on equality of
marriage, for example,

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:32.550
a lot of the use of the kind
of analogies have been akin.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.780
But I guess one
question I have is

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:37.250
what's the limit of
using that analogy?

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.680
So one thing you
mentioned in your work

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.100
is that a lot of the--
in the 1960s-- a lot

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.850
of the women-- African
American women--

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.410
were using it to rewrite
African American history.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.160
That in fact it was a
kind of dual project.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.120
One was a kind of affirmation
of an invisible group,

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.730
but also this intersection
with academia and scholarship

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:04.680
to sort of say there's an entire
forgotten group who we have not

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.700
understood who played a
critical role in history.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.820
How much does that
play for, say,

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:13.780
our new immigrant wave of
people who find themselves

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.130
in domestic work?

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:16.929
Or is it just really
the civil rights

00:30:16.929 --> 00:30:19.470
component, or is it also linked
to some of these other things

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:29.170
about being seen as somebody
whose-- the history contributes

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:34.350
to a sense of recognition that
there's a group of people,

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:36.770
that there was individuals
involved who shaped

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.110
the dynamics of our society?

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:45.680
Does anybody want to
take that or-- how

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.390
much does that play a
role because you described

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:50.830
two components.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:51.330
-Yeah.

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:57.980
The specific history of African
American women in some ways

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:01.154
I think foreshadows
what's happening now,

00:31:01.154 --> 00:31:03.070
and in other ways it's
a very distinct history

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.820
as you mentioned.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.620
And the legacy of slavery
that African American women

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:10.970
experienced was very
prominent in their organizing,

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:13.390
and so we hear references
over and over again

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:18.060
to the history of slavery
as it shaped the lives

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.540
of these domestic workers.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.120
And so when we talk about
immigrant workers today,

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.810
obviously the context
is different, right?

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:28.380
There isn't necessarily that
same history of slavery there.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.080
Maybe, but not necessarily.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.990
So I think we have to think
about the differences.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.462
One of the things--
I mean, I guess

00:31:37.462 --> 00:31:38.670
there are a couple of things.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:42.690
One is the question of
the lack of documentation

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:44.800
for some of the workers today.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.640
And I think that's really
important to consider.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.820
So we can think about what
is this historical moment.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:54.140
So in the 1960s and the
1970s, the historical moment

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.730
was fundamentally about
the civil rights movement

00:31:56.730 --> 00:32:00.350
and the politics of race as
it affected African Americans.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:03.220
I think if we look at the
political discourse today,

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:08.050
it is really about the division
between quote unquote Americans

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:10.790
and people who we consider
not Americans, right?

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:12.880
It's between the
documented-- the foreigners--

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.200
and the domestic laborers.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:21.810
Not domestic workers, but the
folks who are US citizens.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.100
And one of the
things that I find

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.340
most fascinating about the
contemporary organizing

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.350
is the ways in which labor
organizers today-- and it

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:32.330
includes all these
people at the table

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:35.740
now-- have been able to
cross that divide and say,

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:38.790
actually, when you talk
about workers' rights,

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:41.910
it doesn't matter if you're
documented and undocumented.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.590
That, in fact,
labor rights should

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:48.140
be entitled to people if
they're working in any setting.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.520
-Could I just ask a
follow-up on that?

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.526
I think there are
examples of that

00:32:52.526 --> 00:32:54.650
where we talk about workers'
rights as a universal,

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:58.410
but it does seem, and Jane
alluded to it earlier,

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:02.570
that within at least
our society there

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:05.430
is a fear of undocumented
workers given

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:09.375
the lower social mobility, given
the greater economic anxiety.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.210
Again, I'm not an
expert in politics,

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:17.180
but it does seem at least one
thing people are preying on,

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.200
who are taking advantage, is
trying to create divisiveness

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:24.900
within the working class and in
particular around undocumented

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:25.650
versus documented.

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:28.520
And how does your
work speak to that?

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.120
Because I do think there is
a sense of workers' rights

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:31.670
as universal.

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:35.920
We have the United Nations,
the ILO, but unratified,

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.520
and contemporary
political debates,

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:43.190
and even within union movements
some ambiguity sometimes

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:45.940
it feels or seems like
around how should we

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:52.340
think about people who have
citizenship or green cards

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.500
and those who are undocumented.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.560
And maybe some of the organizers
can also speak to that.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.420
-I want to go back
to the other question

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:03.180
where we are talking
about connecting history

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.600
to the present, right?

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.360
And when we talk
about domestic workers

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.880
then in the past and
African Americans,

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:14.780
we also need to remember
that in the early 1900s,

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.880
the Irish, the Polish,
the Italian-- these

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.889
were the jobs that
were available to them.

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:23.719
In some cases, those jobs
were eventually good for them,

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:24.989
right?

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:28.120
So they were also
part of this history

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:31.219
that now a lot of the
workers are doing this work,

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:32.480
they are Brazilians.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.940
They are El Salvadorians.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.550
They are Hondurans.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:39.139
So the connection is
there to the past.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:42.469
I think the difference here
that Premilla brought up

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:44.800
is the immigration
status, right?

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:49.600
So that creates a great divide
between OK, you are Irish.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.159
And you had papers, right?

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:53.460
You just had to get in
line and get papers.

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:54.989
But now there's no line.

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:56.909
There's no line to get
your papers, right?

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:59.590
So we have a broken
immigration system,

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:03.270
and we have 11 million people
and probably about half

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:06.050
of them are women and
I'm going to really guess

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:09.630
that a huge percentage of
them are doing domestic work.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.890
They are undocumented, right?

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:14.070
And they are, many
of them, afraid.

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.330
Many of them don't
know that they have

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:18.830
protection of the labor laws.

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:20.440
Basic protections.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.790
They have protection
against retaliation.

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:24.830
And so they are in isolation.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:26.820
So they're in a
space where every day

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.770
they get taken advantage of.

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:30.990
Many of them are coming
in not understanding

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:32.930
any of their rights.

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:35.100
So we deal with that
on the day to day.

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.420
And of course we cannot forget
history because unfortunately

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:41.140
history constantly
repeats itself.

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.770
So we try to fix it so
some of those really

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:46.940
bad historical moments
don't sneak up one us

00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:51.660
again and continue to over
and over again happen.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:56.320
So I do think that we have to--
when we speak with workers--

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.490
we have to draw on history.

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:02.130
And we have to draw on our
own personal experiences too,

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:04.070
and I do that all the time.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.590
I think one thing that
I left out of my bio

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:10.140
was that that was a domestic
worker for 15 years.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.760
I was brought here
as a domestic worker.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:17.480
I was in forced labor
making $25 a week.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:21.100
Working 90 hours a
week for two years

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.460
and sleeping on a
[INAUDIBLE] porch.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.460
And I shared that
with the workers.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:29.740
That's my history, but also it's
a history of many other workers

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:34.030
that are doing their job now
and feel trapped and feel alone.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.780
So we have a
responsibility to continue

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:41.292
to have these conversations
so we can correct that.

00:36:41.292 --> 00:36:42.750
-I really appreciate
that because I

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:47.340
think having that link back to
sort of the Irish and Italian

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.240
and Polish-- that part,
especially in Boston,

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:54.150
was a very-- that was the
jobs that were available

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:57.870
and given the ethnic
discrimination that took place.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.710
And I think just to
connect what you said,

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:03.540
I think we can't decouple this
from globalization, right?

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:07.950
Why are there huge
movements of people now

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:13.040
happening in ways that,
given the modern state,

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.720
what's leading to that?

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.300
Because there's
also, in California,

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:21.430
you can see people
coming from the Pacific.

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:24.960
And the Middle East has
become a place also.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.440
So I think one of the things
is we can't decouple this also

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.610
from the larger changes.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:30.920
What's happening
to our economy, how

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.150
we are doing immigration
policy, but also how capital

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:34.680
is flowing from one place--

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.480
-I just want to say
the demand, too.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.490
We cannot forget the demand.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.010
There's a huge demand
for the service.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:45.130
I mean, the country now depends
on 2.5 million domestic workers

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:46.340
every day.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:50.050
And by 2035, we're going to
need another 4 million of them

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:53.190
because people are
turning 65 every day.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:54.650
And people are having babies.

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:56.610
But all of us
women, we don't want

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:58.610
to stay home anymore
and take care

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.360
of the house and the children.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.690
We want to have a career.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:03.320
We have the right
to have a career,

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.020
and we find ourselves
trying to have a career

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.680
and trying to take
care of the family.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.270
But we're going
to need some help,

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.950
and we are needing some
help to be able to do both

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:14.140
and to do it well.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.420
So I think it's something
that we need to remember too

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.580
is the demand.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.620
And I think [INAUDIBLE] a long
time ago that we outsource

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:24.860
a lot of things, but we
cannot outsource our elderly,

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.620
our children, or our home.

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:30.620
Someone has to come and take
care of that right here,

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:34.500
and so therefore the need is
going to continue to increase.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.560
-If I can speak a little bit to
the demand, also in connection

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:42.120
to history, and also the
connection to immigration

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:45.430
and how they're all coming
together, in a lot of the work

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:48.190
that we do it's dealing
with modern day slavery.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.340
Human trafficking.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.160
Right?

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.340
So domestic workers are
number two in the country

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.186
to be trafficked,
and a lot of people

00:38:54.186 --> 00:38:55.810
don't know that
because they are unseen

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:57.270
and they're easily hidden.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.770
But when you can talk
to an individual about,

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:03.150
you too have gone
through slavery, right?

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:06.570
What we traditionally see
is slavery being open,

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:09.720
out there, in a field,
and being oppressed.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.790
And you do not see even
her as working, right?

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:14.920
You often can't even
see her as then being

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.602
a survivor of trafficking.

00:39:16.602 --> 00:39:18.810
There are people who I've
represented who didn't even

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:21.220
know, didn't even
know what they had

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:24.481
gone through was what we would
define legally as trafficking.

00:39:24.481 --> 00:39:26.230
And then the resources
that are available,

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.940
including a U or T visa.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:29.840
So it is looking
at the connection

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.880
between our own slave
history and what

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:35.359
has become today,
due to globalization,

00:39:35.359 --> 00:39:36.900
due the families--
some of my clients

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:40.360
were brought here to
work for diplomats,

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.990
for people who have
certainly the money

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:45.690
to pay them, and have been
totally exploited and hidden

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:47.150
away and not paid.

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:49.250
So it's the combination
of looking at immigration,

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:51.320
looking at the
globalization, looking

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.180
at why people-- the demand
to bring people over here.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.610
Not only is it that women
want to work, but a lot of us

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:58.360
can't afford not to.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.020
And as we say in the
movement, domestic work

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.840
is the work that makes
all other work possible.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:04.390
Right?

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:08.700
And so for many local and small
mini-economies within the home,

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:11.460
the domestic worker is vital
to that actual family having

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:12.650
an income.

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:15.410
And so when we began
to talk about slavery,

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:18.060
and when we began to
talk about economies,

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.320
and when we began to
talk about immigration,

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.550
we have to talk
about trafficking.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:25.240
And we have to talk about
that as a parallel track

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.250
to our fight.

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:28.280
And it galvanized
some workers and it

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.880
helps people to really
understand what they're doing.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.200
What they're part of.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.090
-Monique, do you want
to add something?

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:38.085
-No, I just-- it's just
a wealth of information

00:40:38.085 --> 00:40:39.460
and I'm just trying
to figure out

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:47.260
how-- how to even connect what
we're seeing on the larger

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.780
scale, how to translate what
we're learning about things

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.860
these big economic
ebbs and flows

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.340
and why we're even here to even
use that as a tool to organize

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.130
on the most basic level.

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:59.160
And we talked about
the power of stories.

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:04.130
I had some students ask
me earlier this week

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:04.940
at Smith College.

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.870
They were like, if
there was "the man," who

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:09.450
is the man that you're fighting
with on a day-to-day grind.

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:12.615
Beyond the agencies and
beyond the isolation

00:41:12.615 --> 00:41:14.680
of domestic workers
and organizing

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.550
across neighborhoods,
it's really the feeling

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:20.790
that you are disenfranchised.

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:24.360
The overall feeling, after
so many decades and hundreds

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:28.630
of years of being
ignored and oppressed,

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:32.230
that you can't do much.

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.630
You can't do much to
change your condition.

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:39.910
So the stories that
we come to spaces with

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:42.620
like, why am I here in this
country in the first place.

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:43.120
You know?

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.550
That's the main thing
that people kind of bring

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:46.730
to the table.

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:48.190
They're like, I
came here because I

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:50.350
wanted to send money
home for my child.

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:51.860
The most basic thing.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.340
That was the only place--
the US was the only place

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:59.140
that I was told I can make money
and send home to my children.

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.490
And then some workers
really identify with that.

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:03.460
And other workers
identify with the struggle

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:05.695
of even making ends meet
to even pay the rent just

00:42:05.695 --> 00:42:10.170
so you can go to work the next
day and have a place to sleep.

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:13.180
So our big question
as organizers

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:17.440
is how do we connect
the big level stuff

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.840
with the human level
connection stuff that we really

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.689
need to build the movement
to scale down [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:23.689 --> 00:42:25.230
-I love that because--
and I am going

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:27.120
to apologize because
I'm going to just keep

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.070
being there because this is
where my level of analysis

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.860
always come from the structure--
but thinking about how we

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.770
connect structure and
agency is, I think,

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:34.690
where the possibilities
for change

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:36.434
are because
structure in my world

00:42:36.434 --> 00:42:38.100
is that human beings
don't have choices.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.380
So in sociology,
everything is kind of

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:41.970
over-determined
in a certain way.

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:44.079
We obviously believe
there's some choices,

00:42:44.079 --> 00:42:45.620
but that there is
over-determination.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.440
Your book points out that
there's agency, right?

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.430
There's a possibility
for people to organize.

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:51.540
And you gave a mechanism,
which is storytelling.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.470
Storytelling somehow
can mobilize something.

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:57.339
A connection to history
that I'm not isolated,

00:42:57.339 --> 00:42:58.130
that I'm not alone.

00:42:58.130 --> 00:42:59.400
Social networks.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.500
The bus stop.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.130
These locales where
sort of agency

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:05.130
becomes possible
and collectivity

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:07.800
becomes possible and feeling
like you're part of a community

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:11.510
and you're not just an atomistic
kind of individual who's lost.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.260
But I want to just
explore this connection

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.762
a little bit because
I think it gets

00:43:15.762 --> 00:43:17.970
to the part of your book
about how do we move forward

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:19.180
if we're not able.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.620
So just pick up on a couple
of points that we're saying.

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:23.510
You pointed to the
role of gender.

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:25.800
That, in fact, a lot
of domestic-- and I'll

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.760
just-- I don't want
to mischaracterize it.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.590
But you have
situations, and it was

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:32.059
funny what you said at
Smith-- who's the man, right?

00:43:32.059 --> 00:43:34.350
But in some cases, at least
what I got out of the book,

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:39.910
was who's the woman who's
employing the domestic worker

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:45.970
or, for lack of a better term,
the manager or the person

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:49.820
who actually organizes their
work, what needs to be done.

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:52.150
Part of this, again,
comes from opportunities

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:54.660
that as workforce
both-- it could

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:56.712
be both a combination of
both opportunity, which

00:43:56.712 --> 00:43:58.670
is people voluntarily
going on to the workforce

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:00.960
or out of necessity,
that it's hard to lead

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.300
a life without having
to earn her income.

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:05.440
There is a combination of both.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.960
But partly because
also housework

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.320
is not equally shared, right?

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:14.580
We know from a lot
of research that,

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.520
while this current
generation of men

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:20.140
does more household work
than their fathers did,

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:23.850
men consistently overestimate
how much they contribute

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:28.670
to that by way-off
percentages from what

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:33.380
I've learned from my colleagues
and from personal story.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.140
So we still have gendered
division of labor

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:40.560
in the household.

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.390
And so we have this
very interesting dynamic

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:50.030
where gender and opportunities
among a certain class

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.530
of people.

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:51.904
And there was a
lot of discussion

00:44:51.904 --> 00:44:55.320
about this when Sheryl
Sandberg's Lean In came out

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:59.500
and-- who was that a book for?

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:03.005
And who could kind
of be in that space,

00:45:03.005 --> 00:45:05.110
in that circle, so she
basically was calling

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:06.990
for agency among people?

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:08.900
And who was left out
of that discussion?

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:12.644
And I guess I'd be interested
in just kind of exploring that

00:45:12.644 --> 00:45:14.060
on your own
experiences because it

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:18.380
is, as we learn from the
book, a gendered occupation.

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.900
But also the dynamics
of who is kind

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.130
of organizing that
work is also-- I

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:26.070
don't think we could leave
recognizing the role of gender

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:29.100
there as well.

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.900
-I think-- just to quickly put
some comments on that-- one

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.770
of the-- I wouldn't
call it pushback,

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:37.600
but one of the surprises
we felt I think

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:40.440
in talking to certain
employment groups,

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.380
certain women-based
deployment groups,

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:46.170
was how the Domestic
Worker Bill of Rights

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:49.260
or the empowerment of nannies
or house cleaners for higher

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:53.160
wages, for overtime,
was not readily embraced

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.040
by professional working women.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:56.540
Right?

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:57.939
Not readily.

00:45:57.939 --> 00:45:59.480
I wouldn't say it
was a fight, but it

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.210
was a surprising
conversation that I had not

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:05.350
intended to have to
justify in many cases.

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:07.480
That you need to pay
your nanny overtime.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.450
You need to pay her.

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:10.080
You need to have a
written contract.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:14.174
And the pushback,
why, was surprising.

00:46:14.174 --> 00:46:15.840
It was, so you can
go to work and so she

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.120
can afford to pay her bills.

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.790
But it was an irony because
I felt in some sense

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:23.130
the very same women who would
be encouraged to lean in

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:27.260
and to break down glass ceilings
in their professional capacity

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:31.280
as doctors, as professors, as
professional women were really

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:34.410
struggling with why do I--
I can't afford and would

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:38.830
I pay and she is just, and so
on and so forth, with my child.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:42.480
And so it was an interesting
dynamics that I--

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.570
in one case-- the class
and gender dynamic.

00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:47.780
And it was women who seemed
to have the hardest point.

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:51.020
Natalicia was instrumental in
getting a lot of labor-- men--

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.920
to come on board
to this movement.

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.970
So it wasn't as-- I don't know
that the push was as hard,

00:46:56.970 --> 00:46:59.040
surprisingly, with
working class man.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:04.232
So maybe there's a
class camaraderie there.

00:47:04.232 --> 00:47:06.190
So just speaking a little
bit about the gender.

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:08.315
At the same time-- just
one more point about gender

00:47:08.315 --> 00:47:10.090
and organizing-- at
the very same time

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:11.548
while there may
have been pushback,

00:47:11.548 --> 00:47:13.750
the biggest proponents
who were employers

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:17.890
for equality and for
recognition were also women.

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:18.390
Right?

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:20.306
Who were professional
women such as yourselves

00:47:20.306 --> 00:47:22.800
in academic settings or
professional women who

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.510
had themselves at one point
been domestic workers.

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:29.250
So gender played in and out.

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:29.750
-Yeah.

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:31.150
It's interesting.

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:34.220
Just to pick up on
your point, Lydia.

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:38.110
I think household
labor is simultaneously

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:42.190
the big uniter of
women across class

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:46.280
while it is, at the same
time, the big divider of women

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.410
across class because
there are women

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:51.880
who do this-- I
mean, lots of women

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.340
do it regardless of
your class background,

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:56.160
very often without pay.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.160
Very often struggle with
their husbands and spouses

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.830
about who does what.

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:06.940
But it's also the issue which
obviously middle class women,

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:10.110
upper class women,
rely on employing

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:12.060
other women to do this
work for them when

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:13.670
they have to leave the home.

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:16.260
So in that regard,
it has the potential

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:20.300
I think to build bridges
among a feminist community,

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.810
and in my book I talk
about how that in fact

00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:25.360
did happen at certain
moments, especially

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.550
around passage of the Fair
Labor Standards Act Amendment

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:30.660
in 1974.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:32.710
But it also helps us
understand and think

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:36.240
about why there has
been such pushback

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:39.190
against certain sectors
of the women's community.

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:43.040
And in fact, feminism to
some degree in the 1960s

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:48.370
relied on hiring exploitable
women to do this work.

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:51.490
And the entire feminist
project was dependent

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:54.452
upon hiring women.

00:48:54.452 --> 00:48:57.600
-I think that was such a
fascinating part of that story

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:01.233
because I think, again,
this interlocking dynamic

00:49:01.233 --> 00:49:05.020
of movement-- that
you can't just

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.810
look at these as simple
cause and effect.

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.434
Where you really have
to understand how

00:49:08.434 --> 00:49:11.870
they interlock with each other.

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:13.180
And the effect.

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.980
One thing-- and just want to
shift gears a little bit here--

00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.970
is as you said,
and it's come out

00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:22.790
a little bit, that
storytelling connects

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:25.620
domestic worker
organizing in the 1960s

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:27.420
and that it still
plays a role today,

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:33.290
that you tell stories
of exploitation,

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:35.100
stories of trafficking.

00:49:38.021 --> 00:49:39.020
It's really interesting.

00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:42.520
I have to say-- there's a
colleague of mine, Marshall

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.915
Ganz, who writes a lot about
the role of storytelling

00:49:44.915 --> 00:49:49.030
in the United Farm Workers,
which is a kind of similar area

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:53.250
where you had people who
were really marginalized

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:55.640
and they were not
connected to any location.

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:58.180
So, in fact, it was
even more complex

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:03.620
and also occupied this
very shadowy labor status.

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:05.610
Help me understand a little bit.

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:07.610
Why do you think
storytelling is so important?

00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:10.990
How it catalyzes agency.

00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:14.060
As a person who comes
from a structural view,

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:17.730
the idea that the epistemology
of subjective experience

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:23.550
can actually move things is a
really hard connection to make.

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:24.746
Or is it just a correlate?

00:50:24.746 --> 00:50:26.870
That we come up with
something happened and we say,

00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:29.950
oh look at the roles of
stories in that process.

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:33.980
I think it would be helpful
to understand how it is,

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:36.280
and maybe you could
share a compelling story

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.370
and tell us what it
means to you and how

00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:40.260
it might have affected
your own participation

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:42.100
or your own interest
in this area.

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.440
-I've always felt stories
are such a great tool

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:52.650
to break down stereotypes that
people have about one another.

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:53.890
Particular inside Mata Hari.

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:56.100
We're a multiracial,
multicultural organization

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:59.350
so we rely on stories to
really break down the things

00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:01.000
that people assume
from each other

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.280
about each other in society.

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.360
The messages and the
cues that you get.

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:09.840
I'll never forget this one
neighborhood meeting in Lynn

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:12.940
where there was a
domestic worker who

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:17.640
is a white woman that was
making less than minimum wage.

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:21.160
And she's been doing it for
four years with a family that

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.020
made a lot of money.

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:25.665
And I'll never forget our member
leader, who was a Latina woman,

00:51:25.665 --> 00:51:28.040
she was like, if that could
happen to a white woman, that

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.010
can happen to anybody.

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:29.656
Don't you see?

00:51:29.656 --> 00:51:32.030
That was something that was
a breakthrough because people

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:35.360
assume that only certain
groups of people are exploited.

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.760
And I'm the only one.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:37.320
You know?

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:38.944
Especially when you're
isolated, you're

00:51:38.944 --> 00:51:43.100
kind of feeling
that I did something

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.630
wrong along the way and this
is why I'm in this situation.

00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:46.950
But when you meet
other people and you

00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:48.580
see the themes and
the threads and then

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:51.660
there's something bigger that's
happening here beyond just me.

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:53.750
And I think there's so
much power because of that.

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:55.470
Using that one--
your single story--

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:57.950
to connect with other
people and share experience,

00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:00.900
and doing that to
scale, it's catalyzing.

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:01.610
It's amazing.

00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:03.190
It's powerful.

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.760
-Yeah.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:07.830
We see a lot of that
at the center as well.

00:52:07.830 --> 00:52:09.820
Storytelling is
powerful because, first

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.660
of all, a lot of
the women, they're

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:16.860
coming in and feeling uncertain
in learning about the new space

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:21.060
and what's happening, but
also not understanding what

00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:23.130
everyone else is going through.

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:26.430
And at the moment that you
start telling your story,

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:28.670
you become human again.

00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:29.800
You are vulnerable.

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.760
When you open up and let people
know things that happen to you,

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:37.060
it creates a sense
of vulnerability

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:39.320
that allows other
people to respect you.

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.150
But also to feel that
they can share too.

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:45.480
We create human connection
and great human warmth

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.470
and create understanding
that we all,

00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:50.500
at one point in time in our
lives, no matter who we are,

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:54.230
we are vulnerable and
we need each other.

00:52:54.230 --> 00:53:00.050
And also the women, they get
mad at some of these stories.

00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:04.780
And then they laugh at some of
them, they're so outrageous.

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:06.830
And then they'll cry.

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:09.240
But then they'll tell
each other that they

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.280
can count on each other.

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:12.340
And people leave
with the feeling

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:14.200
that they are no longer alone.

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:15.630
They are part of
something bigger.

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:17.520
They are not struggling alone.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:21.200
And I think one story-- I'll
share with you really quickly--

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.550
it was this lady.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:24.410
She cleaned homes.

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:27.280
And when she first started
coming to the center,

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:31.300
she was very shy, but
towards a few months later,

00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:34.550
she was helping us
call other workers,

00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:36.640
she was leading some
of the meetings,

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:39.320
and then one day in
one of the meetings

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:43.260
this lady was very upset
because the employer

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:46.020
made her clean the entire
tiles in the bathroom

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:47.580
with a toothbrush.

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:51.480
And she told her,
you know, I think

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:56.090
I'm really tough all the time,
but one day at my workplace

00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:58.140
I worked really hard,
I finished everything,

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:00.560
and I thought my employer was
going to be really excited.

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.750
It was a rainy afternoon
and it was cold,

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:06.360
and because I finished early
she gave me bucket of water

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.900
and said, since you finish early
I'd like you to wash the fence.

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:13.460
And sent her out
to wash the fence.

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:15.470
She said she did wash
the fence, and she

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:19.010
says she cried the whole time
as she was washing the fence,

00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:22.310
but after that date she
decided that why would

00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:25.020
she allow someone to
treat her like that.

00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.930
And she would never allow
for that to happen again.

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:30.290
And she was telling
the other workers

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:32.940
that when things like
this happen to us,

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:34.850
it dehumanizes us.

00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:37.130
It triggers us like
we have no value.

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:38.940
We can't allow it to happen.

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:40.220
We need to work.

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:42.350
We also need to
keep our dignity.

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:46.830
So those kinds of conversations
in those spaces where

00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:49.470
you have women who
are feeling vulnerable

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:52.500
really fill the space
with hope, but also

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.070
with the feeling of solidarity.

00:54:54.070 --> 00:54:57.040
So it's really powerful.

00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:02.150
And when you share stories
like this with legislators,

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:06.560
no matter how tough Republican
they are, they'll stop

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.560
and they'll listen and
they'll support you.

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:12.700
And they remember
some of their parents

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:17.750
who were also maids early
on in the early 1900s.

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:19.610
So that's how we're
able to get a lot

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:21.870
of the support at
the State House

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:23.740
was by telling the stories.

00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:26.304
I told my story 300 times.

00:55:26.304 --> 00:55:28.220
And then I brought lots
of workers and Monique

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:30.550
to tell their stories
too, because you also

00:55:30.550 --> 00:55:32.300
want to make sure that
our stories are not

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.740
unique to ourselves.

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:35.510
This is something
that is happening

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:37.860
to a very large
number of people.

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:38.830
It's a problem.

00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:41.850
It's a systemic problem
that we have to correct.

00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:44.090
So that's why we
tell the stories,

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:45.530
and that's why
it's so important,

00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:48.510
and I think will continue
to be as we continue

00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:53.960
to now work on public education
and implementation of the bill.

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:59.070
-Just a note, coming from
a practitioner, when you're

00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:01.540
representing individuals or
when you're part of organizing

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:04.340
but also trying to
explain legal concepts,

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:06.450
storytelling is vital.

00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:08.730
No one besides a
group of lawyers

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:11.090
really cares to
hear about the law.

00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:12.380
That's the truth.

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:13.710
That's the honest to God truth.

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:16.580
I mean, no one really
cares about the excitement

00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:21.550
of changing the jurisdiction
of the MCAD from 6 to 1

00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:23.630
through the amendment
that we did on blah blah.

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:26.300
By then their eyes have
glossed over and by then

00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:28.220
it's lost the point.

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:30.997
And so instead, it
was learning from--

00:56:30.997 --> 00:56:33.080
when I was organizing and
working at the Brazilian

00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:35.670
Immigrant Center, working with
the women from Mata Hari--

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:41.350
is learning that if I cannot
communicate and just talk,

00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:44.160
if I have to talk in legal
terms then I will not be heard

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.260
at all.

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:49.820
And so it was instead
turning my cases that

00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:52.750
would come to me into stories.

00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:56.470
So has anyone ever
experienced a position--

00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:58.470
this situation where
you are working--

00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:01.080
and my client, for example,
was sexually harassed.

00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:01.840
Sexually harassed?

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.786
That term doesn't seem to work.

00:57:05.786 --> 00:57:08.160
What happened is she received
a text message of a picture

00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:10.350
of the man's penis.

00:57:10.350 --> 00:57:12.130
That hits.

00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:13.740
And then you go into
why that's wrong

00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:15.680
and the feelings that come
behind it, and so on and so

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:16.180
forth.

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:18.570
And by the way, that's illegal.

00:57:18.570 --> 00:57:19.080
Why?

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.720
Because blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.890
But unfortunately, if
you're a domestic worker,

00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:23.860
we can't do anything.

00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:25.130
What are you talking about?

00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:25.630
Right?

00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:28.570
And then that's the way of
basically saying the MCAD

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:30.550
does not protect
gender protection

00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:33.350
because there's a number and
there was an exclusion and so

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:34.350
on and so forth.

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:36.930
So it was using legal
cases and experiences

00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:41.080
that were coming as part
of the storytelling rubric

00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.700
to explain rights, to explain
where there weren't rights,

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:47.060
and then why we had to fight.

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:47.560
-Yeah.

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.893
I was just going to say, when
I think about storytelling

00:57:49.893 --> 00:57:51.720
and domestic worker
organizing, it kind of

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.040
reminds me a little bit
about the anti-rape movement

00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:58.050
in the 1970s where these
were deeply personal, deeply

00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:00.527
tragic experiences
that happened to women.

00:58:00.527 --> 00:58:02.110
And it was really
only once they began

00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:05.410
to speak out and testify
about their experiences

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:07.860
that you begin to see
a movement evolving.

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:12.620
And so domestic work is a
very isolating occupation

00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:14.740
and domestic workers
are kind of invisible.

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:18.670
So we have this image of what a
domestic worker is, but I think

00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:22.560
the moment that individuals
begin to speak out and talk

00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:26.030
about their experiences and
you get to know who they are,

00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:29.090
it's the basis for developing
a collective identity.

00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:31.340
And I actually think it's
one of the reasons-- I mean,

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:33.820
this movement is so--
the contemporary movement

00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.710
is so incredibly
fascinating to me.

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:38.670
And part of the reason
it's fascinating to me

00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:40.295
is because of the
ways in which they've

00:58:40.295 --> 00:58:44.920
been able to build bridges
across racial and ethnic lines.

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:47.630
And there aren't
very many examples

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:52.040
in history of a labor movement
that is truly multi-racial,

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:53.200
but this one is.

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.330
In nearly every
city, you see workers

00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:58.140
of different ethnic
groups and racial groups

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:00.640
and linguistic backgrounds
coming together to organize.

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.510
I think part of the
way they've been

00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:05.990
able to do that is because the
stories, regardless of who you

00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:08.210
are, sound very, very similar.

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:09.690
-It's really interesting.

00:59:09.690 --> 00:59:11.190
There's a number
of aspects that you

00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:15.200
talked about what a story is,
that it seems to sort of invoke

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:18.640
agency, makes somebody
feel like wait,

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.890
I feel some sense of
empowerment because I'm

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:23.510
able to speak and to be heard.

00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:25.180
That it creates empathy.

00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:27.990
That a shared sort of
understanding and a shared

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:31.450
experience with
something that transcends

00:59:31.450 --> 00:59:34.470
to a human experience
and not just

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:39.110
based on sort of certain
categories of identity.

00:59:39.110 --> 00:59:44.310
Its connection to a
past seems to also be--

00:59:44.310 --> 00:59:46.250
and that many
people, even if they

00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:48.719
haven't had a specific
experience, in their families

00:59:48.719 --> 00:59:51.260
they may have experienced pain
in the past in the past there.

00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:53.000
They may have had
a grandparent who

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.100
had a similar role or a parent.

00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:57.900
And then for some
reason it also seems

00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:04.667
to get people who are in high
power suddenly feeling, whoa.

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:06.250
I think partly because
people in power

01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:07.958
often believe that
they deserve the power

01:00:07.958 --> 01:00:09.340
and they will use
it righteously.

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:13.200
And that somehow it says,
no, actually not all people

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.140
use power righteously.

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:16.490
And here is an opportunity
to use your power

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:20.170
as a legislator or your
power to sort of create

01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:23.920
an even playing field
for vulnerable people.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.350
Again, this is very helpful.

01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:29.080
I guess some stories are--
not that I know anything

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.830
about the structure
of narrative,

01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:33.140
but I guess some stories
travel better than others.

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:35.260
And that telling
your story 300 times

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.320
may have helped you
figure out which

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:42.100
parts lead to the sort of
moving people in different ways.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.160
And how you tell your
story matters, and learning

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.080
how to do that matters,
and that's part

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.330
of what education does, right?

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:49.610
Education in some
ways is the capacity

01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:52.930
to learn to tell your story
in a way that transmits.

01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:54.760
You mentioned the
role of contemporary--

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.100
and I know we wanted
to leave a lot of time,

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:57.683
and I have to go
teach a class at 5:30

01:00:57.683 --> 01:00:59.100
so I'm going to be taking off.

01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:01.730
But you mentioned a little bit
about contemporary organizing

01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:07.200
and I want to ask, and
it's kind of maybe not--

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.710
if it's a question that's
not working, just say it,

01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:13.250
but in the beginning you talked
about contemporary organizing

01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:16.440
among-- for example, seeing
the $15 an hour work.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:18.640
The organizing
consciousness that's

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:23.050
emerging among people who
increasingly find themselves

01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:24.350
in contract positions.

01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:27.980
Uber or even you
UPS where you're not

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:31.310
considered an employee,
and discussions like that.

01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:32.900
I guess one question
I have is, how

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:36.110
is technology allowing
people to communicate

01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:39.050
across space and time and
how is this likely to impact

01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:40.010
organizing?

01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:42.620
Whether it's through
text messages

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:46.390
or-- what's replaced
the bus stop?

01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:48.020
Or is the bus stop
still the place?

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:55.820
How do things like GroupMe, text
messages, joining a user group,

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:59.880
access to webs, the
mobile technology--

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.130
how is that going to play out.

01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:03.410
We've seen it at least
partly contributing

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:06.540
to social consciousness and
revolutions in other places.

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.420
How does it play out
in social movements

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:11.310
and organizing here, if it does?

01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:17.810
-I feel like technologies
of-- especially

01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:20.151
for people that are not
used to having access

01:02:20.151 --> 01:02:22.400
to smartphones, especially
as smartphones are becoming

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.010
much more affordable these
days, and now they've

01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:28.445
become such a-- what
was once something

01:02:28.445 --> 01:02:30.320
that was a high commodity
is something that's

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.800
so accessible for people.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.500
And the power is learning how to
use it for your best interests

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:39.380
other than having your employer
call you to schedule something

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:42.710
and sending text messages to
your family-- nanny family--

01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:44.260
pictures and whatnot.

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.320
Beyond that, there's so
many apps like GroupMe

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:50.180
that help people connect because
everyone is so spread out.

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:53.360
Not only are domestic
workers working house

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.557
to house to house,
geographically we

01:02:55.557 --> 01:02:57.210
are spread out as well.

01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:59.830
And with extended
hours of working,

01:02:59.830 --> 01:03:03.880
you don't have time to really,
after a nine-hour shift

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.900
or something, go to a
neighborhood meeting.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:08.780
So we have to figure out ways
to use tools to our advantage.

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:11.230
Like using GroupMe to
check in with one another.

01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:14.650
And we've been using webinars,
and it's been interesting

01:03:14.650 --> 01:03:16.870
because whenever we send
out invites to women now,

01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:18.950
they're like, where
is the meeting?

01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:20.230
Just call.

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:20.940
Just call us.

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:22.565
And we're constantly
having that issue,

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:26.490
but technology is so
amazing because they're

01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:29.510
making modifications to make
it easier for us to even call

01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:30.030
the workers.

01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:33.580
So I've been using this
tool called Uber Conference.

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:37.580
That's no affiliation to Uber.

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:40.530
You can actually send something
out and it calls everybody,

01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:43.680
and everyone just gets on there
like, hello, hello, hello.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.500
And we're having a meeting,
which would take us weeks

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.690
to organize to be in person.

01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:51.410
People are late for
different reasons,

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:52.850
tugging the children along.

01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:55.760
So having a very succinct,
one-hour meeting.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.230
We're going to do this for
this week, and talk to you guys

01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:59.700
next week.

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.770
It's been so
powerful in that way.

01:04:01.770 --> 01:04:05.995
And doing it bilingually, we've
been getting bigger, faster,

01:04:05.995 --> 01:04:11.470
and stronger just by
replicating and practicing it.

01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:15.470
-I want to say that indeed,
it does not replace, though,

01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:18.910
the old-fashioned
bus stop and library

01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:21.290
and stopping at the
playground, but it

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:25.900
does-- it's a great other
mode of communication that

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:28.160
speed up the process.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.870
Even to check in on
a couple of things.

01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:31.450
If you are at your
job and you have

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:35.690
a question about something,
a bill or a right,

01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:38.720
you can text us and you
will get the answer, right?

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:43.040
So it does speed up the
process of communication

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:46.110
and give us
absolutely other modes

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:49.610
of accessing each other, right?

01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:53.580
But it does not-- I don't
think that the old-fashioned

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:57.670
face-to-face and hugs and
getting to know each other

01:04:57.670 --> 01:05:02.730
and listen to each other,
that human interaction,

01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:06.240
we're not looking for it
to, but it does enhance

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.560
absolutely the work that we do.

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:13.146
-I would say a lot of my cases
I've gotten from Facebook.

01:05:13.146 --> 01:05:16.020
Whether I meant to or not, I'm
just tagged all of a sudden

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:17.706
in a question by
a set of nannies.

01:05:17.706 --> 01:05:18.830
They're like, I don't know.

01:05:18.830 --> 01:05:20.450
Lydia, what do you think?

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:23.590
And so I'm pulled into
certain conversations.

01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:27.120
Actually, one of my
clients who-- she was

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:30.930
brought here from--
so she's from Uganda.

01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:34.720
She worked for a family from
Saudi Arabia who brought her

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.340
here and then did not pay her.

01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:39.580
And so she asked to
get paid many times,

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:41.814
and I'm summarizing
the story very quickly.

01:05:41.814 --> 01:05:44.355
Ultimately they told her to get
out in the middle of January.

01:05:44.355 --> 01:05:46.570
They kicked her out of the
house and put her outside,

01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:49.370
physically outside of the
house, because she just

01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:50.670
wanted to be paid.

01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:55.400
And so she is outside,
and she had her smartphone

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:58.920
and luckily posted that she
had been put in this situation.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:03.950
From that post, I don't
know who found somebody in--

01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:07.360
went to Uganda, knew somebody
in the state of New Jersey,

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.140
who knew someone in Rhode
Island, who knew someone

01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:12.940
at a shelter, who got--
one, two, three, four, five,

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:14.370
and then the shelter called me.

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:20.080
So it was-- that's what it took
to get her to representation,

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.360
and get her out
and safe, but that

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.300
speaks to the power
of also connectedness

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:27.320
through social media that she
would not have had otherwise.

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:30.000
So I hope we can use
that as an example

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.860
to break down a lot
of the isolation

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:35.850
that survivors or people who
are going to trafficking have,

01:06:35.850 --> 01:06:38.180
is that access to the
internet, which we did put

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:40.820
into our Domestic
Worker Bill of Rights.

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:43.350
You can't deny them access
to the phone or the computer

01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:43.850
at all.

01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:45.770
If you're the only
access they have,

01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:47.050
you can't deny it to them.

01:06:47.050 --> 01:06:50.420
That's in our regulations to
define what is for privacy.

01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:52.270
And it's because of
that, having access

01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:58.360
to those forms of communication,
technology is free.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.519
-So we're going to
pivot to the audience.

01:07:00.519 --> 01:07:01.810
I'm going to have to apologize.

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:04.280
I'm teaching a class
in about five minutes

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:09.790
at HBS, so is it OK if I switch
with-- thank you, and thank you

01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:10.290
so much.

01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:12.690
I apologize.

01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:15.740
[APPLAUSE]
