00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.860
Build it.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.949
The Smith Mansion in Wyoming is a one-of-a-kind
log structure built by hand by one guy.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.800
Francis Lee Smith spent over 12 years building
the 75 foot high mansion without any blueprints

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.280
and he actually died from a fall during its
construction.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.640
Abandoned for over 20 years a preservation
project is currently trying to restore the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.860
incredibly unique house.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.360
Klaus Kemp is the only living practitioner
of diatom arrangement.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.360
Diatom are microscopic single-cell algae that
create glass shells around themselves.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.790
Although popular during the Victorian period
none of these professional microscopists passed

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.460
down their techniques.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.000
So Kemp spent eight years researching different
glue to perfectly arrange diatoms.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.670
And he’s constantly searching for new specimens
to meticulously and obsessively build into

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.670
arrangements.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.770
Draw it.

by drawing with electricity.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.470
Hansen developed permanent nerve damage after
an obsession with pointillism and now utilizes

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.439
his jittery hands to constantly reinvent ways
to make his art.

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.520
Including creating Jimi Hendrix out of 7,000
matches or Chuck Norris with paintballs.

The exaggerated depictions draw amplify their
personalities such as FDR’s wheelchair becoming

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.600
a Transformer, JFK hunting aliens on the moon
or Ronald Reagan riding a raptor.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.600
Because he did that.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:56.990

Finally, Tycho - SEE was shot in complete
darkness with a Microsoft Kinect projecting

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:20.290
an infrared dot pattern - and it was directed

He built it for a short film using scrap metal,
old clock parts, gearbox, copper sheets, brass
