00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.112
- Good morning everyone, it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.112 --> 00:00:05.771
I'm in Manila, Philippines
and today I'm going a group

00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:09.259
to go on an extreme food tour in Pampanga

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.605
which is a little north of Manila.

00:00:11.605 --> 00:00:15.360
And Pampanga is known for it's food.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.287
It is one the culinary,
one of the food centers

00:00:18.287 --> 00:00:19.645
of the Philippines.

00:00:19.645 --> 00:00:21.245
And by the way, right now I'm in bathroom

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:23.997
because the baby is asleep in the room.

00:00:23.997 --> 00:00:26.664
(playful music)

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:31.444
One of the main reasons that
I came to the Philippines

00:00:31.444 --> 00:00:33.427
this time was to join this event,

00:00:33.427 --> 00:00:36.682
and this is put on by the
World Street Food Congress

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:39.638
with KF Seetoh from Singapore and his team

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:41.170
which is called Makansutra.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.003
It's preservation of
local food in the country

00:00:46.076 --> 00:00:49.650
and so it's gonna actually
be a pretty big group

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.735
that's gonna be on this food tour.

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:54.234
So I'm gonna do my best
to get as many video shots

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:55.852
as possible and I'll be filming myself

00:00:55.852 --> 00:00:57.495
but it should be fun.

00:00:57.495 --> 00:01:00.328
And I just saw on the release form

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:05.858
that it's a 15 hour food frenzy safari.

00:01:05.858 --> 00:01:10.025
So we're gonna be eating a lot
of local Filipino food today.

00:01:14.028 --> 00:01:15.430
Ah!

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.770
Oh, that coffee is terrible.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.199
This is from the hotel.

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:21.319
Oh wow, I don't even
taste the coffee in there.

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:23.986
(playful music)

00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:34.280
So actually our first
stop is right in Manila.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.994
We haven't driven yet to Pampanga.

00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:38.679
And we're stopping at a place called

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.346
Bulaluhan sa Espana.

00:01:41.603 --> 00:01:45.441
And we're here to eat
a dish called bulalo.

00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:49.323
Got the bulalo, there is some fried fish,

00:01:49.323 --> 00:01:50.778
some other kind of deep fried thing

00:01:50.778 --> 00:01:53.822
and then the other main
dish is an eggplant

00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:57.386
which has been flattened
out into a complete flat

00:01:57.386 --> 00:01:59.961
almost like pancake omelet looking.

00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:01.324
- So where are you from?

00:02:01.324 --> 00:02:02.157
- From Thailand.

00:02:02.157 --> 00:02:04.275
- Thailand, oh we've been
in Thailand last June.

00:02:04.275 --> 00:02:05.303
- Good, good.

00:02:05.303 --> 00:02:06.711
- And you are from?

00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:08.293
- [Woman] From Thailand also.

00:02:08.293 --> 00:02:10.544
- We're gonna have a lot of food today.

00:02:10.544 --> 00:02:13.210
So I'm gonna just pace
myself, I'm gonna have,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.448
I'm starting off with
just a little bit of rice.

00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:19.107
I'm gonna start with this eggplant

00:02:19.107 --> 00:02:20.920
and there's egg in here too right?

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.468
- [Woman] Yes.

00:02:22.468 --> 00:02:23.885
- It's like a ...

00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:32.308
Oh that's awesome.

00:02:32.308 --> 00:02:35.725
Mm, it's like a crispy fried oily omelet.

00:02:37.226 --> 00:02:39.274
But then the eggplant
inside is really creamy

00:02:39.274 --> 00:02:40.607
and really soft.

00:02:43.846 --> 00:02:45.636
Oh that broth.

00:02:45.636 --> 00:02:49.380
That is a really rich
meaty meaty flavored broth

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.863
and it's quite salty as well.

00:02:50.863 --> 00:02:55.044
Okay next I'm gonna try these little fish.

00:02:55.044 --> 00:02:58.852
Oh yeah, those are just
crispy all the way through.

00:02:58.852 --> 00:03:01.487
They're salty, they are ...

00:03:01.487 --> 00:03:06.172
Any kind of deep fried fish
like that are fantastic.

00:03:06.172 --> 00:03:08.335
- [Woman] Take all, take all.

00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:10.982
- No, we gotta share it, we're
gonna share it though right?

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.987
Who wants a healthy bone marrow?

00:03:12.987 --> 00:03:15.078
Bulalo is known for it's bone marrow.

00:03:15.078 --> 00:03:17.446
And so that's the main
part of eating bulalo,

00:03:17.446 --> 00:03:20.490
so I got the bone here, the bone marrow

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.157
and I'm just gonna pick this up.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.087
Oh ho ho, look at that bone marrow.

00:03:34.375 --> 00:03:35.958
Yeah, it's awesome.

00:03:38.267 --> 00:03:39.977
It almost taste like, it
almost has that texture

00:03:39.977 --> 00:03:44.334
of scrambled eggs but
more, more soft and like,

00:03:44.334 --> 00:03:46.094
aw it just melts in your mouth.

00:03:46.094 --> 00:03:49.078
Oh bone marrow is just one of the,

00:03:49.078 --> 00:03:52.438
the ultimate meaty things to eat.

00:03:52.438 --> 00:03:55.688
Oh and a hanging piece of beef as well.

00:03:59.126 --> 00:04:00.726
That was absolutely delicious.

00:04:00.726 --> 00:04:05.099
I actually really liked the
eggplant, the eggplant omelet.

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.334
That was wonderful but in
addition to that bone marrow,

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:11.739
what a wonderful gateway to start the day.

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.322
(upbeat music)

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:24.195
Just made it to Pampanga
and we are stopping off.

00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:26.923
This place is called Atching Lillian.

00:04:26.923 --> 00:04:30.496
And this is a heritage, a legendary,

00:04:30.496 --> 00:04:33.156
she's owns a private kitchen restaurant.

00:04:33.156 --> 00:04:35.176
Really nice place, I think
it's her house as well

00:04:35.176 --> 00:04:38.730
and then she opens it as a restaurant.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.321
I think you have to call ahead and reserve

00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:42.889
kinda like private dining.

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.139
- These things have become iconic.

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.639
They are flavors that represent a country.

00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:53.384
So this to me is heritage
culinary culture.

00:04:54.807 --> 00:04:56.603
- They have all the food
setup open face style.

00:04:56.603 --> 00:04:59.643
You go through the line and
get all the food that you want.

00:04:59.643 --> 00:05:01.450
I'm hanging out with Bowling.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.555
- Hi.
- She's also from Thailand.

00:05:03.555 --> 00:05:06.638
- Yes.
- And what's your Instagram?

00:05:06.638 --> 00:05:09.519
- Eat and shout.
- Eat and shout.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:11.439
You gotta go check out her Instagram.

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:13.577
And she also loves to eat.

00:05:13.577 --> 00:05:16.635
- Yeah, but Mark always hungry.

00:05:16.635 --> 00:05:18.154
(laughing)

00:05:18.154 --> 00:05:21.301
- And this is very
traditional Pampangan cuisine.

00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:24.085
I got one of everything,
so there's different

00:05:24.085 --> 00:05:25.717
types of cuisinos.

00:05:25.717 --> 00:05:27.849
There's a blood dish.

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.099
This I what I'm looking
forward to eating most,

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:32.010
which is a Pampangan tamale.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.427
- Mm hmm, tamale.

00:05:35.245 --> 00:05:36.726
- Do they call it tamales also?

00:05:36.726 --> 00:05:39.738
- Just about.
- Okay, and so I've eaten

00:05:39.738 --> 00:05:42.281
Mexican tamales many many times.

00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:46.076
But what's unique about
this is that Mexican tamales

00:05:46.076 --> 00:05:49.041
normally made with corn
flour and then it's also

00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:51.089
normally wrapped in a corn husk

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:54.001
before it is steamed and cooked.

00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:58.310
But for the Filipino tamale
it is made with rice flour

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.044
and it's wrapped in a banana
leaf and then steamed.

00:06:02.044 --> 00:06:03.318
So this is what I'm looking
forward to eating most

00:06:03.318 --> 00:06:05.334
off this whole plate.

00:06:05.334 --> 00:06:06.510
You want to taste it too?

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.010
- Please go ahead.

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.980
- Alright, oh there's like a thick outer,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.563
well there's like 10
layers of banana leaf.

00:06:15.726 --> 00:06:18.798
That's a lot of banana leaf there.

00:06:18.798 --> 00:06:21.715
It feels, oh there's egg in it too.

00:06:22.756 --> 00:06:23.589
Aw check that out.

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:28.086
It feels kinda like jelly,
it feels a little like jelly.

00:06:28.086 --> 00:06:28.919
- Eat it.

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:29.919
- Yeah okay.

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:33.862
I think I just pick this up.

00:06:38.345 --> 00:06:41.012
Mm, it has a very jelly texture.

00:06:42.494 --> 00:06:44.589
It's kind of mild in flavor

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:46.808
but really really
gelatinous and almost like

00:06:46.808 --> 00:06:48.205
yeah, like jelly.

00:06:48.205 --> 00:06:52.024
Compared to a corn
tamale, this is very very

00:06:52.024 --> 00:06:54.360
light and kinda like refreshing almost.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.034
And another thing that
I'm very interested to try

00:06:56.034 --> 00:07:00.109
from this plate is a,
is it a type of tocino?

00:07:00.109 --> 00:07:01.617
- [Man] Yeah, I think it's carabao.

00:07:01.617 --> 00:07:02.933
- Carabao.
- Carabao meat.

00:07:02.933 --> 00:07:06.196
- Okay, which is water
buffalo, a water buffalo.

00:07:06.196 --> 00:07:08.863
And looks kinda like skirt steak

00:07:11.807 --> 00:07:13.155
kinda sticky in texture.

00:07:13.155 --> 00:07:14.988
And very red in color.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.663
Mm, oh it's really really rich.

00:07:22.557 --> 00:07:25.341
It does have a sticky texture to it

00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:27.829
but then at the same time you
could taste like the meat is,

00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:28.662
is pulled.

00:07:29.772 --> 00:07:31.937
And it also has a nice sour taste to it.

00:07:31.937 --> 00:07:33.153
That was really good.

00:07:33.153 --> 00:07:37.431
And that's really some
heritage traditional recipes

00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:40.472
that she's cooking here and
she's preserving the culture

00:07:40.472 --> 00:07:42.200
and the food which is really awesome.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.033
She's really nice.

00:07:43.033 --> 00:07:45.667
Thank you very much, that was very nice.

00:07:45.667 --> 00:07:47.470
I enjoyed it very much.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.137
(playful music)

00:07:59.587 --> 00:08:00.700
- Awesome man.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.617
- Yup, you bet awesome.

00:08:03.872 --> 00:08:05.410
If you don't have local friends you will

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.179
never never find this
little gem of a spot.

00:08:08.179 --> 00:08:09.822
- Definitely.
- I have no idea where I am.

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:10.655
I just got out of a bus.

00:08:10.655 --> 00:08:15.209
- (laughs) Awesome to be
hanging out with Seetoh today.

00:08:15.209 --> 00:08:16.042
- Yay.

00:08:16.042 --> 00:08:17.699
- And we have made it
to the next restaurant

00:08:17.699 --> 00:08:19.544
which is called Taldawa.

00:08:19.544 --> 00:08:20.974
- Taldawa.

00:08:20.974 --> 00:08:21.831
- What are we eating here?

00:08:21.831 --> 00:08:23.346
- Look at this, it's like a little,

00:08:23.346 --> 00:08:24.246
I don't know, somebody's house.

00:08:24.246 --> 00:08:26.610
- Oh this is very good.
- Or somebody's courtyard.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.907
Or somebody's village, check around.

00:08:27.907 --> 00:08:30.489
They even have a basketball court here.

00:08:30.489 --> 00:08:31.322
- [Mark] Love the atmosphere already.

00:08:31.322 --> 00:08:32.815
- And it's a small little

00:08:32.815 --> 00:08:34.490
charcoal kitchen down here.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.541
You gotta take a look.

00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:36.374
It's so authentic,

00:08:36.374 --> 00:08:38.040
it's so charming.
- They'd take your cooking?

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.207
- Yeah she's on there stewing
this jet black pot of a,

00:08:44.002 --> 00:08:46.818
she does a lot of stuff
with goat and duck.

00:08:46.818 --> 00:08:48.220
- I'm gonna see if I can
take a look in the kitchen

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.696
real fast to see the cooking.

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:52.113
(chattering)

00:08:55.552 --> 00:08:56.969
This is sinigang?

00:08:58.432 --> 00:09:00.768
This entire area just smells like goat.

00:09:00.768 --> 00:09:02.161
Oh it's a wonderful aroma.

00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:03.369
I love it.
- You know when you put goat

00:09:03.369 --> 00:09:04.660
into a sinigang soup,

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.725
which is a national soup,
it's a very sour soup.

00:09:07.725 --> 00:09:11.308
Feel the beauty of how
the gaminess of goat

00:09:12.647 --> 00:09:15.691
is reduced with this charming sour soup,

00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:17.277
it's so beautiful.

00:09:17.277 --> 00:09:19.948
Have it over rice and you'll
be crying in a while there.

00:09:19.948 --> 00:09:21.232
- My mouth is watering thinking about it.

00:09:21.232 --> 00:09:24.899
- Ah let's do this.
- I can't wait to try it.

00:09:27.393 --> 00:09:29.810
- [Woman] This one goat, yes.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.354
- I'm gonna try take adobo first.

00:09:34.354 --> 00:09:36.687
And this is adobo with duck.

00:09:42.347 --> 00:09:44.514
Wow, oh that is so tender.

00:09:46.635 --> 00:09:50.272
Aw, it's salty, it's a little bit sour,

00:09:50.272 --> 00:09:54.390
and I think I could really
taste the garlic in there.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.473
(laughs)

00:09:58.691 --> 00:10:00.271
Okay next up I'm gonna try the sinigang

00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:03.271
which is goat, it's a goat sinigang.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.353
Oh yeah.

00:10:15.778 --> 00:10:19.028
I got a little bone shard in there, mm.

00:10:20.762 --> 00:10:23.486
That's the type of dish
that you know it's goat.

00:10:23.486 --> 00:10:26.025
Yeah there's no denying
the goatiness of that

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:27.465
and it is wonderful.

00:10:27.465 --> 00:10:30.835
It has just a natural
goat kinda taste to it.

00:10:30.835 --> 00:10:32.973
The broth is a little bit sour

00:10:32.973 --> 00:10:34.502
and you can also tell
that it's just been boiled

00:10:34.502 --> 00:10:37.678
for many many hours so
that the meat is tender.

00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:42.371
And then the flavor of
the meat has just sort of

00:10:42.371 --> 00:10:45.899
completely gone into that broth as well.

00:10:45.899 --> 00:10:48.129
So it's really rich and a little bit oily

00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:49.877
and delicious as well.

00:10:49.877 --> 00:10:52.960
Then the final dish is the kaldereta.

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:58.067
Oh yeah, oh that goat is so tender.

00:10:58.067 --> 00:11:01.744
It does tastes like a
stew, like a tomatoey stew.

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:04.805
There' carrots in there,
there's potatoes in there

00:11:04.805 --> 00:11:07.311
but it's all about that
goat that's just so tender

00:11:07.311 --> 00:11:09.394
and so meatily flavorful.

00:11:12.975 --> 00:11:16.595
Oh yeah, oh yeah the heart is awesome.

00:11:16.595 --> 00:11:18.685
It's a little bit,

00:11:18.685 --> 00:11:21.235
just has a slight rubbery texture to it.

00:11:21.235 --> 00:11:22.273
You like the heart also?

00:11:22.273 --> 00:11:24.421
- Yeah, this is the first thing I'd take.

00:11:24.421 --> 00:11:26.232
- Oh yeah, there's a
couple of hearts in there.

00:11:26.232 --> 00:11:27.315
- Yeah right.

00:11:28.973 --> 00:11:31.844
- The heart is one of
the best single bites

00:11:31.844 --> 00:11:33.113
of the entire bird.

00:11:33.113 --> 00:11:34.516
What do you call it in tagalog?

00:11:34.516 --> 00:11:35.670
- This? Balunbalunan.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.670
- [Mark] Ba-lune-ba-lune.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.815
- Balunbalunan.

00:11:37.815 --> 00:11:38.939
- [Mark] Ba-lune-ba-luna.

00:11:38.939 --> 00:11:39.772
- Nan.

00:11:39.772 --> 00:11:40.605
- [Mark] Balunbalunan.

00:11:40.605 --> 00:11:41.855
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:11:41.855 --> 00:11:43.083
(giggling)
- Gizzard.

00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:45.166
- Gizzard, mm, delicious.

00:11:46.646 --> 00:11:48.618
- You know, you can find great restaurants

00:11:48.618 --> 00:11:51.589
anywhere in the world but this, only here.

00:11:51.589 --> 00:11:55.034
And her dish is distinctly Philippines.

00:11:55.034 --> 00:11:59.490
So this is why I celebrate
humble home cooks like this.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.990
- This is the highlight of
this food tour for me so far.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.710
Really good food, love the
atmosphere, this type of place.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.451
Oh I better not get hit by a car.

00:12:08.451 --> 00:12:11.005
But it's also one of
those successful meals

00:12:11.005 --> 00:12:13.629
where it feels like
you're wearing lip gloss

00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:17.117
because of that natural
oiliness of that goat.

00:12:17.117 --> 00:12:19.784
(playful music)

00:12:29.515 --> 00:12:32.097
- Next restaurant we're
going to is called 25 Seeds.

00:12:32.097 --> 00:12:33.178
And this is a Filipino restaurant

00:12:33.178 --> 00:12:35.166
but it's a modern Filipino restaurant.

00:12:35.166 --> 00:12:38.555
The chef who owns this restaurant
who is a really cool guy,

00:12:38.555 --> 00:12:40.561
he's been with us on this food trip

00:12:40.561 --> 00:12:42.741
and this is his restaurant
that we're gonna try out next.

00:12:42.741 --> 00:12:45.908
(native tribal music)

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:54.894
(cheering)

00:12:54.894 --> 00:12:57.705
- Well this is organic corn.

00:12:57.705 --> 00:13:00.727
And then we added some designated coconut.

00:13:00.727 --> 00:13:03.223
And a little bit of salt.

00:13:03.223 --> 00:13:05.434
That's it, so pure so you could
taste the real corn flavor.

00:13:05.434 --> 00:13:07.983
You're really focusing on the ingredients.

00:13:07.983 --> 00:13:10.149
Yeah, and this is a dying recipe.

00:13:10.149 --> 00:13:11.145
- Oh so this is a traditional--

00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:12.429
- Very difficult to find this one.

00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:13.262
- It's a traditional Filipino recipe.

00:13:13.262 --> 00:13:16.081
- Yes, they want to bring them back.

00:13:16.081 --> 00:13:17.331
- Cool alright.

00:13:21.685 --> 00:13:22.600
Wow!

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.010
Okay next up, this is
the Filipino soft tofu.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:30.177
And it's so soft that you
can drink it with a straw.

00:13:37.406 --> 00:13:40.906
(live instrumental music)

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.577
Chef Sau is getting ready
to prepare his paella sisig

00:13:49.577 --> 00:13:52.276
which is a combination of paella and sisig

00:13:52.276 --> 00:13:55.109
and the first time ever presented.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.457
- We gotta review the
caramelization, the sweet flavor of,

00:14:00.457 --> 00:14:02.624
and then we use margarine.

00:14:05.012 --> 00:14:06.512
- [Spectator] Woo!

00:14:10.761 --> 00:14:13.344
- And then we put all the pork.

00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:18.571
Some more pork.

00:14:21.108 --> 00:14:23.572
- And then he tossed
in the rice, coated it,

00:14:23.572 --> 00:14:25.172
mixed it with all the rice.

00:14:25.172 --> 00:14:26.814
Then he topped it with banana leaves

00:14:26.814 --> 00:14:30.100
and it steamed and baked
sort of at the same time.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.912
The smells, the porky smells
are just unbelievable.

00:14:33.912 --> 00:14:36.290
Chef just dished me a portion.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:37.805
I came outside here on the balcony

00:14:37.805 --> 00:14:40.845
to get some better lighting.

00:14:40.845 --> 00:14:42.040
Oh that's beautiful.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.928
And I'm gonna just quickly to begin with

00:14:43.928 --> 00:14:45.976
I will squeeze on that kalamansi.

00:14:45.976 --> 00:14:48.809
(room chattering)

00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:55.138
And I want to take a bite
with everything in it.

00:14:55.138 --> 00:14:58.055
Get some of those chillis in there.

00:15:04.002 --> 00:15:04.835
Wow.

00:15:06.221 --> 00:15:07.608
Oh what a dish.

00:15:07.608 --> 00:15:11.505
The rice is gooey but then it's broken.

00:15:11.505 --> 00:15:14.054
The texture is broken by
the little bits of pig face

00:15:14.054 --> 00:15:17.948
which are slightly cartilagey in texture.

00:15:17.948 --> 00:15:20.252
And then you've got the chili in there,

00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:22.835
the freshness of the kalamansi.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.907
That is just like a casserole
but a glorious casserole.

00:15:30.097 --> 00:15:32.188
I had to get another scoop of the paella.

00:15:32.188 --> 00:15:33.948
And then also got some of the chicken,

00:15:33.948 --> 00:15:36.209
some of the other dishes, some shrimp.

00:15:36.209 --> 00:15:37.418
And then they also have kare-kare,

00:15:37.418 --> 00:15:40.584
a Filipino peanut curry with seafood.

00:15:40.584 --> 00:15:44.167
And I will begin actually
with this mussel,

00:15:45.005 --> 00:15:48.408
I added some of the kare-kare
sauce into the mussel.

00:15:48.408 --> 00:15:50.861
So I will drink and slurp.

00:15:50.861 --> 00:15:53.861
(live guitar music)

00:15:56.525 --> 00:15:59.692
Mm, that's quite a sweet peanut sauce.

00:16:00.536 --> 00:16:02.669
Hello, how are you man?

00:16:02.669 --> 00:16:04.260
Nice to meet you.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.681
That was an absolutely amazing dish.

00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:09.006
And we are now walking through Pampanga

00:16:09.006 --> 00:16:10.862
on our way to the next restaurant.

00:16:10.862 --> 00:16:12.541
- We here for a 15 hour.

00:16:12.541 --> 00:16:13.788
Hey why, join me, join me.

00:16:13.788 --> 00:16:16.257
- Next up, we are at Susie's Cuisine

00:16:16.257 --> 00:16:19.171
and this is another legendary
restaurant in Pampanga.

00:16:19.171 --> 00:16:21.795
We are eating mostly a
selection of desserts.

00:16:21.795 --> 00:16:24.472
They have most of their signature desserts

00:16:24.472 --> 00:16:26.087
laid out on the table.

00:16:26.087 --> 00:16:29.831
I'm not hugely into desserts
but I will take a bite

00:16:29.831 --> 00:16:32.042
of a couple of their signature desserts.

00:16:32.042 --> 00:16:33.767
This is one of their signature desserts,

00:16:33.767 --> 00:16:35.595
it's called tibok tibok.

00:16:35.595 --> 00:16:38.697
And it's kinda like a pudding,

00:16:38.697 --> 00:16:41.530
it think it's made from goat milk.

00:16:45.447 --> 00:16:46.603
Oh yeah.

00:16:46.603 --> 00:16:48.324
Oh wow and it tastes of coconut too.

00:16:48.324 --> 00:16:52.132
And then it's like a
really really thick sticky

00:16:52.132 --> 00:16:53.935
pudding like consistency.

00:16:53.935 --> 00:16:57.268
Next one I'm trying is call sapin-sapin.

00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:02.936
Sticky consistency, it's pretty sweet.

00:17:02.936 --> 00:17:06.371
A couple bites of sweet desserts for me

00:17:06.371 --> 00:17:08.371
and I'm just about good.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.928
That was a little too sweet for me

00:17:11.928 --> 00:17:14.614
but you have to try some
traditional desserts.

00:17:14.614 --> 00:17:16.416
We're walking back to the bus now

00:17:16.416 --> 00:17:19.094
and we are driving back to Manila

00:17:19.094 --> 00:17:21.846
and gonna eat some more food.

00:17:21.846 --> 00:17:24.429
(upbeat music)

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.484
Traffic was an absolutely
nightmare coming into Manila.

00:17:40.484 --> 00:17:44.346
Uh but we just came to
this gigantic Mega Mall.

00:17:44.346 --> 00:17:47.184
And we are next going to Makansutra

00:17:47.184 --> 00:17:51.351
which is Seetoh's project
and his hawker food court.

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:57.002
I'm hungry, it's been
so long since we ate.

00:17:57.002 --> 00:17:59.988
Look at all of this amazing
food and a lot of it is

00:17:59.988 --> 00:18:02.047
Singaporean Malaysian food.

00:18:02.047 --> 00:18:03.256
There's some clay pot rice.

00:18:03.256 --> 00:18:04.899
What's up, yeah.

00:18:04.899 --> 00:18:07.064
There is some um--

00:18:07.064 --> 00:18:08.366
- Hello!

00:18:08.366 --> 00:18:11.199
(room chattering)

00:18:13.016 --> 00:18:16.933
I'm gonna try this satay
right here, right now.

00:18:19.143 --> 00:18:20.662
Oh yeah.

00:18:20.662 --> 00:18:23.435
Oh the cumin on there is wonderful.

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:27.602
Clay pot rice is one of
the ultimate comfort foods.

00:18:29.926 --> 00:18:31.509
Oh yeah, oh indeed.

00:18:32.348 --> 00:18:35.089
That is ridiculously comforting.

00:18:35.089 --> 00:18:38.460
All the smokiness, that's
really really good.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.861
And really hot and fresh.

00:18:39.861 --> 00:18:42.528
(playful music)

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.244
We are walking now to
the final destination

00:18:49.244 --> 00:18:52.709
on this extreme Filipino food tour day

00:18:52.709 --> 00:18:56.461
and saving the ultimate for the last.

00:18:56.461 --> 00:18:58.561
- Whoa, oh look at that.

00:18:58.561 --> 00:19:00.499
(pigskin crunching)

00:19:00.499 --> 00:19:02.166
- The sound of love.

00:19:07.304 --> 00:19:09.804
(crowd awing)

00:19:12.048 --> 00:19:13.798
Everybody, one, two, three.

00:19:13.798 --> 00:19:14.881
- [All] Whoa!

00:19:16.372 --> 00:19:18.452
- Everywhere in the
Philippines they have their

00:19:18.452 --> 00:19:21.567
own version of lechon
which is the roast pig.

00:19:21.567 --> 00:19:24.522
And each region I think
has their own recipe

00:19:24.522 --> 00:19:26.179
and their own style of cooking a lechon.

00:19:26.179 --> 00:19:28.718
But one of the most famous
and the most beloved

00:19:28.718 --> 00:19:31.587
in all of the Philippines is in Cebu.

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:36.387
And so this is one of the best
places to eat lechon in Cebu

00:19:36.387 --> 00:19:39.343
but they have just opened
a branch in Manila.

00:19:39.343 --> 00:19:40.676
- [Both] Cheers.

00:19:42.259 --> 00:19:44.862
- Hmm mm.
- Ho ho ho ho.

00:19:44.862 --> 00:19:46.445
- Kra-maa!
- Oh mah!

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.528
- Crunchy.

00:19:48.528 --> 00:19:50.587
- Oh it's ridiculously crunchy.

00:19:50.587 --> 00:19:51.420
- Mm mm.

00:19:52.262 --> 00:19:54.843
- Oh, oh that's insane.
- Unbelievable yeah?

00:19:54.843 --> 00:19:56.934
- That's insane.
- Mm.

00:19:56.934 --> 00:19:58.756
- It's so crispy, it's actually like

00:19:58.756 --> 00:20:00.450
one of the crispiest things
you could possible eat

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.478
in the whole world.

00:20:01.478 --> 00:20:02.978
It is just insane.

00:20:05.084 --> 00:20:09.251
That's like a crispiness that
you never want it to end.

00:20:10.219 --> 00:20:11.684
(laughing)

00:20:11.684 --> 00:20:13.732
- He's suppose to tilt his head.

00:20:13.732 --> 00:20:15.535
Yeah, and then close his eyes.

00:20:15.535 --> 00:20:17.274
Okay close eyes, that's how good it is.

00:20:17.274 --> 00:20:18.107
Oh man.

00:20:18.107 --> 00:20:19.792
(Mark laughs)

00:20:19.792 --> 00:20:20.709
- Wow, wow.

00:20:23.141 --> 00:20:23.974
(Seetoh groans)

00:20:23.974 --> 00:20:25.587
(laughing)

00:20:25.587 --> 00:20:29.153
- You gotta tilt, you gotta tilt. (laughs)

00:20:29.153 --> 00:20:31.230
Let me taste the meat real fast.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.745
How is the meat?

00:20:32.745 --> 00:20:34.265
- [Seetoh] Oh it was also the meat.

00:20:34.265 --> 00:20:38.243
- I haven't even made it to the meat yet.

00:20:38.243 --> 00:20:40.217
(Mark giggling)

00:20:40.217 --> 00:20:42.190
- [Woman] How?

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.602
- You could just taste all of those herbs.

00:20:43.602 --> 00:20:48.459
You can taste the lemongrass
just embedded into that meat.

00:20:48.459 --> 00:20:49.686
This is one of those pieces of meat

00:20:49.686 --> 00:20:53.669
that you just actually wanna,
you barely even wanna chew.

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:56.431
You just want to leave it in
your mouth and just suck on it.

00:20:56.431 --> 00:20:57.264
(Woman laughing)

00:20:57.264 --> 00:21:00.174
The contrast of the most crispy thing

00:21:00.174 --> 00:21:02.147
you could possibly put in your mouth

00:21:02.147 --> 00:21:03.822
with the most creamy tender thing

00:21:03.822 --> 00:21:05.593
you could possibly put in your mouth

00:21:05.593 --> 00:21:08.057
both together at once.

00:21:08.057 --> 00:21:09.557
Yeah, it's insane.

00:21:20.729 --> 00:21:23.143
It's juicing in my mouth right now.

00:21:23.143 --> 00:21:24.210
- Thank you my friend.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.153
You survived, you did it,

00:21:25.153 --> 00:21:26.313
you did it.
- Yeah.

00:21:26.313 --> 00:21:28.291
The Commando Foodie.

00:21:28.291 --> 00:21:30.198
Survived the food challenge.

00:21:30.198 --> 00:21:31.770
- [Seetoh] No kidding huh,
no kidding the real deal.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.498
- 15 hour food frenzy.

00:21:33.498 --> 00:21:34.331
(Seetoh laughing)

00:21:34.331 --> 00:21:36.226
That was awesome.
- Bravo.

00:21:36.226 --> 00:21:39.511
- The baby is sleeping again
so I'm in the bathroom again.

00:21:39.511 --> 00:21:42.338
But I want to just say a
big thank you to Seetoh,

00:21:42.338 --> 00:21:44.013
to the whole Makansutra team

00:21:44.013 --> 00:21:45.986
and the World Street Food Congress

00:21:45.986 --> 00:21:48.653
and everyone who helped
put that food tour together

00:21:48.653 --> 00:21:50.455
and organized everything.

00:21:50.455 --> 00:21:51.927
That was fantastic.

00:21:51.927 --> 00:21:55.794
And it was a lot of fun to
meet a lot of other food lovers

00:21:55.794 --> 00:21:57.479
and to just hang out and eat.

00:21:57.479 --> 00:21:59.858
