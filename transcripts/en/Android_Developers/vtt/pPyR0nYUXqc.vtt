ANKUR KOTWAL: Today we're going
to be talking about how

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.760
to make Android apps beautiful,
and we're going to

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.100
start off by looking at an app
that hasn't had much love.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.150
This is actually the first
in a multi-part series of

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.290
DevBytes, and today's episode
is going to focus on

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.000
modernizing, just doing some
very basic modernization

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.560
techniques with your app.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:36.010
So, let's switch to the phone,
and let's look at our app.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.440
Now, the first thing I want
to actually point

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.530
out is the app icon.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.210
The app icon is the identity
of your app.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.950
It's the identity of your app
not only on the user's device,

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.970
but also on the Play Store, so
making this piece of identity

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.320
stand out and look polished
is really important.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.540
This app does not qualify of
having done a good job.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.480
So we've now launched the app,
and you'll see it's very

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.690
basic, and a common pattern
that we normally see.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.030
It's a list view.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.140
We have some thumbnails on the
left hand side, and some text

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.940
on the right.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.500
And straight away, we see that
this app is actually

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.970
an old style app.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.850
It uses a title bar at the
top, It has a legacy menu

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.590
button at the bottom, which
shouldn't be there on a device

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.320
with virtual navigation
buttons.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.280
The images are all
inconsistently sized from each

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.380
list item to list item.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.130
And when we go into the details,
again, we've got a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.660
bad title bar, but all the text
is jutted up all the way

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.060
to the edges.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.940
So, let's look at what we do to
fix this as a first step.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.240
What we're going to do before we
switch to code, let's have

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.050
a look at what the target's
going to be.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.380
This is our first stage that
we're going to get to, which

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.580
is an action bar.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.100
We've got action items, we've
got an overflow menu as well.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.160
And we're doing some
notifications.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.020
So, getting back to that, let's
now look at what we've

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.560
started with.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.430
Let's look at some code.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.760
And what we have here is
actually the manifest file.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.850
We've got a minimum
SDK version set to

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.720
10, which is great.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.750
We're targeting users from
Gingerbread and up.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.750
But our target SDK version is
also set to API level 10.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.250
This should always be set to the
most recent version of the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.600
Android SDK, which in
this case is API 17.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.900
So, the first change we'll
make is to make that 17.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.520
This will automatically get
rid of the menu button on

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.710
devices that have virtual
navigation buttons.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.170
The other thing we want to do is
actually change the style.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.560
We're using the theme.light
style.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.660
So what we're going to do
instead is use our own style

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.640
that is also a backwards
compatible.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.110
So our manifest file is actually
going to change into

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.900
something like this, where we've
got API 17 here, and

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.570
we've got our own app theme.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.190
The way we're going to define
this app theme is by having a

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.020
styles.xml in our values
directory, which just extends

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.550
theme.light.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.480
This is our base theme.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.020
What we're then going to do
is we're going to have a

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.120
styles.xml from v11.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.790
API 11 to 13 will get theme
HollowLight, and API 14 and

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.680
upwards will get the
HollowLight with

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.110
a dark action bar.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.340
So once we've done this, we're
going to get a nice, styled

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.250
action bar there.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.260
We're going to get rid
of the menu button.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.030
But what we might also want to
do is brand our action bar to

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.120
be more consistent with the
stylings of our organization

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.650
or service that we provide.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.250
Switching to the slides now,
what we actually want to do is

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.940
take our action bar the way it
is now and make it orange,

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.860
basically, and change the icon
as well, again, to be

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.030
consistent with our brand.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.490
The way we're actually going to
do that is use this third

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.220
party tool, called the Android
Action Bar Style Generator,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.210
developed by Jeff
Gilfelt from the

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.710
Android Developer Community.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.670
Great utility where you can go
and specify various attributes

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.930
about how you want your action
bar to be presented, and then

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.250
what it does is provide you with
a zip file that you can

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.130
just extract over your project,
and you're done.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.520
So, that wraps up part one.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.670
I just want to show you how
far we've gotten in this

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.180
checkpoint.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.770
We've gotten from something that
obviously looked old to

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.430
something that looks a
lot more modern now.
