00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:17.136
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Whoa, we have
like, too many people.

00:00:17.606 --> 00:00:18.456
&gt;&gt;Student: Check that.

00:00:18.586 --> 00:00:22.926
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We have GameMaker
on a couple of flash drives.

00:00:22.926 --> 00:00:26.746
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The seemingly chaotic
fun scene is actually a carefully

00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:29.996
monitored learning environment,
where advanced students

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:32.246
from McKinley High School are paid

00:00:32.306 --> 00:00:35.546
to teach others how to
play and build games.

00:00:35.856 --> 00:00:38.936
&gt;&gt;My name is Rick Kelsey, and
my position her at McKinley,

00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:43.356
is STEM Director, which is Science,
Technology, Engineering and Math.

00:00:43.426 --> 00:00:46.196
I'm also the Director of The
Institute of Urban Game Design,

00:00:46.626 --> 00:00:48.666
which is a program
funded by George Mason,

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.496
and the National Science
Foundation, where we've taught

00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:55.186
over 1,000 students from 150
different schools, around Washington,

00:00:55.186 --> 00:00:57.946
D.C., Maryland and Virginia,
and they've all learned how

00:00:57.946 --> 00:01:02.406
to make video games, with computer
science, 3D modeling, and animation.

00:01:02.406 --> 00:01:04.586
&gt;&gt;Student: The little icon above it.

00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:08.976
&gt;&gt;Kevin: We are looking at using
collaboration and mentoring as a part

00:01:08.976 --> 00:01:11.856
of delivering and teaching
STEM content.

00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:16.676
Typically, you would have an
instructor who may have 20 students

00:01:16.676 --> 00:01:18.626
in a classroom, and it's difficult

00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:21.446
for that one instructor
to serve 20 students.

00:01:21.446 --> 00:01:24.746
So what we've done is,
we've trained students

00:01:24.746 --> 00:01:27.206
who are already familiar
with the technology.

00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.496
&gt;&gt;Justin: This object right
here, this clown, it would have--

00:01:29.496 --> 00:01:33.396
&gt;&gt;Kevin: In the summer, we actually
take them through a two week session,

00:01:33.396 --> 00:01:35.776
where we teach them
how to become mentors,

00:01:35.776 --> 00:01:38.096
provide support, give
them encouragement.

00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:43.526
And so we have a cadre of
mentors that are then positioned

00:01:43.616 --> 00:01:45.956
in the classroom to
assist the instructors.

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:47.366
&gt;&gt;Justin: So hit F5.

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:50.816
&gt;&gt;Kevin: From our preliminary
results, what we are seeing,

00:01:50.816 --> 00:01:53.516
is that on both sides,
we see benefits.

00:01:53.876 --> 00:01:57.246
Students are benefiting because
they get immediate feedback,

00:01:57.246 --> 00:01:59.046
immediate assistance.

00:01:59.116 --> 00:02:01.366
&gt;&gt;Student: Save this right now,
and save it in any file you want.

00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:03.386
&gt;&gt;Kevin: The mentors are benefiting

00:02:03.646 --> 00:02:07.246
because they are continually
rehearsing and going over skills

00:02:07.246 --> 00:02:08.526
that they have learned,
because you know,

00:02:08.706 --> 00:02:10.946
you don't really learn something
until you have to teach it.

00:02:10.946 --> 00:02:11.866
&gt;&gt;Student: I clicked him.

00:02:12.026 --> 00:02:13.326
&gt;&gt;Student: But you
haven't added the code yet,

00:02:13.386 --> 00:02:14.936
so nothing is going to happen.

00:02:14.936 --> 00:02:16.206
&gt;&gt;Student: Those are just
different shortcut menus.

00:02:16.286 --> 00:02:17.386
&gt;&gt;Alice: I just love this idea

00:02:17.386 --> 00:02:19.696
of students becoming more
specialized in something.

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.876
From early on, knowing that
becoming more specialized

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:26.616
in any field will lead to getting
paid, and getting paid even more,

00:02:26.616 --> 00:02:29.106
so it's a great part of the model.

00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:31.456
&gt;&gt;Gary: How you doing?

00:02:32.396 --> 00:02:37.016
&gt;&gt;I started out as a parent
volunteer, and I was there

00:02:37.016 --> 00:02:38.596
when the program was in its infancy.

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:42.456
I saw the value of the program
immediately in his enthusiasm

00:02:42.456 --> 00:02:43.556
with regard to his homework.

00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:47.826
I got more and more involved, so
I would man the desk, for roll,

00:02:48.146 --> 00:02:52.216
I'd tell the kids to stop running
in the hallway, I'd go get snacks,

00:02:52.216 --> 00:02:54.866
I'd do whatever it took, just
to keep the program going.

00:02:55.016 --> 00:02:56.466
And now I've been instrumental

00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:59.966
in helping the D.C. Public School
System roll out a technology bus,

00:03:00.516 --> 00:03:05.886
where we can take STEM programs
and education to the students,

00:03:05.886 --> 00:03:08.946
and not only just to the
students, but to our citizens.

00:03:09.826 --> 00:03:11.376
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The bus
will soon be outfitted

00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:14.466
with computer workstations
and flat screen TVs.

00:03:15.326 --> 00:03:18.256
Today, students use laptops
to test a new version

00:03:18.256 --> 00:03:22.176
of the NSF funded game,
called, "Immune Attack."

00:03:22.606 --> 00:03:25.756
&gt;&gt;Chris: This game has a lot of
educational value packed in it,

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:29.126
because I'm not a biology
major, and I'm learning things

00:03:29.286 --> 00:03:30.426
by playing "Immune Attack."

00:03:30.996 --> 00:03:33.546
This is so detailed, first of
all, it talks about monocytes,

00:03:33.916 --> 00:03:36.466
and things in the body that
most people don't know about.

00:03:36.836 --> 00:03:38.916
And they've integrated
it into a video game.

00:03:39.456 --> 00:03:40.336
It's a great way to learn.

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:42.806
&gt;&gt;Justin: It was an ear infection
you're trying to destroy,

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:46.666
there are these little green-- I
think that's one of them right there.

00:03:46.716 --> 00:03:48.996
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Many of our
mentors are tech savvy.

00:03:49.146 --> 00:03:53.516
They already know the software,
they're great with the technology,

00:03:53.556 --> 00:03:56.186
and so their natural
inclination is to just do it.

00:03:56.186 --> 00:03:57.756
&gt;&gt;Justin: It's different
when you explain the game,

00:03:57.976 --> 00:04:00.336
than when you're actually, like,
playing it, because I'm trying

00:04:00.336 --> 00:04:03.726
to just tell her, and if I got
on, I could just do it, but--

00:04:03.726 --> 00:04:06.436
&gt;&gt;Kevin: So we have to say, no,
you don't want to do it for them,

00:04:06.536 --> 00:04:11.646
you want to make this student have
success, and you want to push them

00:04:11.646 --> 00:04:15.046
or guide them in that way,
but if you just do it,

00:04:15.156 --> 00:04:18.196
then they don't have a chance to
see that they can do it themselves.

00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:19.906
&gt;&gt;Justin: But you'll know
when you see them, they're--

00:04:19.906 --> 00:04:21.196
&gt;&gt;It's just kind of
interesting that--

00:04:21.196 --> 00:04:22.626
you feel good, when
you're able to, like,

00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:25.966
kind of teach someone something,
and to feel passion about that.

00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:28.000
&gt;&gt;Careful, careful, careful.

00:04:28.596 --> 00:04:34.976
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm doing it.

00:04:35.076 --> 00:04:35.806
