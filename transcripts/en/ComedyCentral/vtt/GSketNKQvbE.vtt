00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.036 align:start position:0%
- Congratulations.

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:05.204 align:start position:0%
My nephew is
a sophomore at UCLA.

00:00:05.237 --> 00:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
I'll have him
take your little class.

00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:09.308 align:end position:100%
- Uh, you could,
or you could--

00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:11.177 align:end position:100%
and I mean this
in the nicest possible way--

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.247 align:end position:100%
mind your business/
shut the [bleep] up.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.549 align:start size:19% position:81%
Sorry.

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:18.518 align:start position:0%
- Did you know that apparently
I have to get a job

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.353 align:start position:0%
or I go back
on house arrest?

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:22.755 align:start position:0%
Well, too sad, so bad,
Sister Sergeant.

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:25.124 align:start position:0%
I ain't doing it.
It's bull[bleep]!

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:26.592
- You want to talk b-[bleep]?

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:29.362 align:end position:100%
I did what you told me to do.
I Pfeiffed it out.

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:31.531 align:end position:100%
And thanks to your brain-dead
brain's advice,

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.499 align:end position:100%
my dream job
went down the dream drain.

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:37.103
- I am very mad and very upset
about everything you just said,

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:38.471 align:start position:0%
but I would also like
to switch gears

00:00:38.504 --> 00:00:39.806 align:start position:0%
and say how happy I am
that you didn't get it,

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
because now
you can stay with me

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:43.242 align:start position:0%
and you can go with me
to the Army surplus store,

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:45.178
and I can park my wheelchair,
and you can change my catheter.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:48.114 align:end position:100%
- I would never, ever stay here,
even if you paid me,

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:49.816 align:start size:69% position:31%
which you already did.

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:54.253
I would rather kill myself than
stay here another day, bitch.

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:55.655 align:start position:0%
- Excuse me?

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:57.690 align:start size:72% position:28%
- I called you a bitch.

00:00:57.723 --> 00:01:00.493
- Well, you know what, bitch?

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:03.296 align:start position:0%
Why don't you get in a car
and find a cliff,

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.101 align:start position:0%
and then,
when you find that cliff,

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:09.235 size:84% position:42%
take the car that you're in
and drive off of a cliff,

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:11.404 align:start position:0%
you freaking bitch?

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:13.339 align:start size:69% position:31%
- Good advice. I will.

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:14.507
And you know what else?
- What?

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.242 align:start size:75% position:25%
- I'll land in the ocean

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:18.344 align:end position:100%
because I am smart enough
to build a car that floats,

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:22.548 align:end position:100%
"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"-style,
you [bleep] bitch.

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:25.118 align:start position:0%
- Okay, well, I have
several shark homies

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:26.819 size:75% position:38%
that I can reach out to,
and they could smell you

00:01:26.852 --> 00:01:30.356 align:start position:0%
and lead me to you,
you [bleep] bitch.

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:32.125
- Well, then, I'll give 'em
a little shark sleeping pill,

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:34.527 align:end position:100%
and they'll be all like,
zzz, [chomping],

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.262
you Shirley Temple-headed bitch!

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:37.464 align:start position:0%
- I am not a drink!

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:40.766 align:start size:59% position:41%
Cheteran was right.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.768 align:start position:0%
You have no idea
what I've been through.

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:44.303 align:start size:59% position:41%
- And what is that?

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:47.173 align:end position:100%
3 ounces of weed
and a box of honuts?

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:49.408
- What are honuts?
- Donuts for whores.

00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:53.412
- All right.
Attention, everyone.

00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:56.549
Tonight is about
my lovely daughter, Gene...

00:01:56.582 --> 00:01:58.451
- [loud fake cough]
The nightmare.

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:01.420
- And her brilliant tutor,
Roberta.

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:04.390
- [fake cough] The nightmare.
- I already did that.

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:06.526
- Now, I understand Robert
has prepared a little something,

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:08.361
have you, Robert?
- No.

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:09.695
I have something prepared
that's better, so can I...

00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:11.764
- All right, honey.
Yeah, go ahead.

00:02:11.797 --> 00:02:15.334
- This is better than
whatever Billie was gonna say.

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:19.405
I just wanted to say
thank you to all the people

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:22.308
that helped me
through my sentence.

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:25.311
Uh, of course there's
my loving father, Dad Russell.

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:27.780
[applause]

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:31.384
Um, big ups to my awesome
stepmother from another brother.

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:32.785
Where's Tanzy?

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:34.453 align:start position:0%
- You're welcome.

00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:36.289
[applause]

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:38.824
- Uh, the mail guy
always brought cool letters

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:42.195
and fun coupons, so let's
give it to--give it up for him.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.729
[applause]

00:02:43.762 --> 00:02:46.566 align:start size:53% position:47%
And, oh, my gosh.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.802
I almost forgot
the most important person.

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:51.504
Wow.

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:54.607
She's the, uh, wind
beneath my chicken wings.

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.911
My best friend

00:02:58.944 --> 00:03:01.247
and the person
I trust the most.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.751
Joy.

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:07.753
[cheers and applause]

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:10.119
Thanks, Joy. Thank you.
- Excuse me.
