<i>- So I took Nick
to the Pioneer Saloon,</i>

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.040
<i>which is
in Goodsprings, Nevada.</i>

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.580
<i>It's a little ghost town
up in the hills,</i>

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.710
<i>and I heard that there
was gonna be</i>

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.750
some Ford trucks there.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.120
I want him to see

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.710
how they look done,
give him some more input.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.420
Then that way, he'll be able
to have a better idea

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.250
of what he wants.
This one's

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.540
more or less
a customized, uh, '48.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.170
It's got tilt front end
on it.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.790
- It's black.
- It's custom flames.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.580
This is a '56, just like yours,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.620
and this one here--
this is probably

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.290
the most customized truck
I've seen out there.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.880
You can notice
all of it, right?

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.500
The ordinary person
to walk up to this,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.830
he wouldn't know.
He's just say,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.080
"Oh, that's a cool truck."

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.830
- Hey, Rick!
- How you doing?

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.210
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.330
- Mike told me
you were out here, looking.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.380
- Hey guys. Hey, guys.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.170
Gary, did you build this?
- Yes.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.920
- You did?
- Yes.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.170
Cut two cabs apart,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.250
put 21 extension on...

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.880
- Right.
- And, uh...

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.920
- Took a piece to the dash?
Right?

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.080
Took a--one of the--
- Yes.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.580
Had two humps and two trucks,

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.880
so I said, "Let's put
the other one over there."

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.920
- Yeah, make it--
- I got two speedometers now.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.000
- [laughs]

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.080
Yeah, it's got a lot of work.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.710
- The bed is six months' worth
of varnishing on that.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.880
- Oh, wow.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.920
- Underneath is just as shiny
as on top.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.620
- Oh, yeah.
See?

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.290
Now, that's a frame.
- [laughs]

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.790
- That's that
custom-made frame.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.080
- Yeah.
- Winters Quick-change

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.120
rear end.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.620
- Yeah.
- I can change it

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.420
and get it ready to show
in 20 minutes.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.960
- Tell me, you know the time
you spent on it.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.960
How much time?

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.960
- 25 years.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.330
[laughter]

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.830
- That's gotta be
a lot of money.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:27.830
- 300,000.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.540
I ran out of money three times.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.000
[laughter]

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.960
<i>- I think this definitely
showed Nick</i>

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.290
<i>that--that it's
blood, sweat, and tears</i>

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.120
<i>to get this thing done,
but at the same time,</i>

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.580
this isn't just about
what Nick can't do.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.790
You know, Nick could've.
He wants to, I can tell,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.330
<i>but he just doesn't
have the time.</i>

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:44.750
<i>He really doesn't,</i>

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.670
<i>so for me to be able to bring</i>

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.040
<i>a little bit
of his dreams into it</i>

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.420
<i>would be worthwhile.</i>
