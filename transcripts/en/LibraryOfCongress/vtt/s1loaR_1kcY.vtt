00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.120
We're so glad that Washington's
beautiful cherry blossoms are just

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.770
about to burst into bloom
after that little storm.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.920
It's perfect [laughter].

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.580
It's perfect.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.690
So, just a quick question
I know of course you

in many international venues,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.720

that are on display in our foyer

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.180

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.420
My name is Mari Nakahara.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.880 position:56%
I am the curator for architecture,
design and engineering at the Prints

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.170
and Photographs Division.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.700
I'm here today to talk about
the Library's participation

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.750
in the National Cherry
Blossom Festival.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.920
The Library holds over 162 million
items covering an almost universal

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.650
range of the subject in diverse
formats, including resources,

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.350
related to cherry blossoms
and their history.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.760
Right after I was hired as a
Japanese reference librarian

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:58.480
at the Library's Asian Division in
2007, I found these restorations

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.760
of 11 varieties of the cherry
blossoms, which were given

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.420
from the City of Tokyo to
Washington, DC in 1912.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.000
I was so excited to see
these and I begin to dream

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.160
of making them known more broadly.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.140
The more I found that I
explored the Library's collection

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.220
and the more I found
holdings related

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.970
to the cherry blossoms
in the 1912 gift.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.650
Long story short, I, along

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.430
with my colleague Cathleen Brudd
[assumed spelling] also P&amp;P,

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.780
mounted the Sakura, Cherry Blossoms

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.310
as Living Symbols Friendship
exhibition for an occasion

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.140
of the 100th anniversary of
the cherry blossom tree gift.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.220
Multiple programs were held,
along with the exhibition,

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.910
including gallery talks,
lectures, K-12 programs and so on.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.450 position:56%
The exhibition and its gallery talk.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.840 position:56%
And also, many educational materials
are still available via the

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.440
Library website.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.740
Oh, did I show you the?

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.040
I show you the drawings?

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.410
Did you see the drawings?

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.510
Oh, okay. All right.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.000
So, if you go the website
you can still see point says

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.940
at the top learn more, or public
program and the exhibition items.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.920
So, you can see everything.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.570
Pursuing one of the Library's goals
of providing general understanding

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.590
of American culture,
intellectual and social life,

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.070
and of other peoples and nations.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.820
I decided to continue to host
events in the program related

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.360
to cherry blossoms, coinciding

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.890
with the National Cherry Blossom
Festival every spring even

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.480
through the scale is much smaller.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:06.240
One of the big event is
called Japanese Culture Day.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.320
This program, presented by
the Library's Asian Division,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.890
and also the Center for the Book,
introduced children and adult

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.370
to the Japanese culture through
hand-on origami artwork creation,

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.380
trying on Kimono and
other activities

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.530
as you are seeing on the web.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.900
By participating in these
activities, people not only enjoy,

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.960
but also have an opportunity to
learn the meaning of each activity

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.420
from the library staff member and
the volunteers who have a depth

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.780
of knowledge of Japanese culture.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.630

A program about Japanese
children's life and the culture.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.970
We, each year, also provide
special presentations

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:11.350
such as children's book readings
and introduction of Japanese food.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.870

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.900
Children will find
additional supplies,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:29.440 position:56%
which I must keep confidential until
the day of the event [laughter].

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.900
Last, but not least,
Cherry Blossom princesses

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:40.670 position:56%
from the last few years instruct the
children in the art of tiara making.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.350
Children also will
have the opportunities

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:50.170
to explore young readers centers
current and classic books.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:54.910

about the 53 bonsai trees, which
Japan gave as a bicentennial gift

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.200
to the United States in 1976.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.370
The trees led to the founding
of the national bonsai

and the Penjing Museum US
National Arboretum [inaudible],

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.950

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:05.870
The panel aims to expand the
public's knowledge, awareness,

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:10.660
and understanding of these
enchanting miniature trees

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.030
that are living works of art.

So, first off, that's
a big question,

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:12.250 position:56%
relationship between noh and Kyogen.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.510
Originally, they were
one in the same.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:21.480
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:27.020
So, we have noh and Kyogen and
these two drama forms coexist

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:32.510
within the single genre
of [foreign word].

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:38.280
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:43.650
So, the way to enjoy it is to
see it alternately, first noh

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.510
and then a Kyogen interlude.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:54.450
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.750
So, noh is often, the
themes are rather tragic,

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:02.510
and it's structured
on a song and dance.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:09.540
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:14.090
And, on the other hand, Kyogen
treats everyday subjects.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.190
The characters are common people,

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:21.670
and it's about their comedic
situations of their everyday life.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:30.870 position:56%
So, in the past, people would spend
the entire day watching these plays.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:38.510 position:56%
So, it would be a repetition of noh,
then Kyogen, noh, and then Kyogen.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.360
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.840
Of course, we have better things
to do these days [laughter].

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:53.510
So, normally you would go see
one noh play, or one Kyogen play.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:15:01.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.510
So, for a Kyogen play, typically
it's between 20 and 30 minutes.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:09.120
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.050
So, increasingly, as you are today,

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.510
people come to see
Kyogen plays only.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:22.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.540
So, I want to stress to you that
although we tend to think of Kyogen

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.880
and noh as separate things, I
want to stress that they used

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.520
to be part of, well, together.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.340
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: [Laughter] No, no,

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.830
we're Going to keep
going back and forth.

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.210
This is wonderful.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.390
So, it's like a musical, in a
way it's like a counterpoint.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:16:03.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.940
&gt;&gt; MATOKA SHAMUTZU: Yes,
exactly like a counterpoint.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.150
So, noh is very sober
and profound, very tense.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:13.360
And then you would watch
the Kyogen for that release.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.110
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: You know, you were
saying that Kyogen is a theater

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:21.930
of gentle humor and everyday
satire and everyday situations

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.620
and I was reading that your
father, I believe made a comment

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:32.430 position:56%
about how Kyogen is like tofu, and I
wondered if care to expound on that?

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:41.390
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.790
&gt;&gt; MATOKA SHAMUTZU:: So,
ironically it started as a slur

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.510
against the Shigeyama family.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:53.410
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:59.510
So, eventually the Kyogen became
patronized by the Samurai classes.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:10.520
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:15.490
So, in the Meiji Period when
the Samurai went out of power,

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.350
all the Kyogen performers

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:21.510
and noh performers lost
basically, lost their jobs.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:30.110
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:34.390
So, they attempted to survive
through the patronage and support

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:38.510 position:56%
of people who were willing to do so.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:45.340
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:52.510
But to mount a noh play you
need at least 20, 20 actors.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:57.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:02.510
On the other hand, a Kyogen play,
you only need five or six people.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:11.050
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:15.950
So, I think it made it, the
economic barriers were not

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.510
as high for Kyogen plays.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:23.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.020
And also, they're shorter.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.510
Which is sometimes preferred.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:33.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:39.510
So, from the Taisho Period, early
20th century to the Showa Period.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:45.330
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:50.510
And even in Japan, women
were coming to power.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:56.110
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.440
So, often the Kyogen
plays functioned

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.510
as entertainment at
these girls' parties.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:08.330
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:12.510
And also, for gatherings
for children.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:18.360
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:24.510
And so, Kyogen was very well
adapted to these kind of places.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:31.060
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.750
So, in a sense, my grandfathers'
grandfathers were ancestors,

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.390
he tore, or plucked Kyogen

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:43.510
out of the larger picture
of [foreign word].

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:52.070
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:56.220
So, then my ancestors they
would perform everywhere.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.110
Weddings, temples, at parties.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:04.510
And it became to be perceived that
Shigeyama Kyogen was everywhere.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:14.050
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:18.590
So, I'm not sure if this is
actually a Kyogen proverb,

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:24.510
but there's a saying if you're
lacking for a dish, have Tofu.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:45.130
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:50.690
So, Shigeyama Kyogen came to
be bad mouthed as tofu Kyogen

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:57.510
that it was everywhere,
common, but now, cheap.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:03.810
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:09.840
But my ancestor said, well what's
wrong with tofu, tofu is fine.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:24.370
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:27.370
So, tofu is extremely versatile.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.940
There's a tofu that your mom
would put on the dinner able,

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.600
or there's the tofu
that is presented

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.510
in a very refined way
in a restaurant.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:40.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:46.450
So, as long as there is tofu
for that that is appropriate

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:52.510
for that place, it should not
inconvenience anyone [laughter].

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:59.430
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:05.090
So, if it's a very classy,
high-end event, it can be that

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:09.510
or if it's a kid's event
it can be that also.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:14.510
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:23.050
[ Laughter ]

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:30.300
Okay, so basically Shigeyama
Kyogen will never say no.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:31.600
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: Wonderful
[laughter].

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:36.480
We wanted to ask you a little
bit about the training of actors.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.670
And I know it's very much a father
to son apprenticeship kind of thing

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.270
and I was wondering how
old most actors are.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.750
How old were you when you began,

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.530
and when did you make
your first appearance?

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.350
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.270
&gt;&gt; MATOKA SHAMUTZU: It
was at the age of four

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.510
that I first took the stage.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:01.460
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:05.010
And I prepared for this
role for about six months.

00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:09.080
That's what I hear [laughter].

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.660
I don't remember it.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.840 position:56%
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: And, we were
thinking about too, how do you know?

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.050
It's a long apprenticeship I know
and we can talk about the study

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.070
of techniques, but how do you
know when you're finished?

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:26.790
Is there an official ceremonial
moment that you be begin

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:30.300
to make your debut as an adult?

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:37.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.510
&gt;&gt; MATOKA SHAMUTZU: So, there's
a play called [foreign word].

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:47.550
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:50.230
So, I've heard that once you
have role in [foreign word],

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:56.510
that means that you have become
a full-blown Kyogen actor.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:02.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:06.520
For me that happened
about 17 years ago.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:12.510
But my father was very
critical about it.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:16.060
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.260
So, in my father's eyes, no doubt,

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.920
I'm still not yet a
full Kyogen actor.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.070
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: And
you'll have the chance

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.250
to see his father [inaudible]
tonight who is a very,

00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:32.500
very distinguished actor
and we wanted to know too

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.480
about the hereditary title
that he carries and how does,

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.780
what is the nature of this?

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:49.610
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.010
&gt;&gt; MATOKA SHAMUTZU: So,
the head of our family,

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:57.510
the name for that is
Shigeyama [foreign word].

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.710
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:05.140
So, [inaudible] my father
who is here tonight,

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.510
he is the second [foreign word].

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:11.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:16.690
And [foreign word] was actually
my grandfather's birth name.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.140
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.510
So, after the Second World War.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:31.570
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:36.710
So, in the world of entertainment,

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:40.510
there were many reforms
that were carried out.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:43.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:49.260 position:56%
So, up until then, it was
absolutely Taboo or forbidden to mix

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:52.510
or intermingle with
different genres.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:55.410
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.510
So, you might come
out with a new work.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.620
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:04.510
Or revive an old work.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:10.050
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:14.280
And sometimes you would
have noh actors performing

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.390
in [inaudible] plays.

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:23.510 position:56%
And that was absolutely unbelievable
by the standards of that time.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:30.050
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:34.480
So, my grandfather, because he
appeared in a [inaudible] play,

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:41.510
he was actually made to resign
from the Noh Association.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:50.690
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:53.210
So, when all this was happening,

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:57.590 position:56%
my grandfather was still called
[inaudible] and not yet [inaudible].

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:02.510
At the time when all these
reforms were taking place.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:11.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.120
So, for us, the name is
associated with that very,

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.420
this period of great innovation.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:22.010
And also, the Chinese
character [inaudible] is 753,

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:27.610
which is Japan is a very
auspicious and celebratory event

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.510
that celebrates the
health of children.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:34.370
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:39.510
So, we decided to keep
this as an actor name.

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:45.480
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.750
So, the funny thing is we
decided we don't have to wait

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:53.510
until that person dies, it's okay
if there are two [foreign word].

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:56.100
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.070
In Japan that's a little
bit unthinkable.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.130
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.510
It was very groundbreaking.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:07.120
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.520
So, my grandfather's brother,
he said, well just step outside

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:15.130
of Japan and you see
that it's normal.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:16.430
It's very normal.

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:21.630
Lots of people have the name of
their parents, or their fathers.

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:25.510
So, don't worry about it.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:32.740
And that is how Shigeyama
became a family name.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.690
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: Speaking,
continuing the line of comments

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:37.300
about your father and so, on I know

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:43.730
that when you study the character's
their techniques [foreign word],

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:47.790
they are almost codified
and so on, but I understand

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.550
that a great actor
puts his own stamp

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.800
on these, makes his own version.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:11.450
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.630
&gt;&gt; MATOKA SHAMUTZU: So, take for
example my father or grandfather,

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:19.130
they will only teach us
about 70% of what they know.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.240
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.900
So, that part is what
has been transmitted.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:32.510
But the remaining 30% is really
up to you to expand upon.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:35.700
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:40.280
And that part, there's no way
they're going to give you that.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:46.510
So, this is Something that you
have to watch and steal [laughter].

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:55.050
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:56.850
And this is ongoing.

00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:02.340
And so, observing the acting of
other people, watching the stage,

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:06.230
that is an extremely
important part of our training.

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.100
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: And I know
that you are really a star

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.580
in many ways in Japan.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.770
You're in television,
the movies and so on,

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.630
and again very much
crossing boundaries

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:19.540
and expanding the horizons
of your generation,

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:22.210
I'm curious, do you have any?

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.930
Well, let's talk for a
moment about the Mozart Opera

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.800
that you talked about, yeah.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.100
His family has been
involved with a number

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:34.100
of really exciting projects
involving many different things.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:38.870
In Paris you're giving workshops,
residencies to teach techniques,

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:43.960
and they've been involved in
theater of the absurd like Beckett.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.330
But there was a Mozart
opera collaboration

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.940
that I think you were involved in.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:54.460
If you could talk a
little bit about that.

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:58.510
[Foreign word] was that it?

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:02.700
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.490
&gt;&gt; MATOKA SHAMUTZU:
So, in Japan less

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:07.510
and less people are
listening to classical music.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:12.090
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:17.510

Kyogen theater, even less.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:23.240
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.660
So, in general, people who
go to these things are seen

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:32.230
as atypical, not normal [laughter].

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:41.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.220
So, our thinking is that if you're
interested in classical music,

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.830
that is western classical music,

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:49.510
you might be interested
in Japanese classics.

in Japanese classics you
would no doubt be interested

in western classical music.

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:16.810
We thought it would be
easy for the audience

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:20.240
to understand what
we're attempting to do.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:28.690
So, we had the idea that this might
be an audience that was receptive

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:35.440
and had a gentle attitude
towards classics.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:43.510
And we thought it was a great
entryway, or gateway to this.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.410

an opera style Kyogen.

wonderful.

at which we could have one

of you ask a question I know
that we have to give time

for the actors to get ready.

or two, are you okay?

that [inaudible] has been
traditionally a male acting domain

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:18.410
is the same true for Kyogen?

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:23.940
&gt;&gt; Is it true for Kyogen?

that was wishful thinking,

I almost say women only.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:46.110
But yes, both noh and
Kyogen are limited to men.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:47.840
&gt;&gt; Question over here.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.130
&gt;&gt; I have attended a
number of Kyogen and noh

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:54.680
and [inaudible] performances
in Japan, in Italy,

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.860
and in the United States.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:01.970
Six months ago, on September
16th, I saw a performance

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:08.360
at the Historic Teatro della
Pergola in Florence Italy

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.220
and it was sponsored by the
Embassy of Japan in Rome

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:15.050
and the Japanese consulate
in Florence

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:18.040
and they did just what
you described,

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.880
which is that there was
first an extensive noh play

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:26.180
and then two different
Kyogen theater productions.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:31.900
Now, the Kyogen actors were
from the [foreign word] School

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:37.440
and actually I wrote down the
names, one was [foreign word]

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.920
and the other was[foreign word].

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.870
And my question was
this, if you are familiar

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:47.490
with this particular company,
would they have a different style

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:51.670
of presenting Kyogen
than your company?

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:55.710
In other words is there a
variety of different styles today

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:58.750 position:56%
In the production of Kyogen theater?

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:03.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.510

I know both of them very well.

[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:15.260
So, Mr. Huto [assumed spelling]
he's much more advanced than I am

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:19.510 position:56%
and [foreign word] is a bit younger.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:24.430
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:32.380
And I actually belong to
the same [inaudible] school.

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:36.510
The scripts are almost identical.

But their activities tend to center,
in Tokyo, and we are Kyoto based.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:55.510
So, we don't have that
much exchange day to day.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:39:00.550
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:06.940
So, of course, they're Tokyo
people so, they're, how do I say?

More stylish [laughter].

[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:20.940
So, we're Kyoto so we
have a comedic touch.

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:40.010
&gt;&gt; I think I saw you in Kyoto at
a performance for a conference

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:45.040
in late August last
year, I'm not sure,

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.470 position:56%
but I was wondering about the music.

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:54.290
Do you use the music
and how the music came

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:57.790
into being with the theater acting.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.950
I believe it was, either
it Kyogen or noh, it was.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.340
&gt;&gt; MATOKA SHAMUTZU: Are you
sure it was me [laughter]?

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.190
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:36.860
End of August last year?

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:54.060
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:58.620 position:56%
So, of course in Kyogen too
sometimes you have musical elements,

00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.920
components.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.600
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:06.780
For example, when you have a
scene of [inaudible] drinking.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.510
I think this is pretty
much universal,

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:14.510
so when you have a
drink, you start to sing.

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:18.320
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.510
So, in that sense I
might have used music.

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:26.120
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:32.510
But that would be a sort of parody
of the chanting that occurs in noh.

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:36.230
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.710
So, I think we might
have used some singing

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:41.880
that was similar to noh chanting.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:45.510
&gt;&gt; So, I guess I'm
interested in the chanting.

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:59.230
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:00.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; MATOKA SHAMUTZU: So, first of all

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:04.670
in noh chanting you don't
have music, a score.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:14.600
So, you have a text and next to
the characters you have symbols.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:18.740
And it's Jo up, down and middle.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:25.510
So, the idea.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:31.520
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:36.530
And this is very relative, it
almost depends on how you are

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:39.090
that day, your condition that day.

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:42.210
And it varies from individual.

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:48.080
So, it's not a fixed, it's
probably most accurate to say

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.830
that it's not a fixed thing.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.370

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:57.810

we'll have to move forward.

revival of the works classics,

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:06.970
are there still being new works

[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:33.540
&gt;&gt; MATOKA SHAMUTZU: So, the
way I see it, to revive things

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:38.640
that have sort of departed
from our contemporary mindset,

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.510
I think of that as
almost an obligation.

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:49.220
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:57.360
So, even if the audience does
not quite get it, unfortunately,

00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:59.510
it's up to us to know that.

in this traditional art
form, this is something

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.510
that we have to continue to do.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:25.630
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:28.920
So, of course when we
mount such performances,

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:36.510 position:56%
mainly the [foreign word] the really
obsessive types will come out.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:40.360
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:44.020
So, in any case, we
only have 180 plays

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:48.740
which are considered the classics.

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:52.510
So, it's in a way it's
easy to see all of them

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:57.090
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:00.510
But of course, we don't
put on all 180 plays.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:04.330
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:06.910
And in most cases, we
try to select those

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:09.510
that have some contemporary
relevance.

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:14.050
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:19.140
So, performances that are
geared more toward a deep

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.510
research attitude.

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:26.230
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:30.370
But, we need to embrace
that also and continue.

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:34.500
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: So, you are,
in fact I want to say too,

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.670
you create new plays
as well don't you?

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:38.970
At least I think so.

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:43.160
&gt;&gt; MATOKA SHAMUTZU: Yes.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.460
&gt;&gt; ANNE MCLEAN: So, this
extraordinary family is,

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:48.580 position:56%
from the time of Shakespeare,
playing and preserving the very old,

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:52.690
and remarkable, but also
creating the new, it's amazing.

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:56.470
So, we thank you for being
here and we are grateful.

00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:59.510
We look forward to the performance.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:05.240
[ Applause ]

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.890

of the Library of Congress.
