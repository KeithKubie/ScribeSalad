emerge in rural communities now this was
 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.120

7 and a half years ago it was nowhere

7 and a half years ago it was nowhere
 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.160
7 and a half years ago it was nowhere
near it is now it's phenomenal what's

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170
near it is now it's phenomenal what's
 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.260
near it is now it's phenomenal what's
happened in the last 7 odd years but

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610
because one of the main problems people
 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.910

an amazing picture I took I think about

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720
an amazing picture I took I think about
 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.390
an amazing picture I took I think about
four years ago in Uganda and it looks

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400
four years ago in Uganda and it looks
 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.070
four years ago in Uganda and it looks
like a torch ad but it's you know by the

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080
like a torch ad but it's you know by the
 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.630
like a torch ad but it's you know by the

this thing if you really really want to

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620
this thing if you really really want to
 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.260
this thing if you really really want to
and this is how people are thinking

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270
and this is how people are thinking
 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.260
and this is how people are thinking
about how you sell to an audience and a

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270
about how you sell to an audience and a
 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.670

market which is very very different to
the one that we live in and I think we

the one that we live in and I think we
 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.270
the one that we live in and I think we
need to be aware as we march ahead that

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280
need to be aware as we march ahead that
 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.480
need to be aware as we march ahead that

big moment for me I suppose that there

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020
big moment for me I suppose that there
 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.120
big moment for me I suppose that there
were a couple of big moments but the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130
were a couple of big moments but the
 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.370
were a couple of big moments but the
early one was doing the work in Kruger

National Park and they wanted to set up
 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.479
National Park and they wanted to set up
a system to start sending messages to

a system to start sending messages to
 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.190
a system to start sending messages to
the communities around the park to

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200
the communities around the park to
 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.690
the communities around the park to
re-engage them in the conservation

questions just generally start to talk
to them a little bit more and they were

to them a little bit more and they were
 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.520
to them a little bit more and they were
starting to get phones and they said to

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530
starting to get phones and they said to
 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.740
starting to get phones and they said to
me can we set a system up that allows us

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750
me can we set a system up that allows us
 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.560
me can we set a system up that allows us
to send 200 texts to go up to 200 people

and you know we can do elephant alerts

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430
and you know we can do elephant alerts
 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.740
and you know we can do elephant alerts
as well when elephants break the fence

a training and it just didn't make any

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860
a training and it just didn't make any
 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.460
a training and it just didn't make any
sense so that was kind of the gap and

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470
sense so that was kind of the gap and
 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.659
sense so that was kind of the gap and
the other part really for me was that

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669
the other part really for me was that

Kruger national parks were going to
control this system and we're not

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790
control this system and we're not

quickly realized that in fact they were
 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.360
quickly realized that in fact they were
the first ones who would know if an

100 miles away and it made no sense so I

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550
100 miles away and it made no sense so I
 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.040
100 miles away and it made no sense so I
was thinking about where is the control

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050
was thinking about where is the control

Saturday night and I just thought about

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910
Saturday night and I just thought about
 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.430
Saturday night and I just thought about
hey you know this idea started to come

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440
hey you know this idea started to come
 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.070

through my head and it really turned out

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080
through my head and it really turned out
 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.080
through my head and it really turned out
like this it's why not set up a

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090
like this it's why not set up a
 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.880
like this it's why not set up a
communication hub but it runs off of the

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890
communication hub but it runs off of the
 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.620
communication hub but it runs off of the

doesn't require the internet so by
installing a software on a laptop you

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080
installing a software on a laptop you
 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.260
installing a software on a laptop you
plug in a phone with a cable put numbers

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270
plug in a phone with a cable put numbers

communities into that system you can
send them all the message and it's very

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979
send them all the message and it's very
 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.890
send them all the message and it's very
easy and it works pretty much anywhere

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900
easy and it works pretty much anywhere
 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.260
easy and it works pretty much anywhere
and and funnily enough it does work in

places like this where many many tools

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000
places like this where many many tools
 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.280
