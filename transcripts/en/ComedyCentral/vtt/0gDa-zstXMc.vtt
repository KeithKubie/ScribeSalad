00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:04.571
Next up, incoherent
Lands' End vulture Sarah Palin,

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:06.640
-uh... the Ala...
-(laughter)

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.943
the Alaskan rodeo cyborg came
roaring back into the spotlight

00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:12.112
to jump on the Trump wagon.

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.282
Here she is endorsing him
back in January.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:19.753
Looking around at all of you,
you hard-working Iowa families,

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:23.423
you farm families, and...
teachers and teamsters

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:26.360
and... cops and cooks,

00:00:26.393 --> 00:00:28.495
you rock and rollers,

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.097
and holy rollers...

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.434
you with the hands
that rock the cradle...

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:36.870
(laughter, shouting)

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:40.140
Total... total courtesy smile
for that.

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:42.976
(like Palin): To all you
hands that rock the cradle

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.113
and girl interrupteds
and single white females

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.614
and Jennifer 8,

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:49.850
this is for all
the Rosemary's babies

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:51.285
and the Air Buds

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.654
and the big trouble
in Little Chinas

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:56.423
-(cheering, applause)
-and Fridays and Next Fridays,

00:00:56.456 --> 00:01:00.594
and especially all you workin'
hard down at the road house

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.162
by point break.

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:05.065
This campaign
will never die hard!

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:08.068
(laughter, applause, cheering)

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.304
Comedians,
where is Sarah Palin now?

00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:13.140
-April. -I don't know,
probably becoming a grandmother

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:14.975
for, like, the ninth time.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:17.077
Bristol hates condoms!

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.513
All right, points. Points.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:22.316
Uh... up to her tits in pills.

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:24.251
-(laughter)
-Points.

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:25.819
Sarah Pillin. Ramon.

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:28.622
Based off of her sweater,
Jo-Ann Fabrics.

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:31.758
-Yes, points.
-(laughter, whooping, applause)

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.494
No.

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:36.230
That's not a...

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:37.998
I'll tell you exactly
what happened.

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.833
A disco ball got loose
in Anchorage

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:41.668
and she hunted it
and skinned it.

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:43.570
-(laughter)
-That is what happened.

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:43.670
-I used every part
of the disco ball. -Every part!
