we made this discoveries

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670
we made this discoveries
 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.560
we made this discoveries
early 1970s but it was only until 1985

early 1970s but it was only until 1985
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.470
early 1970s but it was only until 1985
that this international agreement was

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480
that this international agreement was
 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.380
that this international agreement was
agreed upon we did it and the ozone

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390
agreed upon we did it and the ozone
 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.470
agreed upon we did it and the ozone
layer is recovering this is a great

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480
layer is recovering this is a great
 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.519
layer is recovering this is a great
success story but it it really it stands

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529
success story but it it really it stands
 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.720
success story but it it really it stands
out for another reason

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730
out for another reason
 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.220
out for another reason
is that it's almost unique there was a

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230
is that it's almost unique there was a
 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.040
is that it's almost unique there was a
problem that society had to respond to

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050
problem that society had to respond to
 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.229
problem that society had to respond to
we decided that we had to communicate

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239
we decided that we had to communicate
 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.819
we decided that we had to communicate
this to society but for people in

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829
this to society but for people in
 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.760
this to society but for people in
government to respond they often need to

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
government to respond they often need to
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.660
government to respond they often need to
have public opinion in their favor it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670
have public opinion in their favor it
 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.090
have public opinion in their favor it
was really not customary for scientists

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100
was really not customary for scientists
 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.549
was really not customary for scientists
to go out to try to convince the public

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
to go out to try to convince the public
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.950
to go out to try to convince the public
that something had to be done but we

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960
that something had to be done but we
 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.090
that something had to be done but we
realized if it is not us then who and if

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
realized if it is not us then who and if
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.319
realized if it is not us then who and if
it's not now when society has many

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329
it's not now when society has many
 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.320
it's not now when society has many
challenges today but among the most

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330
challenges today but among the most
 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.899
challenges today but among the most
important ones it is certainly climate

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909
important ones it is certainly climate
 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.359
important ones it is certainly climate
change so the problem of CFCs and the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369
change so the problem of CFCs and the
 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.550
change so the problem of CFCs and the
ozone layer was entirely a problem that

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560
ozone layer was entirely a problem that
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.039
ozone layer was entirely a problem that
was figured out by scientists and solved

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
was figured out by scientists and solved
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.760
was figured out by scientists and solved
by the rest of us through political work

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770
by the rest of us through political work
 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.550
by the rest of us through political work
but the issue is now as a political one

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560
but the issue is now as a political one
 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.249
but the issue is now as a political one
if we work together and work on all

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259
if we work together and work on all
 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.350
if we work together and work on all
different fronts not just you know

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
different fronts not just you know
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.240
different fronts not just you know
science and research but with politics

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250
science and research but with politics
 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.130
science and research but with politics
and economics we can have a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140
and economics we can have a
 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.780
and economics we can have a
comprehensive solution to climate change

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790
comprehensive solution to climate change
 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.150
comprehensive solution to climate change
so we have to keep working very hard

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160
so we have to keep working very hard
 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.190
so we have to keep working very hard
let's be optimistic but rational if we

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200
let's be optimistic but rational if we
 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.310
let's be optimistic but rational if we
work together we all end up having a

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320
work together we all end up having a
 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.110
work together we all end up having a
better world

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120
better world
 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.159
better world
