00:00:00.445 --> 00:00:01.230
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, everyone.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:01.910
Thanks for coming out.

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.250
Today we welcome Joel Stein.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.480
JOEL STEIN: Is that weird?

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.610
Is that not what people do?

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.100
I haven't done this
that many times.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.940
MALE SPEAKER: You might
know Joel from--

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.470
JOEL STEIN: Sitting here.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.330
MALE SPEAKER: --his columns
in "Time" magazine.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.050
Also, he's the guy
right over there.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.090
Also from various TV
shows where he--

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.470
right after this he'll be going
to MSNBC to discuss

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.440
about important things,
I'm sure.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.660
JOEL STEIN: With an audience
about this size.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.510
MALE SPEAKER: His book is "Man
Made." He will teach us about

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.760
being manly, as someone who
grew up reading books and

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.270
played with computers probably
needs to learn more about.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.115
So Joel Stein.

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:37.616
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.616 --> 00:00:40.430
JOEL STEIN: No, I already
did that for you.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.780
This may be the only group on
the planet I could teach

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.390
something about being
manly to.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.980
So yeah, this will
work out well.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.990
I write for "Time" magazine.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.570
The only beat I cover is myself
because it's the only

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.750
thing I'm interested in.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.490
And no one was covering
that beat.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.130
I got there in 1997.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.300
I was writing for a magazine
called "Time Out New York,"

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.640
and this editor at "Time" asked
me to write a piece for

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.580
this quarterly they did called
"Time Digital," back when

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.480
people-- like the internet
was new and people were

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.470
excited about it.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.990
You had a lot more magazines
like "Red Herring" and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.880
"Business 2.0."

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.510
And so I went to Kansas City and
Minneapolis, to find the

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.490
world's greatest video
game player.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.580
And I'd never been on a
business trip before.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.350
I was like barely old enough to
rent a car, which they make

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.300
impossible until you're like
30 for some reason.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.960
And I remember sitting in my
hotel room having to write it

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:40.520
that night.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.890
It was due the next day, and
just freaking out, like

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.560
writing for anything that
"Time" magazine put

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.720
out seemed so scary.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.020
And I was just panicked.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.790
And I couldn't write.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.370
And I drove around Minneapolis
for a while.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.915
I got to a Steak 'n Shake.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:56.730
I drove in.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.920
I was just going to get an ice
tea or something, and I went

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.680
up to the drive-through box.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.130
And the woman said,
can I help you?

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.030
And I said, yeah, I just
really want to talk.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.169
And she said, OK.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.010
And so I told her my problems.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.920
I had this story to write.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.430
It's for "Time" magazine.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.970
I keep picturing 4 million
people reading it.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.870
And she gave me the most amazing
pep talk, which was

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.470
like, they wouldn't have hired
you if they didn't think you

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.740
could do it.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.300
You've done this before.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.530
Don't get in your
head so much.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.790
And it was so incredibly
helpful.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.690
And I drove up and I--

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.330
we didn't have the connection
I kind of hoped we'd have.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.770
It's one thing when
you're talking to

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.560
someone through a box.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.970
And then you see--

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.310
I thought she'd be
my future wife.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.190
And it didn't work out.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.450
But I did go home
and I wrote it.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.070
I went to the hotel
and I wrote it.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.870
A couple months later, I got
hired by "Time" magazine,

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.240
which freaked me out.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.800
Because I thought I'd have to
write super boring stuff for

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.530
the rest of my life.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.090
But they were paying me in real
money instead of in food,

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.660
which is what I was getting paid
at "Time Out New York."

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.900
Which I think you get paid--

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.610
do they pay you in food or they
also you a salary here?

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.792
Because I would do it
just for the food.

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:05.245
But that's why I'm
a journalist and

00:03:05.245 --> 00:03:07.955
you guys are engineers.

00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:10.360
So I've been working at
"Time" since '97.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.310
And what I've found is that the
best way for me to learn

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.610
things is by doing things.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.920
So when I write about something,
even if it doesn't

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.210
go in the article, even if the
article's all in third person,

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.100
I usually go do something
to understand it.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.430
Like I recently wrote a profile
of Steve Ells, the CEO

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.490
of Chipotle.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.460
And I kind of thought
I got him.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.840
I thought I got the company.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.090
But then they got the company
to let me work at a Chipotle

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.670
for half a day.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.440
And then I kind of really got
what they were telling me.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.690
It's really hard for me,
although I did fine in school,

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.170
to learn any other way.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.190
So that's kind of how I got
to writing this book.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.850
And kind of how I do most of my
stories in "Time." I had to

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.140
do a cover on George Clooney.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.400
And I didn't know-- like
sitting down with

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.580
him seemed so boring.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.950
So I invited him over my house
for dinner thinking he would

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.060
say no, but just so it would buy
me time to think of more

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.090
interesting things.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.420
And he said yes.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.130
At which point, I had to tell
my wife that George Clooney

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.430
was coming over for dinner,
which if anyone has a normal

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.649
wife and a normal
relationship--

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:19.950
I forgot this is on YouTube.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.680
If anyone has a wife who

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.120
occasionally Googles her husband--

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.940
my wife doesn't care.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.270
This is fine.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.110
Yeah, she was pissed.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.390
She was like, I have
to clean the house

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.840
and make like a playlist.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.420
Like you're cleaning it and
you're making dinner.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.530
I'm like, yeah, of course.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.980
So she got drunk and so
did George Clooney.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.280
And she spent a half hour just
grilling him on why he doesn't

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.210
have a wife, which I was
so happy about, just

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.640
taking crazy notes.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.930
And didn't make it in
the piece, my editor

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:54.480
kept cutting it.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.140
I kept putting it back in and
my editor kept cutting it.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.130
But yeah, so there is video.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.900
I find that the things I do,
because some of them--

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.920
I think because journalists
lie all the time, people

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.020
assume that I'm lying.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.750
So I've taken to, if I
ever can remember.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.810
And it's easier now when I have
my Google Android phone

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.430
in my pocket.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.430
I shoot video whenever I can.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.550
Like when Clooney was over, this
alarm started going off.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.980
I just figured I'd ignore it
because that's what I do when

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.060
alarms go off.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.380
And he had been a handy man.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.110
He's like, no, we're
going to fix this.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.710
Let's figure out where this
alarm's coming from.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.180
So he wound up looking
all over my house.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.600
He went under my house
and got this ladder,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.320
way under my house--

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.910
I live in the Hills.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.880
And then he brought it and went
into my attic, which I

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.160
now call the Clooney
attic, because I've

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.540
never been in there.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.080
I still haven't been in there.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.270
And he went up there
with a flashlight,

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.330
a little bit drunk.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.160
And so I videotaped
all of this.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.810
It turned out under our table
was a monoxide alarm.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.450
It just needed a new battery,
which we figured out

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.710
eventually.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.030
We would have got there
much earlier if

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.700
we hadn't been drinking.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.330
But I videotaped it.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.000
And now people who read this
story don't think believed he

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.520
was in my attic, but
you see the video.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.320
So for the book, I tried to
videotape as much of me

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.210
getting beat up as I could, so
that people would believe it.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.510
So for the book, I found out--

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.880
my wife was pregnant.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.460
And we were going to the first
sonogram where we could

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.540
probably tell if it was
a boy or a girl.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.090
And I remember thinking
that I don't care if

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.037
it's a boy or girl.

00:06:37.037 --> 00:06:40.090
I'm a child of the '70s.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.990
I understand both genders
are lovely.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.060
I've enjoyed both-- that's
weird to say.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.380
Totally straight.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.980
I couldn't be more straight.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.250
Do I find some men attractive?

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.440
Sure, we all do.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.590
But I've never gone to second
base with a guy, ever.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:01.560
Leave it there.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.560
So I thought I didn't care.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.760
Went to get the sonogram
and they told us that

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.360
our son was a boy.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.640
In fact, our OB/GYN who I will
not name is amazing, super

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.630
cool, super smart women,
went to Princeton.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.960
Just super smart.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.145
But when she gave us the--

00:07:27.145 --> 00:07:30.230
when you go to a sonogram now,
you get the equivalent of like

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.000
a photo booth strip of pictures
of your child.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.030
And she said to us,
it's a boy.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.690
Wow, he's got a really
big penis.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.620
If things don't work out for him
in school, he can always

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.360
work in the Valley.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.710
And like, this is
all so weird.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.230
I'm just processing
information.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.580
She gives us this photo strip.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.270
She draws like a penis and
testicles and writes, wow,

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.440
exclamation point next to it.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:06.610
And all I'm thinking is, we need
a new OB/GYN for sure.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.600
But I'm also having like a
mini-panic attack where I'm

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.170
freaking out because
I'm picturing--

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.460
all I can picture
is that penis.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.300
And that penis wanting
to throw a baseball.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.310
And that penis wanting
to go camping.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.940
And that penis getting
in a fight, needing

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.980
to know how to fight.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.415
And I like, I'm not capable
of any of that stuff.

00:08:23.415 --> 00:08:26.870
When I was a kid, all my
friends were girls.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.800
I listened to nothing but show
tunes until I was like 13.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.504
I had a glass animal
collection.

00:08:33.504 --> 00:08:38.120
I had an Easy Bake Oven, which
I still think is awesome

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.429
because you can make
cakes in your room.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:44.460
But a lot of other
boys didn't.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.590
I never went camping.

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.030
I never played Little League.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.960
I just thought, my son's going
to want to do all this stuff

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.540
and I'm not going
to be able to.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.130
So I went out and tried to learn
all the things I should

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:56.500
have learned long before this.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.630
I went on a series of what
I call manventures.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.210
And the first thing I did was
I figured I'd fix the first

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.220
problem, which was not
becoming a Boy Scout.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.840
So I called the Boy Scouts and
they said I could, indeed,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.870
earn my first badge.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.620
And so I went on a camping
trip for a weekend with

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.100
11-year-old Boy Scouts.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.520
And put up my first tent
and slept in it.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.390
I learned the difference between
sleeping in a tent and

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.920
sleeping just not in a
tent doesn't exist.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.640
I don't know who the tent
industry has fooled.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.480
But it's still cold.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.040
It's wet when you lay.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.190
I either had the wrong tent or
everyone else is an idiot.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.600
So I went on a bunch of
these adventures.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:41.900
Let's see.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.130
I did so many things that I've
blocked out of my head because

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:44.840
they are painful.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.810
I got a day trader to give me
$100,000 to day trade with of

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.800
his money for a day
in Chicago.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.792
I worked in a pit crew of a
racing team, the America Le

00:09:55.792 --> 00:09:56.600
Mans racing.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.130
Team I had a Lamborghini
Superleggera for 3 days, which

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.860
was incredibly fun.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:07.450
I helped my very manly
father-in-law fix a house,

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.452
re-roof and do some
plumbing work in a

00:10:09.452 --> 00:10:12.020
house for three days.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.680
I went turkey hunting.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.160
Have any of you ever gone
turkey hunting?

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:16.770
I'm at Google.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.900
I'm asking silly questions.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.590
Have any of you ever played a
video game in which turkey

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.420
hunting takes place?

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:23.940
AUDIENCE: "Duck Hunt."

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.225
JOEL STEIN: "Duck Hunt."
That's close.

00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:27.220
I, too, have played "Duck
Hunt." Turkey hunting is

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.750
totally different than
"Duck Hunt."

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.770
So I had this crush on a girl
from kindergarten to fifth

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.820
grade named Bizzy Sklars.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.870
Very worthwhile crush.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.520
And In fact, nothing to
do with this story,

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.130
just want to brag--

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.030
after college, kissed
her at a bar.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.250
A bar called The
Village Idiot.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.100
Only time I've ever kissed
a woman at a bar.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.600
Village Idiot.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.340
It closed now.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.860
Yeah, I think it was owned by
the same people that own

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.860
Coyote Ugly, perhaps.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.300
Yeah.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.490
But anyway, I kissed
Bizzy Sklars there.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.150
Wrote it on the wall.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.330
Didn't write it on the wall,
wrote it in my book.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:04.410
And so Bizzy did not
want to marry me.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:10.360
She wound up marrying a very
manly dude up in Vermont who

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.540
built the extension on the log
cabin they live in by chopping

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.830
down the trees in his backyard
himself, and like

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:16.860
putting the logs in.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.425
And his house is just
dead animals on the

00:11:19.425 --> 00:11:21.130
wall that he's killed.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:22.830
And I remember I walked
into their house.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.780
I'd never been up
there before.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.200
Because I came up to go turkey
hunting with them.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.810
And there were like three
deer on the wall.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.580
And I was like, oh, you
killed them all?

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.750
He's like, yeah, I wanted one
that I shot with with a rifle,

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.842
one I shot with a muzzle
loader, and one

00:11:38.842 --> 00:11:40.380
I shot with a crossbow.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.420
I was like, I don't
want to do this.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.640
To go hunting--

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.450
I'm pretty socially liberal.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:53.580
And to go hunting, turns out
you have to pass a test and

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:54.600
get a license.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.630
It's like a 12-hour class,
then you take a test.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:59.860
And I was like, I'm just going
hunting for one day with a

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.790
trained guy.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.110
I still have to take
this test?

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.950
And they looked at me like I
was crazy when I called.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.110
Or they said I was crazy.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.590
Of course you have to take a
test, you're going to have a

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:07.740
gun in your hands.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.070
And I had moved further right
than the NRA in about five

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.930
minutes of wanting to go hunting
than I ever thought I

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.340
could possibly move.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.240
So to turkey hunting, just
in case anyone ever

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.200
invites you, don't go.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.000
You have to wake up--

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.850
like with all male activities,
you have to wake up

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.540
at like 4:00 AM.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.740
Because guys go and play
poker at night

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.190
and go to strip clubs.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.660
Guys are out until 2:00 and
they wake up at 4:00.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.840
Sleeping is not manly was the
first lesson I learned.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:41.110
And for turkey hunting, it turns
out I don't like animals

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.260
enough to kill them.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.090
Because you have to get really
involved in animal life.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:51.030
To kill a turkey, you have to go
out in the woods, hide, not

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.570
move, wear camouflage, and
pretend you're a female turkey

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.610
who desperately wants
to get laid.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.570
So you have to learn like what
a sexy turkey would sound

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:04.620
like, how to determine other
actual female sexy turkeys,

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.280
and get in like arguments with
them that you're going to be a

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.790
better turkey blow job giver
to your turkey man.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.840
I think eating meat is wrong.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.150
Except for turkey because
turkeys are the worst people

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.010
in the world.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:20.900
Turkeys--

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.320
honestly, this is what a male
turkey does in the morning.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:30.070
He goes out, has sex with as
many females as he can, and as

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:34.455
soon as a less alpha turkey
comes along, he beats them up,

00:13:34.455 --> 00:13:37.080
and makes them stand
there and watch.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.695
During mating season, that's
a turkey morning.

00:13:38.695 --> 00:13:42.840
They just have sex until quote
unquote-- from Matt, Bizzy's

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.900
husband, they have quote, "They
have sex until their

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.200
peckers hurt." That's
their morning.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.315
So we went out and Matt sat--

00:13:49.315 --> 00:13:52.710
I held the gun and Matt sat next
to me and tried to be a

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:53.380
sexy turkey.

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.000
And he gets really into it, like
making sexy turkey faces.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.050
And I just thought, this is--

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.270
I'm not manly enough to even
be comfortable with

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.010
what's going on.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:11.260
And after turkey hunting,
I got the--

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.080
so I figured I had to do
something military related.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.740
And I thought about
embedding in Iraq.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.220
And my wife thought about me
not embedding in Iraq.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.060
I didn't want to embed Iraq.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.400
And I thought when you embed,
you kind of just watch anyway.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.830
I wanted to do something
more experiential.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:29.610
So I called someone at
Department of Defense and I

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.670
said, would any of the branches
let me do like three

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.540
days of boot camp somewhere?

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.010
And the next thing I know, every
branch of the military

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.730
was emailing me better and
better offers to compete to

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:43.640
have me use up our nation's
resources.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.110
And so it got crazier
and crazier.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.050
I was going to do something--

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.240
I did do something
with the Marines.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.910
I was talking to the Navy.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.730
The Army--

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.560
this General Mark Hurtling--

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.480
General--

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.580
started emailing me jokes.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.310
He started emailing me
like, I heard you're

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.430
talking to the Navy.

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:06.490
I thought you wanted to learn
how to be a real man.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.740
Smiley face.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.310
And I was like, I want to be in
the branch of the military

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.220
where the generals
use emoticons.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.790
That's my branch.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.560
So I did some stuff with the
Marines, but the real stuff I

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.780
did was with the Army.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.020
And again, rhetorical
question.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.890
Have any of you served
in the military?

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:27.790
Really?

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:28.492
What'd you do?

00:15:28.492 --> 00:15:29.640
AUDIENCE: Air Force.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.180
JOEL STEIN: How long were
you in the Air Force?

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.666
AUDIENCE: I was [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.820
JOEL STEIN: So do you have a
job here or you just take

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.360
people's lunch money?

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.730
What do you do?

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:44.936
AUDIENCE: That's what
I do, generally.

00:15:44.936 --> 00:15:46.050
JOEL STEIN: Yeah, because
they don't need it.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.100
AUDIENCE: No one has lunch
money because it's free.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.110
JOEL STEIN: They probably
don't mind.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:51.210
AUDIENCE: Screwed that one up.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.220
JOEL STEIN: Wow.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.985
Did you all know that?

00:15:54.985 --> 00:15:56.500
I figured that would be
something everyone at Google

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.790
knew that someone served.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.500
He will protect you when
things go badly here.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:06.480
So boot camp is really
stressful, like they yell at

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.530
you all the time.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.090
When you eat, you
can't look up.

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:11.250
And if you look up,
they yell at you.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:14.170
You don't talk to each other.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.776
This is true in the Marines,
but it's also true in the

00:16:15.776 --> 00:16:19.880
Army, I went to go do the
swimming test in the Marines.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.550
And they made me take off my
clothes, which was weird

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.090
because they were dressed.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:27.900
And then they made me walk
through these very Baden-Baden

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.950
kind of showers that I
had to walk through.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.500
And then they made me urinate.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.870
And this guy stood and yelled
in my ear and counted down

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.323
from 30 while I urinated.

00:16:37.323 --> 00:16:40.150
And I was like, oh, they yell
at you while you piss, like

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.800
that's stressful.

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.990
And then he got to zero and i
didn't know what to do because

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.040
I still had a good stream going
and he just started

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.000
counting again from 10.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.820
So I don't know what the
consequences were, but it was

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.440
scary at shit, like just someone
screaming in your ear

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.840
while you piss.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.960
And basically, it's just getting
screamed at constantly

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.650
because everything
you do is wrong.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:04.089
So I had only been in
my fake boot camp--

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:05.470
They let me do it with
a real troop.

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:10.240
It was kind of real,
but I knew I could

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.790
leave at any time.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.619
I was 39 years old.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:15.930
I wasn't like away from home
for my first time.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:21.020
But it was really stressful,
like the way that a haunted

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.800
house is stressful. even though
it's fake, it still

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.930
feels real because someone's
really yelling at you.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.250
And so I'm staling telling
you the fact that I was

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.560
only three hours in.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.300
I hadn't done any physical
activity.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.600
It was super hot.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.125
And I hadn't really slept
because I was nervous the

00:17:37.125 --> 00:17:38.070
night before.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:43.790
And they made me eat
this cold MRE.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:48.680
I fainted three hours in
without having done any

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.540
physical activity.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.840
I've never fainted before.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.920
Never fainted after.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.730
But if any of you go into the
military, my advice is faint

00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:59.170
right away.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.000
Because the tenor changes
immediately.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.770
I had Pedialyte, and a
fan, and a doctor.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.690
And I was treated--

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.150
throughout the whole experience,
I was treated a

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:09.600
little bit better.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.690
Yet, even like there's this
thing called the night

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.750
infiltration course,
which is amazing.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:18.000
They wait until it
gets dark out.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.500
So you're just waiting
and waiting.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.850
And then they have these
speakers that blast the Muslim

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:26.710
call to prayers, which if
you're in a US military

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.670
uniform, I don't care if you are
Muslim, it's the scariest

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:29.480
thing in the world.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.960
And then they play women
and children screaming.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.510
And then they make you get into
a low crawl and crawl

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:40.130
towards these towers that are
shooting actual live machine

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.160
gun fire right over your head.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.740
So you don't stand up.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:45.940
You keep crawling.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.590
It was one of the most amazing
things I've done my life

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.095
because I'm not a very
focused person.

00:18:52.095 --> 00:18:54.530
I don't, as you know,
don't play sports.

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:57.470
But when people are shooting
live real machine gun fire

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:01.110
over your head, you really
are in the moment.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.100
Every so often they
fire a flare.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.930
And the idea was you had to stay
completely still, so that

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:11.790
you wouldn't be seen by the
enemy, which was actually some

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.850
private somewhere shooting
a machine gun at you.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.550
And the sky lights up and
you have to stay still.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.760
It was one of the most oddly
peaceful moments of my life.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.560
Because there was nowhere
else I could possibly

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.710
be or think to be.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:24.640
And it was amazing.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.130
And I got to the end where
you're supposed to stand up

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:28.030
and I didn't stand up.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:28.700
I kept going.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.000
But eventually I stood up.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.580
I was kind of proud of myself.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.220
I had survived and done like a
decent job of telling other

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.410
people to go away from these
TNT areas that were

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.860
exploding near us.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.910
They were fenced off, but
still they were loud.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:48.210
And I got to the end and these
people came over to me and

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.730
they're like, we're doctors.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:51.330
Are you OK?

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.040
We heard you fainted
earlier today.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.110
And I realized that if I ever
was in the military, that's

00:19:56.110 --> 00:20:00.410
all I'd be known for for
my entire career.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:04.410
I'd be carrying POWs over my
shoulders and they'd be barely

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:05.970
alive and mocking me for
being the guy that

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.390
fainted during boot camp.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.440
So the military's out for me.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:16.590
And then finally, I decided
part of my problem was I'm

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.150
afraid of confrontation.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:22.480
So I decided that really, being
afraid of confrontation

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.530
taken to the extreme is being
afraid of getting in a fight.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.370
So I decided I needed
to get into a fight.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.680
And I didn't know
how to do that.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.030
Do you go to a bar and insult
someone's woman, like I had no

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.520
idea how to get into a fight.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.830
So I did what all
wimpy guys do--

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.860
journalists at least when they
want to do something, is I

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:39.560
called a publicist.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.680
And I called the publicist for
the UFC and I said, I would

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.360
like to fight one of your
fighters, knowing they'd say

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.780
no because they have lawyers.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.450
And they don't make you sign
NDAs as soon as you walk into

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.510
a room, but they do
have lawyers.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:58.130
And the publicist said,
that's a great idea.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:02.000
We will let you fight
Randy Couture.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.260
And I googled Randy Couture and
I thought, this is not a

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.510
good idea at all.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:12.510
I couldn't back out though,
because the whole point was I

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.060
was afraid of confrontation, so
backing out seemed like a

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:14.670
horrible idea.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.610
So I went and trained with
Dana White, who's the

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.310
president of the UFC, and he set
up some training for me.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:22.550
And one of the things
he did was that--

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.920
I did videotape, so that people
could believe it.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:31.920
Is he had this jujitsu black
belt guy with me.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.870
He said, the first I want you
to do, dude, you got to get

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:35.030
choked out.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:39.520
And so I said, I just want to
learn how to defend myself.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.400
I don't know if I have to
experience the worst of it.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.440
He's like, dude, you got to
know what it's like to get

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.080
choked out.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:46.370
So he had this guy take off
his shirt, oddly, and get

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.500
behind me--

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.990
as if this wasn't gay enough--

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:51.350
and choke me out.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:57.170
And he had never choked out
a total pussy before.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:01.960
So he didn't know that I would
immediately, in the situation,

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.010
instead of trying to fight him,
which I knew was useless,

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:05.350
I just wanted to get
it over with.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.010
So I tried to go to sleep.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:12.190
And I was just trying to help.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:14.740
I am an awesome actor,
apparently.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:15.840
And they thought
I fell asleep.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.620
And the next thing I know, Dana
White is yelling in my

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.650
face, dude, did you dream?

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.480
I was like, did I dream?

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.240
He's like, yeah, you dream.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:22.820
It's crazy.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.040
I don't think you
were choked out.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.040
Let's do it again.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.560
So I was like, no, no, no.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.330
And the guy chokes
me out again.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:32.160
And again, I'm fake sleeping.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.320
And again, he's fooled.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.575
And my voice and my throat is
so sore, like that night I

00:22:37.575 --> 00:22:40.655
couldn't swallow my own spit.

00:22:40.655 --> 00:22:45.200
Now I know why men for eons
have been such dicks.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:50.040
Because if you have a really
miserable, hard physical day,

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.140
I couldn't talk.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.460
I couldn't smile.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:56.910
I was just an unhappy zombie,
which is how I imagine men

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:59.630
come home from like mining as.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.690
My wife was like, you can't--

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:05.455
this was the day before
I was supposed

00:23:05.455 --> 00:23:06.450
to fight Randy Couture.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:08.330
And she's like, you can't
do that tomorrow.

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:10.430
Part of being a man is
knowing when to quit.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:15.030
I was in enough of a daze where
I was like, yeah, that

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:15.520
makes sense.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.940
Like anything you say right
now would make sense, like

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:20.450
being a man is knowing how
to arrange flowers.

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:21.990
Anything would've made sense.

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:24.660
And so I woke up the next
morning and this

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.700
fog had kind of lifted.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.390
My throat still killed, but
I was able to function.

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:31.320
So I went and I fought
Randy Couture.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.360
I met him thinking I would charm
him and that he would

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.780
know not to hurt me.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.760
But he would not talk to me.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.300
He just like pointed.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.440
And we went to this ring.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.270
I was so, so scared.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:48.410
But I was hoping it would
be over in five seconds.

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.730
He would either hit me
and I would blackout.

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:53.990
Or he would get me into some
kind of hold and it would end.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:56.910
But instead, Randy Couture
decided to go at like 10% and

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:59.490
let me know what five minutes
in the ring felt like.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:01.880
And he would just toy with me
and kind of knock me down,

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.020
then let me go and knock
me down and let me go.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.720
I don't recommend this
as an experience.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:16.400
But after doing all this stuff,
I realized that there's

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.910
a lot of it I didn't like.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.530
And that genetically, there's
just some stuff I'm

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:21.700
predisposed not to like.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:25.000
I don't have the kind of
detailed attention span for

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.820
some of the stuff.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.620
I do fix stuff around my
house now, really minor

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.730
stuff that I YouTube.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:34.310
Some of it's so much easier
than you think, and it

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.800
impresses my wife, and
it gets me laid.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.670
So if fixing a toilet will get
me laid and it takes a half

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:41.390
hour, I will fix a toilet.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.320
And it does make you feel good
about yourself because it's

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.900
like, first of all, it's faster
than calling someone

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.170
and standing around and
pretending to watch him do it.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.100
And it's cheaper.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.270
It does make you feel connected
to your home in a

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:53.180
different way.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.210
But during this whole time that
I was doing this, I also

00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:00.010
was making this list for my son
of advice of things that I

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.690
had experienced, things
people had said to me.

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:07.270
And in the end, what I'd learned
from doing this book

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:11.030
is that what I learned from
writing my column in "Time"

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:14.880
magazine, which is that the only
real way to change is by

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.070
doing stuff.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.000
I've become 10% manlier.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.180
If I kept doing this stuff, I
think I would really change.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.480
But I've been lazy.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:29.340
And so I thought about
this list.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.890
In the end, it's a really
good list and I'm

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:32.900
really proud of it.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.300
But in the end, I decided
not to give it to him.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.330
Because the only way
a man learns is by

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.430
doing, not by reading.

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:44.760
So I don't think he'll
ever see that list.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.700
But I'll put it up online,
I don't care.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.860
Is there anything I could
possibly tell you about either

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:58.600
my job, my book,
or my sex life?

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:02.740
My use of Google to improve
my sex life?

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.310
AUDIENCE: So in your experiences
through the book--

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.420
JOEL STEIN: Mohawks, no.

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:06.650
Not manly.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:07.880
Another question?

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.010
AUDIENCE: What was the most
physically demanding and what

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.850
was the most mentally
demanding?

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:13.320
JOEL STEIN: The Army
was by far the

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.690
most mentally demanding.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:15.920
It wasn't even close.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.250
The most physically
demanding--

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:21.930
Army boot camp.

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.570
The Marine boot camp was
a tiny bit harder.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:27.070
But even the Marine boot camp,
I was an old man doing stuff

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:28.470
meant for young men.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.510
I passed everything.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.750
I can't even really swim and
I got to level three of the

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:37.370
Marine swimming test out of I
think four without knowing

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:38.750
what it was or trying.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.185
The Army stuff was like, for
the most part-- some

00:26:41.185 --> 00:26:42.040
of it was very hard.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.890
But for the most part,
it's like three

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:45.550
hard workouts a day.

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.270
But that's all you're
doing, really.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:49.690
So I didn't find that
too demanding.

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:54.400
The MMA stuff, the UFC fighting
stuff was really

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.630
physically demanding.

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:56.730
Especially the jujitsu.

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.340
But the boxing and the Muay
Thai, the kickboxing, was

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.190
really demanding.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:02.290
But the MMA stuff.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:04.310
I think about going to take
some MMA classes to get in

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:05.710
better shape.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.520
It's an amazing workout.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.770
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.060
JOEL STEIN: Anyone else have
workout questions?

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:15.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah, me, for sure.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.130
JOEL STEIN: OK.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.730
No, you look great.

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:17.810
AUDIENCE: I have
two questions.

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:18.460
JOEL STEIN: Sure.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.416
AUDIENCE: The first is it was
really interesting when you

00:27:20.416 --> 00:27:22.410
were talking about your
experience in the Army at

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:25.140
night and how they play the call
to prayer, which I didn't

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:25.720
know about.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.730
So why do they do that?

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.700
AUDIENCE: Oh, America
hates Muslims.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.640
And we express it
wherever we can.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.920
I don't know if you've
noticed this.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.070
Why did they play the--

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.970
over and over again, they try
and replicate the current

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:43.420
battles that were going on.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.460
So they have a whole
fake village.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:50.320
Both the Marines and the
Army have fake--

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.110
back then, fake Iraqi villages,
where they hired

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:58.480
like local Arabs to
play the bad guys.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.150
So yeah.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:03.510
The thing about the army that
I didn't like was you're

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.200
constantly reminded that the
job is killing people.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.270
And for me, that's
a deal breaker.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.370
Like if I had gotten to "Time"
and they said, you get to

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:12.670
write about yourself.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:15.590
You have an expense account.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:19.600
We're going to pay you well, but
you got to kill people, I

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.070
wouldn't have taken the job.

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:24.205
So for me, it was a constant
reminder that

00:28:24.205 --> 00:28:26.330
we're killing people.

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.485
I didn't feel like they were
racist or homophobic at all.

00:28:29.485 --> 00:28:32.260
In fact, I thought they were
very careful about it.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.050
But they were clear about
who the enemy was.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:38.750
And that involves the call
to prayers, which is--

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.730
I was surprised about, which
is why I mention and why I

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:41.980
wrote about it.

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:47.602
You should be warned.

00:28:47.602 --> 00:28:48.670
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:49.710
JOEL STEIN: No problem.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:52.220
AUDIENCE: And my second question
was, what if your son

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.240
is like you and he
likes show tunes?

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.205
JOEL STEIN: Well, my son does
like show tunes because I play

00:28:57.205 --> 00:28:58.320
them all the time.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.320
And he already can sing "Singing
in the Rain," and

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.080
he's three.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:06.540
So about halfway through the
book, I went from thinking, oh

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.820
my god, what if my son wants
to do this stuff?

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.860
I better know how.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:10.410
Because he does.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:11.880
Already, I can tell he
wants to go camping.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.960
So now I can at least set up a
tent, take him camping, and

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.780
not be afraid.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.430
But I also starting halfway
through, oh my god, I don't

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:20.690
want to raise another me.

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.470
I don't want a kid who's
afraid of everything.

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:24.050
I don't need him to like
all this stuff.

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:27.950
But I want him to at least
experience it so he knows that

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:31.190
he has more capabilities than he
thinks, and the world isn't

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:35.430
as bifurcated, or divided.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:36.460
Things aren't as scary
as he thinks.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.150
So I want him to experience
things even if he

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:38.880
doesn't want to.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.670
I know you can't force
a kid to do things.

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:42.440
That's part of what I
learned in the book.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.560
But yes, my son is very
much like me.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.010
He's a total non-confrontational
wimp.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:48.670
He hates sports, or throwing
a ball, or whatever the

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:49.820
equivalent is now.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.540
But he loves cars and trucks.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.460
So every kid's totally different
and I've had to

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.890
learn about--

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:56.750
I knew nothing about
cars and trucks.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.160
And now I know as much
as a three-year-old

00:29:59.160 --> 00:29:59.940
about cars and trucks.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.210
So it's a huge improvement.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:03.460
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:05.740
JOEL STEIN: Hi.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:05.940
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:09.750
So your book was about
masculinity.

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:12.550
Did you get any insights
about femininity from--

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:13.840
JOEL STEIN: Oh, I had
lots of insight.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.500
If I have had a girl, this
would have been easy.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.950
Did I get any extra insights
about femininity?

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:19.200
Yeah.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.810
It's the same lesson I've been
learning my whole life, which

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:28.430
is that as much as they say they
don't, women want someone

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:32.090
who has some capabilities
and confidence.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:37.730
And the stuff I do in the book
is stuff that like any woman

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:40.400
can and should do and would get

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.720
accolades for in our society--

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.510
for being able to fix a house,
being able to protect herself.

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:46.640
These aren't particularly
male skills.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:51.090
But as a guy, if you don't
have those skills, you're

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:51.910
harshly judged.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:53.970
Whereas, if you're a women
without those skills, society

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.430
kind of accepts that.

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:57.320
And that's the lesson
I kept learning.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.110
If you don't know how to fix
stuff around your house, as

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:02.290
much as your wife and other
women don't care, they care.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:05.070
And if you can't protect
them and protect

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:05.960
yourself, they care.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.360
And that erodes your confidence
a little bit.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.160
I grew up in the '70s and
listened to "Free to Be You

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:13.490
and Me" over and over again.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:15.650
I was taught that there's no
difference between boys and

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:17.990
girls and that it's a
societal construct.

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:20.330
But gender is not a societal
construct.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.760
Because my son came out like--

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.560
he could barely crawl and he
started pushing around mustard

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.535
on the ground and
making noises.

00:31:27.535 --> 00:31:30.290
And we're like, oh, I guess we
should buy him a toy car.

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:32.130
And that's all he cares
about is cars.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.310
And we were just at our
preschool open house and they

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:37.885
talked about like, you can put
stuff in their cubbie.

00:31:37.885 --> 00:31:40.190
But there was something like,
don't bring Chapstick because

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.820
all the girls wind up just
using the Chapstick and

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:43.940
fighting over it.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.790
And I was like, why do they
come out so differently?

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:48.950
You must know the
answer, right?

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:51.420
Isn't there some Google brain
scan that's being done on--

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:52.140
yeah, I'm sure.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.310
Well, share that with
us at some point.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:55.900
AUDIENCE: It is Google
Brain Scan, in fact.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:56.720
JOEL STEIN: Google Brain Scan?

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.810
OK.

00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:00.420
How far do I have to scroll down
the menu to get to that?

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.730
Because there's 8,000 things,
like streamline.

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:05.950
Isn't that the whole point,
it's just a bar?

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:06.920
It's like, oh, we do that.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:07.880
We have cars that drive
themselves.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.190
You just have to go
to the fifth page.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:12.900
You just have the pass
Google+ eight

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:14.150
times to get to anything.

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:18.980
I have, by the way, 112 friends,
which I think is the

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.922
record on Google+.

00:32:20.922 --> 00:32:22.770
So you should friend
me immediately.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.060
AUDIENCE: From your insights and
experience with this, what

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.580
does it mean to be a man?

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:35.280
JOEL STEIN: Surfing is important
to being a man.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.580
Smoking marijuana
is important.

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:42.640
Owning a van, having
a dog named Scooby.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.600
Have I nailed any of
your life so far?

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.710
What does it mean to be a man?

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:53.410
The thing I learned the most
was having not just

00:32:53.410 --> 00:33:02.220
self-confidence, but having
some abilities.

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:05.710
I feel like I'm this close
to saying the--

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:07.560
who's the guy who keeps
talking about skills?

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.230
The indie movie with
the kid from Utah?

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:11.160
Yeah, Napoleon Dynamite.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.830
I feel like I was this close
to being Napoleon Dynamite,

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:13.930
talking about needing
skills, and

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:15.180
fighting ligers, and stuff.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:19.900
But no, I think self-confidence
and

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:24.400
capabilities is very masculine
and very attractive.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.660
I'd like to see you
work on that.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:32.780
Also, computer science,
programming, very manly.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:33.190
Engineering.

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:34.440
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:41.750
AUDIENCE: How did you find out
you wanted to be a comedy or

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:42.570
humor writer?

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:44.740
And what was it like in the
early years of your career?

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.270
JOEL STEIN: I don't play
an instrument.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:53.830
I'm not good at sports.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:58.420
There were very few options
for me to get attention.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.700
And I think I developed
a sense of humor.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.200
First of all, I'm Jewish.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:06.810
And so that's kind of the
mode of communication.

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:09.840
And my parents think they're
funny and don't use YouTube,

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.090
so I can say that.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:16.080
And I just was impressed
by the--

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.810
there was a punkishness to
comedy that really appealed to

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:21.510
me, because it wasn't the angry

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:23.469
punkishness of punk rock.

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:30.330
But it was kind of an inside,
self-aware kind of flipping

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:30.720
off the man.

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.010
And that really appealed
to me.

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:33.840
So I was obsessed
about Letterman.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.010
I subscribed to "Spy"
magazine.

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:38.429
Letterman read one of my
questions on air when I was in

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:40.420
high school, which
is the highlight

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:43.110
of my writing career.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:45.080
I tried like seven times till
I figured out how to get a

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.969
letter on Letterman.

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:49.590
So I didn't really think
of it as a career.

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:51.969
I thought I'd be a lawyer
because that's all I could

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:54.594
think of what people who
don't have skills do.

00:34:54.594 --> 00:34:56.820
And so I wrote for my
high school paper.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:57.600
I wrote a column.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.960
I wrote a column for my college
paper that was far

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.670
more popular than my
column is now.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:04.700
And I interned at "Newsweek"
because some professor at

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.920
Stanford who read my stuff in
the school paper got me an

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.130
internship there.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:11.210
And then it started to
look more feasible.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:14.390
I gave myself two years before
law school out of college.

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:18.080
And when those two years ended
and I still fact checking and

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.830
not writing, I decided to give
myself another two years.

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:24.250
And I was going to move to LA
and try sitcom writing.

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:25.160
That was my next two years.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.480
I'm sure I would have found
out another two

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.900
years until I died.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.410
And eventually, becoming some
kind of a sonnet writer.

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:32.970
But instead, this new
magazine, "Time

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:34.380
Out New York," started.

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:37.350
And a guy I knew from working
at Martha Stewart got a job

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:41.770
there and got me an interview.

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:43.160
It was only two years.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.220
And to struggle for two years in
today's economy, or even in

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.390
the early '90s is amazing.

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:48.590
But if you don't know
it's two years, it

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:50.990
seems kind of endless.

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.570
It was hard.

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.560
It was hard-- and I started
not as a humor writer.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.470
I started as a journalist.

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:58.080
And I tried to keep getting
people to run my column.

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.180
And I got "Time Out"
to run it.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:01.590
And then when I got to "Time,"
I kept running

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:03.000
the "Time Out" column.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.810
And then eventually, the editor
of "Time--" I thought

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:07.320
the world was much
smaller than--

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.500
even before the internet, it was
even easier to believe the

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.570
world was tiny.

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.510
So I believed that the old
people who worked at "Time"

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:15.370
would never see my column at
"Time Out New York," which was

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:16.290
incredibly stupid.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:17.740
And of course, they did.

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:19.470
And I didn't get in trouble.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:22.910
And instead Walter Isaacson, who
was my boss offered to run

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:23.810
my column in "Time."

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:27.760
And I just remember like, one
of those moments where your

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.230
adrenaline gets going and you
see the world kind of like

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:31.730
sharpens and shrinks.

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:34.120
And I remember just like,
this is crazy.

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.870
So I've basically been writing
a column since 1997 for

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:42.500
"Time." People think I would get
bored of it, but instead

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:43.480
the readers get bored.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:47.190
But I keep having to find new
readers who don't get bored.

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:50.200
So I still really like it.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.352
I don't think I answered any of
your questions, but I got

00:36:51.352 --> 00:36:53.260
to talk about me.

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:56.430
I had a good time.

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:58.570
AUDIENCE: Through all the
manventures you've gone on,

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:03.220
have any of them kind
of stuck as hobbies?

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.520
JOEL STEIN: Hobbies, no.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.550
And all men have hobbies, but
I don't have any hobbies.

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:10.750
I remember sitting down at the
cafeteria at Fort Knox, which

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.280
is where "Stripes" was
shot and I did my

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:16.820
fainting with the Army.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.580
What I also learned from writing
this book is that I

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.270
can now talk to guys
in the military.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:21.770
If I see a guy at
the airport--

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:23.890
if i saw a guy in uniform
at the airport, I never

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:24.810
knew what to do.

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:27.900
I didn't know like,
do you thank him?

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.950
Or that just annoys them?

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:31.790
Or do you like, offer them your
seat or is that treating

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:33.060
them like an old person?

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.480
I never knew how to deal.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.480
And now I just talk to them
about where they did boot

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.080
camp, and talk about
boot camp stuff.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.330
The Army let me fire a tank.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:44.220
So I'm the first civilian to
ever fire a tank and the last

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.770
civilian who will ever
fire a tank.

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:47.495
So I can talk to the,
about tanks now.

00:37:53.217 --> 00:37:55.460
What was your question again?

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:58.200
I'm so excited to talk
about myself.

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.460
AUDIENCE: Just if you're still
doing any of these things.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:00.810
JOEL STEIN: Oh, right.

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:02.700
So I fix some stuff around
my house, but I

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.290
don't have a hobby.

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:06.440
These guys asked me if I had
hobby, because they just

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.590
wanted to connect.

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:10.430
The amazing thing about, no
matter how different are from

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:13.870
other people, if you find like
one tiny thing about their

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:15.980
life that you're interested in,
people are happy to talk

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.240
to you no matter how
different you are.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.240
So the guy just wanted
to bond with me.

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.770
He was like, do you
have any hobbies?

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:21.840
I was like, I don't.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.190
He's like, of course
you have a hobby.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:28.140
He's like I race cars and fix
jet skis, or whatever he did.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.090
And he had like 10 of them.

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.970
And I was like, how do
people have hobbies?

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:38.130
I'm either writing, cooking
dinner, or watching my kid.

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:39.650
Or looking at internet porn.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:40.670
Is that a hobby?

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:42.280
And he said, no, that
wasn't a hobby.

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.980
So I'm out.

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.530
I fix stuff around my house.

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:47.920
And when I say that, I mean like
once every two months I

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.400
fix something--

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.860
a small thing.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.455
So that kind of stuck.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.340
My interest in cars stuck, but
that's only because my son.

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.090
I've learned a lot more about
cars, gotten more

00:38:59.090 --> 00:38:59.650
interested in them.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:02.360
But no, not a lot of it stuck.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:04.360
And I don't know why I
don't have hobbies.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.155
I don't know.

00:39:06.155 --> 00:39:09.450
It just sounds so hard to have
a whole hobby, stuff you do.

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.430
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.800
AUDIENCE: So I was wondering
what other kinds of less

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.250
obvious manly things you might
have looked into, such as--

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:24.570
obvious things are like doing
the Army training, and riding

00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:26.080
a bull, and whatever.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.180
But some of the less obvious
things, like maybe the leader

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:33.340
of a boat crew that goes crab
fishing in Alaska, or doing

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.780
something like raising money
and building a startup

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.970
company, or something
like that.

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:39.590
Obviously, something near
and dear to us.

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:41.420
I'm curious about those
experience.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:42.540
JOEL STEIN: Yeah.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.680
So I sold this as a movie
and I was supposed to

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.760
write it and I haven't.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.040
So I'm now writing it
for another guy.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:50.410
And we were sitting around
yesterday making a list of

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:53.610
things that I considered that
we might put in the movie.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:57.090
I considered Alaskan king crab
fishing, which is super manly.

00:39:57.090 --> 00:40:00.060
In the end I decided I simply
wanted to have the skills of

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:04.700
your average American male,
which I defined pretty--

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:08.980
I think in America we define
masculinity by this very

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:14.030
Scotch-Irish, Sir Walter
Raleigh, South of the

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:17.410
Mason-Dixon line, Hatfields
and McCoys, kind of very

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:20.190
specific masculinity.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:23.490
I was trying to do what an
average American does that

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:24.440
fits into that.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.440
I also did the day trading
thing, which is a very

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.360
different Northeastern.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:32.520
I was thinking about doing a
British, stiff upper lip,

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.670
drinking tea while the bombs are
falling kind of manliness.

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:36.960
Didn't really accomplish that.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:40.730
So I really stuck to that
Southern American masculinity.

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:42.860
And all the things I considered
along the lines

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:46.800
that you're talking about,
seemed very extreme and

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.520
different than like--

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.010
I spent a day with the
firefighters in the book,

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:52.610
which seemed within the realm of
what an average dude might

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:53.780
be able to do.

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:57.910
Whereas like heli-logging, I
thought about having a coyote

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:00.140
let me cross the border
from Mexico.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.250
I thought about doing a
couple days in prison.

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:05.190
I thought about joining
a biker gang or going

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:06.090
to Sturgis at least.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:09.120
And I thought about
selling crack.

00:41:11.712 --> 00:41:14.650
What else?

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:16.500
There were a couple things I
didn't do just because people

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.780
didn't call me back.

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:21.820
Like the Hell's Angels have
a really bad website.

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.750
I don't know if you
guys can fix that.

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.285
They don't respond to their
user questions.

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:30.930
Some things I got
pretty far with.

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:34.020
Some things I did and cut from
the book, like I actually

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.760
wound up getting all
the stuff about--

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.980
I spent a day at a
hedge fund I cut.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:44.480
I spent three days as a pit crew
in this race that I cut.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.855
I wanted to spend a couple
weeks, just occasionally at

00:41:50.855 --> 00:41:53.920
night with the Elks, or the
Lions, or any of those groups.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.360
Just like old dudes talking
about old stories I thought

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.570
would be something very
masculine about that

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:00.860
part of your life.

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:03.515
It was really an endless amount
of stuff I could do.

00:42:03.515 --> 00:42:05.620
Thought about farming.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:08.120
Thought about being a cowboy.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.310
So yeah, there was really
an endless amount of

00:42:10.310 --> 00:42:11.310
stuff I could do.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:13.870
I wish I had done fewer things
actually, and really focused

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:14.800
more on the depth of it.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:17.752
But I'm a lazy writer.

00:42:17.752 --> 00:42:19.002
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:42:22.229 --> 00:42:23.580
JOEL STEIN: You guys
have no work to do.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.900
AUDIENCE: Of all the different
themes and pieces that you've

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:32.240
researched and written about,
what made you choose this to

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.790
start writing a book?

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:36.390
And then, after this whole
experience, do you think

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:37.640
there's more in the future?

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.810
Are you interested in doing kind
of these more in-depth

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:42.310
pieces, and stories,
and books?

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:44.490
And maybe, I guess,
movies later?

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:45.740
JOEL STEIN: Yeah.

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:50.660
So after I started at "Time."
part of the reason I took that

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:53.730
job was so I could
write a book.

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:55.480
And I had one idea that was
OK that no one wanted

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.340
to buy early on.

00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:59.790
And then, I hadn't really had
an idea I liked enough to

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:02.160
pursue as a book.

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.210
To be totally frank, I'm not
sure this was that idea.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.990
It's just that the book industry
was dying and I felt

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:09.340
like I had to write a book.

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:11.790
And this was something that I
organically was talking about

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:12.400
and feeling.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.190
And eventually my friend Josh
was like, you should write a

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:16.340
book where you learn
to be a man.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:18.780
If you're so obsessed with
this, just go do it.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:22.410
So it was an opportunity for me
to do a lot of things that

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:25.640
I wanted to have done, but
wouldn't do unless I had a

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.170
reason because they
all sucked.

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:30.820
So that's kind of how I decided
to write the book.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.710
I don't know if that's
the best way to

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.350
decide to write a book.

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:37.040
If I were to write
another book--

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:37.810
I don't know.

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:39.720
I don't know if I would
do it the same way.

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.560
If I did do it the same way,
I know what I would write

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.440
about, which is--

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.280
I don't know if I can
describe it quickly.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.650
But basically, I probably
won't write this book.

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:49.460
I'll probably have to do a new
genre of book because I think

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.730
the genre of going to do stuff
is getting a little old.

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:52.820
At least for now.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.110
But if I were to go do stuff
again, I'm kind of curious

00:43:55.110 --> 00:44:00.580
about the fact that 98% of the
decisions that we make in life

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:03.520
aren't really our decisions.

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.090
Because it's only practical
to do it this way.

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:08.430
We do what our society and
our friends are doing.

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:11.730
So most of the decisions I've
made about how to live my life

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:14.970
are really demographic and not
the thought-out choices I

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:15.590
would think.

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:19.640
So I wanted to go explore both
historically and in present

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.910
time in different cultures how
people live their lives, and

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:25.370
go do that for a while.

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:27.040
As simple as living in
a foreign country

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.760
for a couple months.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:32.810
Or having my family, my parents
and my wife's parents,

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:35.800
live with us for a few months
as people do in most of the

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:36.980
world, always have done.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:38.480
Just kind of exploring--

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.460
getting super religious for a
little while, just exploring

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.040
different ways to live
and seeing--

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.910
kind of making more thoughtful
choices.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:46.015
I realize that didn't
sound funny, but

00:44:46.015 --> 00:44:48.580
it'd be really funny.

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:51.278
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:51.278 --> 00:44:52.190
MALE SPEAKER: I think that it's
unless somebody has a

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:53.102
burning, burning question.

00:44:53.102 --> 00:44:54.930
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:55.430
JOEL STEIN: Thanks
for having me.

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.730
This was fun.

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:59.062
[APPLAUSE]
