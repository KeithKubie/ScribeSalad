Hey guys, I'm Nate.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.260
Welcome back to the workshop,
where today we're going to be making

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.620
a small desktop catapult
that fits inside this tin of mints.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.620

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.500
[Music]

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.279
For this build, we're going to need our
tin of mints, Altoids or something similar,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.440
a small binder clip, a plastic
spoon, and some thin cardboard,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.440
maybe a playing card
that you have lying around

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.220
or I'll be getting mine
from this empty cereal box.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.700
We'll need a pair of
scissors to cut things,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.200
and some hot glue and tape
to attach stuff together.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.620
There's plenty of options for
what you can use as ammunition,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.309
but since our tin of mints comes
full of mints that are the right size,

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.660
we'll try using that as ammo.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.720
To get started, let's empty all of
the mints out of our tin and into a cup.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.400
We won't need this piece of paper.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.600
Just throw that out.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.980
Now, let's just clean out our tin a little bit,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.200
so it's not so full of mint dust.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.380
We are going to be
gluing onto this surface,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.600
so we really want to make sure it's
clean enough that the glue will stick.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.580
Our binder clip is
going to be the mechanism

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.580
that gives our catapult some extra spring.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.360
So that's going to fit inside our box.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.719
And then our spoon
will be the little basket

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.180
at the back of our catapult
that holds our ammunition.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.120
Let's take our plastic spoon,
measure how long we want it to be,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.500
and then cut it off
so it fits within our tin.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.240
Now, what we need to do
is attach our plastic spoon

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.450
onto one side of the binder clip.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.620
We'll use our strong tape for that.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.880
There we go.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.400
Attach the tape to the spoon.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.020
You can flip this away from the binder clip

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.300
so we can easily wrap it all the way around 
the spoon and the handle of the clip.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.580
Alright. I think we're
getting a pretty good idea of how

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.340
this catapult mechanism is going to work.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.740
If I hold down the back of the binder clip,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.760
we can see that by
pushing down on the spoon,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.020
it stretches the binder clip open,
and that's giving us a lot of spring power.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.140
Now using whatever
our source of cardboard is,

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.920
we want to cut out a piece that's
the same width as the inside of our tin.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.980
Let's trace around our tin and
then cut a little bit smaller than that,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.299
so the cardboard is the size of the inside,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.560
rather than the outside.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.120
We don't even need the entire bottom.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.160
We only need about half of it,
so I think right about there should be fine.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.960
There we go.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.020
Our piece of cardboard now fits pretty
perfectly inside the bottom of our tin.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.380
We now want to divide our cardboard into
2 pieces based on the size of this binder clip.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.680
With the cardboard in the tin,
and the binder clip on top of it,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.640
pressed all the way up against the tin,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.000
our dividing line should be right
near the back of the binder clip.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.580
The smaller piece of cardboard
will fit inside of our binder clip.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.380
And the larger piece will
go over the second silver handle,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.100
and overlap onto the tin.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.800
Let's use some of our hot glue
to attach this first piece of cardboard

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.500
to the inside of the binder clip.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.420
Now, a little bit more hot
glue on top of the second handle,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.040
and then we'll put this piece
of cardboard down on top of that.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.580
We should be able to fit our whole 
mechanism down inside of our Altoid tin,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.380
and we can start to
see how this is going to work.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.540
We'll use some more hot glue to attach
all of that cardboard down to the tin,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.100
and that should do a good job of
holding our catapulting mechanism in place.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.720
Now at this point,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.990
we can pull back on the spoon,

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.590
and we see the spring
effect starting to take place.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.430
But if we look at the front,
it looks like our cardboard is

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.900
just peeling up despite the hot glue.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.380
So let's try reinforcing that by adding more 
glue around the edge of our cardboard,

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.230
but on top of the cardboard.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.480
Now you can see that we've
filled the corners all the way up,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.860
so there's glue on top of the cardboard,

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.200
and hopefully, that will give it
a secure enough hold against the tin,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.240
that it should give us some
resistance as we pull back on the spoon.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.880
With our glue cooled
and holding everything down,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.480
we should be ready to
start firing off some Altoids.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.460
Let's go for a smaller shot.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.420
There we go.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.380
Little less power, it
actually shot up quite a bit more.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.320
I'll take it.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.980
I hit the monitor on the camera.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.720
That's pretty good.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.100
Now this works alright, but I think there
are some improvements that we can add to it.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.220
Because of the high resistance
level in one of these binder clips,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.690
I don't think it's actually possible 
to fold this down

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.250
far enough that we can
really close the whole tin.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.240
And if we do, then it can
just pop right open again.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.460
So let's see if we can't modify this
to have a little bit less resistance,

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.400
so that we can conceal
the whole thing inside our tin.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.880
For this upgraded version
of the mint tin catapult,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.190
we've got another tin,
we have another spoon,

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.120
we'll be using an
even smaller binder clip,

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.040
and we'll also use a paperclip,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.060
and a piece of a paint stick.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.720
We also have another piece of the
same cardboard cut from our cereal box.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.140
We'll start the same way
by measuring our spoon and

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.440
cutting it short enough that it should
be able to fit entirely inside our tin.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.180
We'll attach our
spoon to our binder clip,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.800
much the same way we did before.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.360
We can see the same extending action
on our binder clip that we had before.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.500
Let's cut out our cardboard
the same way before as well.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.200
That seemed to fit.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.360
This step is also the same.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.280
We fit our mechanism inside
onto the piece of cardboard,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.700
and we mark where the dividing line is.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.160
Of course, this is a smaller binder clip,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.400
so the small portion
in front is even narrower.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.180
Now here's where we're
gonna start changing things

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.440
that aren't just the size of the binder clip.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.160
Even with the smaller binder clip
that doesn't have as much strength,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.460
we would have a hard time getting
this to stay down inside our tin.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.760
There's a lot of pressure
one of these clips.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.520
So what we want to do
is figure something out,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.220
that we can put in the
jaws of our binder clip

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.180
that will hold it open so that it's not
just being held down by the lid of our tin.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.520
That's the reason we have our paint stick,

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.660
if we fit this paint stick,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.400
and maybe something else a little bit wider 
down inside the jaws of this binder clip,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.240
it's held open which makes it
lay flatter against the table.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.530
We can see that just by itself,
it's still sticking up quite a bit.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.920
But if we can get it
to open a little bit more,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.340
it will stay in a position that
should be able to let our tin close.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.200
Let's cut off a piece
approximately the size of our binder clip.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.540
Our goal is to have our binder clip
attached to the tin slightly off center,

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.460
so that we have space to fit
the piece of the paint stick

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.900
in between the jaws when we want to
switch from firing to storing our catapult.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.460
To make it easier to move the piece
of paint stick in and out of the binder clip,

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.760
let's take a small paper clip,
and bend that into an L shape attached

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.620
to our piece of painter stick.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.020
That should give us a little handle
we can hold on to to put it in place

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.100
when we're ready to use it.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.240
Like before, we'll have our small piece
of cardboard in the jaws of the binder clip,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.820
and when you combine that with the
piece of paint stick and the paper clip,

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.880
hopefully will give us
enough pressure holding it open,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.080
that we can close the lid down on top of it.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.920
Our spoon is still
sticking up just a little bit,

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.760
but it doesn't have a
lot of spring power to it.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.400
I'm betting that'll be
enough to hold it closed.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.560
We are going to need enough
space that we can fit our little wedge

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.560
in and out from inside 
the binder clip's jaws.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.120
So we're gonna want to
offset our binder clip

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.080
so it's easily out of the way.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.840
That seems like a pretty good spot to me,

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.880
so that's where we'll attach
our cardboard to the binder clip.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.500
And I'll attach this piece of cardboard
to the back handle of our binder clip,

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.360
the same way we did on the first one.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.800
Let's apply hot glue all
over the bottom of this cardboard,

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.440
glue it down in place into the tin,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.020
and then of course,

00:07:55.020 --> 00:08:00.180
we'll use the same reinforcing technique
of adding hot glue along this corner edge.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.020
While we're waiting for that
glue to cool down a little bit,

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.020
let's work on making a
target for these launchers.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.940
I've got this piece of gray foam
core and these nine plastic cups,

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.300
let's try and make a bit of a
grid that we can put these cups into.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.180
We'll trace out circles,
cut holes into the foam core,

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.840
and then sink the cups
down into the foam core,

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.100
and make sort of a target grid where we
can assign different points to different cups.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.740
Beautiful.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.600
A multicolored target board.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.760
[inaudible] we're great.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.500
Alright, we can pull back on our catapult,

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.520
it has a good amount of spring,
it's not pulling up the cardboard,

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.880
let's see if we can fit our little
barrier block in the jaws of our binder clip.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.680
Yeah, holds it open pretty well.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.620
We can still see the spoon is
a little bit above the top of the tin,

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.339
but there's not that much resistance on it.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.960
So let's see if this will stay closed.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.660
It does.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.360
Beautiful.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.640
Our tin holds itself closed,

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.260
we can open it up,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:38.860
and we can remove our little support block,

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.860
whatever we want to call that.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.129
And we have our fully functional catapult.

00:09:42.129 --> 00:09:43.240
Let's get some mints out.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.040
Try this bad boy.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.420
Nice.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.200
That just flew about 25 feet.

00:09:53.209 --> 00:09:57.209
Alright, let's see if we can shoot some
of our mints from our catapult into our target.

00:09:57.209 --> 00:09:59.059
I bet we can do with both catapults.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.360
Alright, let's try our first catapult first,

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.200
see if we can get this to go in.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.100
I don't know how little
power I'm gonna need.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:09.960
Let's try this.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.120
Nope.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.240
That was too little.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.500
That was way too much.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.020
Back-up plan.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.140
Still nothing. I shot like six at once.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.300
Alright, I'm gonna see if I
can lay this down a little flatter.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.880
We can get steep or shallow.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:40.000
Let's try a shallow angle.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.580
Rolled down in between them all.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.120
Yes.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:46.880
Haha!

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.620
It went in.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.360
I got one.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.060
I got one.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.160
Finally.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.520
That's like 55 shots.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.400
And one of them went in because
that's how good I am at aiming.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.220
That went in again.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.060
Alright, that's like 3 out of 70,

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.500
which is not a good ratio.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.880
But let's try the other catapult.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.320
See if I can do any better.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.640
This one does have a little more give to it,

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.440
so I feel like it should be
easier to adjust to the right range.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.000
Ha!

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.700
See, it only took like
six or seven tries with this one,

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.320
instead of like 50 with the other one.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.120
Way better.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.800
These catapults are designed for power.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.720
Look at this thing.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.900
I was trying to overshoot it,

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.300
and I overshot it.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.480
And it hit the light,
and fell down into the cup.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:44.300
When we're finished using our catapult,

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.580
we can just put the block in
place in between the binder clip jaws.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.200
Add some ammunition for later,

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.680
and close the whole thing up.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:58.080
It's nicely self-contained
and if we want a mint, well,

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.440
we can also just have a mint.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.360
Hey guys. Thanks for watching.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.999
If you aren't a subscriber yet,
just hit the bomb to get in the club.

you're supposed to watch next.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.000
That's it for now.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.920
Have fun. Be safe.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.740
And see you tomorrow.
