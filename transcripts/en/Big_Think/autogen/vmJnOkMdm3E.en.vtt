years which is which is trivial compared
 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.939

to how big our budget really is the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
to how big our budget really is the
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.550
to how big our budget really is the
United States military budget is roughly

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560
United States military budget is roughly
 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.000
United States military budget is roughly
the size of all other nations military

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
the size of all other nations military
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.230
the size of all other nations military
budgets combined if we cut our military

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
budgets combined if we cut our military
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.670
budgets combined if we cut our military
in half just in terms of the annual

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680
in half just in terms of the annual
 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.730
in half just in terms of the annual
defense budget it would still be much

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740
defense budget it would still be much
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.980
defense budget it would still be much
bigger than China's and Russia's

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990
bigger than China's and Russia's
 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.539
bigger than China's and Russia's
combined I think I'd like to also see us

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
combined I think I'd like to also see us
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.429
combined I think I'd like to also see us
take the lead in getting rid of our

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439
take the lead in getting rid of our
 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.260
take the lead in getting rid of our
nuclear arsenal there is absolutely no

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
nuclear arsenal there is absolutely no
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.109
nuclear arsenal there is absolutely no
use for nuclear weapons anymore and it's

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119
use for nuclear weapons anymore and it's
 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.969
use for nuclear weapons anymore and it's
very difficult for us to make the case

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
very difficult for us to make the case
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.100
very difficult for us to make the case
to a country like Iran no you're not

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
to a country like Iran no you're not
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.749
to a country like Iran no you're not
allowed to have nuclear weapons well we

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
allowed to have nuclear weapons well we
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.050
allowed to have nuclear weapons well we
still have about 8,000 nuclear warheads

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
still have about 8,000 nuclear warheads
 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.690
still have about 8,000 nuclear warheads
in our own arsenal I think it's hard for

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700
in our own arsenal I think it's hard for
 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.020
in our own arsenal I think it's hard for
us to tell other people that they should

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030
us to tell other people that they should
 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.810
us to tell other people that they should
respect the rule of law when we are

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
respect the rule of law when we are
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.190
respect the rule of law when we are
carrying out these illegal

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
carrying out these illegal
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.969
carrying out these illegal
assassinations in other places and are

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
assassinations in other places and are
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.030
assassinations in other places and are
answerable only to ourselves I think

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040
answerable only to ourselves I think
 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.450
answerable only to ourselves I think
that our militarism helps to perpetuate

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
that our militarism helps to perpetuate
 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.589
that our militarism helps to perpetuate
the kind of fear and insecurity around

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599
the kind of fear and insecurity around
 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.070
the kind of fear and insecurity around
the world that unfortunately will make

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
the world that unfortunately will make
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.060
the world that unfortunately will make
conflict more likely I think our hope of

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070
conflict more likely I think our hope of
 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.560
conflict more likely I think our hope of
course is that other people are too

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570
course is that other people are too
 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.020
course is that other people are too
scared ever to engage in any sort of

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030
scared ever to engage in any sort of
 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.300
scared ever to engage in any sort of
violence or we will retaliate I don't

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310
violence or we will retaliate I don't
 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.980
violence or we will retaliate I don't
think it's going to work out work that

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990
think it's going to work out work that
 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.850
think it's going to work out work that
way so I see this period as an enormous

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860
way so I see this period as an enormous
 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.370
way so I see this period as an enormous
opportunity for our country for the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380
opportunity for our country for the
 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.250
opportunity for our country for the
United States to show show some real

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260
United States to show show some real
 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.740
United States to show show some real
leadership because we are so powerful

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750
leadership because we are so powerful
 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.520
leadership because we are so powerful
and and we of course like to think of

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530
and and we of course like to think of
 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.790
and and we of course like to think of
ourselves as a peaceful just very moral

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800
ourselves as a peaceful just very moral
 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.130
ourselves as a peaceful just very moral
people and I think we have a right to

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140
people and I think we have a right to
 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.640
people and I think we have a right to
feel that about ourselves so I'm hoping

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650
feel that about ourselves so I'm hoping
 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.130
feel that about ourselves so I'm hoping
that we have the kind of leadership some

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140
that we have the kind of leadership some
 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.720
that we have the kind of leadership some
day maybe even Barack Obama in his

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730
day maybe even Barack Obama in his
 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.140
day maybe even Barack Obama in his
second term that will will seize this

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150
second term that will will seize this
 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.550
second term that will will seize this
opportunity and help convince Americans

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560
opportunity and help convince Americans
 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.790
opportunity and help convince Americans
and the rest of the world that now is a

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800
and the rest of the world that now is a
 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.160
and the rest of the world that now is a
time when we can really move past this

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170
time when we can really move past this
 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.790
time when we can really move past this
this period of militarism and war and

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800
this period of militarism and war and
 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.990
this period of militarism and war and
take those resources and use them to

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000
take those resources and use them to
 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.400
take those resources and use them to
solve some of the other problems that

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410
solve some of the other problems that
 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.730
solve some of the other problems that
often lead to conflict
