further back what would it mean to go

theory is the wrong place to begin for

two reasons the first is there's no

reason to suppose that starting from

we will change the subject or distort

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120
we will change the subject or distort
 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.240
we will change the subject or distort
the subject and it's not obvious why

engaged or distorted reflections of this
sort now of course the proponents of

sort now of course the proponents of
 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.000
sort now of course the proponents of
theory have a quick answer to this

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010
theory have a quick answer to this
 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.490

objection they say that their theory

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500
objection they say that their theory

embodies the truth about ethics

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830

therefore to the extent that ordinary

human rights thinking is sound it must
 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.509
human rights thinking is sound it must
be congruent with the theory but the

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519
be congruent with the theory but the
 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.060
be congruent with the theory but the
problem is that it's very doubtful that

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070
problem is that it's very doubtful that
 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.910
problem is that it's very doubtful that
any existing theory captures the truth

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920
any existing theory captures the truth
 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.610
any existing theory captures the truth
about ethics and that's not because

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620
about ethics and that's not because
 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.100
about ethics and that's not because
there is no such thing as s it ethical

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110

depending on how you specify the right

depending on how you specify the right

depending on how you specify the right
for example the right of people not to

for example the right of people not to

be tortured simply for fun is obviously
 

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:50.830
be tortured simply for fun is obviously
an absolute one but of course it gets

an absolute one but of course it gets

an absolute one but of course it gets
far more complicated if we don't

the issue of absolute rights is complex
is the need to draw a distinction

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:01.610
is the need to draw a distinction
 

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.880
is the need to draw a distinction
between human rights as a matter of

the moral right not to be tortured could

a further question whether the law

a further question whether the law
 

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:20.860
a further question whether the law
should reflect this possibility for

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:20.870
should reflect this possibility for
 

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:22.780
should reflect this possibility for
example if the law retd the right not to

example if the law retd the right not to
 

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:25.030
example if the law retd the right not to
be tortured is not absolute this might

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040
be tortured is not absolute this might
 

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.010
be tortured is not absolute this might
have the unintended effect of actually

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:27.020
have the unintended effect of actually
 

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.350
have the unintended effect of actually
encouraging torture in cases where it

encouraging torture in cases where it
 

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.990
encouraging torture in cases where it
isn't justified and that illustrates the

to make is that there is a tendency to

to make is that there is a tendency to

but the interest in Liberty is not the

to which the interest generates a duty

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480
that something I hinted at earlier that
 

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.150
that something I hinted at earlier that
there's a difference between how we deal

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160
there's a difference between how we deal
 

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.799
there's a difference between how we deal
with this in law with from how we deal

00:50:49.799 --> 00:50:49.809
with this in law with from how we deal
 

00:50:49.809 --> 00:50:53.940
with this in law with from how we deal
with this in morality I have I'm ashamed

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:53.950
with this in morality I have I'm ashamed
 

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:55.920
with this in morality I have I'm ashamed
to say I do convince myself that there

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:55.930
to say I do convince myself that there
 

00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:58.829
to say I do convince myself that there
are situations where I could imagine as

00:50:58.829 --> 00:50:58.839
are situations where I could imagine as

are situations where I could imagine as
a moral fort experiment that there could

00:51:02.009 --> 00:51:02.019
a moral fort experiment that there could
 

00:51:02.019 --> 00:51:05.700
a moral fort experiment that there could
be a sufficient case for torturing

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:05.710
be a sufficient case for torturing
 

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:07.230
be a sufficient case for torturing
someone in order to bring about a

certain results they've saved the life
 

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:10.319
certain results they've saved the life
of a child by twisting the arm of the

00:51:10.319 --> 00:51:10.329
of a child by twisting the arm of the
 

00:51:10.329 --> 00:51:11.910
of a child by twisting the arm of the
person who knows where the child is and

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920
person who knows where the child is and
 

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.559
person who knows where the child is and
will die at any moment

00:51:13.559 --> 00:51:13.569
will die at any moment
 

00:51:13.569 --> 00:51:15.269
will die at any moment
and this you in

00:51:15.269 --> 00:51:15.279
and this you in
 

00:51:15.279 --> 00:51:17.459
and this you in
like this form of torture on them so it

00:51:17.459 --> 00:51:17.469
like this form of torture on them so it
 

00:51:17.469 --> 00:51:19.289
like this form of torture on them so it
seems to me that you can conjure up

00:51:19.289 --> 00:51:19.299
seems to me that you can conjure up
 

00:51:19.299 --> 00:51:20.969
seems to me that you can conjure up
scenarios where morally it's the case

00:51:20.969 --> 00:51:20.979
scenarios where morally it's the case
 

00:51:20.979 --> 00:51:25.529
scenarios where morally it's the case
that you would be justified inviolate

00:51:25.529 --> 00:51:25.539
that you would be justified inviolate
 

00:51:25.539 --> 00:51:26.880
that you would be justified inviolate
you'd still be violating the right and

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:26.890
you'd still be violating the right and
 

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:28.799
you'd still be violating the right and
doing the wrong but that violation would

00:51:28.799 --> 00:51:28.809
doing the wrong but that violation would
 

00:51:28.809 --> 00:51:31.140
doing the wrong but that violation would
be justified but I think there's a

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:31.150
be justified but I think there's a
 

00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:33.179
be justified but I think there's a
separate question an entirely separate

00:51:33.179 --> 00:51:33.189
separate question an entirely separate
 

00:51:33.189 --> 00:51:35.549
separate question an entirely separate
question about whether we should have a

00:51:35.549 --> 00:51:35.559
question about whether we should have a
 

00:51:35.559 --> 00:51:38.099
question about whether we should have a
policy of torture that is legally

00:51:38.099 --> 00:51:38.109
policy of torture that is legally
 

00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:40.169
policy of torture that is legally
accepted and whether we should train

00:51:40.169 --> 00:51:40.179
accepted and whether we should train
 

00:51:40.179 --> 00:51:42.419
accepted and whether we should train
people to be torturous and have this as

people to be torturous and have this as
 

00:51:42.429 --> 00:51:44.789
people to be torturous and have this as
an official policy of the state I think

00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:44.799
an official policy of the state I think
 

00:51:44.799 --> 00:51:46.649
an official policy of the state I think
there are powerful reasons for saying

00:51:46.649 --> 00:51:46.659
there are powerful reasons for saying
 

00:51:46.659 --> 00:51:48.929
there are powerful reasons for saying
that the answer to that must be no so

00:51:48.929 --> 00:51:48.939
that the answer to that must be no so
 

00:51:48.939 --> 00:51:50.699
that the answer to that must be no so

commit torture in cases that you think
are morally justified but now they're

are morally justified but now they're

acting in a way that the law says are
 

00:52:10.029 --> 00:52:12.539
acting in a way that the law says are
not permissible and I think the best way

not permissible and I think the best way
 

00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:14.159
not permissible and I think the best way
to handle this is I think people like

00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:36.510
the case of them slavery and someone
 

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:39.050
the case of them slavery and someone
says I want to be a slave I'm going to

00:56:39.050 --> 00:56:39.060
says I want to be a slave I'm going to
 

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:41.600
says I want to be a slave I'm going to
be paid a lot of money to enter into

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:41.610
be paid a lot of money to enter into
 

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:44.210
be paid a lot of money to enter into
this contract of slavery I choose to be

00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.220
this contract of slavery I choose to be
 

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:45.950
this contract of slavery I choose to be
a slave that money will help my family

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960
a slave that money will help my family
 

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:50.090
a slave that money will help my family
etc so I want the law to uphold and

00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:50.100
etc so I want the law to uphold and
 

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.680
etc so I want the law to uphold and
recognize this contract of slavery that

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:51.690
recognize this contract of slavery that
 

00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:54.170
recognize this contract of slavery that
I'm entering into and uh presumably we

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:54.180
I'm entering into and uh presumably we
 

00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:55.670
I'm entering into and uh presumably we
would say that we're not going to do

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680
would say that we're not going to do
 

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:58.280
would say that we're not going to do
that because the proper understanding of

that because the proper understanding of
 

00:56:58.290 --> 00:57:01.130
that because the proper understanding of
the autonomy we want to protect is one

00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:01.140
the autonomy we want to protect is one
 

00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:05.000
the autonomy we want to protect is one
already influenced by dignity and it's

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:05.010
already influenced by dignity and it's
 

00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:06.339

something that in that way undermines

something that in that way undermines
 

00:57:12.529 --> 00:57:16.479
something that in that way undermines
one your dignity and second also

with some contingent conflict between
these two elements but I'd like to

these two elements but I'd like to
 

00:57:29.839 --> 00:57:32.109
these two elements but I'd like to
forestall that as much as I can by

did they have but as I said I'm

that was behind Universal Declaration of

human rights that have been possessed

makes perfect sense to say human rights

problems with that
the first is he's got a really mistaken

the first is he's got a really mistaken
 

01:08:30.589 --> 01:08:33.880
the first is he's got a really mistaken
view about how we generate rights and

view about how we generate rights and
 

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:35.620
view about how we generate rights and
the mistaken view is he thinks that

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:35.630
the mistaken view is he thinks that

into that disjunction between something

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:50.690
into that disjunction between something
 

01:08:50.690 --> 01:08:51.970
into that disjunction between something
I've got a right to and something that's

so therefore things like the

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040
so therefore things like the

could be things we have rights to even
 

01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:02.770
could be things we have rights to even
though they're also part of the common

though they're also part of the common
 

01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:05.950
though they're also part of the common
good but the second thing is this always

01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:05.960

in philosophy you have to ask the

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520
in philosophy you have to ask the
 

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.160
in philosophy you have to ask the
question what's the alternative to the

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:09.170
question what's the alternative to the
 

01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:10.269
question what's the alternative to the
position that I'm putting

01:09:10.269 --> 01:09:10.279
position that I'm putting
 

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:11.769
position that I'm putting
because every position has got its pros

01:09:11.769 --> 01:09:11.779
because every position has got its pros
 

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:14.200
because every position has got its pros
and cons so he says what international

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:14.210
and cons so he says what international
 

01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:15.729
and cons so he says what international
human rights law is doing is not

01:09:15.729 --> 01:09:15.739
human rights law is doing is not
 

01:09:15.739 --> 01:09:19.599
human rights law is doing is not
securing pre-existing moral rights its

01:09:19.599 --> 01:09:19.609
securing pre-existing moral rights its
 

01:09:19.609 --> 01:09:23.229
securing pre-existing moral rights its
securing to other things a decent

01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:23.239
securing to other things a decent
 

01:09:23.239 --> 01:09:25.240
securing to other things a decent
minimum for people a decent level of

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:25.250
minimum for people a decent level of
 

01:09:25.250 --> 01:09:28.779
minimum for people a decent level of
satisfaction of their interests and some

01:09:28.779 --> 01:09:28.789
satisfaction of their interests and some
 

01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:32.109

basic notion of status equality now

01:09:32.109 --> 01:09:32.119
basic notion of status equality now
 

01:09:32.119 --> 01:09:34.629
basic notion of status equality now
here's the problem what is a decent

01:09:34.629 --> 01:09:34.639
here's the problem what is a decent
 

01:09:34.639 --> 01:09:37.899
here's the problem what is a decent
minimum how do i specify when something

01:09:37.899 --> 01:09:37.909
minimum how do i specify when something
 

01:09:37.909 --> 01:09:39.729
minimum how do i specify when something
is at the decent minimum or above the

01:09:39.729 --> 01:09:39.739
is at the decent minimum or above the
 

01:09:39.739 --> 01:09:42.640
is at the decent minimum or above the
decent middle I think the only answer is

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:42.650
decent middle I think the only answer is
 

01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:45.249
decent middle I think the only answer is
something like what point is a duty

01:09:45.249 --> 01:09:45.259
something like what point is a duty
 

01:09:45.259 --> 01:09:47.680
something like what point is a duty
generated to all human beings to provide

generated to all human beings to provide
 

01:09:47.690 --> 01:09:51.039
generated to all human beings to provide
them with this minimum so therefore his

01:09:51.039 --> 01:09:51.049
them with this minimum so therefore his
 

01:09:51.049 --> 01:09:52.809
them with this minimum so therefore his
alternative is not a replacement to the

01:09:52.809 --> 01:09:52.819
alternative is not a replacement to the
 

01:09:52.819 --> 01:09:54.879
alternative is not a replacement to the
Orthodox view it just is a different way
