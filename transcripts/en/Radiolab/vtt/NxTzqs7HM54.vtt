9
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.060
from [inaudible], w.

10
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.860
N. Y. S. E. N. N. P. E. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab,

11
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.450
the podcast and today on the podcast something a little different. We,

12
00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:51.890
we say that often we do. This is more different than our usual different, yeah.

13
00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:55.610
This is a comes from our friend Carl Zimmer who's been on the show a bunch of

14
00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:58.730
times, helping us untangle some complicated scientific things.

15
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.050
This time we find him not in our normal area in our show.

16
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:07.480
He's in the basement of a bar, which is in Brooklyn, New York to untangles.

17
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.600
Really kind of a very personal question in his mind. I want to give it away.

18
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.530
That's right. Carl told this particular story for a group called story collider,

19
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.860
which has people come on stage to live stories about science.

20
00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:22.220
And the fellow you're going to hear introducing Kraut. This is Ben Lilly,

21
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.970
welcome to the stage. Carl Zimmer. He's the Co founder Co founder story,

22
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.003
correct?

23
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.600
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.080
<v 4>So in 1997,</v>

25
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.850
I woke up in the middle of the night in South Sudan. Uh,

26
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.930
at the time, uh, South Sudan was not its own country.

27
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.640
It is an independent country. Uh, just recently when I was there,

28
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.270
um, it was in the middle of a civil war. Now,

29
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:58.190
South Sudan as a territory is about the size of Texas and I was not near the

30
00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:00.260
front lines. So, uh,

31
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:03.680
it's not as if I had to worry about getting shot by somebody from the other

32
00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:08.210
side. But there were plenty of things to be very worried about. So, for example,

33
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:11.900
if you were walking around outside and there was a plane coming overhead,

34
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:14.900
you never quite knew if it was a plane that came from Khartoum where that had a

35
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:18.740
bomb and was looking for a place to drop it and they like to drop it on places

36
00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:22.820
like hospitals, which is where I was at. Um,

37
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.780
and if the bombs didn't get you, there were lots of other things that could,

38
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.850
little invisible things that could get you, um, see,

39
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:34.550
because South Sudan is at the time,

40
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:37.130
was probably the best place in the world to get sick.

41
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.600
There were so many ways to get sick and so many ways you could still get sick

42
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.480
and South Sudan you actually really couldn't get sick anywhere else in the

43
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:46.760
world. Um, so for example,

44
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:50.210
there were flies buzzing around called cc flyers and they might bite you and

45
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:53.690
they might put a little single celled parasite into you and you would get

46
00:02:53.691 --> 00:02:56.030
sleeping sickness. Uh,

47
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.980
you can't really get sleeping sickness much of any place else. Uh,

48
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.680
and if you didn't get medical attention, you would die.

49
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.610
It's one of those diseases where there's, there's no escape clause.

50
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.660
You will die if you don't get medicine. And in, in that case,

51
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:13.510
the medicine that you would get was basically arsenic.

52
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.170
So neither, uh, alternative is really attractive. Um,

53
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.190
then maybe you would drink some unfiltered water and you might swallow a Guinea

54
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:31.090
worm. So you might swallow some invisible, uh, larvae. Uh, it would, uh,

55
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.710
get into your stomach and say, well, this is where I belong. It would grow.

56
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:39.040
It would burrow out of your, uh, out of your intestinal wall.

57
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:40.900
It would wander around in your abdomen.

58
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:43.510
It might meet up with the Guinea worm of the opposite sex,

59
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.840
and they would mate and the chemo would develop eggs. Yeah.

60
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:51.040
You know where this is going. She gets to be about two feet long.

61
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:54.310
She says it's time to bring forth a new generation of Guinea worms.

62
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.640
What shall I do? I'm going to crawl down this person's leg

63
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.580
and I'm going to create a blister.

64
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.520
I'm going to poke up on skin criticalist blister,

65
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.040
which the only way to relieve it is to splash water on it.

66
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.420
And with every splash of water, the Guinea worm will Serge out eggs.

67
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.020
Then we'll go into another pond and carry on the generation of,

68
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.113
of getting worms.

69
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.480
So you might want to just pull on this thing and get the hell the thing out.

70
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.260
But of course you just pulled part of it and the rest would die.

71
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.660
And you would have about maybe a foot of dead worm in your leg and you would

72
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:30.790
probably have an immune reaction that would kill you.

73
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.150
There were things you could get sick of that had no name. You might survive,

74
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:38.980
you might not. Um,

75
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.000
and of course there were the good old standard ways to get sick. I mean,

76
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.480
there was malaria. You can get malaria in lots of places.

77
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.740
But the people at this medical center, they were, a lot of them were, um,

78
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.360
American doctors who would kind of go from crisis to crisis. Uh,

79
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.950
and, uh, they would talk about the malaria in South Sudan and say, this is,

80
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.630
this is amazing malaria.

81
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.010
It was like the worst Valarie in the world. You know,

82
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.670
this is going military good. Those you don't just get a fever.

83
00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:13.630
And kick kind of Achy and get over it. You go straight to your brain,

84
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.420
you go crazy. And if you don't get a plane,

85
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.860
a whole plane to get you out of there and maybe to Nairobi,

86
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.030
you're going to die.

87
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.160
Now something to bear in mind is that I'm not a doctor.

88
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.700
In fact, at this point I was kind of a hypochondriac

89
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.120
and so the thing is that like, you know, every time I got a fever,

90
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:41.050
I'm sure it was going to be meningitis or if I got a pain in my side,

91
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:44.460
I was sure it was going to turn into a tumor. Uh,

92
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.810
and so there I am, you know,

93
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:51.130
looking up in the moonlight and the mosquito netting above my head and I'm

94
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.720
saying holes in it. I'm thinking, what am I doing here?

95
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.620
This is the kind of trouble that writing about science can get you into

96
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.380
[inaudible]. I started as a copy as a science writer actually as a copy editor.

97
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.650
I got a job at a magazine. It was basically to pay the bills.

98
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.580
I was a copy editor. I wasn't very good at it. I would like commas go through,

99
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.150
which you're not supposed to do as a copy editor,

100
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.700
a as real copy editors will tell you, my boss took pity on me and you know,

101
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.770
let me fact check some things and I got to write a some short pieces just about

102
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:29.210
all sorts of different things, you know,

103
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:33.290
a moon of Saturn or beetle that produced a green glow.

104
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.570
And it was all interesting,

105
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.230
but it didn't feel particularly important to me. Um, you know,

106
00:06:41.231 --> 00:06:44.690
I, I was always writing and I felt like when I grow up,

107
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:45.710
I'm going to be a writer,

108
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:49.670
but I wasn't really sure what I was going to be writing about. Um,

109
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.410
and so I got this job and it,

110
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.690
and it paid the bills and it was fine and eventually I would figure things out.

111
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:59.580
I hoped. Now, uh,

112
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.600
at the time I was dating a woman named Esther and so Esther and I had met in

113
00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:10.961
high school and she was tough and she was funny and she wasn't quite sure what

114
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:14.800
she was going to do with her life when she grew up. Um,

115
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.810
and we managed to continue to date through college.

116
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.650
And then after college she really wanted to do something. And again,

117
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:25.700
she wasn't sure what, so she applied for the Peace Corps and she got in,

118
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.530
uh, and eventually she was assigned to Africa. But the whole process,

119
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:35.531
it takes an incredibly long time to actually even leave the United States.

120
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.820
So by the time she left,

121
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:41.420
I was already working at this job and I was already starting to write about

122
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:45.680
science. So she went to Rwanda.

123
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.030
And like, as it happens with a lot of people, that peace corps, she burned out.

124
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.350
So within a year she was back home, but she had gotten the bug.

125
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.030
She wanted to get back to Africa.

126
00:07:56.031 --> 00:07:58.520
She wanted to be back there in a meaningful way.

127
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.700
And so she thought that a meaningful way to be there would to go as a journalist

128
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:05.960
to be a foreign correspondent.

129
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.410
So she applied to journalism school and she went to Columbia.

130
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.240
So Columbia was hard naturally. Um,

131
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.380
but after a while other things became to be hard.

132
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.400
So for example, waking up in the morning was hard.

133
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.820
And after a while, eating was hard.

134
00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.400
And after a while,

135
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:34.430
walking up the stairs to our apartment was hard and she was asking what's going

136
00:08:35.821 --> 00:08:40.650
on. So she went to her doctor and the doctor said,

137
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:41.783
something's wrong.

138
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:47.330
And eventually it was determined that she had a rare form of cancer that starts

139
00:08:48.181 --> 00:08:49.140
in the pancreas.

140
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.630
Now you don't think about cancer when you're mid twenties. Uh,

141
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.820
you don't think of rare forms, the pancreas in your mid twenties. Uh,

142
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.550
and so as a result,

143
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.870
this cancer had moved really fast and spread very far by the time it was

144
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:07.260
detected. Now she and I, you know,

145
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:10.170
being in her mid twenties, we just thought, well,

146
00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:15.171
we're gonna fight this as if somehow our thoughts could vaporize cancer cells.

147
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.710
Um, and our doctor kind of went along with that, I think,

148
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:22.170
because he probably felt that, you know,

149
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.230
maybe that's the best way that people in their mid twenties should deal with

150
00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:29.610
something like this to prepare for a life that they're not going to have.

151
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.980
So, uh, after a few months, she died,

152
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.943
<v 3>can I lid?</v>

153
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.660
<v 4>So I went away for a few months. Uh,</v>

154
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.680
and then I came back and I came back to my job and I was writing about science

155
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.210
and it was different. So for example,

156
00:09:52.211 --> 00:09:56.560
I wrote a story about water just about water. Um,

157
00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.210
and yet it was quite mesmerizing to me.

158
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:06.040
Um, this was a story just about sort of how water molecules kind of interact.

159
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:06.860
They, they,

160
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.380
the kind of like dancers at a dance party in a crowded club and you know, the,

161
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.140
the volunteers sort of joined together and then pull apart,

162
00:10:14.141 --> 00:10:17.080
they form clusters that dissolve again. And it's, it's, it's,

163
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.440
it's incredibly complicated and incredibly beautiful and it's water.

164
00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:25.090
It's water that we've all grown up with looking at in a glass or what have you

165
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.740
and those water molecules, in a weird way.

166
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.820
I've been waiting all this time for us to understand them and to get to know

167
00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:36.790
them. And I felt,

168
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.900
and talking to these scientists that in a way, uh,

169
00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.570
you know what it was like this, this old friend.

170
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.090
So you know how like with an old friend,

171
00:10:46.091 --> 00:10:49.180
you know you haven't seen him for a long time and you take up right where you

172
00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:53.620
left off while these water molecules were just floating around for billions of

173
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:53.621
years,

174
00:10:53.621 --> 00:10:58.621
just waiting for us to learn about them and we could go away and then we could

175
00:10:58.841 --> 00:11:02.710
come back and maybe some scientists had found something else interesting about

176
00:11:02.711 --> 00:11:06.300
water and it,

177
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:11.530
we would just take off where we left off and all the attention that we paid to

178
00:11:12.161 --> 00:11:14.980
the water would be repaid with beauty.

179
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:21.660
So at the same time I looked at sort of all of us and human life and I felt

180
00:11:24.401 --> 00:11:27.580
like, how is that a week?

181
00:11:27.581 --> 00:11:32.581
And I'll be walking around just pretending that we are going to die.

182
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:38.370
You know, that maybe tomorrow you'll get a diagnosis and that's it. No, we're,

183
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:42.910
we're, we are, we're all gonna die. And so I, I felt like somehow like,

184
00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:43.810
you know, we were walking,

185
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.340
all of us were like walking on a thin sheet of glass with cracks in it.

186
00:11:48.341 --> 00:11:52.670
And I was the only one that noticed and I could look down and I could see the

187
00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:53.230
people,

188
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:58.230
the other side that my doctor at the time I was actually friends with and,

189
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.100
and he was incredibly patient with me because he understood what sort of,

190
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.160
you know, that my frame of mind. And I would go to him and I would say,

191
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:07.420
all right, I don't want you to give me,

192
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.230
I want you to get tested my heart and I want you to test my blood.

193
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.830
I want you to test this and test that. As I said,

194
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:18.270
I was sure that if we ran enough tests that I would find out that there was

195
00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:21.460
something wrong with me because I had to be right.

196
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:27.150
And so he would run test after test after test to become totally uncalled for.

197
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.150
Um,

198
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:33.150
and it all came back negative and I was so dissatisfied.

199
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.540
I was in perfect health and it was terrible.

200
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.713
Um,

201
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.560
so I think through that kind of experience, I,

202
00:12:45.561 --> 00:12:50.561
I ended up writing a lot about evolution because here was a process where life

203
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:55.330
and life turning into death could actually not just end in death but lead to

204
00:12:55.331 --> 00:12:59.920
something, uh, and you could produce new things.

205
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.000
So my first book, which came out a few years after Esther died, was,

206
00:13:04.001 --> 00:13:07.090
was about evolution. And it was about these big transitions,

207
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:09.610
these transformations, um, you know,

208
00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:14.611
fish coming on land and then some mammos going into the water becoming dolphins

209
00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:19.030
and whales. And there was a certain kind of, um,

210
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.660
joy and melancholy and writing about it. I found this,

211
00:13:22.661 --> 00:13:26.350
this passage from the metamorphosis by Arvin.

212
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.910
I made the, the EPO, the, uh, the opening to the book,

213
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.500
and the, the, the story is that, uh, you know, so the,

214
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.140
the metamorphosis is full of all sorts of changes, a lot of which are,

215
00:13:39.141 --> 00:13:42.880
are very agonizing to the, the people who are going through those changes.

216
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:47.710
They don't like it. Um, and yet something beautiful comes out of it.

217
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:52.820
So, for example, the God Bacchus is, uh,

218
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:57.880
kidnapped by some people on a ship and he's going to take vengeance on them.

219
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:03.270
And so the sailors are horrified and watch their hands disappearing and turning

220
00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:08.890
into just flippers and their nose stretches out into a hook and their voice

221
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:13.660
disappears and they're flailing around and they just leap into the water and

222
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:18.310
they become the whole fence. And I was reading that and I would think, you know,

223
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.550
I've seen that kind of changed myself in my own life.

224
00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.570
After that book, I, I, uh,

225
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:28.900
was casting around for another idea and I thought, well,

226
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.470
I'll write about parasites. Um, and you know,

227
00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:34.780
at the time it just sort of seemed like, oh, that'd be cool.

228
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.250
When I look back at it, I think there's something more going on there. I mean,

229
00:14:39.251 --> 00:14:42.940
I became a real FSC Nado of the, the, the, the strangest,

230
00:14:42.941 --> 00:14:44.950
most extreme parasites out there. I mean,

231
00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:49.660
we're talking about wasps that perform brain surgery on cockroaches and then lay

232
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:49.980
their,

233
00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.810
their eggs inside of them and the cockroaches are alive as the wasp is growing

234
00:14:53.811 --> 00:14:56.360
inside them. Or, you know,

235
00:14:56.361 --> 00:15:00.830
an aunt that climbs up to the top of, of a, of a flower,

236
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:05.831
and then a giant stock of fungus comes out of its head and showers down on the

237
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.480
aunts below sowing death.

238
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.610
And I suppose I just felt like, well, you know, if we're, hey,

239
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:14.810
we're all going to die,

240
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:19.460
you might as well look at the most amazing ways that,

241
00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:21.650
that happens in the natural world.

242
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.480
So I started to travel around and look for parasites and I wanted to go to a

243
00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:33.530
place where I could see parasites, uh,

244
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.370
making life difficult for people. I wasn't quite sure how to do it.

245
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.240
I had an old, really good friend who was living in Nairobi at the time,

246
00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:45.380
so I went and visited him and his wife and I would make little forays to try to

247
00:15:45.381 --> 00:15:49.130
find a story for my book.

248
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.350
And I just started, I ended up with a lot of dead ends and I was thinking,

249
00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:56.540
you know, I'm going to go home and I'm going to have nothing.

250
00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.700
It's going to be a real bummer. But my friend started by chance that, hey,

251
00:16:01.701 --> 00:16:03.680
you know what? There's this medical organization,

252
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:08.960
they're dealing with the sleeping sickness epidemic in South Sudan at which is

253
00:16:08.961 --> 00:16:12.590
actually right across the border from Kenya. And they're looking, you know,

254
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:12.821
they're,

255
00:16:12.821 --> 00:16:16.580
they would like to invite some journalists to come and see what they're up to.

256
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.450
And to me this was, I don't know,

257
00:16:20.451 --> 00:16:22.490
this was like the invitation for the Oscars or something.

258
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.080
I mean I was thinking of all the things that I could see there that I just read

259
00:16:27.081 --> 00:16:29.750
about. I mean I could see them and so for example,

260
00:16:29.751 --> 00:16:33.020
there's something called Loa loa. I don't know if any of you heard of it.

261
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.630
So it's a, it's a worm, a, if I remember correctly,

262
00:16:35.631 --> 00:16:39.500
it's transmitted by mosquito. So you see a mosquito buzzing around, you think,

263
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:40.590
Oh God, I hope it didn't have low,

264
00:16:40.591 --> 00:16:44.660
low and I hope it's not going to bite me because what happens, it bites you.

265
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.430
Lolo it gets into your system and it starts started crawling around and I'd like

266
00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:53.630
to crawl around and connective tissue and one of the places where we have

267
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.990
connected tissue is in the surface of your eyes.

268
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.790
So, so people who get low, low,

269
00:17:00.791 --> 00:17:05.791
I will say that they can actually see the parasite and crawling across their

270
00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:09.920
field of you. So this was really a place where you could see parasites.

271
00:17:09.921 --> 00:17:13.460
I mean really, really see them.

272
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.060
And I don't know if that meant that I wanted to get it or talk to someone and

273
00:17:17.061 --> 00:17:19.700
say, well what's it like to see it? I don't know what I wanted.

274
00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:24.470
All I know is that very early one morning I went to this little airport in the

275
00:17:24.471 --> 00:17:29.000
outskirts and never go be with my friend. He drove me out there and you know,

276
00:17:29.001 --> 00:17:32.320
then my friend Scott said, okay, I'll see ya. We Kinda,

277
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:36.680
I got in a little plane with a couple of other journalists and um, you know,

278
00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:38.930
in order to, it's not easy to get into South Sudan,

279
00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.020
especially back then when it was a war zone.

280
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.950
So what you had to do was you had to fly from Nairobi to the border and the is

281
00:17:49.531 --> 00:17:51.690
like the most desolate place you can imagine.

282
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.560
You can look from miles and see basically nothing there may,

283
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:59.570
I think I saw a couple huts like in the distance that was it.

284
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:06.090
You land on one runway and there's another plane there that's the plan is going

285
00:18:06.091 --> 00:18:08.880
to take you to South Sudan. So I'm like, okay,

286
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:12.180
I get my bag and I get out and other journalists are getting out there just like

287
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:17.240
four or five of us and there's no one else around for miles except this guy.

288
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:19.080
Um,

289
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:24.080
I recall he was wearing like a members only jacket and he was like the border

290
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:29.430
guard. Uh, and he said,

291
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.030
I would like to see your passports so you know,

292
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.570
you give me your passport because he's,

293
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:38.520
he's supposed to stamp them and giving them back to you and then you're on your

294
00:18:38.521 --> 00:18:40.230
way, you know. But you know,

295
00:18:40.231 --> 00:18:43.080
going across borders in Africa is always a little sketchy.

296
00:18:43.081 --> 00:18:46.140
So you're nervous already. You're not because you know,

297
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.520
he holds your life in your hands. Maybe you want some money or something.

298
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.360
Well the thing was that he couldn't stamp a visa and her passport,

299
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.980
cause we weren't going to a real country. We weren't really going anywhere.

300
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:06.240
We're going to this place that had really no official designation yet.

301
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:11.760
So he didn't stamp our pieces. He just said, I'm going to hold onto these.

302
00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:18.330
So he takes our passports and it just tucks him away in his members only jacket

303
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:23.730
and we're thinking, yes, we're going. And we all got into,

304
00:19:23.731 --> 00:19:26.520
this plane was a supply plane.

305
00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:29.340
There were some crates with medical supplies and stuff in it.

306
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:35.100
And we got in sort of buckle up along the walls of this open,

307
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:35.640
uh,

308
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.640
open a part in the back and they closed the back of the plane and then the plane

309
00:19:41.801 --> 00:19:43.630
took off and we went off the grid.

310
00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:51.810
So a week later I did come back and I did get my passport.

311
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:59.550
I did get back home. Uh, it's been 14 years since I got here,

312
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.280
back from South Sudan. Uh,

313
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:04.760
two years after I got back,

314
00:20:04.761 --> 00:20:08.960
I fell in love with a woman named grace and we got married.

315
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:14.770
We have two girls who run around in our garden and I feel like I have been given

316
00:20:16.431 --> 00:20:21.310
like a gift, a second life. A second story. Um,

317
00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:26.290
[inaudible] we still deal with some parasites where I live. Uh,

318
00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.940
maybe not getting worms, but you know, West Nile virus, Lyme disease,

319
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.410
it's actual plasma. You can never get away from them. Totally. You know,

320
00:20:35.411 --> 00:20:39.760
we are human. Um, but I don't go to places like South Sudan anymore.

321
00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.560
Mainly for their sake.

322
00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:47.230
When I was there in South Sudan, I saw, um,

323
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.180
I saw a lot of things, you know,

324
00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:53.380
I saw people separating beyond what I can imagine.

325
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.451
I also saw,

326
00:20:54.451 --> 00:20:57.370
I saw a lot of people getting off their lives in the middle of a war zone,

327
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.180
which was something that I didn't even think possible. Uh,

328
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:06.450
before then I would see huge fields full of gigantic termite mounds.

329
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:13.480
But the thing that I actually remember most, most clearly was that night,

330
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.990
waking up in the middle of the night and looking up in a panic at that mosquito

331
00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:22.420
net and thinking there are holes in it.

332
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:26.110
I could see them in the moonlight and I was,

333
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:28.840
I could feel this kind of panic coming up with me.

334
00:21:28.841 --> 00:21:33.730
And then another voice in me said, well, what's the big deal? All right.

335
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:35.290
I mean,

336
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:40.290
if you're going on and on about how we're all going to die and you know there's

337
00:21:41.531 --> 00:21:44.800
nothing you can do about it and you're sure that there's,

338
00:21:44.801 --> 00:21:46.330
there's something just waiting for you,

339
00:21:46.331 --> 00:21:51.220
then why didn't you just go back to sleep and just let it happen?

340
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:57.910
And I could feel, I could feel this, this thing inside me,

341
00:21:57.911 --> 00:22:00.970
this thing inside me that was resisting that and that was me.

342
00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.090
It wasn't a parasite that was myself.

343
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:09.810
And there was this drive that I felt I was not going to just fall asleep again.

344
00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:18.430
You know, we are then. It's a drive that we all have, you know, we, we live,

345
00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.960
we keep living. If death comes into the neighborhood,

346
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:28.390
we're going to fight it. And that is true. That's a rule and it's real.

347
00:22:28.391 --> 00:22:33.391
It's as real as those water molecules floating in space for billions of years.

348
00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.250
And that is what writing about science has given me. Thanks

349
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.720
