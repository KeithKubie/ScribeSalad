00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.660
How do you picture an atom in your mind – like
this, or like this, or maybe one of these?

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.200
If you understand enough about atoms to visualize
any of those things,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.249
then you know more about atomic theory than
scientists did just 100 years ago.

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.729
And, like, WAY more than they thought they
knew 2500 years ago.

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:19.280
That's when Greek philosopher Leucippus and
his pupil Democritus

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.480
first came up with the idea that matter is
composed of tiny particles.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.240
No one knows how they developed this concept, but they didn't think the particles were particularly special –

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.920
they just thought that if you cut something
in half enough times,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.599
eventually you'll reach a particle that can't
be cut anymore.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.219
They gave these particles the name "atomos,"
which means uncuttable or indivisible.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.180
So basically, they thought that iron was made
up of iron particles

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.600
and clay was made up of clay particles and
cheese was made up of cheese particles.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.300
And they attributed properties of each substance
to the forms of the atoms.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.940
So, they thought that iron atoms were hard
and stuck together with hooks,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.500
clay atoms were softer and attached by ball
and socket joints that made them flexible,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.510
and cheese atoms were squishy and delicious.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.510
Now this makes a certain amount of sense if you don't happen to have access to electron microscopes

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.309
or cathode-ray tubes or the work of generations
of previous scientists.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.540
Because the fact is atomic theory as we know
it today is the product of hundreds,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.840
if not thousands,
of different insights.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.160
Some models, like that of Leucippus, were
just blind guesses.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.320
As time went on, many more were the result
of rigorous experimentation.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.260
But, as has been the case in all science, each scientist built on what had been learned before.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.700
We've been talking a lot about the fine details
of chemistry in recent weeks,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.700
and we're gonna keep doing that as we move on to nuclear chemistry and then to the basics of organic chemistry,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.500
but we do, I wanted to set aside some time to explain how we know what we know about the atom today,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.600
and how we know that we're not quite done
figuring it out.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:50.980
[Theme Music]

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.180
Now you might think that once Leucippus and Democritus came up with the general idea of atoms,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.920
it'd be pretty easy for someone else to take
that little, indivisible ball and run with it.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.120
But you'd be wrong.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.060
The next major developments in atomic theory
didn't come along for nearly 2300 YEARS.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.270
I've already told you,
for instance,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.340
about the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier,
who proposed the law of conservation of mass,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.090
which states that even if matter changes shape
or form, its mass stays the same.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.370
And you should remember the English teacher
James Dalton

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.930
who determined that elements exist as discreet
packets of matter.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.220
Thanks to these, and other great minds, by the 1800s we had a better grip on the general behavior of atoms.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.350
The next logical question was "Why? Why do
they behave the way they do?"

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.390
This led to the investigation of atomic structure.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.490
In the 1870s, scientists began probing what
stuff was made of using discharge tubes,

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.660
basically gas-filled tubes with electrodes
in each end,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.200
which emit light when an electrical current passes through them – basically, what a neon light is.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.360
Because this light was originally produced
by a negative electrode, or cathode,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.270
it was called a cathode ray,
and it had a negative charge.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:59.520
But in 1886, German physicist Eugen Goldstein found that the tubes also emitted light from the positive electrode,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.180
basically, a ray headed in the opposite direction, which meant that there must also be a positive charge in matter.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.520
Goldstein didn't fully understand what he'd
discovered here –

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.800
I mean, scientists still hadn't figured out what was responsible for the negative charge in the rays either.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.380
Then, English physicist J.J. Thompson took
the discharge tube research further:

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.180
by measuring how much heat the cathode rays
generated,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.459
how much they could be bent by magnets and
other things,

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.560
he was able to estimate the mass of the rays.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.640
And the mass was about 1000 times lighter than a hydrogen, the smallest bit of matter known at the time.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.840
He concluded that the cathode "rays" weren't
rays or waves at all, but were, in fact,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.540
very light, very small
negatively-charged particles.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.240
He called them "corpuscles;" we call them
"electrons."

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.620
So even though we didn't understand what shapes
they took,

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.150
we knew that there were both negative and
positive components to matter.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.790
The next question was "How were they arranged
in the atom?"

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.500
Thompson knew that the atom overall had a
neutral charge,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.900
so he imagined that the negatively charged electrons must be distributed randomly in a positively charged matrix.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.409
And the very English Thompson visualized this
model as a familiar English dessert:

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:13.560
plum pudding, the positive matrix being the cake, and the electrons the random, floating bits of fruit within it.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.740
Even today, Thompson's model of the atom continues
to be called the "plum pudding model."

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:21.639
And while a single electron's motion is random,
the overall distribution of them is not.

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.990
The next big step was taken by New Zealander
Ernest Rutherford in 1909.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.080
He designed an experiment using an extremely thin sheet of gold foil and a screen coated with zinc sulfide.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.960
He bombarded the sheet with alpha particles,
which he didn't really know what they were,

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.260
just that they were produced by the decay of radium, they were positive charged, and they were really, really small.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.360
He expected them to just fly right through the foil, with no deflection, and many of them did just that.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.200
But as it turned out, some of the particles were deflected at large angles and sometimes almost straight backward.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.980
The only explanation for this was that the
entire positive charge of an atom,

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.249
the charge that would repel an alpha particle,

00:04:58.249 --> 00:05:03.729
must be concentrated in a very small area,
an area that he called "the nucleus."

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.419
Because most of the alpha particles passed
right through the atoms undeterred,

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.759
Rutherford concluded that most of the atom
is empty space, and he was correct.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.180
Rutherford would later discover that if he
bombarded nitrogen with alpha particles,

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.399
it created a bunch of hydrogen ions.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:23.080
Now he correctly surmised that these tiny positively charged ions were themselves fundamental particles:

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.550
Protons.
Now we're getting close to reality.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.749
So these chemists had a fairly good idea of
the structure of the atom,

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:31.789
they just needed to figure out what exactly
the electrons were doing.

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.379
Enter Niels Bohr.

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:37.330
In 1911, the same year the results of Rutherford's
gold foil experiment were published,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.240
Bohr traveled to England to study with Rutherford.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.640
And as a physicist, he was also interested
in the mathematical model set forth by

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.520
German physicists Max Planck and Albert Einstein to explain the behavior of electromagnetic energy.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.360
Over time, Bohr came to realize these mathematical principles could be applied to Rutherford's atomic model.

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:55.580
His analysis of the gold foil experiment and
calculations

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.969
based on the proportion of the alpha particles
that went straight through,

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:02.219
those that were slightly deflected, and those
that bounced almost completely backward,

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:06.689
allowed him to predict the most likely positions
of electrons within the atom.

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:12.480
Bohr's resulting model, sometimes called the planetary model, is still familiar to most people, probably including you.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.000
It represents the electrons in orbits around
a small central nucleus.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.660
Each orbit can have a specific number of electrons,

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:23.719
which correlates to the energy levels and
orbitals in the modern model of an atom.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.660
And while it's definitely flawed, Bohr's model is very close to reality in some important ways.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:35.059
But like everyone I've mentioned in the past couple of minutes, Bohr was at once fantastically right and way off.

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:37.439
The problem was those pesky electrons.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.449
It was the German theoretical physicist Werner
Heisenberg

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:45.200
who got everyone to understand just how huge
and mind-blowing this electron problem was.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.420
But he was also the one who helped tie the
whole mess up into a neat little bundle.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.400
Using his wicked math chops, Heisenberg discovered
that it is impossible to know with certainty

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.500
both the momentum of an electron or any subatomic
particle and its exact position.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.480
And the more you know about one of those two variables, the harder it gets to measure the other one.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.279
So if you can't measure the position or momentum
of an electron,

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.380
you obviously can't say with certainty that the electrons in an atom are all neatly aligned in circular orbits.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:15.960
So he and a new wave of physicists and chemists
proposed a new theory: a quantum theory,

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:22.120
which proposes that electrons weren't particles or waves, instead, they had properties of both and neither.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.860
By this thinking, the arrangement of electrons around a nucleus could only be described in terms of probability.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.060
In other words, there are certain regions where an electron is much more likely to be found.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.980
We call these regions "orbitals."

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.819
You know, the very same orbital that you and
I have been talking about –

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.689
the ones that go by the names "s and d and
p and f" and that form sigma and pi bonds –

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:44.189
those are the things that Heisenberg's theory
predicts.

00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:46.260
And that's the modern understanding of atoms.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.529
Because it's based on probability, quantum
atoms are often drawn as

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:52.949
clouds with the intensity of color representing
not individual electrons

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:56.389
but the probability of finding an electron
in any particular position.

00:07:56.389 --> 00:08:00.389
For this reason, the quantum model is often
called the cloud model of the atom.

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:02.109
And now ya know!

00:08:02.109 --> 00:08:06.509
All the people I've mentioned and many others put their heads together over time to build this current and

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:09.479
– I might say – quite elegant understanding
of atomic theory.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:15.379
Now, after 2500 years, even though we can't see them, we can know what they're like and how they work,

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:20.689
because a long succession of scientists contributed
bits and pieces to the whole fantastic picture.

00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:25.429
But it's also important to recognize that
we still may not be quite all the way right.

00:08:25.429 --> 00:08:28.760
Thompson's contemporaries were sure that the
plum pudding model was right;

00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:32.139
scientists in Bohr's day fully believed that
the planetary model was right,

00:08:32.139 --> 00:08:36.239
and today we're extremely confident that the
quantum model is correct.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.600
But it may not be all the way correct, and
that's where you come in:

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.800
the only way we can go on being sure is to
keep asking questions and conducting experiments.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.040
And that's why you're taking chemistry
and physics. Pay attention!

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.500
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.879
If you paid attention, you learned that Leucippus
and Democritus

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:57.509
originated the idea of atoms nearly 2500 years
ago,

00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:59.889
but that the real work didn't really begin
until

00:08:59.889 --> 00:09:04.690
both protons and electrons were discovered
by experimenting with discharge tubes,

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:08.850
and how Ernest Rutherford figured out what
and where the nucleus is.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.839
You also learned that chemistry can sometimes
be done with just math,

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:13.480
like how Bohr figured out his model

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.629
or the way that Heisenberg used math to usher
in the quantum theory of the atom.
