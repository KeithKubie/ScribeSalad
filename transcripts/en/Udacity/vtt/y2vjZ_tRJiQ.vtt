00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now special relativity is really an amazing subject.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
For me, when I took special relativity, this was the first time that I encountered something

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that was completely unintuitive, and by that, I mean the conclusions which we're going to draw

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
from special relativity are going to be things we never see in our daily lives.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And that's because special relativity deals with the realms of the very, very fast

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
of objects moving near the speed of light.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The speed of light is such as important number in physics that we give it own variable.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We call it lowercase c and it's value is about 3x10⁸ m/s.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
In fact the exact value is 299,792,458 m/s,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but this is the approximation we're going to be using in this unit.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
All right, so I have told you how crazy and mind blowing this topic is going to be.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Where do we begin such a topic? Who do we start with? What do we talk about?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Well, let's start with our good friend Galileo.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now you may have heard that special relativity is Einstein's theory, Albert Einstein,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and yes that's true, but just like Newton before him, Einstein stood on the shoulders of Galileo

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to make his or at least one of his amazing discoveries.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
In fact, his theory of special relativity can be completely derived by 2 postulates.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
A postulate or axiom is just something that we believe to be true and which we use.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We use these postulates by applying logic to them and eventually we get some conclusions.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
That's pretty amazing about this approach to problems is that as long as the logic is sound,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
you can't argue the conclusions if you believe the postulates.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
What I'm going to do today is show you what these two postulates are.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Motivate why they must be true then we'll see a couple of the remarkable conclusions that follow.

00:01:47.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Let's move forward to the first postulate.
