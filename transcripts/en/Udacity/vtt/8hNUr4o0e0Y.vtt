00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.950
In the previous exercise, you practiced querying for all entities

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.820
of a kind. Magnus has talked to you about querying

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.420
by kind and by property. So the next step is

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.910
for you to write the code and fill the search results

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.270
by property values. For example, you could find all the

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.040
conferences whose city property has a value London. To add

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.030
a filer to a query, you either call up the

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.050
filter method specifying the property and operate a filter on and

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.140
the value of the filter on. So, for example, if you

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.900
need to fill from the city property and the value London.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.310
But let's suppose you already created the query and now you

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.750
want to add filters. After you create a query object you can't

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.690
change it. In other words, it's immutable. So to make changes

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.740
to your query you need to reassign the variable and this is

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.310
how you build up your query. So let's say this is

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.120
my original query where I'm getting all the conferences ordered by name.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.620
So now to add my filter, I just reassign

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.060
query back to itself really but that makes a copy

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.310
of it and, in this way, you can keep adding

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.360
filters. And that's what you're going to be doing now
