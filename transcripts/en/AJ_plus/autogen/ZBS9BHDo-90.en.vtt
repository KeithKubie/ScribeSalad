00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.739
yes if you oh I think I'll be a few ways

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:02.749
yes if you oh I think I'll be a few ways
 

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:47.440
yes if you oh I think I'll be a few ways
out there to get some good data

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450
 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.799
occurred to me that if surfers has

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809
occurred to me that if surfers has
 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.750
occurred to me that if surfers has
sensors on ball on their surfboards on

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760
sensors on ball on their surfboards on
 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.880
sensors on ball on their surfboards on
the surfboard leashes they could we

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
the surfboard leashes they could we
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.080
the surfboard leashes they could we
could acquire huge amount of

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090
could acquire huge amount of
 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:16.390
could acquire huge amount of
environmental data around the coastline

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400
 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.700
basically and there is a sparsity of

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
basically and there is a sparsity of
 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.620
basically and there is a sparsity of
observations around the coastline so we

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630
observations around the coastline so we
 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.410
observations around the coastline so we
really don't properly understand or know

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
really don't properly understand or know
 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.120
really don't properly understand or know
what is really happening around our

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
what is really happening around our
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.850
what is really happening around our
coastline but if people have these

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
coastline but if people have these
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.350
coastline but if people have these
sensors they could make a huge

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360
sensors they could make a huge
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.240
sensors they could make a huge
difference to data collection around the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250
difference to data collection around the
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.050
difference to data collection around the
coastline with the GPS data we can

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
coastline with the GPS data we can
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.880
coastline with the GPS data we can
acquire information certain performance

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
acquire information certain performance
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.219
acquire information certain performance
such as how many ways you port how far

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229
such as how many ways you port how far
 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.710
such as how many ways you port how far
you go on each wave how fast you go on

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720
you go on each wave how fast you go on
 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.670
you go on each wave how fast you go on
each way and this data is useful data

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680
 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.080
we need surfers to get on board with

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090
we need surfers to get on board with
 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.450
we need surfers to get on board with
this idea
