publishing and that figure has come up
 

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:14.879
publishing and that figure has come up
again and again in various reports in

again and again in various reports in
 

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:17.159
again and again in various reports in
the web survey that we've done we head

00:08:17.159 --> 00:08:17.169
the web survey that we've done we head
 

00:08:17.169 --> 00:08:18.509
the web survey that we've done we head
around the same number of ARL

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:18.519
around the same number of ARL
 

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:20.819
around the same number of ARL
institutions answering and it looks as

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:20.829
institutions answering and it looks as
 

00:08:20.829 --> 00:08:22.350
institutions answering and it looks as
if it's now about seven seventy eight

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:22.360
if it's now about seven seventy eight
 

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.189
if it's now about seven seventy eight
percent of ARL institutions are either

00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199
percent of ARL institutions are either
 

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:29.819
percent of ARL institutions are either
doing or considering publishing so there

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:29.829
doing or considering publishing so there
 

00:08:29.829 --> 00:08:32.579
doing or considering publishing so there
is some growth and only twenty-two

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:32.589
is some growth and only twenty-two
 

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:33.839
is some growth and only twenty-two
percent of the institutions were not

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:33.849
percent of the institutions were not
 

00:08:33.849 --> 00:08:37.199
percent of the institutions were not
active at all in this area it's a it's a

00:08:37.199 --> 00:08:37.209
active at all in this area it's a it's a
 

00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:39.299
active at all in this area it's a it's a
difficult number because publishing is a

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:39.309
difficult number because publishing is a
 

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:43.529
difficult number because publishing is a
very broad term but it's interesting to

00:08:43.529 --> 00:08:43.539
very broad term but it's interesting to
 

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:47.160
very broad term but it's interesting to
see growth as I mentioned we were also

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:47.170
see growth as I mentioned we were also
 

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.170
see growth as I mentioned we were also
looking at what was happening in smaller

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:49.180
looking at what was happening in smaller
 

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.049
looking at what was happening in smaller
institutions and you'll see that of the

00:08:52.049 --> 00:08:52.059
institutions and you'll see that of the
 

00:08:52.059 --> 00:08:54.749

cases a blue star is overlain with a red

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:12.589
cases a blue star is overlain with a red
 

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:14.800
cases a blue star is overlain with a red
star so for example if you think of a

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:14.810
star so for example if you think of a
 

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.260
star so for example if you think of a
conference you can see an electronic

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:17.270
conference you can see an electronic
 

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.449

we operate across a continuum and by

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:34.430
we operate across a continuum and by
 

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.900
we operate across a continuum and by
doing things together we can provide

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:36.910
doing things together we can provide
 

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.700

research journals and putting our name
 

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:18.539
research journals and putting our name
on them are we not are we wrong to put

on them are we not are we wrong to put

our name on technical reports and that's
 

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.869
our name on technical reports and that's
a that's a tricky one because we could

00:23:24.869 --> 00:23:24.879
a that's a tricky one because we could
 

00:23:24.879 --> 00:23:26.519
a that's a tricky one because we could
go over to our sort of a white label

00:23:26.519 --> 00:23:26.529
go over to our sort of a white label
 

00:23:26.529 --> 00:23:28.320
go over to our sort of a white label
approach and just say okay we're going

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:28.330
approach and just say okay we're going

approach and just say okay we're going
to provide the services but we're not

00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159
to provide the services but we're not
 

00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:32.789
to provide the services but we're not
going to put our name on them but then

00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799
going to put our name on them but then
 

00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:35.690
going to put our name on them but then
we again risk becoming irrelevant so

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:35.700
we again risk becoming irrelevant so

we again risk becoming irrelevant so
it's it's a it's a difficult one and I

this is mission related and I know I
 

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.990
this is mission related and I know I
think this is an area which will come up

think this is an area which will come up
 

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.810
think this is an area which will come up
again and again today how much of this

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:06.820
again and again today how much of this
 

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.190
again and again today how much of this
is mission related how much of this is

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:08.200
is mission related how much of this is

cost recovery I think what we hope will

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.080
cost recovery I think what we hope will
 

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.539
cost recovery I think what we hope will
happen is that we can move towards a

00:24:12.539 --> 00:24:12.549
happen is that we can move towards a
 

00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:14.759
happen is that we can move towards a
product mix where some things will be

00:24:14.759 --> 00:24:14.769
product mix where some things will be
 

00:24:14.769 --> 00:24:17.639
product mix where some things will be
subsidizing other things but at the

00:24:17.639 --> 00:24:17.649
subsidizing other things but at the
 

00:24:17.649 --> 00:24:19.230
subsidizing other things but at the
moment we're operating a lot of this on

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:19.240
moment we're operating a lot of this on
 

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:24.810
moment we're operating a lot of this on
short-term money and that really brings

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:24.820
short-term money and that really brings
 

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.779
short-term money and that really brings

challenges and partly because I can't I

00:29:59.130 --> 00:29:59.140
challenges and partly because I can't I
 

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.990

can't know enough about what all those

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:01.000
can't know enough about what all those

everybody else is doing so one of the

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:06.510
everybody else is doing so one of the
 

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:09.300
everybody else is doing so one of the
one of the responsibilities I realized

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:09.310
one of the responsibilities I realized
 

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.250
one of the responsibilities I realized
is that in addition to my communicating

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:11.260
is that in addition to my communicating
 

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.960
is that in addition to my communicating
I need to make sure that we have more

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:12.970
I need to make sure that we have more
 

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:14.580
I need to make sure that we have more
structure in place for everyone else to

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:14.590
structure in place for everyone else to
 

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.280
structure in place for everyone else to
communicate and that is making making a

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:17.290
communicate and that is making making a
 

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:18.720
communicate and that is making making a
real difference as we start to build in

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:18.730
real difference as we start to build in
 

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.330
real difference as we start to build in
that structure but as we created the

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:21.340
that structure but as we created the
 

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.310
that structure but as we created the
position we determined that essentially

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320
position we determined that essentially
 

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.170

kind of main categories of work so one
is that I'll be providing and figuring

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:31.090
is that I'll be providing and figuring
 

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.660
is that I'll be providing and figuring
out ways to provide library publishing

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:33.670
out ways to provide library publishing
 

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.550
out ways to provide library publishing
services just from within the library

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:50.190
scholarship and rely on other technology
services to do that and then finally the

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.200
services to do that and then finally the
 

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.320
services to do that and then finally the
third piece is to bring the resources of

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:52.330
third piece is to bring the resources of
 

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:53.760
third piece is to bring the resources of
the press in the library together in

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:53.770
the press in the library together in
 

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:56.720
the press in the library together in
some ways that they haven't done before

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:56.730
some ways that they haven't done before
 

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.220
some ways that they haven't done before
so the priorities at the library were

00:30:59.220 --> 00:30:59.230
so the priorities at the library were
 

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:00.870
so the priorities at the library were
really just to bring some publishing

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880
really just to bring some publishing
 

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.730
really just to bring some publishing
expertise into the into the organization

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:02.740
expertise into the into the organization
 

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.910

nobody in the library had any specific

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:05.920
nobody in the library had any specific
 

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.280
nobody in the library had any specific
experience with publishing and that was

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:08.290
experience with publishing and that was
 

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:09.420
experience with publishing and that was
one of the reasons they wrote the Job

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:09.430
one of the reasons they wrote the Job
 

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:10.620

services so we've essentially in the
 

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:19.290
services so we've essentially in the
same ways some of the ways that Purdue

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:19.300
same ways some of the ways that Purdue
 

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:19.710

I've been focusing on our emphasis is

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:39.880
I've been focusing on our emphasis is
 

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.140

research university and we couldn't
possibly publish in every field that's

important to NYU so that has led over
the years to a lot of frustration and I

00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:16.379
the years to a lot of frustration and I
 

00:34:16.379 --> 00:34:18.930
the years to a lot of frustration and I
don't believe the press is considered

00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:18.940
don't believe the press is considered
 

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.570
don't believe the press is considered
irrelevant at the University but it's it

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:21.580
irrelevant at the University but it's it
 

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.540
irrelevant at the University but it's it
there's a lot of mystification about why

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:24.550
there's a lot of mystification about why
 

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:26.220
there's a lot of mystification about why
we would turn down things that so

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:26.230
we would turn down things that so
 

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:28.470
we would turn down things that so
clearly are about NYU why wouldn't we

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480
clearly are about NYU why wouldn't we
 

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.540
clearly are about NYU why wouldn't we
publish a history of the physics

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:30.550
publish a history of the physics
 

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:32.700
publish a history of the physics
department for example you know there

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:32.710
department for example you know there
 

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:33.629
department for example you know there
are a lot of good reasons why you

00:34:33.629 --> 00:34:33.639
are a lot of good reasons why you
 

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:35.159
are a lot of good reasons why you
wouldn't do that but it you have to have

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:35.169
wouldn't do that but it you have to have
 

00:34:35.169 --> 00:34:36.480
wouldn't do that but it you have to have
that conversation over and over and over

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:36.490
that conversation over and over and over

that conversation over and over and over
so part of the reason for my position

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:38.530
so part of the reason for my position
 

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:40.590
so part of the reason for my position
was to build those start to be able to

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:40.600
was to build those start to be able to
 

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.210
was to build those start to be able to

advice that comes in some ways from the
 

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.230
advice that comes in some ways from the
press but doesn't require the press to

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240
press but doesn't require the press to
 

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:47.879
press but doesn't require the press to
kind of come to the table as a publisher

00:34:47.879 --> 00:34:47.889
kind of come to the table as a publisher
 

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:50.970
kind of come to the table as a publisher
in all ways the other thing that we

00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:50.980
in all ways the other thing that we
 

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.409
in all ways the other thing that we
wanted to do is really be able to take

00:34:52.409 --> 00:34:52.419
wanted to do is really be able to take
 

00:34:52.419 --> 00:34:54.389
wanted to do is really be able to take
advantage of new opportunities and think

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399
advantage of new opportunities and think
 

00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:56.940
advantage of new opportunities and think
through how to do that so vendors and

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:56.950
through how to do that so vendors and
 

00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:58.920
through how to do that so vendors and
technologies coming on stream pretty

00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:58.930
technologies coming on stream pretty
 

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.470
technologies coming on stream pretty
much weekly we have to figure out how to

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.480
much weekly we have to figure out how to
 

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.590
much weekly we have to figure out how to
decide among those so part of my work is

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:03.600
decide among those so part of my work is
 

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.580
decide among those so part of my work is
talking with the managers at the press

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:05.590
talking with the managers at the press
 

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:06.990
talking with the managers at the press
about how we how we set our priorities

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:07.000
about how we how we set our priorities
 

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.030
about how we how we set our priorities
and how we go about doing that because

and how we go about doing that because
 

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.980
and how we go about doing that because
ultimately our goal is to be a scholarly

publisher regardless of format we want
 

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.120
publisher regardless of format we want
to evolve into that where we may be a

00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:15.130
to evolve into that where we may be a
 

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:16.980
to evolve into that where we may be a
book publisher but we may be supporting

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:16.990
book publisher but we may be supporting
 

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:18.570
book publisher but we may be supporting
all kinds of other things as well and

all kinds of other things as well and
 

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.460
all kinds of other things as well and
that's if we went ahead that way what do

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:20.470
that's if we went ahead that way what do
 

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:23.790
that's if we went ahead that way what do
we need to do to get there and as I said

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:23.800
we need to do to get there and as I said
 

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.320
we need to do to get there and as I said

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:26.700
one of our major partners is the
department in the library the digital

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:26.710
department in the library the digital
 

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:29.099
department in the library the digital
library technology services and some

00:35:29.099 --> 00:35:29.109
library technology services and some
 

00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:31.020
library technology services and some
background is useful here because when i

00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:31.030
background is useful here because when i
 

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.840
background is useful here because when i
arrived at nyu they were just in the

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:33.850
arrived at nyu they were just in the
 

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:35.640
arrived at nyu they were just in the
beginning of a process of evolution from

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:35.650
beginning of a process of evolution from
 

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:38.070
beginning of a process of evolution from
being a essentially a project-based

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.080
being a essentially a project-based
 

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.260
being a essentially a project-based
grant funded you know they would get

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:40.270
grant funded you know they would get
 

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.780
grant funded you know they would get
money to do a specific project and build

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:42.790
money to do a specific project and build
 

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:44.340
money to do a specific project and build
technology as they needed it and they

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:44.350
technology as they needed it and they
 

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:46.260
technology as they needed it and they
were really trying to expand their tool

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:46.270
were really trying to expand their tool
 

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:47.040
were really trying to expand their tool
set and

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:47.050
set and
 

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:49.140
set and
their skill set but it was really

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:49.150
their skill set but it was really
 

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:50.700
their skill set but it was really
focused on where what they could get

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:50.710
focused on where what they could get
 

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:53.220
focused on where what they could get
money for and slowly they've been able

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:53.230
money for and slowly they've been able
 

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:55.350
money for and slowly they've been able
to provide more ongoing funding and

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:55.360
to provide more ongoing funding and
 

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.060
to provide more ongoing funding and
full-time staff that weren't just grant

00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:57.070
full-time staff that weren't just grant
 

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:59.160
full-time staff that weren't just grant
funded and have evolved into a real

00:35:59.160 --> 00:35:59.170
funded and have evolved into a real
 

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:02.550
funded and have evolved into a real
operation that wasn't their primary

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560
operation that wasn't their primary
 

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.350
operation that wasn't their primary
focus when I arrived was really some

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:04.360
focus when I arrived was really some
 

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.840
focus when I arrived was really some
very significant preservation efforts

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:06.850
very significant preservation efforts
 

00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:09.330
very significant preservation efforts
and digital preservation of formats that

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:09.340
and digital preservation of formats that
 

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.000
and digital preservation of formats that
are important at NYU and audio and video

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:12.010
are important at NYU and audio and video
 

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:14.730
are important at NYU and audio and video
television so they had some great

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:14.740
television so they had some great
 

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.680
television so they had some great
expertise in preservation but they

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:16.690
expertise in preservation but they
 

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:18.810
expertise in preservation but they
hadn't done large-scale digitization in

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:18.820
hadn't done large-scale digitization in
 

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.330
hadn't done large-scale digitization in
any way they hadn't done a lot of we

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:21.340
any way they hadn't done a lot of we
 

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:23.250
any way they hadn't done a lot of we
weren't digitizing our own collections

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:23.260
weren't digitizing our own collections
 

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.990
weren't digitizing our own collections
and they weren't really offering a whole

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:25.000
and they weren't really offering a whole
 

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.480
and they weren't really offering a whole
lot of ongoing access to stuff they

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:27.490
lot of ongoing access to stuff they
 

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:28.920
lot of ongoing access to stuff they
would build a website but it wasn't

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:28.930
would build a website but it wasn't
 

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:30.870
would build a website but it wasn't
really considered a publication in the

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880
really considered a publication in the
 

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.550
really considered a publication in the
sense of how were people going to use

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560
sense of how were people going to use
 

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.620
sense of how were people going to use
and reuse that material so these are the

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:34.630
and reuse that material so these are the
 

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:35.940
and reuse that material so these are the
departments that are on the slide that

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:35.950
departments that are on the slide that
 

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:37.920
departments that are on the slide that
they that they've now assembled

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:37.930
they that they've now assembled
 

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:40.410
they that they've now assembled
themselves into and it gives a lot more

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:40.420
themselves into and it gives a lot more
 

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.240
themselves into and it gives a lot more
opportunity for us to think about how

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:42.250
opportunity for us to think about how
 

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:44.640
opportunity for us to think about how
are we going to combine efforts and what

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:44.650
are we going to combine efforts and what
 

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.980
are we going to combine efforts and what
can we what can we do working with them

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:46.990
can we what can we do working with them
 

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:50.520
can we what can we do working with them
to figure out how to bring projects in

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:50.530
to figure out how to bring projects in
 

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:55.890
to figure out how to bring projects in
that the DLT s can help us build so I'll

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:55.900
that the DLT s can help us build so I'll
 

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.260
that the DLT s can help us build so I'll
give as Charles did a few examples of

00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:58.270
give as Charles did a few examples of
 

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.030
give as Charles did a few examples of
specific things that we're working on

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:00.040
specific things that we're working on
 

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:04.920
specific things that we're working on
and I tried to sort of encapsulate what

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:04.930
and I tried to sort of encapsulate what
 

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:06.840
and I tried to sort of encapsulate what
they are and in some ways I think we're

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:06.850
they are and in some ways I think we're
 

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:09.390
they are and in some ways I think we're
really we're trying to find ways to

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400
really we're trying to find ways to
 

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.250
really we're trying to find ways to
bring traditional scholars into the

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:11.260
bring traditional scholars into the
 

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:13.740
bring traditional scholars into the
digital realm we're also trying to work

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:13.750
digital realm we're also trying to work
 

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:15.720
digital realm we're also trying to work
really closely with innovative scholars

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:15.730
really closely with innovative scholars
 

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:17.730
really closely with innovative scholars
who are very very eager and pushing us

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:17.740
who are very very eager and pushing us
 

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.190
who are very very eager and pushing us
to do more in the digital realm and then

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.200
to do more in the digital realm and then
 

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.840
to do more in the digital realm and then
also really focusing on who the

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:21.850
also really focusing on who the
 

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:23.850
also really focusing on who the
publishing partners are at NYU that we

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:23.860
publishing partners are at NYU that we
 

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:25.560
publishing partners are at NYU that we
can work with most effectively both from

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:25.570
can work with most effectively both from
 

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:28.200
can work with most effectively both from
the press and the library side so the

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:28.210
the press and the library side so the
 

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:30.540
the press and the library side so the
first example we did was this came

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:30.550
first example we did was this came
 

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:32.370
first example we did was this came
directly out of the press an editor had

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:32.380
directly out of the press an editor had
 

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:36.240
directly out of the press an editor had
a book that was based on texts written

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:36.250
a book that was based on texts written
 

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:37.680
a book that was based on texts written
by authors who were representing

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:37.690
by authors who were representing
 

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:39.960
by authors who were representing
detainees at Guantanamo and they were

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:39.970
detainees at Guantanamo and they were
 

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:41.280
detainees at Guantanamo and they were
writing a book about it but they wanted

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:41.290
writing a book about it but they wanted
 

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:43.380
writing a book about it but they wanted
to provide access to the full text of

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:43.390
to provide access to the full text of
 

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:47.310
to provide access to the full text of
just in PDF form so this was seemed like

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:47.320
just in PDF form so this was seemed like
 

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.380
just in PDF form so this was seemed like
an obvious thing to do so we published

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:49.390
an obvious thing to do so we published
 

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:50.460
an obvious thing to do so we published
the press publish the book and the

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:50.470
the press publish the book and the
 

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:52.350
the press publish the book and the
library built a website and then it

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:52.360
library built a website and then it
 

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.630
library built a website and then it
turned out that the authors of the book

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640
turned out that the authors of the book
 

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.600
turned out that the authors of the book
had an enormous additional archives in

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:57.610
had an enormous additional archives in
 

00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:58.730
had an enormous additional archives in
print and in

00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:58.740
print and in
 

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:00.020
print and in
digital form of all kinds of other

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:00.030
digital form of all kinds of other
 

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.710
digital form of all kinds of other
materials related to work at guantanamo

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720
materials related to work at guantanamo
 

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.870
materials related to work at guantanamo
and they wanted to make that available

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880
and they wanted to make that available
 

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.230
and they wanted to make that available
so that is an ongoing project in the

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240
so that is an ongoing project in the
 

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.480
so that is an ongoing project in the
library special collections and so this

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:11.490
library special collections and so this
 

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.250
library special collections and so this
evolved nicely from you know a good way

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:13.260
evolved nicely from you know a good way
 

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.840
evolved nicely from you know a good way
to help an editor acquire a book that

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:14.850
to help an editor acquire a book that
 

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:16.820
to help an editor acquire a book that
the the authors wanted something more

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:16.830
the the authors wanted something more
 

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:18.230
the the authors wanted something more
than just a book so we were able to

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240
than just a book so we were able to
 

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.880
than just a book so we were able to
offer that and then the library also

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:19.890
offer that and then the library also
 

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:22.640
offer that and then the library also
gained a very large and what we expect

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:22.650
gained a very large and what we expect
 

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.260
gained a very large and what we expect
to be a growing special collection over

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:24.270
to be a growing special collection over
 

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:25.609
to be a growing special collection over
time so that was just sort of a nice

00:38:25.609 --> 00:38:25.619
time so that was just sort of a nice
 

00:38:25.619 --> 00:38:27.830
time so that was just sort of a nice
indicator at the beginning first year

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:27.840
indicator at the beginning first year
 

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.890
indicator at the beginning first year
that we could the this sort of having

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:30.900
that we could the this sort of having
 

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.060
that we could the this sort of having
somebody in between the press and the

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:32.070
somebody in between the press and the
 

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:33.290
somebody in between the press and the
library was going to turn out to be

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:33.300
library was going to turn out to be
 

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:37.520
library was going to turn out to be
useful for a variety of reasons there's

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:37.530
useful for a variety of reasons there's
 

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:40.790
useful for a variety of reasons there's
one of the things that's been important

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800
one of the things that's been important
 

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.430
one of the things that's been important
for us to bear in mind is how our

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:42.440
for us to bear in mind is how our
 

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.230
for us to bear in mind is how our
universities own large context can

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240
universities own large context can
 

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.550
universities own large context can
influence what we're doing and the

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560
influence what we're doing and the
 

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.100
influence what we're doing and the
presses worked for a long time to really

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:14.220
then there's a conversation that takes
 

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.590
then there's a conversation that takes
place and that's essentially using a

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:15.600
place and that's essentially using a
 

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.000
place and that's essentially using a
simple blog software you can put

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:17.010
simple blog software you can put
 

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.610
simple blog software you can put
multimedia up and you can allow you can

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:19.620
multimedia up and you can allow you can
 

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.250
multimedia up and you can allow you can
allow conversation but they curate it in

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:22.260
allow conversation but they curate it in
 

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.450
allow conversation but they curate it in
such a way that every week has a

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:23.460
such a way that every week has a
 

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.450
such a way that every week has a
different theme and then people are able

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:25.460
different theme and then people are able
 

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.370
different theme and then people are able
to respond very quickly to changes in

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:27.380
to respond very quickly to changes in
 

00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.990
to respond very quickly to changes in
the news because putting these things

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000
the news because putting these things
 

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.120
the news because putting these things
online doesn't take any significant

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:31.130
online doesn't take any significant
 

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:32.410
online doesn't take any significant
amount of work and it doesn't go through

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:32.420
amount of work and it doesn't go through
 

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.900
amount of work and it doesn't go through
a peer-review process but then the the

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:34.910
a peer-review process but then the the
 

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:36.940
a peer-review process but then the the
different sets of discussions can be

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:36.950
different sets of discussions can be
 

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:38.589
different sets of discussions can be
used and have been used in classes and

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:38.599
used and have been used in classes and
 

00:42:38.599 --> 00:42:40.780
used and have been used in classes and
in various ways people come back to them

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:40.790
in various ways people come back to them
 

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.970
in various ways people come back to them
and the conversations can continue the

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:42.980
and the conversations can continue the
 

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:47.400
and the conversations can continue the
new every day is a new related set of

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:47.410
new every day is a new related set of
 

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:49.690

scholarly conversations they form

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:49.700
scholarly conversations they form
 

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.670
scholarly conversations they form
clusters and what they're calling it is

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680
clusters and what they're calling it is
 

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.220
clusters and what they're calling it is
a middle state publishing or it's not a

the sort of people are starting to think

00:42:59.410 --> 00:42:59.420
the sort of people are starting to think
 

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.120
the sort of people are starting to think
hard about a topic and they want to

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:01.130
hard about a topic and they want to
 

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:02.950
hard about a topic and they want to
discuss it with each other so media

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:02.960
discuss it with each other so media

Commons platform allows them to create a

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:04.910
Commons platform allows them to create a
 

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:06.820
Commons platform allows them to create a
cluster of conversations around these

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:06.830
cluster of conversations around these
 

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:09.609
cluster of conversations around these
particular topics and then have lots of

00:43:09.609 --> 00:43:09.619
particular topics and then have lots of
 

00:43:09.619 --> 00:43:12.870
particular topics and then have lots of
interactive conversation about those

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880
interactive conversation about those
 

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.700

anyone who's online can join this
conversation and they can comment on a

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:33.650
conversation and they can comment on a
 

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:36.130
conversation and they can comment on a
paragraph by paragraph so the one

example we had of this was a book that

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:37.940
example we had of this was a book that
 

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.790
example we had of this was a book that
had been submitted to NYU press for

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:39.800
had been submitted to NYU press for
 

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.950

publication was simultaneously posted in

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:41.960
publication was simultaneously posted in
 

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.800
publication was simultaneously posted in
media Commons press and so the author

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:44.810
media Commons press and so the author
 

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:46.839
media Commons press and so the author
was getting traditional formal peer

00:43:46.839 --> 00:43:46.849
was getting traditional formal peer
 

00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:48.700
was getting traditional formal peer
review done at the press at the same

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:48.710
review done at the press at the same
 

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:50.530
review done at the press at the same
time as she was getting open online peer

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:50.540
time as she was getting open online peer
 

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.680
time as she was getting open online peer
review done by folks on this site and

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:53.690
review done by folks on this site and
 

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:55.599
review done by folks on this site and
was able to really benefit from those

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:55.609
was able to really benefit from those
 

00:43:55.609 --> 00:43:57.609
was able to really benefit from those
two different forms of interaction the

00:43:57.609 --> 00:43:57.619
two different forms of interaction the
 

00:43:57.619 --> 00:43:59.589
two different forms of interaction the
goal that the media Commons scholars

00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599
goal that the media Commons scholars
 

00:43:59.599 --> 00:44:00.970
goal that the media Commons scholars
have is really to start thinking about

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:00.980
have is really to start thinking about
 

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:02.800
have is really to start thinking about
new ways of publication that are more

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:02.810
new ways of publication that are more
 

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:04.780
new ways of publication that are more
open that give people credit for

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:04.790
open that give people credit for
 

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:07.180
open that give people credit for
commenting that give people give authors

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:07.190
commenting that give people give authors
 

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:09.220
commenting that give people give authors
the opportunity to directly engage with

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:09.230
the opportunity to directly engage with
 

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:11.800
the opportunity to directly engage with
their reviewers so what we're doing is

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:11.810
their reviewers so what we're doing is
 

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:13.540
their reviewers so what we're doing is
really trying to build tools to help

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:13.550
really trying to build tools to help
 

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:16.120
really trying to build tools to help
support that and so we're hoping to be

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:16.130
support that and so we're hoping to be
 

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:18.220
support that and so we're hoping to be
able to start doing more with open

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:18.230
able to start doing more with open
 

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:21.310
able to start doing more with open
annotation and we've just we hope very

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:21.320
annotation and we've just we hope very
 

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.230
annotation and we've just we hope very
soon in another week or two to receive a

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:23.240
soon in another week or two to receive a
 

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.630
soon in another week or two to receive a
grant that will let us bring a group of

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:25.640
grant that will let us bring a group of
 

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.820
grant that will let us bring a group of
scholars to NYU to talk about what peer

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:27.830
scholars to NYU to talk about what peer
 

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:29.740
scholars to NYU to talk about what peer
to peer review should be and how it

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:29.750
to peer review should be and how it
 

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:31.060
to peer review should be and how it
should work and what technologies are

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:31.070
should work and what technologies are
 

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:32.859
should work and what technologies are
needed to support it because we've

00:44:32.859 --> 00:44:32.869
needed to support it because we've
 

00:44:32.869 --> 00:44:34.390
needed to support it because we've
learned using media Commons Press that

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400
learned using media Commons Press that
 

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.000
learned using media Commons Press that
it's not there are things we want to be

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:37.010
it's not there are things we want to be
 

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:38.220
it's not there are things we want to be
able to do that we can't do you

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:38.230
able to do that we can't do you
 

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:40.020
able to do that we can't do you
so we're hoping to specify what those

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:40.030
so we're hoping to specify what those
 

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:43.170
so we're hoping to specify what those
are and then really sort of push the

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:43.180
are and then really sort of push the
 

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.000
are and then really sort of push the
envelope and what what's accepted as

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:45.010
envelope and what what's accepted as
 

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:46.830
envelope and what what's accepted as
this form of scholarly communication so

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:46.840
this form of scholarly communication so
 

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:48.870
this form of scholarly communication so
is this new everyday kind of in-between

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880
is this new everyday kind of in-between
 

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.030
is this new everyday kind of in-between

just things like the question of the
 

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.920
just things like the question of the
relationship between the book that the

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:13.930
relationship between the book that the
 

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:15.570
relationship between the book that the
press is going to publish in print and

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:15.580
press is going to publish in print and
 

00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:17.520
press is going to publish in print and
as an e-book what's the relationship of

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:17.530
as an e-book what's the relationship of
 

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:19.170
as an e-book what's the relationship of
that to the book that appeared in media

will be a different version how are we

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:23.080
will be a different version how are we
 

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:24.630
will be a different version how are we
going to describe those two things and

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640
going to describe those two things and
 

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.460
going to describe those two things and
relate them to each other so it's giving

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:26.470
relate them to each other so it's giving
 

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:29.310
relate them to each other so it's giving
us a lot of sort of examples that we

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:29.320
us a lot of sort of examples that we
 

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.810
us a lot of sort of examples that we
have to work through which is very very

our colleagues are published are working
 

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.859
our colleagues are published are working
on Indy LTS and that's a good example

00:47:24.859 --> 00:47:24.869
on Indy LTS and that's a good example
 

00:47:24.869 --> 00:47:26.930
on Indy LTS and that's a good example
for me that the book reader that they're

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:26.940
for me that the book reader that they're
 

00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:28.400
for me that the book reader that they're
building for this purpose can be used

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:28.410
building for this purpose can be used
 

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:30.319
building for this purpose can be used
for the Arabic materials it can also be

00:47:30.319 --> 00:47:30.329
for the Arabic materials it can also be
 

00:47:30.329 --> 00:47:33.170
for the Arabic materials it can also be
used for the NYU press back list which

backless books including some out of
 

00:47:36.839 --> 00:47:38.299
backless books including some out of
print books and we'll be making those

00:47:38.299 --> 00:47:38.309
print books and we'll be making those
 

00:47:38.309 --> 00:47:41.030
print books and we'll be making those
available online not every book but a

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040
available online not every book but a
 

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.130
available online not every book but a
significant number of them so the

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.140
significant number of them so the
 

00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.450
significant number of them so the
technology that's coming from the

press moving into some new ways and we

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480
press moving into some new ways and we
 

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.020
press moving into some new ways and we
hope it will be relatively seamless so

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:51.030
hope it will be relatively seamless so

so that that big cloud can produce an
enormous amount of potential for us but

enormous amount of potential for us but
 

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:34.579
enormous amount of potential for us but
it also can you know bring in challenges

we hadn't set up ourselves so the
question of scope mission creep is

00:48:41.089 --> 00:48:41.099
question of scope mission creep is
 

00:48:41.099 --> 00:48:45.980
question of scope mission creep is
really critical for us as well so for me

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:45.990
really critical for us as well so for me
 

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:47.359
really critical for us as well so for me
these are the things that we need to do

00:48:47.359 --> 00:48:47.369
these are the things that we need to do
 

00:48:47.369 --> 00:48:50.500
these are the things that we need to do
most effectively next really start to

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:50.510
most effectively next really start to
 

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:52.819
most effectively next really start to
articulate the shared visions and goals

this communicating and preserving
 

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:31.390
this communicating and preserving
because this is where I see the work of

00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:31.400
because this is where I see the work of
 

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.580
because this is where I see the work of
libraries and publishers and I think

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:33.590
libraries and publishers and I think
 

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.350
libraries and publishers and I think
it's interesting that it is located at

00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:35.360
it's interesting that it is located at
 

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:37.810
it's interesting that it is located at
the heart of the academic mission and

00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:37.820
the heart of the academic mission and
 

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:39.070
the heart of the academic mission and
also that they're integrally tied

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:39.080
also that they're integrally tied
 

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:42.370
also that they're integrally tied
together so if this is the work of

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:42.380
together so if this is the work of
 

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.810
together so if this is the work of
expressing the scholarly conversation

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:43.820
expressing the scholarly conversation
 

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:46.330
expressing the scholarly conversation
the great khali conversation happens

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:46.340
the great khali conversation happens
 

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:48.850
the great khali conversation happens
across time in space and that needs to

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:48.860
across time in space and that needs to
 

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.530
across time in space and that needs to
happen through our publishing mechanisms

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:50.540
happen through our publishing mechanisms
 

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.060
happen through our publishing mechanisms
and through our preservation mechanisms

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:52.070
and through our preservation mechanisms
 

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:54.190
and through our preservation mechanisms
which makes the library a really

00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:54.200
which makes the library a really
 

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.190
which makes the library a really
interesting place to bring together the

00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200
interesting place to bring together the
 

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.660
interesting place to bring together the
various publishing components of the

00:51:58.660 --> 00:51:58.670
various publishing components of the
 

00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:05.530
various publishing components of the
university and I think this is important

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:05.540
university and I think this is important
 

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:08.110
university and I think this is important
to consider when we think about the work

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:08.120
to consider when we think about the work
 

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:10.660
to consider when we think about the work
of the university that in essence if we

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:10.670
of the university that in essence if we
 

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:12.460
of the university that in essence if we
don't communicate our scholarship we

00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:12.470
don't communicate our scholarship we
 

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:15.040
don't communicate our scholarship we
might as well not be doing it and the

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:15.050
might as well not be doing it and the
 

00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:17.050
might as well not be doing it and the
Academy really needs to look after the

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:17.060
Academy really needs to look after the
 

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:19.300
Academy really needs to look after the
expression of its work or its work is

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:19.310
expression of its work or its work is
 

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:22.660
expression of its work or its work is
worth nothing and this need was the

00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:22.670
worth nothing and this need was the
 

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:24.340
worth nothing and this need was the
motivation for my library and my

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:24.350
motivation for my library and my
 

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:26.680

that's okay but that what we need to do

00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:56.200
that's okay but that what we need to do
 

00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.440
that's okay but that what we need to do
is to think about how we meet weather

00:59:58.440 --> 00:59:58.450
is to think about how we meet weather
 

00:59:58.450 --> 01:00:01.260
is to think about how we meet weather
weather there we need to do all of those

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:01.270
weather there we need to do all of those
 

01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:04.140
weather there we need to do all of those
things in what cases we need to do those

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:04.150
things in what cases we need to do those
 

01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:09.630
things in what cases we need to do those
things and then how we meet the needs so

01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:09.640
things and then how we meet the needs so
 

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.850
things and then how we meet the needs so
put more simply like what it is is up to

01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:11.860
put more simply like what it is is up to
 

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:24.180
put more simply like what it is is up to
us so I think those of us who are in the

us so I think those of us who are in the
 

01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:26.100

position of creating new kinds of

position of creating new kinds of
 

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:28.190
position of creating new kinds of
publishing mechanisms and in taking

01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.200
publishing mechanisms and in taking
 

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.750

and I think what's interesting is the
 

01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:45.490
and I think what's interesting is the
way in which that we've been able to

01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:45.500
way in which that we've been able to

and I don't and I don't want to to

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:55.850
and I don't and I don't want to to

there's a substantial effort that goes
into defining shaping and communicating

into defining shaping and communicating
 

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.950
into defining shaping and communicating
about that service and because we are

01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:05.960
about that service and because we are
 

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:09.910
about that service and because we are

it seemed like a good thing to do and we

do and what it is that you don't do and
then when you decide you're going to do

01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:43.540
then when you decide you're going to do
 

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.000
then when you decide you're going to do
it what happens after that the whole

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:45.010
it what happens after that the whole
 

01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:47.880
it what happens after that the whole
thing is clear and well-defined and on

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:47.890
thing is clear and well-defined and on
 

01:11:47.890 --> 01:11:49.680
thing is clear and well-defined and on
some level rigid which is why people

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:49.690
some level rigid which is why people
 

01:11:49.690 --> 01:11:52.110
some level rigid which is why people
have been struggling working with a lot

01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:52.120
have been struggling working with a lot
 

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.870
have been struggling working with a lot
of university presses who have rigid

01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880
of university presses who have rigid
 

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.790
of university presses who have rigid
structures because they know how much

01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800
structures because they know how much
 

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.590
structures because they know how much
they cost and how long it takes and that

01:11:58.590 --> 01:11:58.600
they cost and how long it takes and that
 

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.270
they cost and how long it takes and that
that whole process was very very

01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280
that whole process was very very
 

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:02.340
that whole process was very very
comfortable and familiar to me that we

01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:02.350
comfortable and familiar to me that we
 

01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:04.110
comfortable and familiar to me that we
knew what to do and how to do it and we

01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:04.120
knew what to do and how to do it and we
 

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.300
knew what to do and how to do it and we
knew what we didn't do and in library

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:06.310
knew what we didn't do and in library
 

01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:08.670
knew what we didn't do and in library
publishing and in digital technology

01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:08.680
publishing and in digital technology
 

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.830
publishing and in digital technology
projects in general it's very much

01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:10.840
projects in general it's very much
 

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:15.690
projects in general it's very much
harder um they at NYU what we tend to do

01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:15.700
harder um they at NYU what we tend to do
 

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:17.190
harder um they at NYU what we tend to do
is you know if someone's really

01:12:17.190 --> 01:12:17.200
is you know if someone's really
 

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:19.590
is you know if someone's really
advocating for something you know we we

01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600
advocating for something you know we we
 

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.270
advocating for something you know we we
don't have a really form formal

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280
don't have a really form formal
 

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.770
don't have a really form formal
structure yet as you could probably tell

01:12:22.770 --> 01:12:22.780
structure yet as you could probably tell
 

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:24.120
structure yet as you could probably tell
from my slide with all those different

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:24.130
from my slide with all those different
 

01:12:24.130 --> 01:12:26.070
from my slide with all those different
arrows there isn't a hierarchy yet and

01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080
arrows there isn't a hierarchy yet and
 

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.630
arrows there isn't a hierarchy yet and
one of the things I think I need to work

01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:27.640
one of the things I think I need to work
 

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:30.000
one of the things I think I need to work
on is getting a hierarchy in place so we

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:30.010
on is getting a hierarchy in place so we
 

01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:32.880
on is getting a hierarchy in place so we
can start to really assess this big

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:32.890
can start to really assess this big
 

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:34.740
can start to really assess this big
stream of work versus this versus this

01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:34.750
stream of work versus this versus this
 

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:35.790
stream of work versus this versus this
and how are we going to bring it

01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:35.800
and how are we going to bring it
 

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.170
and how are we going to bring it
together we have a lot of the

01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:37.180
together we have a lot of the
 

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.090
together we have a lot of the
charismatic megafauna issue people come

01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:39.100
charismatic megafauna issue people come
 

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:41.060
charismatic megafauna issue people come
in the door with funding or with

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:41.070
in the door with funding or with
 

01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:43.500
in the door with funding or with
reputation or with something super cool

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:43.510
reputation or with something super cool
 

01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:47.130
reputation or with something super cool
and I you know energy gets directed that

01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:47.140
and I you know energy gets directed that
 

01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:49.770
and I you know energy gets directed that
way um but when I first started talking

01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:49.780
way um but when I first started talking
 

01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:51.450
way um but when I first started talking
to them about this job I remember I said

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:51.460
to them about this job I remember I said
 

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:53.130
to them about this job I remember I said
to Steve makowsky who's the director of

01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:53.140
to Steve makowsky who's the director of
 

01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:55.890
to Steve makowsky who's the director of
the press um so how do you think that

01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:55.900
the press um so how do you think that
 

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.450
the press um so how do you think that
dual reports going to work i'll report

01:12:57.450 --> 01:12:57.460
dual reports going to work i'll report
 

01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:59.670
dual reports going to work i'll report
to you and I'll report to Carol and he

01:12:59.670 --> 01:12:59.680
to you and I'll report to Carol and he
 

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.830
to you and I'll report to Carol and he
said yeah and I also report to Carol so

01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:01.840
said yeah and I also report to Carol so
 

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:02.729
said yeah and I also report to Carol so
if there's a really big

01:13:02.729 --> 01:13:02.739
if there's a really big
 

01:13:02.739 --> 01:13:05.370
if there's a really big
disagreement Carol wins and in some way

01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:05.380
disagreement Carol wins and in some way
 

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:06.959
disagreement Carol wins and in some way
i found that comforting a that there

01:13:06.959 --> 01:13:06.969
i found that comforting a that there
 

01:13:06.969 --> 01:13:08.640
i found that comforting a that there
were going to be disagreements and be

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:08.650
were going to be disagreements and be
 

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:09.750
were going to be disagreements and be
that there was going to be you know

01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760
that there was going to be you know
 

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.279
that there was going to be you know
somebody who's going to make the call so

01:13:11.279 --> 01:13:11.289
somebody who's going to make the call so
 

01:13:11.289 --> 01:13:13.319
somebody who's going to make the call so
we're still sort of in that and we don't

01:13:13.319 --> 01:13:13.329
we're still sort of in that and we don't
 

01:13:13.329 --> 01:13:15.239
we're still sort of in that and we don't
have a lot of fights but eventually the

01:13:15.239 --> 01:13:15.249
have a lot of fights but eventually the
 

01:13:15.249 --> 01:13:16.950
have a lot of fights but eventually the
hierarchy does sort of take over and

01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960
hierarchy does sort of take over and
 

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:23.669
hierarchy does sort of take over and
that's you know useful to know oh yeah i

01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:23.679
that's you know useful to know oh yeah i
 

01:13:23.679 --> 01:13:28.310
that's you know useful to know oh yeah i
guess i've been thinking about that

01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320
guess i've been thinking about that
 

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.390
guess i've been thinking about that
hierarchy a bit too and what the

01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400
hierarchy a bit too and what the
 

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.609
hierarchy a bit too and what the
creation of my position did that we

01:13:32.609 --> 01:13:32.619
creation of my position did that we
 

01:13:32.619 --> 01:13:36.330
creation of my position did that we
didn't have before because these units

01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:36.340
didn't have before because these units
 

01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:39.509
didn't have before because these units
did exist before and spent a lot of time

01:13:39.509 --> 01:13:39.519
did exist before and spent a lot of time
 

01:13:39.519 --> 01:13:41.459
did exist before and spent a lot of time
over the course of many years like

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:41.469
over the course of many years like
 

01:13:41.469 --> 01:13:43.279
over the course of many years like
trying to figure out how to how do we

01:13:43.279 --> 01:13:43.289
trying to figure out how to how do we
 

01:13:43.289 --> 01:13:47.250
trying to figure out how to how do we
work together or how can we and always

01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:47.260
work together or how can we and always
 

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:49.520
work together or how can we and always
sort of agreeing that they shared a

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:49.530
sort of agreeing that they shared a
 

01:13:49.530 --> 01:13:51.299
sort of agreeing that they shared a
sense of wanting to advance the

01:13:51.299 --> 01:13:51.309
sense of wanting to advance the
 

01:13:51.309 --> 01:13:53.479
sense of wanting to advance the
scholarly mission and contribute to that

01:13:53.479 --> 01:13:53.489
scholarly mission and contribute to that
 

01:13:53.489 --> 01:13:58.259
scholarly mission and contribute to that
so there is some value in now we have my

01:13:58.259 --> 01:13:58.269
so there is some value in now we have my
 

01:13:58.269 --> 01:13:59.430
so there is some value in now we have my
managers meetings and we all sit down

01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440
managers meetings and we all sit down
 

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:00.720
managers meetings and we all sit down
every two weeks and talk through these

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:00.730
every two weeks and talk through these
 

01:14:00.730 --> 01:14:02.959
every two weeks and talk through these
things and at some point i say okay yes

01:14:02.959 --> 01:14:02.969
things and at some point i say okay yes
 

01:14:02.969 --> 01:14:07.410
things and at some point i say okay yes
so that's that's one way we are putting

01:14:07.410 --> 01:14:07.420
so that's that's one way we are putting
 

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:11.279
so that's that's one way we are putting
in place some other structures for the

01:14:11.279 --> 01:14:11.289
in place some other structures for the
 

01:14:11.289 --> 01:14:13.169
in place some other structures for the
projects that arise sort of out of the

01:14:13.169 --> 01:14:13.179
projects that arise sort of out of the
 

01:14:13.179 --> 01:14:15.450
projects that arise sort of out of the
campus or external organizations that

01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:15.460
campus or external organizations that
 

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.729
campus or external organizations that
want to work with us we have an

01:14:17.729 --> 01:14:17.739
want to work with us we have an
 

01:14:17.739 --> 01:14:20.489
want to work with us we have an
application process in place that has a

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:20.499
application process in place that has a
 

01:14:20.499 --> 01:14:24.149
application process in place that has a
number of criteria partly for it but to

01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159
number of criteria partly for it but to
 

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:26.430
number of criteria partly for it but to
help us assess their readiness to work

01:14:26.430 --> 01:14:26.440
help us assess their readiness to work
 

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.649
help us assess their readiness to work
with us how much have they thought about

01:14:28.649 --> 01:14:28.659
with us how much have they thought about
 

01:14:28.659 --> 01:14:32.939
with us how much have they thought about
this and that also looks at funding and

01:14:32.939 --> 01:14:32.949
this and that also looks at funding and
 

01:14:32.949 --> 01:14:35.580
this and that also looks at funding and
fit with mission from so that gets

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:35.590
fit with mission from so that gets
 

01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:37.649
fit with mission from so that gets
reviewed a couple of times a year but i

01:14:37.649 --> 01:14:37.659
reviewed a couple of times a year but i
 

01:14:37.659 --> 01:14:38.729
reviewed a couple of times a year but i
don't want to pretend that things don't

01:14:38.729 --> 01:14:38.739
don't want to pretend that things don't
 

01:14:38.739 --> 01:14:40.589
don't want to pretend that things don't
trump that and the things that probably

01:14:40.589 --> 01:14:40.599
trump that and the things that probably
 

01:14:40.599 --> 01:14:43.020
trump that and the things that probably
trumpet are a really powerful faculty

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:43.030
trumpet are a really powerful faculty
 

01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:46.049
trumpet are a really powerful faculty
member who may have a funding source who

01:14:46.049 --> 01:14:46.059
member who may have a funding source who
 

01:14:46.059 --> 01:14:49.229
member who may have a funding source who
comes in and says i'm on fire and let's

01:14:49.229 --> 01:14:49.239
comes in and says i'm on fire and let's
 

01:14:49.239 --> 01:14:51.479
comes in and says i'm on fire and let's
do this thing and usually talks to my

01:14:51.479 --> 01:14:51.489
do this thing and usually talks to my
 

01:14:51.489 --> 01:14:53.310
do this thing and usually talks to my
boss the dean of libraries is this is

01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:53.320
boss the dean of libraries is this is
 

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.020
boss the dean of libraries is this is
great how can we support this and then

01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:55.030
great how can we support this and then
 

01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:56.390
great how can we support this and then
you know we figure out how to do that

01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400
you know we figure out how to do that
 

01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:00.689
you know we figure out how to do that
and the other thing because we are do

01:15:00.689 --> 01:15:00.699
and the other thing because we are do
 

01:15:00.699 --> 01:15:02.489
and the other thing because we are do
continue to need to find a lot of our

01:15:02.489 --> 01:15:02.499
continue to need to find a lot of our
 

01:15:02.499 --> 01:15:03.899
continue to need to find a lot of our
activities is that there are things with

01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:03.909
activities is that there are things with
 

01:15:03.909 --> 01:15:06.239
activities is that there are things with
significant revenue opportunities that

01:15:06.239 --> 01:15:06.249
significant revenue opportunities that
 

01:15:06.249 --> 01:15:08.760
significant revenue opportunities that
sort of might get in the mix and

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:08.770
sort of might get in the mix and
 

01:15:08.770 --> 01:15:17.880
sort of might get in the mix and
anyway so no perfect answer I'm really

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:17.890
anyway so no perfect answer I'm really
 

01:15:17.890 --> 01:15:19.080

academic publishing and we know this is
 

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.860
academic publishing and we know this is
not profitable but how you helped the

the market doesn't take care of it

to cover the costs roughly well well I

01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:24.270
to cover the costs roughly well well I
 

01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:25.840
to cover the costs roughly well well I
guess I've had a three-pronged strategy

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:25.850
guess I've had a three-pronged strategy
 

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:29.600
guess I've had a three-pronged strategy
and its ongoing work believe me on this

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:29.610
and its ongoing work believe me on this
 

01:17:29.610 --> 01:17:34.640
and its ongoing work believe me on this
is that I think that publishing doesn't

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:34.650
is that I think that publishing doesn't
 

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.380
is that I think that publishing doesn't
have to cost us as much as it has cost

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:36.390
have to cost us as much as it has cost
 

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:38.810
have to cost us as much as it has cost
us and that we have an opportunity to

01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:38.820
us and that we have an opportunity to
 

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:41.030
us and that we have an opportunity to
constrain those costs and that

01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040
constrain those costs and that
 

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:44.840
constrain those costs and that
technology is useful in that and so that

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:44.850
technology is useful in that and so that
 

01:17:44.850 --> 01:17:46.490
technology is useful in that and so that
it's incumbent upon people who are doing

01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:46.500
it's incumbent upon people who are doing
 

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.990
it's incumbent upon people who are doing
doing the publishing to look for ways to

01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000
doing the publishing to look for ways to
 

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.780
doing the publishing to look for ways to
constrain the cost but that it's also

01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:50.790
constrain the cost but that it's also
 

01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:52.640
constrain the cost but that it's also
incumbent on the institution to

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:52.650
incumbent on the institution to
 

01:17:52.650 --> 01:17:55.670
incumbent on the institution to
recognize that it does cost money and I

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:55.680
recognize that it does cost money and I
 

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.130
recognize that it does cost money and I
think one of the things libraries have

01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:58.140
think one of the things libraries have
 

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:01.070
think one of the things libraries have
been grappling with as those was the

01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080
been grappling with as those was the
 

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.530
been grappling with as those was the
percent 70 70 something percent of

01:18:03.530 --> 01:18:03.540
percent 70 70 something percent of
 

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:05.060
percent 70 70 something percent of
libraries that have started to engage in

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:05.070
libraries that have started to engage in
 

01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:07.400
libraries that have started to engage in
publishing is that it means dedicating

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:07.410
publishing is that it means dedicating
 

01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:10.040
publishing is that it means dedicating
resources and it's usually something

01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:10.050
resources and it's usually something
 

01:18:10.050 --> 01:18:12.050
resources and it's usually something
more than just hiring a person to do

01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:12.060
more than just hiring a person to do
 

01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:13.790
more than just hiring a person to do
some to do some programmatic development

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800
some to do some programmatic development
 

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.770
some to do some programmatic development
that they do have to shift resources

01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:15.780
that they do have to shift resources
 

01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:17.210
that they do have to shift resources
toward that and so libraries have to

01:18:17.210 --> 01:18:17.220
toward that and so libraries have to
 

01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:19.190
toward that and so libraries have to
think about that and then the third part

01:18:19.190 --> 01:18:19.200
think about that and then the third part
 

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.600
think about that and then the third part
is that the institution has to think

01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:20.610
is that the institution has to think
 

01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:22.700
is that the institution has to think
about its responsibility to support the

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:22.710
about its responsibility to support the
 

01:18:22.710 --> 01:18:26.240
about its responsibility to support the
cost of publishing and those of us who

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:26.250
cost of publishing and those of us who
 

01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:27.590
cost of publishing and those of us who
are doing it need to bet make a better

01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600
are doing it need to bet make a better
 

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:27.989
are doing it need to bet make a better

to the institution about why that that's

01:18:29.819 --> 01:18:29.829
to the institution about why that that's
 

01:18:29.829 --> 01:18:31.139
to the institution about why that that's
true and it keep having those

01:18:31.139 --> 01:18:31.149
true and it keep having those
 

01:18:31.149 --> 01:18:32.939
true and it keep having those
conversations so that for me that's the

01:18:32.939 --> 01:18:32.949
conversations so that for me that's the
 

01:18:32.949 --> 01:18:34.829
conversations so that for me that's the
kind of long-term answers like we work

01:18:34.829 --> 01:18:34.839
kind of long-term answers like we work
 

01:18:34.839 --> 01:18:37.919
kind of long-term answers like we work
on all three parts of that and then we

01:18:37.919 --> 01:18:37.929
on all three parts of that and then we
 

01:18:37.929 --> 01:18:39.629
on all three parts of that and then we
might get to a healthier more

01:18:39.629 --> 01:18:39.639
might get to a healthier more
 

01:18:39.639 --> 01:18:43.379
might get to a healthier more
