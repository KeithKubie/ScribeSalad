Speaker 1:          00:00          Our mistakes are nothing new or startling.

Speaker 2:          00:03          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:06          think about that. Most of the time, most of the time, think about this. Most of the time when you make a mistake, it's something that you already knew. You actually know you're making the mistake when you're making it.

Speaker 2:          00:21          Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:23          Here's another thing he says, errors spell the difference between professionalism and mediocrity. It's the little things. It's the little mistakes that you make. Next thing he thinks says discipline soldiers are the main ingredient in victory. Well, guess what? The main ingredient in victory in your life is discipline. Yeah. All Day. All Day. He says there's no magic formula or sweat list's solution by which one can achieve their goals. I think he just said, there is no, there is no shortcut. There is no hack. There's no sweat list solution. You, you're gone. I have to work. Then he says this, no military unit is ever completely trained. Guess what? Neither are you. Neither am I. There is always weakness to work on. Always a lot of them.

Speaker 2:          01:25          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          01:28          He says this in Vietnam, primer combat is too serious of business to permit. Easy excuse of even one mistake.

Speaker 2:          01:35          Okay?

Speaker 1:          01:38          Now think about this. Okay? Comments, too serious of business. Why is that? It's cause you can die. But guess what? We're all going to die. We're all going to die. So why would we, why would we allow ourselves to make easy, easy excuses? Why would you allow that? Hmm? Combat is life and death. So is life so you shouldn't allow yourself these easy excuses. And in the last section that he, that he talks about that I read, it can absolutely be applied. It can absolutely, absolutely be applied. He says another weakness, common among junior leaders is the inaccurate reporting of the estimate of the situation. They are either so exaggerated or Wolff so watered down that they are not meaningful.

Speaker 2:          02:36          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          02:38          Now again, if you apply this to yourself, what you realize

Speaker 2:          02:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:44          is that you got these junior leaders that they're lying to the chain of command. I mean they're, they're exaggerating or they're watering things down, but they're basically lying to the chain of command. And how does that translate to us? We lie to ourselves.

Speaker 2:          02:56          Mm.

Speaker 1:          02:57          That's how it translates to us. Lie to ourselves. We don't tell ourselves the way things really are and when we do that, then we can't fix our problems. If we can't fix our problems, we're not going to improve. So we have to be truthful to ourselves.

Speaker 2:          03:14          Okay?

Speaker 1:          03:14          I have to be truthful to myself. You have to be truthful to yourself. You have to stop rationalizing, stop making excuses. Stop telling yourself little water down the assessments of where you're really at, telling yourself the truth so that you can get where you want to go. You can be who you want to be. You can be who you should be, who you should be. When you do what you know you should do. When you pay attention to the little things, when you implement discipline, true and unflinching and on mitigated discipline in your life. When you stop, when you stop trying to find a sweat list solution, when you look for weaknesses to work on, when you allow no easy excuses and all that starts, when you stop lying to yourself, can you stop lying to yourself? That's when you can be calm, who you know you should be. When you tell yourself the truth about where you are so you can make sure you are in the right place, and if you're not in the right place, that you can get yourself on the path to get there. The path of discipline, the path of hard work, and the path of truth.
