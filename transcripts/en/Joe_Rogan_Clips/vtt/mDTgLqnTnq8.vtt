00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.600
The Joe Rogan experience,
you know,
on stage.

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.120
Did you have like an idol if somebody were trying to be as a stand up?

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.940
Um,
like in the pianos are probably a bunch of guys.
I sounded a lot like Richard,

4
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:14.520
Jenny in the beginning I was kind of stealing,

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.610
like almost stealing his timing and then I realized that one time,

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.970
one time I was on stage and I heard myself sound like him and I was like,

7
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.520
all right,
I gotta fix this.
Yeah.
You know,
I did that with a,

8
00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:27.140
with David towl in New York.
Why would I did to tell,

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.150
I would run downstairs and watch it at tell set and then one day I caught myself

10
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.550
not doing one of his bits,
but like one of his mannerism kind of things.
Yeah.

11
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.390
It's just fun to do.
And I felt,
I was like,
I gotta stop this.

12
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.660
And I went and told SD a,
the woman,
the books,
the comedy cellar.
I was like,

13
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:44.310
I got to stop watching David towl.

14
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:47.130
And I said it like a confessional and I thought she was going to be like,

15
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.610
you're not a real comic.
Then everyone watches the talent.
She goes good,

16
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.510
like more people should stop watching David towl people are just ripping them

17
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:56.480
off and I understand why,
but uh,

18
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.880
he's got such a bizarre sense of timing and then it's so infectious.

19
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.670
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Just so,
so fun.
So fun to watch.

20
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.090
I've known Dave for like 28 years I think,

21
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.070
and he's always been like that.
He's always had that very strange way of talking.

22
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:16.500
Yeah.
You know?
Oh,
it's a box.

23
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.360
I've known him maybe 10 years and I don't know him at all.
You know what I mean?

24
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.050
Like we've like talked a couple of times,

25
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:24.700
but I don't know anything about the guy.
Yeah.

26
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.500
And I think I met him after he had quit drinking,
so I think it was a different,

27
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:33.480
uh,
oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
I knew him in the heart when he was on that show.

28
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.510
Insomniacs and he was getting blasted out of his gourd every night.

29
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.300
Every night he was going to these places and it was killing him.
Yeah.

30
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.370
And he stopped doing the show for that very reason,

31
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:47.730
because everywhere he would go,
it would just be shots,
shots,
shots,

32
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.970
and uh,
and then he,
uh,

33
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:54.840
one time I ran into him at the Improv and it was like one o'clock in the morning

34
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:57.960
and I was headed home.
And he's like,
Hey,
is there an after party?
Where did we go?

35
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.710
I was like,
where do we go?
Like,
go home,
go to sleep.
Yeah.

36
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.090
And then the next time I saw him,
he was totally sober.

37
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.010
He's one of those guys though that got sober and didn't stop being hilarious.
No,

38
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.930
a lot of guys do.
Yeah.
