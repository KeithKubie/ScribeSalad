00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.470
Let's do a few more examples
with the ideal gas equation.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.650
So we have pressure times volume
is equal to the number

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.480
of molecules we have in moles
times the ideal gas constant

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.365
times temperature in Kelvin.

00:00:15.365 --> 00:00:18.550
And I just got a comment on one
of the videos saying it

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.800
made sense except for the fact
that R seems kind of like this

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.680
mysterious thing in here.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.840
And the way you think about R--
let me rearrange this a

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.130
little bit.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.880
Let me write it as pressure
times volume is

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.560
equal to R times nT.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.365
So we've established, or
hopefully we've established,

00:00:35.365 --> 00:00:38.100
the intuition that the pressure
times the volume

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.590
should be proportional to
essentially the total energy

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.900
we have in the system.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.580
Temperature is average energy,
or energy per molecule, and

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.620
this is the total number
molecules we had.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.040
What R is, the ideal gas
constant is, when you multiply

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.670
moles times Kelvin, you
get mole Kelvin.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.310
And with pressure times volume,
it's force per area

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.130
times the volume.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.100
You get force times distance,
or force times one dimension

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.970
of distance, which is joules,
so this is in joules.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.320
So what the ideal gas constant
essentially does is it

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.630
converts-- we know that this is
proportional to this, but

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.710
it sets the exact constant of
proportionality and it also

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.010
makes sure we get the units
right, so that's all it is.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.540
It just helps us translate
from a world dealing with

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.270
moles and Kelvins to a world of
dealing with, well, in this

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.490
case, atmospheres and liters,
or bars and meters cubed, or

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.950
kilopascals and meters cubed.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.660
But no matter what the units of
the pressure and the volume

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.940
are, the whole unit of pressure
times volume is going

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.940
to be joules.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.010
So it's just a translation
between the two and we know

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.550
that they're proportional.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.720
Now, with that said, let's
do some more problems.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.520
So let's say we want to know
how many grams of oxygen.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.040
So we want to know
grams of O2.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:10.250
So how many grams of O2 are in
a 300-milliliter container

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.750
that has a pressure of 12
atmospheres and the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.125
temperature is 10
degrees Celsius?

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.330
Well, we've already broken out
our ideal gas equation.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.350
Let's see, pressure
is 12 atmospheres.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.370
So we can say 12.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.690
I'll keep the units there.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.840
12 atmospheres times
the volume.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.310
The volume should be in
liters, so this is 300

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.330
milliliters, or 300 thousandths
or 3 tenths.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.435
So that's 0.3 liters.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.070
300 one thousandths of a
liter is 0.3 liters.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.820
And that is equal to the number
of moles we have of

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.170
this, and that's what we
need to figure out.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.180
If we know the number of moles,
we know the number of

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.360
grams. So this is equal
to n times R.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.860
Now which R should we use?

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.610
We're dealing with liters
and atmospheres.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.860
We'll deal with this one.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.260
Liters, atmospheres,
mole-Kelvin, 0.082.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.380
Times 0.082.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.420
And what's our temperature?

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.990
It's 10 degrees Celsius.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.000
We always have to do everything
in Kelvin.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.680
So it's 283 degrees Kelvin.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.200
So all we have to
solve for is n.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.760
We just have to divide both
sides of this equation by this

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.470
right here, and so we have n is
equal to 12 atmospheres--

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.680
I'm just swapping the sides--
times 0.3 liters divided by

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.080
0.082 times 283 degrees.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.900
Our answer will be in moles.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.280
And if you want to verify that,
you can plug in all the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.470
units and use units for the
ideal gas constant.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.930
The number of moles we're
dealing with, so it's 12 times

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:11.860
0.3 divided by 0.082
divided by 283 is

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:23.020
equal to 0.155 moles.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:31.340
Now how many grams are in one
mole of an oxygen molecule?

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:39.610
So one mole of O2, well, we
know oxygen's atomic mass.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.770
It's 16.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.540
One molecule of oxygen, of
gaseous oxygen, has two atoms

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.930
in it, so it has an
atomic mass of 32.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.460
So it's molar mass, it's mass
per mole, is going to be 32

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.660
grams.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.680
Now we don't have one mole.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.130
We have 0.155 moles.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.950
So to figure out how many grams
we have, we multiply 32

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:21.690
grams per mole times
0.155 moles, and

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.310
we'll get our answer.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.550
So let's do that.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:35.990
So we have 32 times 0.155 is
equal to 4.96 grams, or

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:42.730
roughly 5 grams. So we have
approximately 5 grams of

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.970
molecular oxygen.
