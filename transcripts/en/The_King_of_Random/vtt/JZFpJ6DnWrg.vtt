00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.300
If we dumped a recording Go Pro

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.580
into a container of liquid nitrogen

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.120
how long do you think it would keep recording

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.980
before it freezes up and shuts down.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.500
I just got back from the store where i picked up a couple of go pros

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.220
I got the Hero 5 Black as well as the Hero 5 Session

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.240
This one cost me about $400 And if it survives this torture trail Im gonna give it to one of you

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.580
This one here is the Hero 5 Black

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.700
It records 12 megapixles and also shoots in 4K

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.560
Another cool feature is its got a LCD screen on the back so you can actually see what your recording as you do it.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.640
Thats a nice feature to have

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.640
This one here is the new Hero 5 Sesssion

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.020
Shoots in 10 Megapixels and 5K

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.680
Which my old one only shoots in 1080

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.880
And this one has a built stabilizer as well so as your hand holding it

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.680
it helps balance out some of the footage.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.580
So might be a good idea to start off with my older Go Pro

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.880
to see if this is even a viable idea

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.240
Because I don't want to waste new technology unnecessarily

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.700
We just filled up our container with liquid nitrogen

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.700
You can see this thing is extremely frosty and ready to go

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.520
So lets throw this thing in the tongs, get it recording

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.820
Then give it its cryogenic bath that its destine to take

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.580
So We've got this set up on blue tooth

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.280
right now I'm actually doing a screen record of what we're seing here on the Go Pro

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.280
That way if this Freezes up, we'll still the backup footage on my cellphone

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.800
Hey Guys, ready to go?

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.600
Here are the tongss,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.240
And lets just go ahead and dip this in for maybe like 5 seconds  and see if it survives

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.120
Okay, we are confirmed recording

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.720
Its time to dip.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.540
And apparently it looks like its still recording

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.160
And over here you can see, Yup we're stilling getting the Bluetooth feed.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.400
So thats really cool.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.520
Oh thats really cool, we got a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.340
Phone with in a Phone with in a phone with in a phone

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.920
Thats Phoneception

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.560
So very cool, Our go pro survived the first 5 seconds

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.760
I didn't really have and doubt that it would because it didn't really cool down to much

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.500
So this time lets push the boundary, lets fully submerge it and just leave it in there until the nitrogen cools it down completely

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.440
Im a little bit nervous about this one because we might loose the footage

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.020
but thats a risk im willing to take

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.080
There we go.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.520
It is fully submerged and all you can see now is this little red flashing light at the bottom of the container.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.540
Now the reason its bubbling so profusely is because the Hero is cooling down

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.060
And releasing all that heat

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.180
As the nitrogen bubbles start to flatten out that means our hero session will of cooled down completely

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.960
And if you look over here at the camera

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.340
this is the view that our cameras haivng right now

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.560
and its still recording

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.320
The red light's still flashing. We're into it about 25 seconds now

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.800
And its still going

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.580
That red light

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.700
Oh there it goes! Camera low battery

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.960
So we just got a low battery warning

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.860
I no longer see the red light flashing but i do see

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.340
its still recording through the Bluetooth feed

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.340
But this is actually really impressive, i didnt expect it to go this long

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.880
We just got like a triple flash there, the camera just turned off.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.220
I cant tell if the camera turned its self off just because it had a low battery warning

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.500
Or it was the nitrogen that froze it solid

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.840
That was maybe really bad timing and i probably should of charged this before hand

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.040
But based on these results I think i am willing to experiment  with the new cameras and put them through

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.980
the same experiments and see what kind of results we get with them

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.040
Im really curious to know if we saved the footage or not.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.060
Haha.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.560
Woooow

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.320
It is Suuuper cold

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.740
But you know what, it looks in great shape, ohh it just frostbit me

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.280
Imma set it there, woah the back plate just came off

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.180
Hey, ever wondered whats inside a go pro?

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.980
I gotta put that down tho because its like frost biting my fingertips

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.880
That is really really cold guys

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.940
Its actually so cold that its condensing the moisture out of the air

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.959
That we're getting frost build up all around and if I breathe on

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.670
it we can just accelerate that effect

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.840
and that is how you get yourself a

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.940
custom white GoPro okay so we got the

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.620
hero five session we got it hooked up to

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.819
my phone and we got our nitrogen

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.040
replenished we're going to sink this one

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.680
in and just let it run until it freezes

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.300
completely the battery is charged so we

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.500
shouldn't have any connection issues

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.299
with the battery and it's currently

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.459
recording so let's plunge this down into

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.040
liquid nitrogen and see what happens

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.840
Hero 5 session let's make it happen

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.950
look at how the nitrogen just bubbles on

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:15.940
the glass there I'm just going to leave

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.079
that there for a second because that's

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:26.670
kind of cool still recording so far and

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.630
all the way in cool now we're just going

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.610
to let that saute for about one and a

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.680
half to two minutes and when that stops

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.840
boiling the GoPro should be about the

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.180
same temperatures the liquid nitrogen

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.370
we're into at about 35 seconds now and

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.870
everything's going strong the picture

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.940
still looks clear on the bluetooth it's

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.620
actually amazing to me that it can still

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.510
transmit bluetooth wirelessly at those

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.970
temperatures it looks like it's starting

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.630
to glitch out a little bit oh yeah

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.640
camera just turned off at least it

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.020
disconnected from the phone but the

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.880
lights still flashing in there so it

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.470
looks like the GoPro is probably still

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.960
recording there's like some little black

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.780
junk floating around in there oh there

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.770
goes the GoPro just shut off so it looks

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.300
like these things can handle about 60

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.250
seconds in liquid nitrogen before they

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.169
automatically power down if you look

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.310
straight down on it it kind of looks

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.710
like a creepy eyeball this has been

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.120
sitting in there for about five minutes

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.620
let's go ahead and fish it out and take

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.440
a look at the damage there we go that

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.340
thing is cold watch closely what happens

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.479
when I breathe on it gently

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.780
you can literally see the moisture from

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.140
my breath condensing oh and it looks

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.780
like we lost the back panel. the back panel fell right off

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.030
oh and the buttons still

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.030
in there that right there is our button

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.880
so hopefully when that heats backup will

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.530
be able to pop that back together so

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.180
cool while that's thawing out let's go

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.830
ahead and torture test the hero five

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.540
black will leave this thing recording

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.430
until it shuts down all right let's go

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:18.060
for a nitrogen dip so far so good let's

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.530
give it about another five seconds here

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.510
oh look at that the crystals in the LCD

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.150
are actually freezing up see even though

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.620
I'm moving the camera around it's not

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.590
creating an image that is stationary so

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.020
we may have just fried the LCD we're

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.430
pushing 45 seconds now and I just heard

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.979
the camera shutting down it stopped

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:44.760
recording LCD screen is still on so

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.960
let's just go ahead and leave that and

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.510
see how long they'll sit before the LCD

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.310
screen shuts off again oh and check this

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.830
GoPro out this has just got completely

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.880
frosty what we've been waiting that's

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.930
insane frosty the GoPro ok so the LCD

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.030
screen has turned off again can I touch

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.040
it to make it come back on let's find

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.960
out ok it's gone completely unresponsive

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.940
and you see how that just frost over instantly

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.520
instantly the second it touches the air

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.810
all right so I think this one is cooked

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.510
let's go ahead and set that to the side

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.280
so there was a glass lens here and

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.690
that's popped off it looks like the

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.030
inner lens is still ok we may have to

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.860
fish off that glass lens let me grab

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.470
that really quick all right cool that's

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.330
really cold it looks like it was held on

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.860
with some kind of adhesive that probably

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.870
just got so cold and cracked away when

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.270
that warms up we may be able to just

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.160
push it back into place but you can see

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.720
this inner lens looks like it's probably

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.310
going to be just fine it was just this

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.110
protective lens that popped off right

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.210
now it's probably about minus 300

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.590
degrees Fahrenheit it's starting to warm

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.300
up just a little bit if we open the

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.660
battery compartment

00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:50.559
her battery is still in there looks like

00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:55.509
it's in pretty good shape oh okay so

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:57.369
that's not coming out I will just leave

00:07:57.369 --> 00:07:59.169
that in there it seems that when the SD

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:01.509
card gets too cold the ejecting

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:02.830
mechanism doesn't work so we're gonna

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.689
have to let that warm back up and then

00:08:04.689 --> 00:08:06.039
we'll see if we got any good footage

00:08:06.039 --> 00:08:07.959
from it you can see the hero session

00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:09.729
pops apart into three pieces we got the

00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:12.009
button and the backplate and then we got

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:14.279
this little sensor this moisture sensor

00:08:14.279 --> 00:08:16.360
it'll be interesting to see if that gets

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.219
triggered because it was just nitrogen

00:08:18.219 --> 00:08:20.499
so it shouldn't do whatever it does when

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:22.089
i get stricken you can see those came

00:08:22.089 --> 00:08:24.459
out pretty dang frosty will give those

00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:26.379
about 25 minutes to warm back up and

00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:28.360
then pull the SD cards and see if we can

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.699
recover any of that footage so update

00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:32.349
guys it's a day later now and these

00:08:32.349 --> 00:08:33.459
things have sat out all night and

00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:35.110
completely acclimated back to room

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.940
temperature it took about an hour for

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.349
them to completely defrost and

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:40.839
unfortunately we lost all the data we

00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:42.399
kept getting error messages saying the

00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:44.649
SD cards were corrupted so none of the

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:46.420
footage that we got with the GoPros was

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.579
salvageable unfortunately so here's our

00:08:48.579 --> 00:08:50.649
hero five black and here's our hero five

00:08:50.649 --> 00:08:53.500
session so let's see if we can replace

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.079
the button and just pop that back panel

00:08:56.079 --> 00:08:59.139
back in place so it looks like it's just

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:01.329
held on by adhesive nothing really snaps

00:09:01.329 --> 00:09:03.160
into place there which is kind of

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.470
surprising so apparently we got that

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.480
adhesive so cold that it just froze up

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.040
and then when this metal panel shrunk

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.779
that's what caused it to pop off the

00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:12.790
back so now that's warmed up hopefully

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.610
that will stay in place the LCD display

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.139
looks completely normal if we press the

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:20.199
button it looks like we can even get it

00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:23.410
recording what's up welcome back from

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.509
your cryogenic bath so our hero five

00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:27.519
sessions survived it looks like works in

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:28.750
perfect conditions so I'll probably be

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.639
using this for future videos let's check

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:32.259
out the hero five black and see how it

00:09:32.259 --> 00:09:34.180
held up now the first damage we notice

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.740
obviously is this protective screen

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.389
popped off so it's obviously not

00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:39.670
waterproof right now this Ridge right

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:42.100
here is tacky though and now that it's

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.449
warm back up we might be able to clean

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:45.670
that lens off clean this piece of glass

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:46.640
and put it back

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.400
together so let's find some microfiber

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.140
cloth and see if we can restore it to

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.240
its original condition I am curious to

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.980
know if the LCD screen survived because

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.600
when we were doing our test if it froze

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.300
the image and I almost look like it

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.530
destroyed it so it'll be interesting to

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.300
see if that comes back on so this

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.220
display I noticed that there is like a

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.590
small crack it look like a hair at first

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:08.540
but I think it actually is a crack and

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.190
there definitely is something in there

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.380
between the layers of the screen so

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.840
that's not optimal however if we can

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.360
turn this thing on okay actually the LCD

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.040
screen on the front is still working

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.780
that definitely is some kind of a

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.600
fracture or crack because I can see it

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.010
is raised up underneath the surface

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.050
there and there is some discoloration in

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.270
the screen it's still usable it's just

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.760
not perfect and we've got an SD card

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.430
error but look at this the LCD screen is

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.410
actually still working and apparently

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:37.730
it's working very well that's still in

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.730
really good condition this blows my mind

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.440
because that was frozen solid you guys

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.050
saw the image was not moving I'm really

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.190
impressed that that came back to such

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:53.120
clarity how cool this is cool the glass

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.310
didn't crack or anything so as long as

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.510
we can clean this up and put it back

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.070
together it should be in pretty good

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.600
shape all right that's looking good

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.060
in place and hopefully with a little bit

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.860
of pressure we can get that adhesive to

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.170
grab back on I wonder if this voids the

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.680
warranty cool the screen is replaced it

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.339
actually looks like it's back in there

00:11:14.339 --> 00:11:17.920
nice and tight sweet so this is the hero

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.990
five black I just put a new SD card in

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.670
and it was working perfectly so there

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:22.750
you have it guys now you know what

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.699
happens when you soak a GoPro in liquid

00:11:24.699 --> 00:11:26.980
nitrogen they are surprisingly resilient

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.480
I had no idea that they'd hold up that

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.069
well so I threw these things back in

00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:31.420
their packaging and they're almost as

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.009
good as new they're fully functioning

00:11:33.009 --> 00:11:34.449
they work great and so I'm going to pick

00:11:34.449 --> 00:11:36.339
two of you and give these things away so

00:11:36.339 --> 00:11:37.269
