00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.920
So we talked about how the internet satisfies

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.440
the goals of sharing and interconnection and now

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.560
let's talk about some of the other goals

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.610
that are discussed in the DARPA Design Philosophy

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.730
Paper. As we discuss some of these other

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.750
goals it's worth considering and thinking about how

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.970
well the current internet satisfies these other design

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.660
goals in the face of evolving application threats and

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.930
other challenges. One of the goals discussed is survivability,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.970
which states that network should continue to work if

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.230
even some device is fail, are comprised, and so

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.760
forth. There are two ways to achieve survivability. One is

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.710
to replicate. So one could keep state at multiple

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.470
places in the network, such that when any node

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.130
crashes there's always a replica or hot standby waiting

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.930
to take over for the failure. Another way to design

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.130
the network for survivability is to incorporate a

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.690
concept called fate sharing. Fate sharing says that

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.720
it's acceptable to lose state information for some

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.190
entity, if that entity itself is lost. For example,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.960
if a router crashes all of the state on the router, such as the routing tables,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.300
are lost. If we can design the network

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.720
to sustain these types of failures, where the state

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.650
of a particular device shares the fate

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.540
of the device itself, then we can withstand

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.950
failures better. So fate sharing makes it easier

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.620
to withstand complex failure scenarios and engineering is

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.300
also easier. Now it's worth asking whether

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.130
the current internet still satisfies the principle of

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.090
fate sharing. In a subsequent lesson, we'll talk

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.520
about network address translation and how it violates

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.330
the notion of fate sharing. There are other examples where the

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.160
current internet's design violates fate sharing

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.100
and it's worth thinking about those.
