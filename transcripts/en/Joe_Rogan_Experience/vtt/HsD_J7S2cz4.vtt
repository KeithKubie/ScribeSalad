00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.070
Do Do,
do,
do,
do,
do,
do

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.160
[inaudible] could see your breath to see your brother.
How are you?
Good man.
Um,

3
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:11.400
the charcoal,
it's you.
That's me.
I sent Santinello picture.

4
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:14.310
I'll send it to you Jamie.
You've seen it so fucking funny.

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.020
I want residuals on that shit.
What is it called?
Lucky Dev or bro,
it you,
it's,

6
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.640
that's a cue with a steak.
Devil something.
I put it up online.
I was like,

7
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:26.970
this is so fucking funny.
This is me with my own charcoal company called,
uh,

8
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.540
if you're in the market for some charcoal man.
Oh,
jealous devil.

9
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.340
That's what it is.
That's so big.

10
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.480
That veered fucking steak down there with a,
with a knife.

11
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.350
Jealous Devil Barbecue is the only truly manly way of cooking.

12
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.070
Like nobody brags about having a Baker's hat on.
Yeah,
there,
there is.
There it is.

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.960
All natural hardwood,
hardwood,
charcoal.

14
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.120
There is nothing you can do.
The uh,
do you smoke?

15
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.190
You smoke or just just use a trigger.

16
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.540
You know what that is not like a pellet grill.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Right?
Yeah.
Shit,

17
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:03.660
man,
they're so easy.
And did you finish in a skillet or no?
Yeah.

18
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.460
That's the way to go.
Right,
baby with beef tallow.
Ooh,
what does that,

19
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:13.080
what does that,
and you know what else I use?
Huh?
Minced garlic and rosemary.

20
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.970
I put rosemary in the,

21
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.620
in the cast iron skillet with the beef tallow.
It's like an extra,

22
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.010
an extra,
I learned that in a tie in restaurant.
I was going to say,

23
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.110
are you guys doing?
And he's like,
we use a rosemary,
rosemary,
rosemary,

24
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.880
Rosemary.
It's a wonderful Maria.
Bye.
If I go to an Italian restaurant.

25
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.180
That dude talks like that.
I am excited.
I'm stoked.
I'm more pumped.
Yeah.

26
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.890
It's just a regular person.
Even if they're nice,
I'm disappointed.
Yeah.

27
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.440
It's like the nicest waiter ever.
I'm like,
dude,
you seem like a great guy,

28
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:51.000
but damn,
I wish you were from Italy and Freddy Cine Alfredo.
You're like,
Hey,

29
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.640
you ready from Italy back there,
man.
You Malibu.
Fuck,

30
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.391
that's a weird one.
Right?

31
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:00.660
It's like Italian restaurants particularly like I go to a Greek restaurant.

32
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:03.060
I would hope that guy would not have an accent.
I don't,
yeah,

33
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.850
we don't need them to,

34
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.850
I wouldn't care if he could race as long as I can understand them.
That's great.

35
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.650
But I don't require it,
but I required at an Italian restaurant.
Yeah.

36
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.300
Cause it's just,
there's something about it that's different.

37
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:13.890
And then everywhere else Mexican,
you know what I mean?

38
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.680
Everything else was Mexicans,
Chinese chained by Mexicans,

39
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:20.580
Chinese maybe by Mexican,
Mexican or Mexican people in making Chinese food.

40
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.330
It's always one of those weird things you're like,
Huh,
okay.

41
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.440
Is this gonna it's just gonna measure up though.
Like at those,
um,
you know those,

42
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.850
those chain places,
those Chandon which called pf Chang's,

43
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.630
not pf Changs is not as much.
That's like a restaurant.
You order it,

44
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.520
it's pf Changs is pretty fucking good.
But that's all Mexicans cooking that shit.

45
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.410
There's no like Chinese guy greets you.
They're talking time for a second.

46
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.930
Have you ever been to a Buka to Beto?
Like,
oh,
am I going to college?

47
00:02:48.931 --> 00:02:53.931
That was my job as and pookah Bebo if you want like straight up filling old

48
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:58.290
school Italian food,
it's so much,
Bro.
They will hook you up.

49
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.310
They try to fucking kill you.
Wait a minute.

50
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.150
Book booking tobacco is the Chinese food of Italian places.

51
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:04.601
Do you know what I mean?

52
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:08.600
Like how Chinese place to give you way too much food but eat buffet 50 pounds a

53
00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:10.460
fucking pasta when you're gonna book book book in a bubble,

54
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.170
they bring that aluminum 10 out with the Rigatoni and you're like,

55
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:19.171
who the fuck are you for a full fucking kingdom and your servants?

56
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.540
Listen,
this is silly.
Yeah,
it's absurd.

57
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.380
Turning me into an asshole and that's also Rigatoni like that kind of food.

58
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:29.350
You keep going,
you can go on even when it hurts,

59
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.630
you don't stop like that carb when that,

60
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.780
when you're hitting like a good linguine with clams like Ah,

61
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.100
why you're eating.
It's so gluttonous.
Chill.

62
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.460
We go,
that has no nutritional value is going into your stomach.
Like,
oh,

63
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:46.660
it's so good.

64
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.990
You can't wait for more mixed in with some sauce to give the illusion of

65
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:53.910
healthiness.
Oh,
there's green,

66
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.720
little bit of green on it and you just like when your body is trying to process

67
00:03:58.721 --> 00:03:59.554
it afterwards like,

68
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.000
Oh you feel fucked up sometimes when you eat too much pasta you feel like drunk

69
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.060
actually like stoned or drunk cause I'm broken.

70
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.120
My Body's just like all your resources planning all that shit down.

71
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.010
So fucking gross.
Good.

72
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.620
<v 1>Everybody remembers from like time we were kids.</v>

73
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.830
Apparently someone told me that you don't get a significant enough amount of

74
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:22.540
trip to fan from Turkey for it to put you to sleep.

75
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.860
<v 0>Yeah,
I've heard it's bullshit.
I want to know if that's true though.
That's true.</v>

76
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.710
So I've been told that there is tripped if there's always tripped to fan that's

77
00:04:28.711 --> 00:04:30.930
been in Turkey.
But uh,
the,

78
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.380
the running joke is that after Thanksgiving dinner you pass out,

79
00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:36.210
but it's actually because of all the other shit you're eating.

80
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.930
Fucking mashed potatoes on the carbs.
A fucking Brit.
Hawaiian bread rolls car.

81
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.160
<v 1>Yeah.
Contrary to popular belief,</v>

82
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.060
eating Turkey isn't the main reason you feel sleepy after Thanksgiving feast.

83
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.750
The oft repeated Turkey myths stems from the fact that Turkey contains an amino

84
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:54.250
acid trip to fan,
which forms the basis of brain chemicals to make people tired.

85
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:55.084
But it's not true

86
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.610
<v 0>but it's not.
I mean it does but it's not the thing that knocks you out.</v>

87
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.700
Being a fat fucking sitting on your couch and drinking 40 beers is what makes

88
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:01.534
you sleepy.

89
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.430
<v 1>Yeah,
so it says trip to fan is component of the brain.</v>

90
00:05:04.431 --> 00:05:08.120
Chemical Serotonin would get converted into the well known sleep inducing

91
00:05:08.121 --> 00:05:08.601
hormone,

92
00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:13.601
Melatonin and poultry and many other foods also contain trip to fan.

93
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.850
Chickens got similar amounts.
Yup.
Gram per gram.

94
00:05:16.851 --> 00:05:19.610
Cheddar cheese actually contains more trip to fan than Turkey does

95
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.290
<v 0>suck on net cheese heads.
Yeah.
Cheese folks.</v>

96
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.420
It's just being a glutten man.
He's just become a fat piece of shit in the hall.

97
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.930
You just feel like you're supposed to keep

98
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.380
<v 1>eating and eating and eating.</v>

99
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.230
There's an interview with Katt Williams is sitting in the back of a limo.

100
00:05:33.231 --> 00:05:37.190
I talked about this with ms pat or he talked about not eating before shows and I

101
00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:41.930
was like,
he's right.
Like why would I eat before shows and it made me realize,

102
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.860
oh even before shows is a terrible idea because anybody's got to process all

103
00:05:45.861 --> 00:05:47.290
that and you'd come out.
Yeah,
calf

104
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.663
<v 0>asked.
We don't know.</v>

105
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.740
We never eat before shows and we do shows we never eat before.

106
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:53.140
Shows after shows is actually when it tastes the fucking best.

107
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.050
I'll have some fruit,
I'll have a little bit of fruit before a show.

108
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.190
I have a little something like a little baby thing.

109
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.830
<v 2>I don't mind some fruit cause you have some fruit.</v>

110
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.580
It's like you're getting some carbohydrates are getting some sugar,

111
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:09.320
you're getting some fiber.
It's super easy to digest like melon and a melon.

112
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.940
Your buys just,
you could lift,

113
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.050
you could to eat melon and then do a sick kettlebell workout.

114
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.990
Like it's not going to fuck.
You know like melons,

115
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.140
easy to little baby sugar rush to that probably helps your energy a little bit.

116
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.921
Your body just,

117
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:25.610
you mash it into mush so quick and it just goes sliding down there.

118
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.530
Your body's like,
oh we got this.
We should do though.

119
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.880
We should do the tired tour where we just eat a huge meal before we get on stage

120
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:33.830
and see what,
see what comes out of that fucking shit.

121
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.230
Compare Mellon to like a stromboli like one of those ridiculous fucking sausage

122
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:47.921
and she is with the layers but the bread and the cheese is burnt at top.

123
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.610
You know they burn it on the towel and you,

124
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:52.960
you take a couple of bites of that and just like aw.

125
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:54.920
And he just keep going.

126
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.990
But if you looked at like the size of what you would eat in one of those mother

127
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.090
fall design,
the boop boop.
The Bible is to lay layers and layers.

128
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.630
We fucking got it.
That will take you down son.

129
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:09.380
You ain't doing no fucking crosswords after that.
Cheese,
pasta,
cheese,
pasta,

130
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.900
pasta,
cheese.
Sit the fuck down.
This more cheese coming.

131
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.700
You ain't play no puzzles bitch.

132
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.970
That I would run at the brain activity slows down so much more.

133
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.430
Like I wonder what the at the active level of brain activity is when your

134
00:07:19.431 --> 00:07:23.480
stomach,
oh yeah,
you're useless.
I feel like a fucking lose like 80 points of Iq.

135
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.770
You have just get around like someone should come to you and try to get you to

136
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:30.830
do things.
Yeah.
You'll fucking sign off on stuff.

137
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:35.200
You'll change your marriage license.
Fucking leave me alone.
Right.

138
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.300
Do I going to write right there?
Get fellas,
you want your wife to sign a prenup?

139
00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:39.800
Go ahead and fat are out on.
Poke it up.
Oh,

140
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:42.080
Lasagna and then she'll sign whatever the fuck he won't give up.

141
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.080
I don't think I could drink.
Like when I drive home after having a full meal,

142
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.620
I feel more fucked up and like out of it than if I have a couple of drinks.

143
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.140
It will you definitely slower.
Oh yeah.

144
00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:55.010
Your reaction time would be slower if you are full and you were driving.

145
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:55.401
Just like,

146
00:07:55.401 --> 00:07:58.970
it's just like you're tired when you're full and you don't talk as well.

147
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.600
You articulate things as quickly.
Yeah.

148
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.870
It's like it's gotta be related and I was like,
I was part,

149
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.890
I worked there for four years.
That's why I know so much about it.

150
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:09.530
But part of the thing you're supposed to sell at the end of the meal is like

151
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:12.410
lemon,
cello or espresso cause it's supposed to be like a digest.

152
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.350
Now I don't know if that's how your retic yeah,
sales pitch,

153
00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:18.740
but maybe it is something to that where it helps you a little better.

154
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:20.540
And that's why they all drink Italy.
They all,

155
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.700
they all do it as a end of the meal to clear you out a little bit.
Yeah.

156
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.730
It's going to help you break down some shit and so you can kicks in and the

157
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.880
chair,
the chairs in Italy turn into toilets.
You know that round

158
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.980
in Brazil,
when you go to those two,
Haas Korea's um,

159
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:42.150
they have this delicious dessert that has a Papaya in it and it's like a Papaya

160
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.620
smoothie.
Tennis.
It's like a blended Papaya drink and a dessert rather.

161
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:49.430
And they,

162
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.030
they have that specifically because the enzymes and Papaya helped break down the

163
00:08:53.031 --> 00:08:57.120
meat.
Oh,
it does?
Yes.
Wild.
And it's fucking delicious,
dude.

164
00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:01.290
It's a speaking know what's the channel?
What's that chain?
That Brazilian change?

165
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.610
Fogo de Chao.
Chao.
Yeah.
I'll get a child.
That's it right there,

166
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.720
Dude Sun that will fucking rock you at the end of a good meals or booze in
there.

167
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.510
You can get boots.
They have a guy that comes by.

168
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:16.420
I'm only say no cause I'm not a drunk.
But you I would say port.
Yeah.

169
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.700
That's the first question I ask.
Is there a Bougie?
It's good with booze.

170
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.790
It's good without booze too.
It's just good.
I looked at those wishes.

171
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:29.040
I went there with that.
A Ufo Guy,
Bob Ozar.
Ozar want there with yeah.
Yeah.
And uh,

172
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.500
Sholtz Andrew Schultz wanted me to yeah,
and Jeremy Core Ball.

173
00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.880
The guy who made the documentary,
we all sat around talking to them.

174
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.930
That Lazard dude freaked me the fuck out man.

175
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.130
He's a freak out like me want to move.
I,
you know,

176
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.140
I had no indication that he's full of shit.
I mean I was zero bullshit meter.

177
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:47.700
Here's the thing,
man,

178
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:52.920
when you've told a story for his many years,

179
00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:56.250
as many times as he did,
it's a,

180
00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:01.320
it's super hard to be consistent if you're just making everything up.

181
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.090
It's super hard to,
to,

182
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:10.950
to have things that you're saying back then that everybody says don't even

183
00:10:10.951 --> 00:10:15.870
exist.
Right.
Eventually turn out to be true.
It's very difficult to deny that.

184
00:10:15.871 --> 00:10:19.530
Like these are parts of his initial story is initial story had something to do

185
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:24.000
with this thing called element one 15.
Which uh,
most people,

186
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:28.860
I mean they didn't even recognize that it actually existed until much later.

187
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.200
Right.
That's a big feature of it.

188
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.460
When did he start talking about it once you're talking about the eighties

189
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.710
seventies eighties right.
A long time ago.
But it's about,
look,

190
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:41.850
I don't know enough about elements and the table to understand it.

191
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.000
You're talking to a state school kid here.
Double Shit.
Both stupid.

192
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.120
You'd probably more educated than me though.
But at the end of the day,

193
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.970
this guy is obviously smart as fuck.

194
00:10:50.971 --> 00:10:53.970
And he's a scientist that definitely worked at Los Alamos lab.
There's,
yes,

195
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.130
there's a record of him there.
Right?

196
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.690
And they tried to deny that and they tried to erase it.

197
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.250
That alone tells me just the fact that they tried to say that he didn't exist.

198
00:11:02.251 --> 00:11:07.010
He never went.
He never worked at Los Alamos lab.
That's a,
that is freaking huge.

199
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:11.770
Freaky.
Yeah.
In the 1980s you don't think they can just erase your past,
right?

200
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:12.420
Right.

201
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.660
You don't think that they could just erase your birth certificate or erase your,

202
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:18.450
your,
your medical records are ratioed dental records.

203
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:20.070
They could do whatever they want back then we'll,

204
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.690
we'll tell me you shot that documentary about the three identical strangers.

205
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.470
Did you watch her worried about I didn't see it bro.
I heard,
oh my God.

206
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.350
I mean essentially in so many words I can,
without divulging too much,

207
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:36.330
three brothers are born,
a triplets are born and they are separated at birth.

208
00:11:36.331 --> 00:11:37.170
Unbeknownst to them,

209
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.050
they grow up completely independently run into each other later in life.

210
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.580
This was in the 70s I think it was seventies and they meet publicly on,

211
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.760
maybe not Donahue,
but one of those fucking big shows,
you know,

212
00:11:47.761 --> 00:11:51.390
like they bring them all together and they ended up finding out later on the

213
00:11:51.391 --> 00:11:54.670
documentary,
spoiler alert that the comp,
there's a company

214
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.930
<v 3>who is doing this that's doing trial tests on babies that are separated and</v>

215
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:02.110
putting them with different families to find out if they end up growing up with

216
00:12:02.111 --> 00:12:06.600
similar um,
characteristics,
nature versus nurture,
nature,
nurture,

217
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:09.730
scientific experiment.
But imagine how sick you have to be.

218
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.220
Fuck to decide to separate kids.
Yep.

219
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:16.720
And t dude and show up and test their family to find out how their breeding,

220
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:21.130
these are,
how they're growing these children gross as fuck.
You wash it,

221
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:21.940
right James.

222
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.150
They'd come test them every week or two and just be like doing checkups and they

223
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:26.860
didn't,
the parents almost didn't even know.
I don't,

224
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:30.040
I'm not sure other and seem to be more keen about it.

225
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.260
And the other one's just felt like,
well they were getting money for it.

226
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:34.600
So they were like,
this is just a part of a program that we're in pro.

227
00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:37.180
How has that much different than aliens abducting people?

228
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:38.830
And that's what I'm saying.
It's not,
it's not.

229
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.700
That's my point is like if they got away with that

230
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:46.330
<v 1>life and and in genetics test pro involved,</v>

231
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.300
<v 3>mostly they have the data from that to like the nurse or the assistant from the</v>

232
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.510
get the doctor that was doing it says there is data.

233
00:12:53.511 --> 00:12:57.410
She has read it but it has never been released and it should be because they

234
00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:02.360
fucked up on,
oh wait,
you're leaving on an important part.
It's in a library in a,

235
00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:06.800
in like Harvard Law Library in it legally can't be released to the public.

236
00:13:06.801 --> 00:13:10.250
It's something that's,
it's someone's holding onto it and it cannot be released.

237
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:15.370
They've tried hundreds of times and it's got a 2050 release date or whatever.

238
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.970
Their whole,
they're waiting for these people to die.

239
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:20.810
So then it'll just go away and no one will think about it anymore.
It's fucking,

240
00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.540
dude,
watch it.
It'll fuck you up.
I'm scared.

241
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.980
And then you find out in the documentary,
they're not the only ones.
There's,

242
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.020
they've done this over and over and over and over.

243
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.760
It's,
Fuck Dude,
I'm sitting on a plane watching it and Reptilians yes.
You know,

244
00:13:37.761 --> 00:13:39.230
when you're,
you know,
you're on a plane watches,
I'm so good.

245
00:13:39.231 --> 00:13:43.190
And you look around like the other people,
you're like,
fuck no one's watching it.

246
00:13:43.191 --> 00:13:48.080
But I'm like,
fuck it.
Shit.
It was so trippy,
man.
It's so trippy.

247
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.820
So yes.
Do I think that Lazaro had people trying to x out his,

248
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.450
his PA for sure.
For sure.
And

249
00:13:55.450 --> 00:14:00.450
<v 1>there's a look,
there's a lot of other stuff that you gotta go,
hmm.</v>

250
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.290
I Dunno.
How do you,
how do you prove that?
How do you explain that?
Well,

251
00:14:04.291 --> 00:14:06.600
I don't know.
Isn't not like anything in our world.
What do you believe in?

252
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:11.460
The big questions are,
is the education background.
That was a big one.
Um,

253
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:12.930
what do you mean credibility wise?
No,

254
00:14:12.931 --> 00:14:17.640
whether or not he actually was educated at a certain place.
I'm not,
I can't,

255
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.040
this is a fucked up one,
but I can't say what he told me.
I,

256
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.460
um,
but essentially without saying it,

257
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:30.660
it had to do with projects he was working on currently,
no,

258
00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:33.240
at the time when he's working in Los Alamos labs,

259
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.050
I can't say anything more than that.
Fuck.
And now the internet exploded.

260
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.070
I don't know if it's true.
Right.
Who Do you know who told them?

261
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:41.970
I wouldn't say anything.

262
00:14:41.971 --> 00:14:44.970
So I said I wouldn't say anything and I'm not going to say anything,

263
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.710
but whatever he said about all these different things,

264
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:53.570
only he knows if it's true.
Right.
When you're talking to a guy,

265
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.830
it doesn't seem like a liar.
Seems like he's very intelligent.

266
00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.860
I mean when he's talking about all kinds of different things,
very intelligent.

267
00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:04.970
So either he's running the greatest 30 year con of all time,

268
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:11.360
or maybe this really did happen when you talk to them.

269
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.990
So you're just guessing.
You don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know his life.

270
00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:17.710
I don't know his real life.
Right.
Just gas out.

271
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:24.550
But he seems like a guy who seen some shit and just didn't know what to do and

272
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.900
told some friends about it and then then went to the news.

273
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.300
And that's what that George Knapp guy who was the investigative journalists that

274
00:15:36.301 --> 00:15:39.770
studied this case over all the years,
like this guy's never wavered.

275
00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.620
Like he stuck with the story over and over.

276
00:15:42.621 --> 00:15:46.880
Things have shown to be true that they said were science fiction.
Like the um,

277
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.170
there was this equipment that they had at Los Alamos labs that he talked about

278
00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:56.030
where was this a thing that measured the distance or the sides rather of the

279
00:15:56.031 --> 00:15:58.460
digits in your finger.
And apparently it's like a great,

280
00:15:58.461 --> 00:16:01.670
like your fingers that the inches are specific.

281
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.700
And so like if you put your hand down that thing and then Jamie's hand,

282
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.620
it would give a different measurement.
Like there's different,

283
00:16:06.621 --> 00:16:11.621
each bone is a different length and it's the exact length is of like 1.7,

284
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:16.490
whatever the fuck it is,
you know,
1.7 inches,
whatever men measurement,

285
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.830
teal tool they use.
It was,

286
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:23.210
it was calculating the length of your fingers through some kind of buggy system

287
00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:26.720
that he said didn't really work that often.
But people said that science fiction,

288
00:16:26.721 --> 00:16:27.380
it doesn't exist.

289
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.950
And then they finally got photos of these things and people that worked at Los

290
00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.730
Alamos labs concluded or are they a conceited that these were real things,

291
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.690
but for a long time they were fighting and Pete,

292
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.410
some people that didn't know were saying he made that stuff up.

293
00:16:39.411 --> 00:16:41.900
It doesn't exist but insurance shut it.
It does exist.

294
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:43.670
And it did exist right there where he worked.

295
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.210
He even took them on a tour through the labs,
like he knew where everything was.

296
00:16:47.211 --> 00:16:48.760
He used to work there.
So he,

297
00:16:48.761 --> 00:16:51.290
when they went there with the documentary crew with Jeremy Corbell,

298
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.540
they just walked him through.
He showed where he worked,

299
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:58.700
he walked right in there and they do look mainly the guys running the craziest

300
00:16:58.701 --> 00:17:02.970
con game of all time and he's just a super genius and way smarter than me.

301
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:08.060
And he tricked me and he thinks it's hilarious or maybe he saw some shit.

302
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.140
What he was explaining that made it more and more interesting was how

303
00:17:12.141 --> 00:17:13.640
compartmentalized it was.

304
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:19.190
And I about how the problem with being so compartmentalized is that science is,

305
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.310
it's based on free exchange of information.
Right?
Yeah.

306
00:17:22.311 --> 00:17:25.580
You have to have guys who are testing all these different things and working on

307
00:17:25.581 --> 00:17:27.560
them together.
That's the only way he could do so.
Right.

308
00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.710
So he's limited to a couple of guys that are working on the propulsion system.

309
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.260
And then there's a couple of other guys that are working on the metallurgy and a

310
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:35.330
couple other guys that are working on the navigation system.

311
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:40.880
And they chose him because he was kind of a maniac and he put a fucking jet

312
00:17:40.881 --> 00:17:42.350
engine in the back of a Honda.

313
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.620
And it was on the cover of the Los Alamos newspaper.

314
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.110
And it said in the article about Bob was our,

315
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.620
but this fucking jet powered Honda that he was a scientist at Los Alamos lab,

316
00:17:52.621 --> 00:17:55.620
a physicist.
So this was in the newspaper.
They printed this,

317
00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:00.390
this guy was doing this thing where he said he was living at the time in the

318
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.890
area where Los Angeles was.

319
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.050
And it said in the newspaper that he worked at the lab,

320
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.820
there's a fucking logbook of employees.
It's got his name in it.

321
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:12.300
From that time a guy had it,
he showed it,
they took photos of it.

322
00:18:12.301 --> 00:18:13.320
They showed it to everybody.
Look,

323
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:18.000
we have an employee log book like this or the employee directory rather

324
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.960
Robert Lasar right there.
So he worked there.
He really did work.
How could he,

325
00:18:21.961 --> 00:18:23.910
how could all the,
I mean,
how could you fabricate that?

326
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.120
Everybody's scared to talk.
All the people you've worked with are scared to talk.

327
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.010
Why do you think this?

328
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.260
Look at what's happening to him and he looks like a fool that FBI raids his

329
00:18:31.261 --> 00:18:34.170
house.
Everybody calls him crazy.
He didn't want have anything to do with this.

330
00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.980
The only reason why he wanted to do my podcast,
he was what he liked.

331
00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:41.730
He wanted one more chance to just get it out in a form where it's just him

332
00:18:41.731 --> 00:18:45.600
talking and he felt like he and I,
we both talked about,

333
00:18:45.601 --> 00:18:48.270
I think me and you talk,
I'll just let you talk.

334
00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.690
You tell me what happened and I'll let everybody figure out if it's true.

335
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.630
I don't know.
What do you think?
Honestly,

336
00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.840
there was parts of me that said maybe I'm just dumber than this guy,

337
00:18:57.841 --> 00:19:01.560
and he's like really manipulative and maybe he just knows how to tell a story

338
00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.530
and steady fucking King Dude.
I know,
but it's a tricky thing,
man.

339
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.080
You can get cocky,
you can get cocky.

340
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.140
I feel like you don't get cocky and think that you know that someone's not full

341
00:19:10.141 --> 00:19:10.801
of Shit.
Yeah.

342
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:14.370
But I feel like you talk to enough fucking people who are and aren't full of

343
00:19:14.371 --> 00:19:17.340
shit that your meter is higher than most.
I'm also nice,

344
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.960
so when I'm trying to talk to someone,

345
00:19:18.961 --> 00:19:21.990
I want a one things to work out well and giving the benefit of the doubt.

346
00:19:21.991 --> 00:19:25.650
Often I want them to have a good time when we're talking.

347
00:19:25.651 --> 00:19:26.850
I don't want to confront people,

348
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:30.600
even if I angrily disagree with every fiber in my being,

349
00:19:30.601 --> 00:19:33.600
as I've gotten older and better at it,
better at talking to people,

350
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.250
I avoid that kind of conflict.
I just,
I don't think it's necessary,

351
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.240
but I just don't.

352
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.240
I just think your bullshit meter is keen enough where you don't really like,

353
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.320
I think it's super cocky to say that.
I would like to think it is.
Yeah.

354
00:19:46.321 --> 00:19:50.370
My Ego would like to say like a fuck though,
bro.

355
00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.240
Just try to lie.
I've had people lie to me,
dude,

356
00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.370
I know NASA brow that eight NASA stuff fit on anything.

357
00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:00.510
There is times when you know someone's full of Shit and there's times where you

358
00:20:00.511 --> 00:20:03.390
think you know someone's full shit and you're wrong.
Then you know,

359
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.500
it's like this whole thing of looking at someone's eye and talking to them.

360
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.900
Sometimes someone will tell you something like,
oh bro,

361
00:20:09.901 --> 00:20:10.890
I didn't even know you called me.

362
00:20:10.891 --> 00:20:15.000
Like you motherfucker fucking see it right in their eyes.
Like you piece of shit.

363
00:20:15.001 --> 00:20:18.520
You didn't see your text demand.
I didn't even see it.
He didn't say,

364
00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.530
you fucking Solomon Pitch.
Fuck that shit.
You know?
Who knows?
I don't know.

365
00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.630
It freaked me out.
I'm not gonna lie came.
He was like,
fucking,

366
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.140
sometimes you have to do that to people.
What?
Hey Man,
I didn't get your call.

367
00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.270
Is it better off to say,
Hey,

368
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:38.610
I find you a little annoying and very needy and so when I get a phone call from

369
00:20:38.611 --> 00:20:41.790
you off and I cringe,
I do like you and I enjoy our time,

370
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.820
but sometimes I just can't.
Sometimes I can't.

371
00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:48.100
That's probably the most healthy version.
But you can say that.

372
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.480
<v 0>No you can't.
You have to go like this.
You Go,
I didn't.
You did today.
Oh fuck.</v>

373
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:55.420
I didn't see ya.
Sorry man.
Yeah,
I didn't see it.
Did you not get my tax?

374
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:59.890
That's when people that bothered me,
you do you not get my tax.
I always say,

375
00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:02.830
sorry,
I didn't respond to your texts.
I try to say that first,

376
00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.230
but let me tell you something as,
as a man,

377
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.690
if I text you and I'll get a text back,

378
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.960
I don't care what that am going to fucking butt hurt,
right?
No,
I just go.

379
00:21:10.961 --> 00:21:13.130
That's lets it.
He saw it.
It is what it is.
We move.

380
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.800
I don't send a text in needing or if I needed a real response from you,

381
00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.140
I would call you and go,
Hey,
I need to talk to you about something.

382
00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.190
You ever have someone send you a text that's like a little on the needy side and

383
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:27.900
then they send you one like three minutes later it says hello every day.

384
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:32.530
Every fucking day.
Jamie.
Everyday to me when you coming over,

385
00:21:32.531 --> 00:21:34.160
when are you coming over and common Jamie,

386
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.060
me alone from our afternoon pump session.
You know,

387
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:41.350
some people just get real weird with like them sending them messages in a bottle

388
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.960
and then there's this little little message.
Did you get it?

389
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:45.820
And then the other side of it is Bobby Lee,

390
00:21:45.821 --> 00:21:48.730
who literally never answered the text.
Ever.
Ever.
Ever,
ever.

391
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:53.490
I've sent him a thousand texts.
Yeah,
he doesn't answer good for him.
His,

392
00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:58.000
his uh,
green,
you know,
his notification is like 800 fucking little red.
You know,

393
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.020
he never answers,
he doesn't give a shit,
but I kind of,

394
00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:04.340
but everyone who's friends with them knows that's just Bobby.
Yeah.

395
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.230
Joey just calls you.
Yeah,
Joey.
I texted him

396
00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:11.400
<v 1>a lot more.
I've been calling people a lot more,
more personal.
Well,</v>

397
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:15.600
it's also like you can't call as many people as you can text,

398
00:22:15.601 --> 00:22:19.560
and I think there's an overload of communication that occurs when you're texting

399
00:22:19.561 --> 00:22:21.810
with like 10 different friends at the same time.

400
00:22:21.811 --> 00:22:25.410
I got dudes sending me videos than kicking pads and people show me,

401
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:27.450
let me look at this fish.
I caught like,

402
00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:32.430
I'm a fucking get these texts all day from all these crazy interesting people.

403
00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.160
Imagine if I got that many phone calls in a day.

404
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.730
It would be insane to turn your phone.
Be like,
Hey,
what's up man?
Hold on.
Hold on.

405
00:22:38.731 --> 00:22:42.810
Someone's calling me.
Hey,
what's up Tom?
Like you would never right.

406
00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.930
You know what I'm saying?
Like you would never,
if you think about it,

407
00:22:44.931 --> 00:22:48.210
even if you have like three friends and you're texting each other back and forth

408
00:22:48.211 --> 00:22:50.790
throughout today,
make jokes.
Maybe you didn't have like a group chat.

409
00:22:50.791 --> 00:22:52.140
Like a lot of us are in group chats,

410
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.280
talk about Shit and show ridiculous pictures she wanted it would get me kicked

411
00:22:56.281 --> 00:23:01.020
out of the country for sure.
Right.
I mean,
you would never do that.

412
00:23:01.021 --> 00:23:04.650
If it was phone calls,
you'd be like,
you need bitch.
I gotta call you all day.

413
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:06.930
I'm calling you in the morning and I call you in the afternoon.

414
00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.770
Are we fucking like what's happening?
Even if we were,
if you,

415
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.960
if you needed me to call you that many times in a day,
be like,
hey,
hey,
hey,

416
00:23:12.961 --> 00:23:17.730
like we gotta we gotta be happy to be in alone,
to be happy,
be together.

417
00:23:17.731 --> 00:23:22.220
But also you gotta be able to be alone.
If you need phone calls all day long,
hey,

418
00:23:22.221 --> 00:23:26.420
hey,
hey,
hey,
hey,
chill out.
Chill out at Texas.

419
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.290
Good cause you could be in the middle of some shit,
right?

420
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.650
If you're one of them dudes was inclined to change a transmission.

421
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:33.990
You want to rebuild an old Chrysler or something like that.

422
00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.620
You could be under there and then a little text message,
I'll get back to him.

423
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.920
Look,
I figured that out.
That's Mike actually.
Maybe real quick.
Yeah,

424
00:23:40.921 --> 00:23:44.950
we're going to meet a date.
You know,
like it's minimal,
right?
There's metal to,

425
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.370
but isn't that bad

426
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:49.100
<v 2>to be talking to people that way?
Isn't it?</v>

427
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.330
Is it bad to be talking to people so much to shit diet?
Yeah.
It's a shitty diet.

428
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:55.580
Duncan and I were talking about the other day about,
um,

429
00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.500
like finding information online.

430
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.540
Just constantly be inundated with stories of horrific things and bad things,

431
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.660
terrible things in ugly things that it's a bad diet.

432
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:10.970
It's a bad like mine died and I was like,

433
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.090
you're so right that that makes you think you're like immune to that.

434
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.450
That you are who you are and this is just some stuff you're experiencing,

435
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:22.280
but much like if you eat healthy foods,
your body feels better.

436
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:27.310
I think if you concentrate on healthy things and interesting things and

437
00:24:28.161 --> 00:24:31.010
fascinating things and not horse shit,

438
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.940
I think you're giving yourself a better mental diet.
Totally.

439
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.550
I think if you consume too much of anything,
it's bad.
Right?

440
00:24:37.551 --> 00:24:39.530
So consuming too much of even two Ku,

441
00:24:39.531 --> 00:24:42.560
too much positive information can be fucking detrimental because you can get

442
00:24:42.561 --> 00:24:43.430
delusional.
Yes.

443
00:24:43.431 --> 00:24:46.700
So you have to have some semblance of a balance of how you ingest that.

444
00:24:46.701 --> 00:24:50.630
The people that only ingest negative delete.
People only eat candy.

445
00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:58.510
If you are grown adults and for like 10 years you only ate candy,

446
00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.890
your body would be a mess.

447
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.840
A fucking just barely alive if you just had to live off snickers bars.

448
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.960
How much nutrition isn't a snickers bar?

449
00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.750
Like I want to do something with that dude who did the 30 days with a big match

450
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.680
size.
Me Guy.
How about this guy?
Hey Bro,
do this.
Just eating nothing but snacks.

451
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:20.540
See how long you stay alive there satisfies to a point.
That's why you're hungry.

452
00:25:20.541 --> 00:25:23.780
I guess.
They're delicious.
They're phenomenal.
I love a snickers bar.

453
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.140
They're great to take on hikes too,
by the way.
What really?
Yeah.

454
00:25:27.141 --> 00:25:29.320
A lot of nutrition in their burning sugar man.

455
00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:34.070
Fucking hiking up mountains and ship he beloved snickers bars.
Wow.
But Hey,

456
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.970
I think even the snickers people would tell you don't live off that shit stupid.

457
00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:40.700
You can't live off a steam.
Isn't that interesting?

458
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:44.450
Like there's a food you eat that you cannot live off of?
Yes.

459
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:48.560
Because all food at one point you had to eat to live of off of how many days do

460
00:25:48.561 --> 00:25:52.850
you think that you could go with only eating snickers bars and should this be

461
00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:57.560
the sober October challenge?
Yes.
First of all,

462
00:25:57.561 --> 00:26:02.330
yes.
And second of all,
what if we don't know Burger die?
Burt will die,

463
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.290
but I mean that is what it is.

464
00:26:03.291 --> 00:26:07.400
If you only could eat snickers bars and water two weeks,
two weeks,

465
00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.130
two weeks without your body malfunctioning,
I think something's going to happen.

466
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.040
Yeah,
imagine I'm dumb.
You'd get,
does it post,

467
00:26:13.041 --> 00:26:16.400
I just found from like two years ago where people ask it,
ask this question.

468
00:26:16.401 --> 00:26:17.170
It was a discussion.

469
00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:20.960
Someone did the math and get the about 12 to get the caloric intake to get that

470
00:26:20.961 --> 00:26:25.580
2000 a day.
12 a day just for 2000 calories.
But how many days could you survive?

471
00:26:25.581 --> 00:26:28.160
I on,
I mean that's up to you.
Well,
Bro List.
Think about that.

472
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:32.750
12 and snickers bars a day.
Holy Shit.
How long do you think,
okay.

473
00:26:32.751 --> 00:26:35.630
The problem with that is like everyone is not coming from the same starting

474
00:26:35.631 --> 00:26:37.400
point.
Right?
That's the biggest issue.

475
00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.910
Don't have to have three twin guys where I separated them,

476
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.620
make them all eat snickers to one of them dies.
You guys need,

477
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.940
you guys need to control.
You guys need some sort of control.

478
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.660
They would be the test.
Just feed them.
Give them $1 million each.

479
00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:51.240
Give him nothing but snickers until someone's on the verge of death until

480
00:26:51.241 --> 00:26:55.920
somebody taps tap out.
Bitch.
How many days you think you could go on?

481
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:56.790
Only snickers.

482
00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.570
I say two weeks is probably the human body will start to shut down.
I wonder,

483
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.150
maybe you could go a long time.
Well let me say this.
You could,

484
00:27:03.151 --> 00:27:04.020
you could fucking find this.

485
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.530
There's a dude that's been eating just pizza for like 25 years.
Breakfast,

486
00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:09.180
lunch and dinner will find that too.

487
00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:13.950
There's a dude that he's just pepperoni pizza.
I respect that and it's like,

488
00:27:13.951 --> 00:27:17.390
fuck it.
My parents told me what to do my whole life and I'm a grown.

489
00:27:17.391 --> 00:27:18.600
He's now bitch.

490
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.380
I picked everyday just crying and eating pizza and there were socks,
Journal.

491
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.170
Let's try to get him to have like a piece of green leafy Greens.

492
00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:30.510
Puked puked on camera.
That was like,
aw,
he couldn't fucking do it.
Fuck in us.

493
00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.850
It's Bazell and a nice sauce.

494
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:38.180
Get the fucking Green Shit at a pizza for 20 years.

495
00:27:38.431 --> 00:27:42.030
Something like that.
Saying,
what was that Jamie?
Was it 25 years?

496
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:43.830
He says he has one bowl of raisin bran a week.

497
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.500
Shit,
that compacted glue.

498
00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:55.560
That's what pizza is like.
Glue,
mixed blue cheese.
Just chewing down a little bit.

499
00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:00.540
Joe.
That delicious dough.
Holy Shit.
25 years.
She does have diabetes.

500
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.500
Of course he does.
Duh.
Color me surprised.

501
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:09.030
How the fuck,
sorry buddy for laughing at your diabetes,
but how the not at all.

502
00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:13.540
Not Sorry.
How to fuck this.
Someone eat nothing but that glue for 25 years.

503
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.060
That's the cat.
That's him.
That's good.

504
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.470
Let's say he's 48 guys should be doing youtube videos,
so what do they call?

505
00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.290
They call him skinny fat.
There was an article that call them like,
you know,
ski.

506
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:22.530
No skinny fat,
right?
Yeah.

507
00:28:22.531 --> 00:28:26.250
He looks remarkably good for someone who's only in pizza for 25 years.

508
00:28:26.251 --> 00:28:29.070
It might be something to it,
but they say skinny,
fat,
skinny,
fat,

509
00:28:29.071 --> 00:28:32.660
fucking as people look skinny,
fat,
skinny,
fat.
We're like,
the body is,

510
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:37.090
she doesn't show any signs,
but the insights fucking murdered.
It's it apart.
Yeah.

511
00:28:37.091 --> 00:28:41.820
Well she opens her failing.
Nothing's there.
Yeah.
That's why you can look small,

512
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.880
but you don't have anything.
They're skinny fat people.

513
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.430
Limbs are barely hanging on threads.

514
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.720
It's like certain people,
you know,

515
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:55.170
certain people like you hug them and you're like,
oh my God,
God,

516
00:28:55.171 --> 00:28:59.770
there's nothing there.
You're so frail.
So it is funny when you,
when you hold,

517
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.780
that's like when I take pictures after shows and say how to people.
Yeah.

518
00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.280
You know when you grabbed it and you feel,
and some people you feel in your like,

519
00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:08.250
wow,
that's fucking weird.
It's weird.
It's weird.
You're like a fucking,

520
00:29:08.251 --> 00:29:11.460
just a lump of bone sticks,
sticks covered with Jello.

521
00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:17.790
It's terrible.
Bony lumpy bag.
What's really terrible is when,
I mean,

522
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:21.670
I'm not saying you have to be a bodybuilder.
Oh,
but you have to fuck.
It's,

523
00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:26.490
she keep your body moving.
And when it's just a laziness thing.

524
00:29:26.491 --> 00:29:30.240
It's a discipline thing and like this idea that some sort of nobility and

525
00:29:30.241 --> 00:29:34.290
humility and not caring about your body.
It's silly.
I'm out of here.
One,

526
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.040
you get one.
It doesn't make you dumber.
If you work out,
stop.

527
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:42.240
I know the jocks were assholes and people bullied you.
I get it.
Yeah,

528
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.860
<v 1>but God dammit.
Take care of your fucking meet vehicle.
Just go take care of it.</v>

529
00:29:46.861 --> 00:29:51.400
Care the meat skeleton people.
You're being this way.
You work.
Oh yes.
That too.

530
00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:55.960
I like looking good.
I like it.
It's better to me than not looking good.
I'm sorry.

531
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:57.880
I'm willing to put in the time,

532
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:01.150
but you know what the irony is shell because of the hype of,

533
00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.710
because of the growth,
growth of MMA.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.

534
00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:09.160
In my brother because of the growth of MMA,
crossfit,

535
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:10.330
all of these,

536
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:13.030
all these new worlds that have kind of emerged socially now that are so much

537
00:30:13.031 --> 00:30:14.080
bigger than they were years ago.

538
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.920
Nerds from that I grew up in the high school or now are into working out.
Yeah.

539
00:30:17.921 --> 00:30:20.380
That's the irony.
That's a big thing.
Once you do too.
That's what I'm saying.

540
00:30:20.381 --> 00:30:24.160
It's like the biggest like insecure people now they found a home in something

541
00:30:24.161 --> 00:30:27.970
that's disciplined.
It's good.
It feels good to move your body.

542
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:32.920
It feels good.
It feels good to do things.
Whether it's taken a dance class,

543
00:30:32.921 --> 00:30:36.610
I'm not into that,
but taking karate,
I'm not into that shit.

544
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:38.350
I like Yoga.

545
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:43.180
I like running or like doing Jujitsu obviously.
I like all kinds of,

546
00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:46.780
all kinds of martial arts and I have this like moving my body man.

547
00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:50.290
I like wandering uphills.
You move your body,
so I think going,

548
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:53.680
you'll feel better afterwards.
I know you don't want to do it.
I never,

549
00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.600
I fucking hardly ever want to do it.

550
00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.770
If I may be wanting to want to actually do it five out of 10 times,

551
00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.340
but maybe less.
Yeah,
but I do it.
I just do it.

552
00:31:03.341 --> 00:31:06.730
I know what it's like to not want to do it.
I get it.
Shut up.

553
00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.510
I just started talking to myself.
I go,
come on Pussy.
What are you talking about?

554
00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.680
If I was you,
outside of you knowing what I know,
if I could read my mind,

555
00:31:14.681 --> 00:31:18.450
I'd be like,
come on bitch,
you just being lazy.
Put your fucking shoes on,
get up,

556
00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.100
get a sweat going,
and then you're gonna feel pumped.
C'Mon man,

557
00:31:21.101 --> 00:31:25.390
you've done this a million times and then invariably I'll be in the middle of

558
00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:29.620
the workout.
I'm sweating.
I'm like,
fuck yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And then I get into it.

559
00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:30.550
It's like it just,

560
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.760
you got to push past that creepy resistance that Steven Pressfield wrote about

561
00:31:36.311 --> 00:31:40.240
in the war of art.
It,
it applies not just to art,

562
00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.130
not just a writing replies.

563
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:47.320
It applies to clean your room and applies to saying you're sorry to a friend.

564
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.750
It applies to you taking care of a debt.

565
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:52.070
All those things you just keep putting off.

566
00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:56.410
It's this weird thing that you have when you see a problem,
you got to fix it,

567
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:57.640
right?
See the thing you have to do,

568
00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:01.720
go do it when you know something like clean your fucking room.
Right?

569
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.930
That's what Jordan Peterson always says,
clean.
You're clean,

570
00:32:03.931 --> 00:32:06.700
your room and your room and that's,
that really is what he means.

571
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.040
Get your shit in order.
We'll do it and I think,

572
00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:12.370
I think it's also a personality trait though too.
To be fair.
Like I fucking,

573
00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:14.320
I'm someone that has to get it done.
You know when someone goes,

574
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.110
you don't have to do it all at once on the opposite.
I'm like,
yeah,
you do.
Yeah,

575
00:32:17.111 --> 00:32:19.930
you fucking do like my,
she wants new blinds at the house.

576
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.550
What if we just do the living room for now?
I was like,

577
00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.730
none of us do get the whole fucking thing done.
What's the difference?

578
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.270
That's a manly thing to say to get it to fuck,
man.

579
00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.930
What can we just have this window,
this window?
Just this'll be my shade spot.

580
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:34.350
A man goes,
hey,

581
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.590
some code a whole fucking pay back the truck up all around.

582
00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.070
What can be some no fucking bites?
I want trees around this out.

583
00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:47.360
I want to walk around my cock counts.
You could buy an old tree,

584
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.140
you know that you could buy like I want a tree in my yard,
500 years old.

585
00:32:51.141 --> 00:32:53.840
They'll find you one.
That's dope though.
Nope,
that's cool.
To be like,

586
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.310
place it here.
I got to fucking,

587
00:32:55.311 --> 00:32:59.390
I have 150 plus old oak tree in my backyard.

588
00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:03.240
Here's what's weird shit.
Safe.
You have a piece of land,
right,

589
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:07.580
and that piece of land is a hundred acres of beautiful piece of land.
You know?

590
00:33:07.581 --> 00:33:09.710
You don't own the animals on that land.

591
00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.820
Like if there's wildlife on that land or there's a bunch of deer on that land,

592
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:16.160
you can't just shoot him.
You have to have tags.

593
00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:17.840
You have to have state allocated tags.

594
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:21.200
They give out a certain amount based on the deer population using wildlife

595
00:33:21.201 --> 00:33:24.520
biologists and they view it from helicopters and shit.
They,

596
00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:27.050
everyone has different way.
They've trail cameras,
all these different ways.

597
00:33:27.051 --> 00:33:29.540
They determine the numbers.
Then they figured out how many people can hunt,

598
00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:35.530
but you own the trees and that weird and all the trees.

599
00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:37.010
Yeah.
You own everything that they're around.

600
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.770
Don't some gigantic population of of pine trees in the forest,

601
00:33:42.771 --> 00:33:44.900
like you own some giant swath of land that you're logging.

602
00:33:44.901 --> 00:33:47.750
Like those logging companies.
Do they own those tree somehow?

603
00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:52.160
How they don't own the deer.
They don't own the elk alum.
The Eagles,

604
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:54.190
but they own the fucking trees.
It's weird.

605
00:33:54.191 --> 00:33:56.300
Maybe it's because the trees don't move.
Yeah,

606
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:59.750
that's exactly what can't movement are easy to just,
I could just take that.
Yes.

607
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:04.010
Saw that thing.
So they like completely over fish,

608
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.330
you know what I mean?
The virus and then they,

609
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:10.820
they leave these big cut like these huge cut areas.

610
00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:14.720
Like if you've ever been to the woods and seeing a place that's been logged.
Yep.

611
00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.600
It's interesting.
Yeah.
It's wild to see.
Oh that's kind of beautiful.

612
00:34:17.601 --> 00:34:19.370
In a weird way.
I hate to say it,
but it's not,
you're like wow,
that's,

613
00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:24.300
it's mesmerizing.
You know,
it's,
it's a key area for hunting too,
right.
Pick of,

614
00:34:24.301 --> 00:34:28.220
well [inaudible] does a clearing in the animals come out to eat the sprout.

615
00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:31.700
The new new new growth grows up.
Yeah.

616
00:34:31.701 --> 00:34:34.970
And it's a big open place so it gets plenty of rain and sunlight.

617
00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.780
Like sometimes the canopy keeps like smaller things from growing.

618
00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:41.960
You don't get enough sunlight.
And a lot of times in the canopy too,

619
00:34:41.961 --> 00:34:44.900
like everything's beaten down with,
um,
pine needles.

620
00:34:44.901 --> 00:34:47.540
Everything's covered with leaves and shit inside.

621
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:50.710
When you have a real thick forest,
right?
Those big open areas,
mantle,

622
00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:53.870
these animals come out and you could find it in there.
That's fucking mild,

623
00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.450
easy hunting season.
Wow.
It's never easy.

624
00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:01.700
They could smell you fucking impossible distance way you put stuff on yourself

625
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:05.330
too,
to not smell like,
no,
you can't do it if you can't cover up the smell,

626
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:08.300
no chance.
The only thing you could do is there's a thing called,
oh,

627
00:35:08.301 --> 00:35:12.200
Zonix that does work,
but it only works if you're in one place.

628
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:14.540
So like if you're in a tree stand,

629
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:19.040
you have a thing that you put above your head and it sheds ozone down on your

630
00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:22.850
body.
And with the ozone does,
and this is how it's been explained to me.
Again,

631
00:35:22.851 --> 00:35:26.420
remember I'm a moron.
Say you're talking to him like I'm an idiot.
I'm like,

632
00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:30.230
I tell him like [inaudible] I went to Boston University,

633
00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:34.420
Umass Boston rather for three years in their continuing education program and

634
00:35:34.421 --> 00:35:36.770
everyone took my sats.
I'm a legitimate moron,

635
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:41.970
but apparently this ozone shit that comes down over you,

636
00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:46.620
it uh,
it confuses the deer.
Like the deer gets a set.
It's like,

637
00:35:46.621 --> 00:35:48.040
what the fuck is that?
Right?

638
00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:51.600
He doesn't know what it is as opposed to smelling you and go on fuck.

639
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:55.360
They smell you.
They just run,
they smell people.
They just run.
Yeah,

640
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:58.110
they take off run like hundreds of yards away.

641
00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.990
You'll see them just go like this and then just take off and you're like,

642
00:36:00.991 --> 00:36:05.010
what happened?
And you blow some um,
this like a white talc in the air,

643
00:36:05.011 --> 00:36:09.300
like a puff of Talc.
And as it drifts,
you see which way the wind's blowing.

644
00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.580
It's a wind checker,
right?
So when you're up there in the wind,

645
00:36:11.581 --> 00:36:13.200
you have this like little,
it's like a,
like a,

646
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:18.230
almost like a little baby powder title meal and you just press it and the stuff

647
00:36:18.451 --> 00:36:21.680
goes in the air and you could see exactly where they went.

648
00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:25.740
They even have vaporizers now that do it.
Now I have one that's like a vaporizer.

649
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.420
You press a button and just missed it,

650
00:36:27.421 --> 00:36:31.140
goes in the air to show you where the windows and just missed out.
Yeah,
it's wow.

651
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.310
And um,

652
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:35.670
it's just for that just to make smoke so you could see which way the smoke goes,

653
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:40.380
but it's just missed the ozone shit.
Three yields on bonds,
your scent molecules.

654
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.730
Yeah.
So this is what they're saying.

655
00:36:41.731 --> 00:36:44.070
So that I don't think they're allowed to lie about this shit.

656
00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:48.300
I think in this day and age it creates like a shield for your,
your natural,

657
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:51.000
your odor or odor,
natural odor.
So,
um,

658
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.990
my friend John Dudley is a big believer in this and anything he's a big believer

659
00:36:54.991 --> 00:36:59.400
in,
I'm a big believer in that is fucking wild.
Apparently it does work,

660
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:04.050
but it's still,
if they see you move,
if something funky comes their way,

661
00:37:04.051 --> 00:37:08.730
I mean maybe it works for like 80% of the time,
dear,
or some sneaky fucks.

662
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.780
They're smart.
How good is their vision?
Their vision is good,
but they,
they,

663
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:17.430
you view things like from an edge detection thing like that,

664
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:20.130
they see things that move.
Right.
So if you just freeze,

665
00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:24.060
if you have camouflage on and you freeze,
they will often walk right by you.

666
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.400
That's fucking wild.
Especially if you had,

667
00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:31.140
there's a thing that's another thing called the heck suit.
Hecs and a heck suit.

668
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:33.690
I wear one.
I don't know if they really work,

669
00:37:33.691 --> 00:37:37.590
but they appear to work with birds like they've proven that birds follow in

670
00:37:37.591 --> 00:37:41.750
electrical magnetic signal.
That's how they get home.
Right?
They use the,
the,

671
00:37:41.751 --> 00:37:44.790
the natural magnetism of the earth to figure out where the fuck they're going.

672
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:48.120
Like they did 10 sounds crazy.
What isn't that funny that we can't do that.

673
00:37:48.121 --> 00:37:50.850
We're so stupid.
We can't get home of fuck it.
I'm lost.
Yeah.

674
00:37:50.851 --> 00:37:55.050
We can just use our two wrong terms.
I'm fucked though.
But these birds,

675
00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.060
it's like it works with birds.

676
00:37:57.061 --> 00:37:59.130
Like all these guys say that you put these suits on,

677
00:37:59.131 --> 00:38:00.630
birds have no idea you're there.

678
00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:05.220
They don't see you like it blocks the electrical magnetic signal that your

679
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.950
body's is be made out of.
What's that?
It's a mesh.

680
00:38:07.951 --> 00:38:10.410
There's some sort of a mesh that the yaks yeah,

681
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:13.110
the blocks that they have actually been like meters they can show.

682
00:38:13.111 --> 00:38:15.930
They put it on and wave it over this thing.
There's no reaction.

683
00:38:15.931 --> 00:38:19.410
Take it off and then there's a reaction towards detecting the signal that your,

684
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:23.520
your body puts out.
The real question is that it proved that it does that.

685
00:38:23.521 --> 00:38:26.760
The real questions can animals really see it and how many of them can see it?

686
00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.280
The big thing is smell.
It doesn't matter if they can't see you.

687
00:38:29.281 --> 00:38:32.220
If they fucking smell you,
they're gone.
So you could look just like a tree,

688
00:38:32.221 --> 00:38:35.320
but if a deer smells and he's going to just start running,
they just run.

689
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:36.300
What's your,

690
00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.530
<v 2>what's the only fixed for the smell thing?
Other than that,
that,
that thing.</v>

691
00:38:38.531 --> 00:38:40.000
That's it.
That's it.
There's so their,

692
00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:42.900
their sense of smell is impossible to understand.
The,

693
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.630
it's so much better than ours that what we have shouldn't even be called a sense

694
00:38:46.631 --> 00:38:49.410
of smell.
It'd be like the difference.
You look at the hallways,
hallways,

695
00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:53.580
face holes.
Yeah.
Like how,
how?
Well,
the ants do stand up comedy like

696
00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.090
beds in comparison.
Couple of good attitude.

697
00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.960
A couple of guys got to get kind with an ass man.

698
00:38:58.961 --> 00:39:01.900
I gotta get tight three but that's what the difference is in comparison to like

699
00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:05.740
how bad our noses work versus a deer.
Who's the bet?
What animals the best?

700
00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:07.730
I think a bear bears are the best sense of smell.

701
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:10.870
I think bears have a preposterous sense of smell.
Dogs are really good,

702
00:39:10.871 --> 00:39:11.620
but it's not that good.

703
00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:16.030
I think a bear is like a hundred times stronger than a bloodhound fucked up.

704
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:21.220
Fuck.
You can smell something FY eight they could smell 18 miles away.

705
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:24.820
You can go straight fucking Milo.
Ro.

706
00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.790
I search where the average US sight distances.
How far can people,
what's a,

707
00:39:27.791 --> 00:39:30.790
what's a typical like sight tests?
No one can only see about a mile,
right?

708
00:39:30.791 --> 00:39:34.180
Depends on the animal.
Like some animals don't see good at all.

709
00:39:34.181 --> 00:39:38.050
Like pigs don't see good at all.
Yeah,
you just freeze on a pig.

710
00:39:38.051 --> 00:39:40.620
They don't know what the fuck's going on.
For sure.
Eagle Eagle,

711
00:39:40.621 --> 00:39:43.710
I like little mice in the fucking Egos have the best.
Probably site.
Yeah,

712
00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.660
they can see from miles and miles a mile.
My friend from Alaska,

713
00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.760
he goes halibut fishing all the time.
He said,

714
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:52.930
if you love how you're pulling a fish up in eagle can see it miles away.

715
00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:56.470
That's it.
That,
that's some dinosaur shit.

716
00:39:56.471 --> 00:39:59.150
That's how you know dinosaurs shit does.
That play is miles.

717
00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:03.850
What grizzly can find an elk carcass when it's underwater and polar bears can

718
00:40:03.851 --> 00:40:07.520
smell a seal through three feet of ice.
Fuck,

719
00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:12.070
three fucking feet of ice.
Oh my God.

720
00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:16.870
That's insane.
Three feet of ice.
That is a fucking monster.

721
00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.480
Imagine if you were in a big concrete building.

722
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.190
It's three feet thick and there's a bear on the outside.

723
00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:30.480
If that was a monster movie,
be like,
this is insane.
This monster.
No,

724
00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:32.940
I'm here like you'd be two kids right there.

725
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.070
Their parents have already been killed and it was just breathing like,

726
00:40:36.071 --> 00:40:36.904
don't worry,
we're safe.

727
00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:40.840
It's concretes three feet thick because no way could smell us in.
It's outside.

728
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:47.870
I smell who he talks to.
One

729
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:53.170
just just wanting three fucking you and your sister.

730
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:55.840
18 miles of smell.

731
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:58.570
Three feet of smell through eyes.

732
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.350
Did you ever see the video where the BBC reporter gets inside a box like a

733
00:41:02.351 --> 00:41:04.130
plexiglass box?
No.

734
00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:08.440
They put him around polar bears and the polar bear tries to eat them and the

735
00:41:08.441 --> 00:41:10.300
polar bears trying to eat him through this box.

736
00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:13.450
Try and figure out how to get to him because it knows he's in this box.

737
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:17.860
It is fucking terrible.
Why would you ever Bro in?

738
00:41:17.861 --> 00:41:20.800
This guy's got cameras on him the whole time.
Shush.
Shush.
Shush.

739
00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:25.890
Shitness man's Dukie and left in bright fill in those drawers,

740
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:30.880
son.
How strong is that?
That thing has to be indestructable.
They're so big.

741
00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:35.930
They're so big and we've been,
we've been really fucked over.

742
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:37.063
Just let it out.

743
00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:42.090
Let Ron Jamia we've been really fucked over with Goddamn Klondike bars and Coca

744
00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:43.810
Cola and made it look suite.

745
00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:48.290
We have a super distorted perception of this fucking predatory killing machine

746
00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:50.960
that eats its babies,
bro.
Bro.

747
00:41:50.961 --> 00:41:55.820
These things are fucking ruthless.
Like they're that cleanup crew.

748
00:41:55.821 --> 00:42:00.260
They're there to make sure there's so few resources up there in the wild that

749
00:42:00.261 --> 00:42:03.600
this giant behemoth of a bear exist.

750
00:42:03.601 --> 00:42:05.780
So he could just Jack everything,

751
00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:10.010
just jack everything and keep the populations nice and low.
Look at that.
He's in.

752
00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:10.850
You're right in there.

753
00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:14.960
I'm not a biologist so that he knows it's in there and he's just trying to get

754
00:42:14.961 --> 00:42:19.280
at it.
He's biting it.
God Damn,
dude,
that would fuck that up.

755
00:42:19.281 --> 00:42:23.320
Look at this man.
It's pressing on it.
That's glass,
man.
If you're crazy,

756
00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:29.720
you're fucking dead fucking teeth through it.
When it's opening its mouth,

757
00:42:29.721 --> 00:42:31.020
that's a monster's mouth.

758
00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.800
This is what I look like drunk at a Mcdonald's had fucking four in the morning

759
00:42:33.801 --> 00:42:37.630
trying to get food to the drive through
this poor guy.

760
00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.460
He's behind him.
He was like,
but the camera is this way or shaken.

761
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.310
Shaken the shit out of it.
Of course it is.

762
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:47.240
Why would he be so convinced that that can,
that thing would survive.

763
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:52.400
It'd be so dope if it just of,
how do they rescue this cat?
This dude?
Yeah.

764
00:42:52.401 --> 00:42:53.390
How do they get him out of there?

765
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:56.840
Like who's who's like how long does it take to get him out of there?

766
00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:00.980
They got to find a way to distract this bear walked away.
Come on.

767
00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:04.280
It's got to get frustrated at some point.
I'm like,
fucked us.
Look at it.
He goes,

768
00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:08.270
fuck dose.
But how did they test that box?
What is that guy hated him.

769
00:43:08.271 --> 00:43:12.530
The guy who made the box.
Oh,
this guy's going to climb out.
I'm out.
I'm free.

770
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:17.090
We've got a prize.
Hug The bear.
Yeah.
Like let's pretend the bears right there,

771
00:43:17.091 --> 00:43:21.890
right next to him.
That thing can run 35 miles an hour.
Fuck Outta here.

772
00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:27.140
Here's how fast the bear run there and saying,
dude,
they run like that on ice.

773
00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.400
That's things just digging with their claws.
They could run like hell.

774
00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.960
They'd pick,
kind of pretended like that was a totally safe,

775
00:43:32.961 --> 00:43:36.310
normal experiment for him to do.
Like he got out like no big deal,
man.
You know,

776
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:39.110
fucking polar bears.
Ironically our black underneath all that white,
furry,

777
00:43:39.111 --> 00:43:42.400
you know that,
right?
Let's clear those clearer.
Is that just a clear black?

778
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.740
It's black skin.
The skin's black wire.
Yeah,
it is.
Wow.

779
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:48.410
Well you got to imagine that people get Snow Tan,
right?

780
00:43:48.411 --> 00:43:52.070
You get snow blind blind because the sun beating off the snow.

781
00:43:52.071 --> 00:43:55.920
Like people get burned like really bad.
Yeah.
And go skiing without chilling.

782
00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:58.340
That's got a polar bear.
It looks no,
that's a black bear bro.

783
00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:02.150
Polar bear without here.
Yeah,
but it's not.
Look at the hair around his face.

784
00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:05.720
See how it's all black?
A guarantee.
That's a black bear also.

785
00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:09.500
It just doesn't look big enough.
What does a bear,
maybe it's just another one.

786
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:13.790
It's got main,
but you can see how it has the hair on the top of his heads.

787
00:44:13.791 --> 00:44:15.530
Black at the sink.

788
00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.160
I think someone just wrote that and it doesn't mean that it's correct,

789
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:21.920
but they are.
They're dark.
But underneath all that,
they are really dark,
dark.

790
00:44:21.921 --> 00:44:23.690
It's wavy.
Hey,
maybe when they get mains,

791
00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:26.990
their fucking hair on their head gets black.
Who the fuck knows who go to that?

792
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:31.890
Well,
ranges.
Ranges.
Weird Shit.
What the fuck is that fair?
I mean I've looked,

793
00:44:31.891 --> 00:44:35.400
I've seen this before.
I guess I did.
I typed in polar bears popped up.

794
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:39.620
What would imagine pulling up?
They're know for their,

795
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:42.450
the most terrifying cause they're the biggest well there,
right there,
Jamie top.

796
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.950
The top fourth picture is them spreading the hair apart.
Right.
They,

797
00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:48.330
you see the skin there,
so there you go.
Oh perfect.
Yeah.

798
00:44:48.331 --> 00:44:51.750
And see how the hair looks white.
But it's actually,

799
00:44:51.751 --> 00:44:55.440
they say it's like more of like a clear color.
Wow.
That's fucking crazy to me.

800
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:58.590
Yeah.
Like not technically white.
No,
it's,
yeah,
it does.
It does.

801
00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:03.150
It looks translucent.
Translucent almost.
Right.
But what an amazing animal man.

802
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.013
Unbelievable.

803
00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:08.670
Imagine that thing lives in this place where there's no vegetables at all.
Nope.

804
00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:12.660
But it got so big,
it evolved to get that big meet.

805
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:17.960
Duke just meet tons and tons and tons of me and they can eat a fucking like a

806
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:22.920
hole through ice to get to you too.
It would just chew through the ice.

807
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:28.230
It'll do whatever it can to,
it gets you right there.

808
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:32.010
It's so nice that they're so far away.
They swim.
You know,

809
00:45:32.011 --> 00:45:36.120
they jumped in the water and swim.
You can swim six miles an hour,
bro.

810
00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:37.410
And for how long can they swim?

811
00:45:37.411 --> 00:45:39.430
I wonder how long they can stay in the water for cause they have to get out of

812
00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:43.440
something that knots and why do we need knots?
Boat,
boat.

813
00:45:43.441 --> 00:45:47.580
People love that shit with boat people.
Hey,
it's six fathoms.
Hey fuck face.

814
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.330
How many feet?
5.2 knots.

815
00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:56.160
5.2 knots is a mile.
Six miles an hour.
Six miles.
Now it's 5.2 nuns.

816
00:45:56.190 --> 00:46:00.450
My boat goes five notes close.
Want to make it slower?
That's so confusing.

817
00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:04.470
Why would they do that when they can just do miles an hour?
What is knots?

818
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:08.040
I think not around before.
Miles an hour.
Kilometers,
kilometers.

819
00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.040
We're also before miles an hour was it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Kilometers.

820
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:14.850
Kilometers with the metric system and that that was later.
No,

821
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:18.090
no knots or kilometers.

822
00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:23.520
Then where else really smart people are like,
why the fuck are they talking

823
00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:28.590
about kilometers?
Some engineer is like,
God dammit.

824
00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.710
Well when I was in high school,
they tried to put the metric system on us.

825
00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:35.250
They tried to bring back the metric system and we're like,
bitches as America,

826
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.760
fuck that and fuck your systems of 10 we leave out unnecessary letters to maybe

827
00:46:42.841 --> 00:46:45.960
not,
not,
oh nevermind.
Sorry.
It didn't work.
Just like soccer.

828
00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:48.780
They tried to push soccer on us too.
You know why soccer didn't work.

829
00:46:48.781 --> 00:46:51.180
We were talking,
I was talking about this today because this is America too slow.

830
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:55.710
Too slow.
Slow too slow.
Baseball works.
What people say,
people have goals.

831
00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:59.760
People don't goals too.
People have goals.
Oh,
okay.
So people have scoring,
scoring.

832
00:46:59.761 --> 00:47:01.170
People would up scorps listen,

833
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:04.290
the NHL where you're saying the reason they changed the Blue Line rule is

834
00:47:04.291 --> 00:47:07.650
because they wanted more goals so they got more goals,
more viewership.

835
00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:10.620
What's more American than a Grand Slam?
Right.

836
00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.720
Literally nothing bases loaded crack.

837
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:16.570
It's all sports center used to be home runs and dunks.
Yes.
Fucking should be.

838
00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.590
We love,
we love seeing that moment.
Yeah,
so in soccer,

839
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:22.020
but you have 90 minutes and sometimes no goals.

840
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:28.560
I get it.
I can't do it.
If you understand how difficult it is,

841
00:47:28.561 --> 00:47:29.830
if you're a of the game,

842
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:34.030
<v 1>if you love the game,
play the game.
Like Ian loves it.
Yeah,
he does.</v>

843
00:47:34.031 --> 00:47:36.370
He knows the only black I know that loves soccer in America.

844
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.750
Is that real in America?

845
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:40.750
How many black fucking friends you have that love soccer?
He's my only one.

846
00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:44.110
That's true.
I don't have any black friends that watch soccer.
That's true.

847
00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:50.380
He's,
he's literally my only will make it right though.
Yes.
And England.

848
00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:52.780
He lives in England as well.
England,
Jamaica,
right.
Born in Jamaica,

849
00:47:52.781 --> 00:47:55.870
then moved to England in New York.
Have you seen those games?
He goes to,

850
00:47:55.900 --> 00:48:00.790
they look awesome.
We were supposed to go.
I'm not taking their fucking fun.

851
00:48:00.791 --> 00:48:02.840
It's just,
it's not,
I don't,
it's not my ship.

852
00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.450
We were organized in the comedian thing,

853
00:48:04.451 --> 00:48:06.490
but I had a family thing that I would do.
I couldn't make it,

854
00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:08.110
but they look like good time,

855
00:48:08.111 --> 00:48:11.290
especially if you want to get blasted on some of this.
Uh,
Mike Tyson,

856
00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.800
we that we smoke today.
It's the fucking delicious by the way.
Thank you Mike.

857
00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:19.390
Thank you,
Mike.
Thank you.
My shout out to the champ,
the motherfucking champ.
Um,

858
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.680
what were we just talking about?
Polar bears.
Polar bears.
Yeah,
man.

859
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:28.570
There was not,
somebody wrote some article about polar bears.
Uh,
you know,

860
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:32.170
when,
whenever we say that polar bear populations are threatened,

861
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:34.480
they definitely are in certain spots.

862
00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:38.770
But the places where polar bears occupied is enormous.
Yeah,
it's huge.

863
00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:40.810
And in some areas there's a lot of them.

864
00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:44.950
And we have this non nuanced way of looking at polar bears.

865
00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:47.410
So people would get really mad if,
like,

866
00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.540
they found that these Inuits were killing polar bears.

867
00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:53.710
But sometimes these folks are living in places where polar bears are entering

868
00:48:53.711 --> 00:48:57.400
their villages and they are super dangerous killing their babies.

869
00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.910
They'll kill people.
They will straight up kill people.
You know,

870
00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:05.290
I think there's a comic who's a,
um,
he's,
uh,
also a veterinarian.

871
00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:10.270
Kevin,
he's a vet.
Yeah.
He's,
um,

872
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.510
he's a guy who performed in Denver.
I met him in Denver.

873
00:49:13.511 --> 00:49:16.380
I was working with them when,
Oh,
do you know him?
Yeah.
He's,

874
00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:20.050
he's famous and Dandruff.
Fitzgerald.
Yes.
He has a TV show out there.
Fitzgerald.

875
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:21.400
Yeah.
I was gonna say Fitzgerald,

876
00:49:21.401 --> 00:49:23.620
but I thought it was wrong because my friend Dave Fitzgerald,

877
00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.120
that was just tossing and long white hair.
Yeah,
like yeah,

878
00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:30.400
he told me that polar bears out of the womb or like Predator,

879
00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:32.800
you know like the movie Predator,
like out of the womb,

880
00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:36.400
they're just trying to bite and kill out of the womb dope.
I had the wound,

881
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:40.390
they just come out and I was like,
well,
it makes sense,
right?

882
00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.520
If you stop and think about what their life is,

883
00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:48.120
everything is just white and frozen and occasionally catch something slipping.

884
00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:53.680
They occasionally get someone whose son named themselves and you get to them

885
00:49:53.681 --> 00:49:57.460
before they can get away and you could dive in the water and grab a foot and

886
00:49:57.461 --> 00:50:01.380
drag them back up.
Survival man.
The darkest store that I've ever heard,

887
00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:04.300
I don't know if this is true,
but let's pretend it is.
Yeah,
fine.

888
00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:09.600
Was there was some sort of an expedition and there a boat hit some ice and so

889
00:50:10.031 --> 00:50:14.350
their boat started sinking and they had a real problem because the next boat was

890
00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:15.213
hours away.

891
00:50:15.310 --> 00:50:18.970
So they call in a May Day for the next boat and they climb out of the boat in

892
00:50:18.971 --> 00:50:23.290
time before it sinks and then they get to an ice shelter,
like a,
an ice raft.

893
00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:28.010
A Nice island.
An island.
Yeah.
Last island and distance.
I see a

894
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:30.530
<v 2>polar bear,
huck,
and it's many,</v>

895
00:50:30.531 --> 00:50:33.680
many ice land bridges or whatever.

896
00:50:33.681 --> 00:50:37.490
The phone over ice distance that ice island away.
High steps,

897
00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:40.150
but it keeps jumping in the water and getting closer on.
Fuck.

898
00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:43.760
He's trying to figure out what the fuck they are and then filing against to
them,

899
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:48.650
finds out what they are.
It's in the Ice Island next to them,
jumps in the water,

900
00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:52.580
pops up,
grabs one guys.
There's nothing in where they can do about it.

901
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:57.470
Fuck takes him,
kills him,
dragged him in the water again,

902
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:59.550
it goes back on the other ice island.

903
00:50:59.551 --> 00:51:02.120
Just starts eating them and they're just chilling,
watching it.

904
00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:06.320
And there are one ice island away hoping that he doesn't stay hungry after eats

905
00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:10.400
their friend elbows.
Your least favorite friend and the boat comes and rescues.

906
00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:13.820
Fuck me dude.
And they had to watch her.
Frank get eaten alive.

907
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.610
The friend got eaten alive.
He died.
Probably quit it probably.

908
00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:20.090
It probably ate them in front of them.
It probably took us so they could see it.

909
00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.160
He didn't care.
Yeah,
that's what I mean.

910
00:51:22.161 --> 00:51:25.310
Like he'll eat worry when you eat a clam that you're eating in front of other

911
00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:28.760
claims in front of Napster.
I'm sure he,
fuck,

912
00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:30.970
I'm sure the bear ate it to know they want to heap.

913
00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:33.950
I'm saying he kept an eye on them.
Yes.
As like your next dude.

914
00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:37.490
Well he probably knows that they're there.
If this isn't enough,

915
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:42.320
you me,
maybe the guy is like a small guy.
What do you do?
You,
what do you do it?

916
00:51:42.321 --> 00:51:44.630
You just sit there and watch it.
You jump in the water.
What do you,

917
00:51:44.631 --> 00:51:46.550
what do you fucking do?
You can't swim away.

918
00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:49.700
You'll freeze to death if you get in that water.
You just kind of sit,
sit up.

919
00:51:49.701 --> 00:51:51.860
The fact that if a chooses to kill you,
that's your time.

920
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:54.350
There's nothing else you can do.
You can't fight it off.

921
00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:56.690
I would punch my buddy and knock them out so it's easier than,

922
00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:59.170
you know what I mean?
Knock 'em out,
buddy.
Huh?

923
00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:01.280
You have to think about how much you love your friends.
Oh my God.

924
00:52:01.281 --> 00:52:04.010
There's so many people I'd knock out,
Lee for bears to eat.
There's,
yeah,

925
00:52:04.011 --> 00:52:08.600
there's a lot of people.
Most most of my friends I know,
but what it is,

926
00:52:08.601 --> 00:52:10.370
is just,
it's,

927
00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:14.300
it's an escapable with the power that it has.

928
00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.930
Have you had a moment of near death experience?
Never like that.
Never.
Never.

929
00:52:17.931 --> 00:52:19.370
Never around the animal like that.

930
00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:22.880
Have you ever had a near death experience where you're like,
fuck,
I could die.

931
00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.670
Car Accidents.
Car Accidents.
Yeah.

932
00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:27.890
That's the only time I thought I might say this is kind of a near death

933
00:52:27.891 --> 00:52:30.680
experience.
It is.
Never know.
Have you not been in a bad one?

934
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:34.580
I've been in some bad ones.
I've been lucky.
That's near death shit.
Yeah.

935
00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:39.110
You ever ride bikes?
Motorcycles?
No one's gonna know that's your desk show.

936
00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.300
People I knew crashed in one person I knew,

937
00:52:41.301 --> 00:52:45.920
saw someone get hit all in like a month.
It was like bang,
Bang.

938
00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.290
So to people I know crash fuck themselves up.

939
00:52:48.291 --> 00:52:51.560
One was the dude that I was working with,
m and A.

940
00:52:51.561 --> 00:52:56.330
Another was a frank mir was fighting in the UFC.
He was uh,
you know,

941
00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:59.870
one of the best heavyweights in the planet and some guy ran a red light and t

942
00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:03.320
boned them,
snapped his leg in half,
sent him flying through the air.

943
00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:07.920
It had a real problem.
I mean,
he almost lost his leg,
man.
Nobody's lucky lived.

944
00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.980
But the femurs like the big upper leg,
that's a really bad bone to break man.

945
00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:15.860
Usually.
Yeah,
it takes a long time to heal.
It's very dangerous.
A lot of,

946
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:17.560
a lot of blood flows through that area.

947
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:21.380
The main arteries they can fuck it takes a long time for that leg comes back.

948
00:53:21.381 --> 00:53:21.951
And for frank,

949
00:53:21.951 --> 00:53:26.730
it was years before he was like 100% again and arguably he never was the same.

950
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.850
It's arguable that something like that you're,

951
00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:31.590
you're always going to be like playing catch up you guys.

952
00:53:31.591 --> 00:53:34.110
It's such a devastating injury.
Lots.
Fuck.
I mean,

953
00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:38.040
sounds like fuck motorcycles man.
It's too much on protecting.
Yeah.
Woo.

954
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.230
I'm fucking on the outside man.
But we lived in,

955
00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.870
well I was gonna say if you lived in a rural area,

956
00:53:42.871 --> 00:53:46.050
but did you hear about that guy that plowed into these bikers?

957
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.600
He was in a pickup truck.
Yeah.

958
00:53:48.601 --> 00:53:52.470
It was in a pickup truck in New Hampshire and there was this,
uh,

959
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:56.130
I think they call themselves the jar head bike club or something like that.

960
00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:59.220
A bunch of marines that got together and rode their bikes around and this guy

961
00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:03.510
plowed into them and killed like seven on purpose.
No,

962
00:54:03.511 --> 00:54:05.970
I don't know what happened.
I don't know.

963
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:11.730
I don't know if he was being careless.
If,
if he was speeding.
I don't know.

964
00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:16.350
It's fucked up,
dude.
Where was New Hampshire?
New Hampshire.
So I was going to say,

965
00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:18.930
yeah,
I drive a motorcycle on some rural road,

966
00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:22.500
but at some rural roads you gotta worry about people not paying attention.
Right.

967
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.770
You move out to the middle of nowhere.
You still don't fucking know Stephen King.

968
00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:29.850
Remember what happened to him?
Stephen King got hit by a guy who was a,

969
00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:30.571
I think he like,

970
00:54:30.571 --> 00:54:35.571
he dropped something in his car and so he was leaning over to pick up whatever

971
00:54:35.581 --> 00:54:38.730
the fuck he left and his vans.
Stephen King was walking by the side of the road.

972
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.930
Maybe it was his dog.
I feel like maybe it was his dog was doing something.

973
00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:47.960
Anyway,
the guy wasn't looking and hit him and it just broke everything.
Damion,

974
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.500
his whole body was broken.

975
00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:53.610
He had several broken bones who's fucked up for a long time.

976
00:54:53.611 --> 00:54:57.720
It took him forever before he could just sit at his desk again and right and he

977
00:54:57.721 --> 00:55:01.740
details it and great and great detail and it talks about in his book on writing

978
00:55:01.741 --> 00:55:05.940
as well.
That's him with pins in his leg.
I mean there's that dog and dude,

979
00:55:05.941 --> 00:55:08.720
he was older at the time.
I mean he wasn't a young guy.

980
00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:12.720
He's always looked old for some reason to Stephen King has always looked like

981
00:55:12.721 --> 00:55:14.100
every time I see a photo I'm like,
what is he fucking,

982
00:55:14.101 --> 00:55:16.560
he's always 50 he's been 50 since he was born.
Well Bro,

983
00:55:16.561 --> 00:55:19.420
if you carrying around that kind of eagle inside your bag,

984
00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.170
that's what I'm saying.
Right.
That fucked up shit as made him look old.

985
00:55:22.171 --> 00:55:26.800
Always that guy.
What is this Stephen King calls?
Maybe it's not his strange.

986
00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:32.950
Let's not go down a little Google rabbit hole
forever.

987
00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:37.680
Stephen King me think about how many amazing books that guy is written.

988
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:40.350
Think about the diversity of them by the way.
Yeah,
they're not all the same.

989
00:55:40.351 --> 00:55:43.710
Kind of like people always go like Stephen King whore.
He's done with drama.

990
00:55:43.711 --> 00:55:46.320
He's done a lot of different kinds of different things,
but you know what I like?

991
00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:49.560
He almost always made it a writer from Maine.

992
00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:55.590
It was the guy from Maine and then this crazy shit would happen to him.

993
00:55:55.770 --> 00:55:59.460
That's fucking like many of his stories.
Not all of them,
but many,
many stories.

994
00:55:59.461 --> 00:56:03.910
Where a guy from Maine did he write Shawshank redemption?
Yup.
Yup.
Right.

995
00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:06.320
Based off at least.
Yeah,
Dude.
You know what,
I love the story,

996
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.830
but to think about that the,
he wrote that,

997
00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:11.670
that beautiful and the rest of his shit is very dark.

998
00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:15.990
So much of us as black is nice.
Got so much good stuff,
man.
I mean,

999
00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:20.880
he's got so much good.
Did you ever read the Tommy knockers?
It's fun,
man.

1000
00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:24.220
It's about,
uh,
like an alien that the crash

1001
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:27.290
<v 0>lands in the woods and a,
I don't want to give any spoilers.</v>

1002
00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:31.360
[inaudible] starts changing people.
What is Tommy knocker mean?
What the fuck?

1003
00:56:31.361 --> 00:56:32.110
I don't know,

1004
00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:37.110
but I think it was based on some like old fairy tale that people tell us.

1005
00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:41.830
Learning the old words like that.
Tom,
Tom Walker,
find out what it is.

1006
00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:44.890
Let's find out what this word.
Hey,
I want,
I have a word for you.
Like a,

1007
00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:48.220
like Candyman,
you know,
that kind of thing.
Here's a word.
I have a word for you.

1008
00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:51.070
There was a word that I heard that I thought it was very funny that I wrote down

1009
00:56:51.071 --> 00:56:52.870
that I was like,
oh Joel,
think that's fucking wild.

1010
00:56:52.871 --> 00:56:55.540
But I like when I learned a new word,
I go,
oh,
that's fucking,

1011
00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:58.870
I always admire you again.
When I see you,
I'll realize no case.

1012
00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:03.070
I don't give a few rocks.
No case.
Jamie.
Jamie rocks.
No case to.

1013
00:57:03.071 --> 00:57:07.090
He's recently along this whole phone since I got the gold one.
The new iPhone.

1014
00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:09.580
How many months has it been since you've been rocking notes?
October.

1015
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:14.080
Do you feel free?
You feel better?
I've only,
I only had the case for one phone.

1016
00:57:14.081 --> 00:57:18.160
I guess.
You feel better than other people?
No,
I would not feel riskier.

1017
00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:21.610
I would feel like more like you're really living on every day you make it a

1018
00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:22.563
success.

1019
00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:26.770
I so admire how Neil degrasse Tyson explained it when he's twirling it around

1020
00:57:26.771 --> 00:57:27.580
his fingers.

1021
00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:32.580
I've made some catches that may be is gained ability because of doing that.

1022
00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:35.890
Right.
Otherwise I might just let it drop if it was in one of them,

1023
00:57:35.891 --> 00:57:40.600
like odd or cases or something.
Otterbox and thick ones.
This doesn't ever,
I,

1024
00:57:40.601 --> 00:57:44.800
I,
I've said that.
I said the same thing,
not to cop and Neil degrasse Tyson Shit,

1025
00:57:44.801 --> 00:57:48.450
but I love,
love the design of this.
Yes.
If I don't want to be,

1026
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:50.310
you've always said you love that.
I love,

1027
00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:54.420
it's beautiful and I see people with these huge cases,
otterbox and care,

1028
00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:56.920
so fucking throat off a cliff.
What am I throwing my phone off?
I fucking Gli.

1029
00:57:56.921 --> 00:58:00.090
Are you throwing your phone?
But also what?
Sorry,
got Tommy knockers guy.

1030
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:04.230
But also by the way,
we're all stoned folks,

1031
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:09.850
but also I think about it in the sense of,
I know this sounds privileged,
fine,

1032
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:12.840
but I have apple care,
which isn't that expensive or you,

1033
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:17.630
if it's like 20 bucks,
what the fuck you're take that.

1034
00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:23.680
Jeez,
I don't give a fuck Joe Rogan.
You don't give a fuck.
What does Tommy know?

1035
00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:29.140
It's based off of knockers who would've been minors trapped in a cave and

1036
00:58:29.141 --> 00:58:32.380
would've been pounding on rocks to get rescued in his book?

1037
00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:37.430
It's the aliens underground who are trapping on knocking on,
oh,

1038
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:40.540
you should try it.
I don't remember the exact premise.

1039
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:43.180
I knew that they were doing something that was changing the people.

1040
00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:47.430
They made a really kind of funky movie.
It wasn't like the best movie.
It wasn't,

1041
00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:51.810
it wasn't a good film.
TV.
Fucking was it for TV series for TV?

1042
00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:55.150
How many episodes?
Four or five.
I don't.

1043
00:58:55.151 --> 00:58:59.350
It's one of those ones where you almost got an imagine in your head and that's

1044
00:58:59.351 --> 00:59:01.030
an asshole thing to say cause like,

1045
00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:04.840
like I used to have a joke about game of Thrones.
People say he's booked voter.

1046
00:59:04.841 --> 00:59:06.550
I'm like how is that possible?

1047
00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:10.660
You watching real dragons and people fucking and then sword fight.

1048
00:59:10.661 --> 00:59:13.690
It's impossible and you're going to tell me that shows two episodes.

1049
00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:16.390
So two hours.
That movie,

1050
00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:19.000
if you wanted to really figure out what the book is,

1051
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:22.100
it would have to be hours and hours and hours.
That book was

1052
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:26.660
<v 2>nuanced.
The book got into psychology.
What was the other one?</v>

1053
00:59:26.790 --> 00:59:31.000
Where the dudes were in the woods in some alien crawled inside that guy's ass

1054
00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:36.140
hole and killed them.
Which one was that one?
Yeah.
Family Reunion.

1055
00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:40.320
No,
there was like some alien thing.
I crawled in his ass and kill them.
Yeah.

1056
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:43.610
It would take over these people who would take over these people.
It was in the,

1057
00:59:43.611 --> 00:59:47.300
in the guy's toilet.
You know who it was?
It was the guy who was in that,

1058
00:59:47.301 --> 00:59:51.620
a HBO series.
A homeland.
Oh.

1059
00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:55.700
Uh,
Mandy Patinkin knows the guy who was captured.

1060
00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:58.700
He was captured and he was turned over the red headed dude.

1061
01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:03.560
What the fuck is that guy's name?
What the fuck is that guy talking about?

1062
01:00:03.561 --> 01:00:05.630
But this is a newer case.
We can figure this out.

1063
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:10.550
We're going to get to this part over this.
Well,
it that,
first of all,

1064
01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:13.250
that guy,
find out the TV,

1065
01:00:13.251 --> 01:00:16.760
show homeland for season and then you'll find the guy's name.
He's on billions.

1066
01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:19.640
Billions.
That's right.
That guy cause an awesome actor.

1067
01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.900
You know that guy has an English accent.
Yeah.
Does,
yeah.
Crazy.

1068
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:27.020
I know that as good as he is and I can even in American,
that's creepy.
Well,

1069
01:00:27.021 --> 01:00:31.250
it's Kinda like,
what's his name?
Uh,
walking dead guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Same Guy.
I mean,

1070
01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:35.350
same thing.
How are you dare you're wait,
we also false.
Me and Louis.

1071
01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:36.800
Damian Lewis and Lewis.
Okay.

1072
01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:41.980
Go to Damien Lewis's IMD B and there was a movie that he did a few years back.

1073
01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:45.440
There was a good fucking movie.
It was a Stephen and candid.

1074
01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:47.660
I wasn't in the right one,
I just never heard of.
It's called dream catcher.

1075
01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:52.160
Dream catcher.
I was thinking white trash.
That's why I was thinking white trash.

1076
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:56.490
I was like,
why trash white trash trailer,
trash dream catcher.

1077
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:59.780
Same kind of thing though.
You know that is true dream catchers.

1078
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.270
That is the Barb wire around the bicep.

1079
01:01:02.271 --> 01:01:05.080
Tattoo of the house of couture myths.

1080
01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:11.560
Catcher.
Yeah.
Why do people love people love whenever you see someone had one,

1081
01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:16.100
you were like,
fuck man.
Bummer,
bummer.
My kids were shells.

1082
01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:20.120
Yeah.
When you had your child,
when your child just learns about the world,

1083
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:22.490
it's just not a good piece of art.
I'm sorry.

1084
01:01:22.890 --> 01:01:25.790
Adults think it's one or framed cuts or sucks.
Yeah,
right.

1085
01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.700
You notice everyone that catches a drug that has a dream catcher hasn't caught

1086
01:01:28.701 --> 01:01:32.710
one dream yet.
They're fucking shit.
It's true.
It's a dream thief to dreams.

1087
01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:34.430
Dreams.
Yeah.
Catches him,

1088
01:01:34.431 --> 01:01:36.620
but you don't fucking get them dumb in front a girls house.

1089
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:41.240
Imagine if you were single and after all this conversation,
the girl you dreams,

1090
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:46.010
goddamn dream catcher over the bed and you're like,
fuck,

1091
01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.980
she's perfect in every single way.
But she,

1092
01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.660
she believes in astrology and she has a to of catcher.

1093
01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:57.770
It's my,
it was so right.
It was exactly who I am.

1094
01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:03.470
She makes you said I was smart and creative and gifted and that I'm beyond

1095
01:02:03.471 --> 01:02:07.370
generous to my friends.
Just totally true.
She will not see that rubbed.
Uh,

1096
01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:10.130
what is the crystals are gems in your hand before you fuck.
She's like,

1097
01:02:10.131 --> 01:02:14.660
can you roll these in your risks before we,
we'll do a match your intentions.

1098
01:02:14.850 --> 01:02:19.230
They'll change colors.
If you're really your true self,
be me.
I'll be you,
bro.

1099
01:02:19.231 --> 01:02:20.064
How often when you,

1100
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.550
<v 0>when somebody goes,
what's your astrological side?
I'm always like,
oh,</v>

1101
01:02:23.551 --> 01:02:25.880
get the fuck up.
Get the fuck away from me.
Yeah,

1102
01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:29.460
but I am a Leo and Leo's are supposed to be kind of Douchey and a little bit of

1103
01:02:29.461 --> 01:02:31.770
a way.
Oh,
well they're the very aggressive.

1104
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:34.970
What is this supposed to be supposed to be like?
Confidence in like them.

1105
01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:38.100
Bullshit.
I'm a Libra.
Does that mean I'm like every fucking guy born in October.

1106
01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:41.090
That's absurd.
No children form

1107
01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.800
boys and then you would get banned from Facebook for being racist,
Libra voice.

1108
01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:51.690
It'd be all white guys would be like the new proud boys,
not boys by the way.

1109
01:02:51.691 --> 01:02:53.790
I can't wait for sober October for me to keep drinking.

1110
01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:56.310
I want to come on the show and have a drink just to watch you guys battle

1111
01:02:56.311 --> 01:02:59.700
nonsense.
I don't know what we're going to do.
Whatever you do.

1112
01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:01.980
I'm still not going to be sober.
It's my birthday month.
I can't fuck with that.

1113
01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:06.390
The real problem is the time commitment.
Like I have too many Goddamn Pie.

1114
01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:10.680
I've podcasts that are booked all the way up to then and I know there's going to

1115
01:03:10.681 --> 01:03:14.850
be a lot of shit I have to do.
I can't dedicate too much time.

1116
01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:17.610
I can't do what I did last year.
Let's do the snickers challenge.

1117
01:03:17.611 --> 01:03:19.980
I think that's the best way to do it.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.

1118
01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.930
What have you doing different kind of chapter that I know voted,

1119
01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:24.510
but what about a different kind of challenge would tap out first,

1120
01:03:24.511 --> 01:03:26.910
but you guys keep your fucking shitty headaches.

1121
01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:32.040
I'm going to go have a salad.
There's going to,
we're going to do a deep fake.

1122
01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:33.870
Somebody with deep fake of Joe eating snickers.

1123
01:03:33.871 --> 01:03:37.110
Just fake fucking make it a phony.
That was the other thing.

1124
01:03:37.111 --> 01:03:40.410
Like we had an idea of like who can read the most books?
The most pages.

1125
01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:43.280
But the problem with that,
Burt would go road road

1126
01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:49.470
<v 2>pound through all the pages.
Number one,
he can't read but he'll lie.
Look,</v>

1127
01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:52.560
I asked him if he could do the split goes,
Yo,
can you split?
I go,

1128
01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:54.150
I can do this split.
He goes do it.

1129
01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:57.840
So I did this basically I was like an inch off the ground and he's like,

1130
01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.980
oh you really do.
So he went to do it.
He's like,
couldn't do it at all.

1131
01:04:01.981 --> 01:04:03.690
He said the girl a montly flexible.

1132
01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:06.150
It's not like there was a time in his life we could do the split,

1133
01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:10.490
but here he is 44 years old,
fake.
And he can do the splits.
I'm like,

1134
01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.360
what are you doing bird?
Why would you lie about,

1135
01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:14.810
<v 0>he might seem like a guy that could do this stuff for a guy that's been sitting</v>

1136
01:04:14.811 --> 01:04:16.740
on Dick for that many years,
I figured he could do the split,

1137
01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.390
so you know what I mean?
For bouncing around so much cock.

1138
01:04:20.391 --> 01:04:23.930
I'm surprised bird doesn't do the splits.
He's just a funny dude.
I can't.

1139
01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.150
I can't let that happen now.
Fuck that.
Kayla thought,
well,
I'm going to,

1140
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:30.590
I want to be invited so I can sit with Jamie and have a drink and get high and

1141
01:04:30.591 --> 01:04:34.640
while you guys use sober shit,
it has to be some sort of a little test.

1142
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:39.140
You can't,
it just can't be too involved.
I just,
I can't do it anymore.
Yeah.

1143
01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:42.950
Get me and Jamie one of those bubbles so we can just get high and drunk and Rolo

1144
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:46.180
.
Yeah,
give me the bubbles,
but it's just the new feature.
The Joe Rogan.
I know.

1145
01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:47.960
I love the bubble machine.

1146
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:52.790
First featured and then Duncan Trussell podcast number 1313 it was Duncan's

1147
01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:54.950
requests that he be beyond that spiritual number.

1148
01:04:55.550 --> 01:04:59.030
Spiritual numbers are really important.
Please spreading around.

1149
01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:02.750
Have you ever used acupuncture?
Acupuncture?
I have.
I love it.
Is it legit?

1150
01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:06.290
It's legit as fuck.
I love.
Interesting.
It's wonderful.
They say it's legit.

1151
01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.570
You've never done it?
No.
Yeah,
I did do it once,

1152
01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:12.680
but I did it with a dude who did some,
he just was a little,
a little weird.

1153
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:15.830
He wanted you to drink certain herbs and shit and he couldn't tell you why.

1154
01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:18.040
I just went to a fire.
I just

1155
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:18.500
<v 3>want to,</v>

1156
01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:21.460
I just went to a fucking dope acupuncturist and got it done and it's great.

1157
01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.640
Now I my face,
fuck me up.
I didn't like my face was getting fucked me up.

1158
01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.330
<v 0>Ooh,
that scared me all over your face everywhere.
No,
no.</v>

1159
01:05:28.690 --> 01:05:31.390
Your sinuses while your eyes.
Boop.
Boop.
Like in your side,

1160
01:05:31.391 --> 01:05:34.460
if they could fix your eyes,
if you can make your eyes perfect.

1161
01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:38.230
2020 vision like maybe it was slipping.
I'm 1920 I think.

1162
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:42.260
What if it got to like 40,
40,
66,
sorry,
getting tired.

1163
01:05:42.290 --> 01:05:45.130
I can see shit through three feet of ice to the opposite or the other way.

1164
01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:48.760
What is it like?
No,
eight eight is like the most insane vision ever.

1165
01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:52.500
Like is it smaller number?
As small as it is,
the better vision?
Yeah.

1166
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:56.920
So I'm saying 50,
50 bro.
You'd be blind as fuck.
I'm 50,
50.

1167
01:05:57.010 --> 01:05:59.890
But all they can do,
they can fix it.
But you got to keep your eyes open.

1168
01:05:59.891 --> 01:06:03.210
Like look,
that movie,
um,
clockwork orange pop,

1169
01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:06.670
pop your eyes open and just acupro puncture the show your eyeballs.

1170
01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.960
So are you looking up?
I see these spears coming out of your eyeballs,

1171
01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.060
so just people get tattoos on their,
on their fucking eyes.

1172
01:06:13.061 --> 01:06:14.830
Have you seen that shit?
They get them on the whites of their eyes.

1173
01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:19.690
You did a bad thing.
Bad person,
dumb person tattoo.

1174
01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:23.290
You're fucking eyeballs day.
I see someone like that.
I a male in your life.

1175
01:06:23.291 --> 01:06:27.340
Imagine being that guy's dad.
Imagine being his friend,

1176
01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:32.500
but his dad,
like you raised a boy and whatever happened,

1177
01:06:32.590 --> 01:06:36.250
whether it is a chemical imbalance or whatever happened,

1178
01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:41.050
what happened was it abuse?
What?
I don't know what happened.
Something happened.

1179
01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:46.110
<v 3>People are fucked.
Oh,
oh.
Oh that guy.
Uh,
in San Diego.</v>

1180
01:06:46.111 --> 01:06:46.910
I was telling you about this.

1181
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:50.060
A man through sandals at me this weekend at my show.
Yeah.

1182
01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:54.150
What happened is when I call them Sandal Steve,
so this is the most,

1183
01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.900
there's two embarrassing parts of the,
of this story for this man.
The show,

1184
01:06:57.930 --> 01:07:01.470
the sunny show was fucking phenomenal in San Diego was so fucking dope.

1185
01:07:01.471 --> 01:07:05.070
We sold out the weekend and then Sunday show was incredible.

1186
01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:08.310
Everyone's having a good time.
I'm joking around at the end of my show,

1187
01:07:08.311 --> 01:07:12.420
very end about people in San Diego think wearing sandals with jeans as

1188
01:07:12.421 --> 01:07:15.690
appropriate.
I was like,
that's just that San Diego is like buttoned down,

1189
01:07:15.691 --> 01:07:19.230
but I have sandals on his like Douche bags fucking have their toes out but wear

1190
01:07:19.231 --> 01:07:22.170
like pants and some guys are gay.
I'm like,
let me guess.

1191
01:07:22.171 --> 01:07:23.940
You're wearing jeans with sandals and he put,

1192
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.850
brings up the Sandal and I'm like [inaudible] Steve Sound Caesar.
But,

1193
01:07:27.030 --> 01:07:31.830
and he goes,
my name is Steve.
And I was like,
this fucking guy,
this fucking guys,

1194
01:07:31.831 --> 01:07:33.120
you record this,
that no.

1195
01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.420
And I fucking wish that was the only one I didn't fucking record course.

1196
01:07:36.421 --> 01:07:40.410
That's the universe coursing coursing.
So,
so,
so,
so I turned,

1197
01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.640
I turned to the left and this dude throws a fucking,

1198
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:48.000
I see it out of the corner of my eye,
but one of the Sandal hit the curtain,
uh,

1199
01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:50.460
are actually,
and the lawyer,
they have the old comedy store sign.

1200
01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:52.960
Do you know that they bought,
they brought that down.
The old neon?
Yeah.

1201
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:56.910
Had the old neon now hit the neon.
And I was like,

1202
01:07:57.570 --> 01:07:59.970
what the fuck was that shit?
And it kind of,

1203
01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:01.080
you know when something doesn't register,

1204
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:04.380
cause I was like no way that if he broke the neo do it bro.
Murder.

1205
01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:08.130
So I turn and then as I'm turning another sandal gets tossed on stage,

1206
01:08:08.131 --> 01:08:12.990
not thrown,
but like tossed.
And I immediately,
I was like,
wait,
what the fuck?

1207
01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:15.150
And he's going like this,
ah Bro.

1208
01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:20.060
And then fuck staff is coming up and grabbing this fucking moron and two dudes

1209
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:23.510
are standing up in the audience ready to like swing.
Like people were like,

1210
01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.300
it was a commotion and I was like,
what the fuck did,
he goes,

1211
01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.820
I'm just kidding around and we can run.
And they were like,
get the fuck out dude.

1212
01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:32.210
Get and he goes,
come on man,
I'm a big fan.
I go,
dude,
get the fuck out.

1213
01:08:32.211 --> 01:08:35.660
You can't throw shit at me.
Get the fuck out of here.
So they remove the dude.

1214
01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:40.340
But the best part or the most unfortunate part is it's his daughter's 21st

1215
01:08:40.341 --> 01:08:43.550
birthday and she's a big fan.
Right?

1216
01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:46.580
Your Shit had dad through sandals at your fucking do.

1217
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:51.620
So of course if she's listening,
I love you.
Thanks for being a fan.

1218
01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:55.910
Sorry your dad as a fucking moron and through a sandals at us cause that's how

1219
01:08:55.911 --> 01:08:59.450
you get kicked out.
Dead Sea duty through them at my fucking head.
He,

1220
01:08:59.530 --> 01:09:04.310
it missed my head by like a foot and he thinks I'm just kidding around like,

1221
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:06.020
no dude,
that's not funny.
That's what I'm saying.

1222
01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:09.300
You can't throw sandals that Pete,
you can can't throw shit at people again,

1223
01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:12.080
throw shit up and the poor girl man,
I've never seen someone so embarrassed.

1224
01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:14.700
She was getting her purse and shit and she's like,
ah,

1225
01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:17.840
you know like wavering through the crowd and the sun is like,

1226
01:09:17.841 --> 01:09:20.420
can I get back his sandals?
And I was like,
get the fuck out.

1227
01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:22.970
It doesn't usually happen.
Someone's rare,

1228
01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.420
rare you gotta you gotta do some dumb shit.
It does happen.

1229
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.550
<v 2>Hey Man,
this guy got kicked out.
The improv.
Yeah,</v>

1230
01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.130
he was heckling everybody and then when I go on stage with me,

1231
01:09:32.131 --> 01:09:35.550
he was just so loud and they just grabbed him and I go,
dude,

1232
01:09:35.551 --> 01:09:38.040
you kind of shut the fuck up man.
What do you like?
What are you doing?

1233
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:40.320
Are you doing this is ridiculous.
You know you're interrupting.

1234
01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:44.280
And they just grabbed him and the lady who was in front of him was,

1235
01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.340
who's his girlfriend go the kicking them out of sir,
you're going to leave.

1236
01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:52.200
She looks at me and she goes,
did you do this?
Do that.

1237
01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:55.800
No bitch,
you fucking problem.
He is your life in a nutshell.

1238
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:58.720
You were here with him.
You saw what happened.

1239
01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:02.490
You saw me tell the guy what the fuck are you doing man?

1240
01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:06.810
Then you saw the staff kick him out.
Then you asked me did I do this?

1241
01:10:06.810 --> 01:10:10.170
But you know I didn't do this.
You did this chill.
No,

1242
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:15.950
but imagine the kind of enabling or your right next to the guy who's yelling out

1243
01:10:16.741 --> 01:10:21.090
stupid shit interrupting the show.
You're watching the staff come over.

1244
01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:23.520
You've watching this guy get kicked out and she looks at me like,

1245
01:10:23.790 --> 01:10:28.230
did you do this?
Do this.
You gotta get your life in order,
lady.

1246
01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:31.540
Hey,
clean your room.
Clean your room.
Clean your fucking room bits.

1247
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:35.730
That's your problem.
It was so crazy.
I was like,
you saw you were here with me.

1248
01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:40.170
Yep.
The crowd was going ape shit.
They was like your fault here.
Those two people,

1249
01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:43.350
she thought it was my fault.
Everybody else thought it was hilarious.

1250
01:10:43.890 --> 01:10:48.150
The rest of the crowd is so angry at them because it's so indicative of what we

1251
01:10:48.151 --> 01:10:50.130
know to be true about certain people.

1252
01:10:50.190 --> 01:10:54.450
There are certain people that blame everyone else except themselves.

1253
01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:58.700
Totally always watching.
When you watch a guy who said she's,
she's like,

1254
01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.530
he loves you.
I was like,
Whoa,
he's ruining the fucking show.

1255
01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:05.520
Like you just don't come to a show if you can't keep your fucking your,

1256
01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:10.350
your Tourette's and check if you just want to scream shit out and just be

1257
01:11:10.351 --> 01:11:12.510
acknowledged.
It's crazy.
You're ruining the whole show.

1258
01:11:12.670 --> 01:11:15.210
That sounds the same show the Sunday show I was yet.

1259
01:11:15.211 --> 01:11:18.300
We were joking around how crazy it was in the middle of a setup.
I'm to,

1260
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:22.050
I'm about to tell a fucking set up and a guy goes,
she had Tito,

1261
01:11:22.051 --> 01:11:26.610
what's your favorite thing about San Diego?
And I was like,
what?
What?

1262
01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:30.630
And he goes,
I'll just,
I and everybody [inaudible] I mean,

1263
01:11:30.631 --> 01:11:33.570
everyone's lightened him up cause they were like,
is this the,

1264
01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:38.550
some people get so excited sometimes and I don't,
I love do.
It was a nice dude.

1265
01:11:38.551 --> 01:11:42.870
It was just like,
Bro.
Yeah,
yeah.
He got to know the rules of the thing.

1266
01:11:42.871 --> 01:11:47.400
You can't just do it.
He's been out by the beach too much.
Those guys.

1267
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:51.840
There's those guys that too much salt air and too much sun and they're cooked.

1268
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:53.480
They're like a slow,
it's like a,

1269
01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:56.850
you know how like if you're gonna smoke a piece of fish,
I'll give you,

1270
01:11:56.851 --> 01:11:59.850
put your hand in there.
It doesn't even seem like you would do anything.
Right.

1271
01:11:59.910 --> 01:12:03.120
You know,
like you seem like you'd be fine.
Yeah,
but you live there forever,

1272
01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:06.570
but you can't have to like four or five hours.
It become a smoke piece of fish.

1273
01:12:06.850 --> 01:12:10.370
Right.
That's an happens to those dudes.
Brains smoke fish certain amount.

1274
01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:13.560
Those guys,
brains that are always by the beach,
they don't drink enough water.

1275
01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:19.090
They just get old and leathery and therefore their brains leathery.

1276
01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.360
Yeah.
Well,
you see them in the outside.
The look,
leathery.

1277
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:25.050
Their brain looks like that too,
man.
Right?
I'm not a doctor there smoked.

1278
01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:28.670
They smoked and they come to the show.
They're slowly smoked.
Every man I fucking,

1279
01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:32.190
I fucking love.
Who's willing?
I'll fucking love.

1280
01:12:32.191 --> 01:12:35.940
You did too,
by the way of so many.
I had a bunch of Mexican fans.

1281
01:12:35.941 --> 01:12:36.870
I love my Mexican fans.

1282
01:12:37.050 --> 01:12:39.630
Cat showed up in San Diego on all of these dudes ever after the show.
We're like,

1283
01:12:39.631 --> 01:12:43.680
you want us to fuck that dude up dog,
the fucking Sandal,
dude.
I was like,
hey man,

1284
01:12:43.770 --> 01:12:47.590
am I going to,
you do whatever you want to do.
Don't right now.
Denton.

1285
01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:50.610
Don't ask Mexicans to beat up white people right now.
It's a bad time.

1286
01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.820
I'm imploring all Mexicans to beat up Mexicans.
All this wall talk.

1287
01:12:53.821 --> 01:12:55.710
They'll throw in a few extra shots.
Skins should beat up.

1288
01:12:55.711 --> 01:12:59.010
Everybody beat up everybody.
Mexicans that Sandra Santina was saying,

1289
01:12:59.011 --> 01:13:02.580
they might have my favorite food,
a period about this.

1290
01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:08.160
I think my skin's not my favorite food.
Well,
here's the thing.

1291
01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:12.600
Honestly,
it really varies.
Like sometimes my favorite food is steak.

1292
01:13:12.601 --> 01:13:14.400
Sometimes I fear food is Italian,

1293
01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:19.410
but my favorite food when I know I probably shouldn't be net,

1294
01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:23.320
but I want to eat it anyway,
is like a languid case.

1295
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:25.910
Dia from a real Mexican joint,
like that place.

1296
01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:29.970
I've taken you guys to the one that this is a joint in the valley.
You go there,

1297
01:13:29.971 --> 01:13:34.770
they have Mexican,
um,
uh Oh soap operas on TV.
Those girls,

1298
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:36.980
the big tits and the red dresses always,
right?
Yep.

1299
01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.960
And everyone in there is like locals.

1300
01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.780
They're like a bunch of dudes who are getting off work or know about.

1301
01:13:42.781 --> 01:13:45.150
It's like a real small hole in the wall type place.

1302
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:48.810
Everyone speaks Spanish 100% everything's written in Spanish.

1303
01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:52.230
Food is off the fucking charts,
dude.
It's off the charts.

1304
01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:56.490
It you get Lang Lang what case at dia,
Bro.
With the spicy sauce.

1305
01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:00.560
Don't want to kind of meet as in their language.
Tongue language.
Beef.

1306
01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:05.010
It's beef tongue.
Sensational Dude.
It's so good.
I'm going get one of those.

1307
01:14:05.011 --> 01:14:07.740
They have all kinds of tacos.
Oh my God.

1308
01:14:07.741 --> 01:14:11.320
What's your death row meal then is Mexican and your death row meal before I go

1309
01:14:11.650 --> 01:14:13.570
fund really?
Shit probably kill me.

1310
01:14:13.610 --> 01:14:16.270
You want me to have a good time eating lobster first?
Fuck you.

1311
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:19.330
I'm meeting death row man.
Shit.
I mean all of that shit.

1312
01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:21.760
I'm just thinking of trying to take them one guy out when he tries to get me

1313
01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:26.500
from the jail.
That's all my concentration's on.
Come get me,
bitch.

1314
01:14:26.770 --> 01:14:31.330
I'm eating.
If you gotta kill me,
come on man.
Not eating a lobster.
Well,

1315
01:14:31.331 --> 01:14:35.140
I'm not gonna get a fucking lobster.
I'm trying to figure out a way to kill you.

1316
01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:37.750
If they're trying to kill you,
you're trying to figure out where they kill them.

1317
01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:42.010
I'm taking somebody's just one guard gets murdered.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1318
01:14:42.011 --> 01:14:44.260
That's a good way out.
I'll fuck up one time.

1319
01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.880
Don't you think you would be thinking that way?

1320
01:14:46.330 --> 01:14:47.390
They're going to drag you to your,

1321
01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.620
unless you did something horrific and you want to die and you know you're

1322
01:14:50.621 --> 01:14:55.030
terrible.
What if you were wrongfully accused of,
you're wrong.
If you,

1323
01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:57.400
I'm wrongfully accused and I'm on death row.

1324
01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:00.910
I'm trying to kill somebody or you kill yourself when they get to you,

1325
01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:04.690
but how do you so hard in jail?
They make it real hard.

1326
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:08.530
They keep things from you that you could kill yourself with,
which is horrific,

1327
01:15:09.230 --> 01:15:12.170
and it puts you in just the promise.
You could kill somebody else with it,
right?

1328
01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:14.620
They left some wire with fucking handles on it.

1329
01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.430
You're not going to turn that in,
right?
That's going to get,

1330
01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:22.680
that's gonna get passed around some,
some dudes are going to die.
Yeah,
but I,

1331
01:15:22.681 --> 01:15:25.390
but I do think though,
if death row with death rows coming up on you,

1332
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:28.960
you're thinking a lot differently.
You're not thinking about killing the guards.

1333
01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:32.900
You thinking about fucking
please God people,

1334
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:34.990
people find God when they're about to die.
You do.

1335
01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:38.380
But the way to avoid those horrific thoughts is to plan a murder.

1336
01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:45.580
Just stick.
Like how fast can I get to one of these guys before they can,

1337
01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:49.660
they can pile up on me.
I think about what it would take about.

1338
01:15:49.661 --> 01:15:53.800
What does it take though to get to that place when you're like,
that's it.

1339
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:57.370
I'm going to have to fucking just kill everyone.
I see shoes cause I'm done.

1340
01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:00.160
That's always like the appeal of a show like the punisher,

1341
01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:02.200
like the comic book they ever did.

1342
01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:05.320
They always did a shit job with that fucking comic book.

1343
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:07.780
I mean I heard the punisher on Netflix is good.

1344
01:16:07.781 --> 01:16:11.620
I didn't see that in movies like that had a dolphin Lungren movie and he didn't

1345
01:16:11.621 --> 01:16:15.400
even have real stubble.
It's the dumbest shit of all time because by the way,

1346
01:16:15.401 --> 01:16:18.040
this was before HCC is feared.

1347
01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:21.070
They faked his stubble and obviously fake

1348
01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:26.320
VSP coffee grounds.
It looked so bad.
It looks like bad.

1349
01:16:26.321 --> 01:16:27.790
Stipple like little rascals.

1350
01:16:27.791 --> 01:16:31.600
Sponge dipped it in some dirt and rubbed it on his face and they pretended that

1351
01:16:31.601 --> 01:16:35.200
it was a five o'clock shadow.
I mean,
whoever the fucking makeup artists was,

1352
01:16:35.201 --> 01:16:38.830
they should've got the fucking academy award for Paris Shit ever.

1353
01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:40.780
But it's like almost like they made it a comedy.

1354
01:16:40.810 --> 01:16:43.910
It's almost like they know this movie's a piece of Shit and they are gonna make

1355
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:48.430
the makeup so bad and so dumb looking.
Hey,
that's us.
That's us,
dude.

1356
01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:52.120
They're going to make the makeup looking so dumb that nobody believes it's real.

1357
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:55.020
Close it up,
buddy young.
He is their doll figure.

1358
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:59.980
It's not clear and it's not clear.
The other thing is not an HD.
Yeah,

1359
01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:04.870
well it God damn dude,
it looks so fake.
It's hard to tell,

1360
01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:10.010
but that is that you can watch the actual movie.
Did you Google Lundgren?

1361
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:13.940
<v 0>Fake stubble punished.
I just did punish or just so we could see pictures from,</v>

1362
01:17:13.941 --> 01:17:17.240
I didn't want to have anything Dr. Okay.
Just write Dolph Lundgren.

1363
01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:22.160
Punish or fake stubble.
Just try that fake stubble.

1364
01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.690
Can we have that?
Maybe nobody notices but me,
we have that Mike special anymore.

1365
01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:30.840
Where is that?
Where is it?
There is,
oh,
the Mike Tyson fashion.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1366
01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:33.530
Let's have some more.
That was a close up.
I remember there was a close up.

1367
01:17:33.531 --> 01:17:36.050
He was like lying down.
I was like,
this is so fake.
Well,

1368
01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:38.780
I mean right there you can tell.
It looks like shit.
It's hard to tell.

1369
01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:44.240
Like I remember watching on TV going,
what?
What is this?
That looks bad.

1370
01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.620
All right.
There you go.
There you go.
Yeah.

1371
01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:52.410
It's much stringy sideburns counting down to it's dusted his face with some

1372
01:17:52.461 --> 01:17:54.980
dirt.
It looks like.
It's like when,
uh,
when,
uh,
that,
you know what?

1373
01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:57.800
That's like one kid in junior high is trying to get facial hair for the first

1374
01:17:57.801 --> 01:18:01.790
time
he's got a sniper accentuates.
Yeah.

1375
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:06.110
I've been thinking a rock and a police mustache.
Fuck you.
No Way.

1376
01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:09.320
You've got to get a bushy one though.
It's gotta be bullshit.

1377
01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:10.700
You've got to get real bullshit.

1378
01:18:11.150 --> 01:18:15.260
How about one like Mike Beltrani roll up the fucking,
the hairs grow along.

1379
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:18.030
You've got to get like Woolford Brimley you know,
you've got to get Mike.

1380
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:19.970
You know Mike Beltrani is no,
I'm talking about no,

1381
01:18:20.150 --> 01:18:24.560
he's what top MMA referees and,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
I've seen that dude.

1382
01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:28.850
His mustache comes down like this.
Like Cinderella's hair.

1383
01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.630
He's got like a yeah,
handlebars.
Yeah.
Handlebars Jack.
Dude too.

1384
01:18:34.050 --> 01:18:38.360
With crazy ass mustache.
You would do,
you wouldn't fucking do a mustache.

1385
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:41.050
Maybe I'll do one like that.
There's Mike Bell.
Try and look at that shit.
Yes.

1386
01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:43.850
Do you have to grow that mustache for decades?
I know,

1387
01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:46.130
but how long does it take to grow a mustache?
Like that?
Forever.

1388
01:18:46.131 --> 01:18:48.170
But braiding it kind of,
I mean,
dude,
come on,

1389
01:18:48.330 --> 01:18:50.650
you get an extension attitude so you could scan some time.
Shit,

1390
01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:51.920
I wouldn't lie like that.

1391
01:18:54.690 --> 01:18:58.310
I'd wear last extension.
One guy has to have done that one hour fucking mustache.

1392
01:18:58.311 --> 01:19:00.510
We've,
yeah,
maybe someone's done that.
Yeah,

1393
01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:03.570
I would imagine maybe as trophy or something like that.
Oh,
it's right over here.

1394
01:19:05.410 --> 01:19:09.380
The mustache we've,
it's a look.
Right.

1395
01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:10.760
But at a certain point in time,

1396
01:19:10.761 --> 01:19:13.880
I would imagine you become like prisoner to that look.
Yeah.

1397
01:19:13.881 --> 01:19:15.810
The two of you are then forever.
Yeah.

1398
01:19:16.510 --> 01:19:20.450
Like I've had a beard for as long as I can remember and so now if I shave it,

1399
01:19:20.451 --> 01:19:22.910
I'm fucked.
You can't,
I can't shave this worried about it.

1400
01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:26.270
It's Kinda strange that I can never get away from it.
Now this is it.

1401
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:27.920
I didn't think about until you brought it up.

1402
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:31.100
You've never seen me without a beard.
Who's this cat?
This is the,

1403
01:19:31.190 --> 01:19:34.190
I remember playing in a band with this guy and I'm pretty sure part of this

1404
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:37.150
we'll play in the band with this guy.
Yes.
This is not on them under the bus.

1405
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:39.500
Not In his band,
but my band played with them.

1406
01:19:39.501 --> 01:19:42.830
We opened up for this as a singer from Mudvayne.
Part of it is not real,

1407
01:19:42.831 --> 01:19:44.930
but part of it is real.
He does have a really long one,

1408
01:19:44.931 --> 01:19:49.100
but I remember seeing it up close like it was like a rope or something like God

1409
01:19:49.101 --> 01:19:53.420
damn,
it's crazy how long you can grow a fucking beard.
That's absurd.

1410
01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:56.690
That exists.
Like why does hair on the head grow so long?

1411
01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.270
What does hair and the face grow to those lengths?

1412
01:19:59.271 --> 01:20:02.170
It doesn't seem like it'd be useful.
Well,
why would nature do that?
Yeah,

1413
01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:05.180
why would we need it?
Because like arm hair doesn't grow that long.

1414
01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.880
It does need to anymore.
I have a wide,
his beard hair grow long.

1415
01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.950
An arm hair stops.
Well I think it's,

1416
01:20:11.190 --> 01:20:14.670
I think it's probably cause a hole in that weird though.
Well that's like,

1417
01:20:14.671 --> 01:20:16.410
you know,
you don't know the crown of the head hair.

1418
01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:19.960
You know this head hair here like yes.
This will never ever fall out.
It's,

1419
01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:24.260
it's genetically.
Biologically the hairs will never fall out on this crime.

1420
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:26.940
That's right.
When you see someone that anybody says completely bald still here,

1421
01:20:27.090 --> 01:20:31.020
we'll have hair right here.
You have to have hair right here.
They'll forever.

1422
01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:32.011
That is weird.

1423
01:20:32.011 --> 01:20:35.810
But like what I don't understand is like why can the hair on your head gross on

1424
01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.380
long and the hair your beer gross along,

1425
01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.690
but your arm here and leg here is always the same legs,

1426
01:20:40.050 --> 01:20:45.030
but your pre pubes can get rather unruly.
Jamie starts a trim.

1427
01:20:45.031 --> 01:20:49.800
You fucking filthy cont you can get your pubes get out of control.

1428
01:20:49.801 --> 01:20:53.340
Jamie.
I will.
Should I say atrocious.
Atrocious.
They get fucking repulsive.

1429
01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:57.050
Different kind of here.
Yeah.
It's like Ooh,
bears were,
yes.
Yes.
It's core.

1430
01:20:57.210 --> 01:21:01.290
It's angry.
Yeah.
Angry,
protective kind of somebody else.
It's like,
you know what?

1431
01:21:01.291 --> 01:21:05.790
It protects you from filthy plus.
It's like,

1432
01:21:06.010 --> 01:21:07.200
imagine if there's a reason for it.

1433
01:21:07.201 --> 01:21:10.020
Is there a reason why pubic hairs are so thick?
Google that.

1434
01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:12.270
What could that fucking be?
Why is it so weird?

1435
01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:16.110
I was thinking it's like the thick shield around a wild boars face

1436
01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:22.650
before that comes up is why is it curly either.
Why Xero?
Yeah,

1437
01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:26.920
because actually if it wasn't [inaudible] decades,
if he went down there,

1438
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:30.420
they're all,
she had her pussy hair was like a wig.
Like,

1439
01:21:30.421 --> 01:21:34.410
what is this all stringy and crazy as a part and you're like,

1440
01:21:34.411 --> 01:21:38.190
what is happening here?
I left.
I left hair parted pussy.
It's Braitling.

1441
01:21:38.850 --> 01:21:39.683
Beltran's beard.

1442
01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:45.030
This is dumb picks up.
They used to describe this.

1443
01:21:45.031 --> 01:21:47.100
It says that it helps prevent friction,

1444
01:21:47.101 --> 01:21:51.600
both freeing courser and thicker and clearly and all this and not the way I

1445
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:55.770
fucked.
What does that even mean?
Friction.
Have you tried to start a fire?

1446
01:21:55.771 --> 01:21:57.710
Skin debris like so you get it.
Don't get like a super,

1447
01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:00.510
how much hair is on your cock?
Both people.
Both hairs.

1448
01:22:00.511 --> 01:22:03.450
It's like Rye bread and velcro against each other.
I suppose that,
that's funny.

1449
01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:05.860
It just sticks.
If you were on a few one,

1450
01:22:05.861 --> 01:22:08.550
meth and Viagra and you were in the desert,

1451
01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:12.750
do you think you can start a fire flux so hard?
You can start a fire.

1452
01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:17.040
Oh No,
no.
Water in the air.
Yeah,
you're fine.
Yeah.
You're starting to fire.

1453
01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:20.730
If you're rubbing hearted.
Huh?
Your en masse.
It fucking,
you pull,
listen to slap.

1454
01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:27.940
Whoo.
I think that,
I think that's,
I think that's better than

1455
01:22:30.190 --> 01:22:35.100
I to fiddle.
Yeah.
The bow.
The bow way.
Have you ever started a fire like that?

1456
01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:38.790
I've had to try at a camp.
At a summer camp.
We had to do this one.

1457
01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:41.550
We had to do a bow one and then we had to do,
um,

1458
01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:44.470
the wiggle one with your fingers is ridiculous.
What's,
what's this one?
The Flint.

1459
01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:47.880
Flint?
Yeah.
Flint snap ads.
The much more likely one.
Yeah,
that happens.

1460
01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:52.350
But this shit,
this bullshit.
So fucking hard.
It's hard.
So hard.

1461
01:22:52.351 --> 01:22:56.490
I got to the point where roll down.
It was burnt like it was black.
Look,

1462
01:22:56.491 --> 01:22:58.590
you look like what?
It wouldn't catch.
I smelled it.

1463
01:22:58.591 --> 01:23:01.920
I was pretty close I think when I did it.

1464
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:05.920
I don't know when I did it but I'm pretty sure it was like preteens.

1465
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:07.390
<v 2>Yeah.
When you first start those things.</v>

1466
01:23:07.391 --> 01:23:10.150
I think I was boy scouts when I was doing that.
You do boy scouts?

1467
01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:13.660
I did boy scout for how long?
One year.
How long do you do boy scouts?
Yeah.

1468
01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:16.150
How long?
You seem like a long time.
Yeah.

1469
01:23:16.151 --> 01:23:19.150
I didn't make it till we blow whatever though.
I love that.
We're strong enough.

1470
01:23:19.151 --> 01:23:22.960
Huh?
She was pouring bro.
Dude,

1471
01:23:22.961 --> 01:23:26.320
I got fucking kidnapped almost by these criminals,

1472
01:23:26.410 --> 01:23:30.280
these little kids I went to,
uh,
I went to boy scouts in Jamaica Plain.

1473
01:23:30.281 --> 01:23:33.040
Boston Jamaica plains is like a suburb of Boston.

1474
01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:38.020
Not really a suburb was part of the city.
You go to Jamaica,
Queens,
Jamaica,

1475
01:23:38.021 --> 01:23:42.280
Queens,
Jamaica plain in Boston is a,
it's more gentrified now.

1476
01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.070
White people are spreading out and there was white people.

1477
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:46.750
They're everywhere when I lived there too,

1478
01:23:46.751 --> 01:23:50.830
but they were like angry Irish people who will punch in the face.

1479
01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:53.530
And I wasn't used to being around people like that.

1480
01:23:53.531 --> 01:23:57.130
I lived in San Francisco and then I lived in Florida and then all of a sudden I

1481
01:23:57.131 --> 01:23:59.170
lived with these,
uh,

1482
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:04.110
like really wild people.
Men who is my point.

1483
01:24:04.111 --> 01:24:08.650
W W w what were we just talking about?
The led me this,
ah,
about your makeup.

1484
01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:10.450
What about before that?

1485
01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:16.290
About why you're talking about the angry Boston people.
What was it?
A lot the,

1486
01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:19.180
we've maybe been told you just ask me a question.
I can't remember what it was.

1487
01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:23.620
I had a point,
I had a significant point.
I completely lost.

1488
01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:27.820
So we were talking about angry people,

1489
01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:31.840
fire building a fire with Cuban boy scouts,
boy scouts.

1490
01:24:32.710 --> 01:24:36.010
So I went to camp with these fucking kids that lived in this really tough

1491
01:24:36.011 --> 01:24:40.270
neighborhood and there was a lot of Puerto Rican kids and a lot of Italian kids

1492
01:24:40.271 --> 01:24:42.910
and there was Irish kids.
It was all ethnicities,

1493
01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:45.610
but it was basically like low income people.

1494
01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:48.400
And it was the first time I was around kids that were like legitimately

1495
01:24:48.401 --> 01:24:50.500
dangerous.
Like when I live in Florida,

1496
01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:55.800
we were around like alligators and shit and we used to go into the swamps.

1497
01:24:56.171 --> 01:24:58.450
You'd find snapping turtles.
I lived there for a couple of years,

1498
01:24:58.810 --> 01:25:02.110
but it didn't seem dangerous in terms of like the kids that I was interacting

1499
01:25:02.111 --> 01:25:06.190
with.
Then all of a sudden I was in Jamaica plain and they were dangerous kids,

1500
01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:09.220
tough ass kids.
They were tough ass kids.
And um,

1501
01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:13.900
I didn't know I'd never had sex and I didn't know like what way a penis goes in.

1502
01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:15.960
I didn't know it goes up.
I didn't even consider it.

1503
01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:21.040
But this kid names Paulie Hudson,
he lived right next to me,
shamed me.
He goes,

1504
01:25:21.041 --> 01:25:25.150
you probably don't even know that a,
a dick goes up in a pussy.
I was like,

1505
01:25:25.210 --> 01:25:29.740
he's right.
I was like,
he does.
I was 11 I was like,
really?

1506
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:32.610
I was trying to like figure out how that would work.
I was like,
ah,

1507
01:25:32.770 --> 01:25:35.470
well I guess I wasn't alive.
I was 1313 was when I lived in Boston,

1508
01:25:35.710 --> 01:25:39.790
but I was like,
what?
Okay.
I get it checked.
It goes up.
Wow.

1509
01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:45.080
You could've said that nicer.
I was like,
yeah,
you can just say Juno

1510
01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:49.690
kid that I had ever encountered probably would have said,
hey,

1511
01:25:49.691 --> 01:25:53.020
did you know that when you have sex it doesn't go straight in?

1512
01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:54.520
Cause when you think about having sex,

1513
01:25:54.521 --> 01:25:56.730
you would think your penis would go straightforward.
Yeah.

1514
01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.810
You think your Dick goes like this?
You go like that.

1515
01:25:59.130 --> 01:26:01.750
You'd never think you would go up.
You're like,
oh,
of course.

1516
01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:03.950
Why else would boners be like that?

1517
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:05.800
<v 1>Right,
right.
Wouldn't make sense to do it.</v>

1518
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:09.830
You'd have to hold them down to get him into the proper position.
Okay.
Now.

1519
01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:10.341
Anyway,

1520
01:26:10.341 --> 01:26:14.960
I went to fucking boy scout camp with these criminals and do the first night.

1521
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:19.280
The first night they tied this kid up and they,
he was sleeping,

1522
01:26:19.281 --> 01:26:21.140
he was soundly asleep and he was a little annoying,

1523
01:26:21.141 --> 01:26:24.920
but either way they tie this in it up on his Betty,

1524
01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:29.930
a little cot and they dragged him into the woods and it was dark as fuck.

1525
01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:34.580
It was New Hampshire Woods.
You don't see anything,
no lights.

1526
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:35.720
There was no moon out.

1527
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:38.840
So I mean you couldn't see your fucking hand in front of your face.
It was,

1528
01:26:38.890 --> 01:26:41.060
I had never experienced that before and all my,

1529
01:26:41.061 --> 01:26:44.090
and I was 13 so in all my life as a person,

1530
01:26:44.091 --> 01:26:48.740
I had never been in a place where I couldn't see my hand and I was outside
going,

1531
01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.870
this is insane.
Because we were like,

1532
01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:53.960
this boy scout camp was by a lake way the fuck up in New Hampshire.

1533
01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:57.630
And what did they see in their shitty criminal kids
guy?

1534
01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:00.290
And they bring them out into the forest and they leave him there.

1535
01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:04.670
And then they came from me,
man.
But I woke up and I was like,
fuck you,
fuck you.

1536
01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:07.470
And then they took this other guy,
like they left me alone.
I W I just did.

1537
01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:09.560
I gave up on all the activities.

1538
01:27:09.561 --> 01:27:12.830
I was awake when I heard that kid like mumble and shit,

1539
01:27:12.831 --> 01:27:14.210
and I saw them carried away.
I was like,

1540
01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:18.740
these guys just trapping this guy down to a cot with fuck.
I don't remember.

1541
01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:21.620
They did something.
I do not remember,
but I remember the other kid,

1542
01:27:21.621 --> 01:27:25.430
they put toothpaste all over his clothes.
Apparently when you put two spaced,

1543
01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:30.460
like toothpaste is not wash out good nicely and 19 whatever the fuck it was.

1544
01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:34.520
What was I 13 so was 19 1946 79 I think.

1545
01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:37.960
Say 80 79 80 81 I was 14 yeah,

1546
01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:42.440
so it's that age 80 [inaudible] and they're like these little fucking crux.

1547
01:27:42.441 --> 01:27:46.460
I was out in the woods with these kids and we had bows and arrows and 22 rifles.

1548
01:27:46.650 --> 01:27:49.010
You would hear ricochets man,
we would be,

1549
01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:53.450
we would be over by the lake because me and this other kid who was also this
kid,

1550
01:27:53.451 --> 01:27:57.920
we call them onion.
We went by the lake.
I think it was him.

1551
01:27:58.110 --> 01:28:01.130
I is this a Theo von [inaudible] real story

1552
01:28:03.670 --> 01:28:05.950
with this other kid who decided to skip out on,

1553
01:28:06.020 --> 01:28:10.110
no one cared if you were engaging in all their activity,
no one cared.
Right?

1554
01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:12.770
Literally,
I'm telling you,
no one was watching us.

1555
01:28:12.771 --> 01:28:17.090
I was 30 we just grabbed fishing rods and we went well went where the lake was.

1556
01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:20.180
We knew where the lake was like all these kids would get together and they're

1557
01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:24.470
all doing archery and rifle practice and you're hanging out there with a bobber

1558
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:26.190
and the water here.
Zero.

1559
01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:30.820
You Chase your fucking rich today.

1560
01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:38.420
They let these fucking kids have 20 twos you had and it was the,

1561
01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:40.940
it's a weird noise like when you think of a gun,

1562
01:28:40.941 --> 01:28:44.470
you think of a boom 22 is like crack,
crack,

1563
01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:49.070
crack,
crack.
It doesn't feel like it would hurt.

1564
01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:51.340
It sounds like a whip slot.

1565
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:55.900
It's not as threatening as the actual action of getting hit by a bullet.
Yeah,

1566
01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.150
yeah,
yeah.
It will kill you sound like what it is.
People kill people at 20 Twos,

1567
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:01.950
22 old fucking kill you.

1568
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:06.240
<v 2>But it just seemed,
you know,
like he can't be around these kids.</v>

1569
01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:08.780
There were y'all am or are you happy that you did boy scouts or not?

1570
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:12.690
Was that fun for you?
One year?
Nobody did anything to me.
Nobody molested me.

1571
01:29:12.691 --> 01:29:16.070
I felt like I got off light.
You got molested Jamie out?
No.
How dare you?

1572
01:29:16.190 --> 01:29:18.390
That was four years Catholic school,
Bro.
That's where that happened.

1573
01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:23.550
That was years later.
You,
you know what though?
I always think about that.

1574
01:29:23.551 --> 01:29:27.450
You know,
I went to Catholic school when I was a kid kid and then never again.

1575
01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:28.310
I never got molested.

1576
01:29:28.330 --> 01:29:30.450
I always think that maybe I wasn't cute enough or something like that.

1577
01:29:30.451 --> 01:29:32.630
Was that I just found out

1578
01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:37.200
something up online.
Uh,
where I'm from in Columbus,

1579
01:29:37.230 --> 01:29:41.370
some list just got released of a bunch of priests that either that have been

1580
01:29:41.371 --> 01:29:45.030
either accused and found out that whatever was happened,
some are still alive,

1581
01:29:45.031 --> 01:29:45.864
some art.

1582
01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:49.990
I looked through the list and found someone that was a priest at my school.
No.

1583
01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:51.540
Yeah.
I don't know that any,

1584
01:29:51.570 --> 01:29:54.150
none of nobody I know is said they'd been touched anything like that,

1585
01:29:54.151 --> 01:29:57.060
but like blew my blue.
All of our minds,
we're like,
holy shit,
it's gross.

1586
01:29:57.061 --> 01:30:00.350
That shit is fucking girl.
How much?

1587
01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:04.050
It's one of the weirdest things.

1588
01:30:04.051 --> 01:30:08.070
You can just connect a thing that's a horrific act to a church.

1589
01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:13.830
That's one thing that you just can do.
Yeah.
The Catholic Church,
Catholic priests,

1590
01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:18.480
pedophile.
You could just say that.
I mean those tests,
peanut butter and jelly,

1591
01:30:18.481 --> 01:30:19.690
Bro,
too.
Right?

1592
01:30:19.710 --> 01:30:24.710
How crazy is it that the peanut butter to your jelly is fucking kids

1593
01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:31.650
you imagine and kids love peanut butter and Jelly.
If you see a jar jelly,

1594
01:30:31.770 --> 01:30:32.910
you think,
Oh,

1595
01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:35.610
if I had some peanut butter and some bread and make a peanut butter and jelly

1596
01:30:35.611 --> 01:30:39.960
sandwich,
you see a priest,
you're like,
oh,
that guy fucks kids.
He fucks kids.

1597
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:43.200
Isn't that weird?
That's a,
you'll never get away raising.

1598
01:30:43.230 --> 01:30:45.930
Just trying to teach the word of the Lord,
man.
Sure you are dude.

1599
01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:50.190
How crazy is that?
It'll,
it'll go away at some point.
No,
it will not.

1600
01:30:51.140 --> 01:30:54.570
No.
Well not as long as you let those waves keep doing what they're doing.

1601
01:30:54.571 --> 01:30:59.460
It will not.
Yeah.
Just can pope himself at one point,

1602
01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:00.560
that guy that uh,

1603
01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:05.640
Ratzinger in what at one point in his life he was involved in moving people

1604
01:31:06.151 --> 01:31:11.130
around.
The dude,
they said he was wanted for crimes against humanity.

1605
01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:13.680
That's so fucked.
This one.

1606
01:31:13.710 --> 01:31:18.030
There's a documentary that shows that he let these people go and let this one

1607
01:31:18.031 --> 01:31:22.470
guy go rather and moved him to another parish where were molested hundred deaf

1608
01:31:22.471 --> 01:31:26.640
kids.
Oh Dude.
Jesus Christ.

1609
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.970
Oh Shit.
It's pure evil.

1610
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.400
It's pure evil and what's most fucked up about it?

1611
01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:37.490
It's evil that's coming to people that are looking for God.
Right.

1612
01:31:37.530 --> 01:31:38.341
Like the people.

1613
01:31:38.341 --> 01:31:41.400
That's why people get mad when you talk shit about the Catholic Church because

1614
01:31:41.401 --> 01:31:43.460
there's a lot of great people that are,
yeah.

1615
01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:47.520
Not everyone is a shit and all the people that are actually going to the church

1616
01:31:47.610 --> 01:31:50.730
or the good people.
Right,
right,
right,
right,
right.
Good priests.

1617
01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:54.570
They do exist and not everyone's bad,
but the number that are bad.
Oh,

1618
01:31:54.571 --> 01:31:58.270
a hundred desk kids.
Huh?
I mean,
the numbers are insane.
There's,

1619
01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.040
did you see the documentary here?

1620
01:32:00.210 --> 01:32:04.550
<v 0>New eval?
No.
Are,
did I speak no evil?
Speak?
No.</v>

1621
01:32:04.870 --> 01:32:09.280
Which ones?
So my iTunes,
I think I can pull it up.

1622
01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:13.410
Pull that shit up,
baby.
I'll publish Udev shit up.
Um,

1623
01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:18.340
but it's a horrific documentary.
Speak,
speak.
No,
it's a horrific,

1624
01:32:18.341 --> 01:32:21.040
deliver us from evil.
Deliver us from evil.
God.
Damn.

1625
01:32:21.130 --> 01:32:23.140
We've got three different titles.
Which one do you like better?

1626
01:32:23.230 --> 01:32:26.110
Deliver us from me.
They nailed it.
I think they got it right.

1627
01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:29.680
It's a terrible documentary in terms of,
um,
the way it makes you feel.

1628
01:32:29.681 --> 01:32:32.470
It makes you feel it's a very good documentary.
Makes you feel terrible.

1629
01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:36.100
That reminds me of,
did you watch,
um,
uh,
the devil?

1630
01:32:36.101 --> 01:32:39.610
We know which ones that we talking about that.
So we talked about that before.

1631
01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:44.350
The devil we know is about,
um,
three m and Teflon.
Oh.
Oh,

1632
01:32:44.370 --> 01:32:46.870
you don't know what that shit.
No,
Bro.

1633
01:32:46.871 --> 01:32:51.760
Watch Teflon is in 99.99% of the world's blood.

1634
01:32:51.790 --> 01:32:54.070
They had to go all the way back to the Korean War to find out Teflon.

1635
01:32:54.071 --> 01:32:58.110
Not In someone's blood.
What fact?
Teflon.
Teflon.

1636
01:32:59.050 --> 01:33:02.710
The devil we know,
bro.
Watch this fucking documentary cover up.

1637
01:33:02.711 --> 01:33:06.940
Did you ever Google?
Um,
the devil we know debunked?
No.

1638
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:11.760
Me Neither this,
but no,
that's what I always do.
Oh,
debunked.
No.
Well,

1639
01:33:11.770 --> 01:33:12.461
watch this shit.

1640
01:33:12.461 --> 01:33:14.980
It'll give you some believe you some insights heavy to what's really going on.

1641
01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:20.590
Even though I'm not doubting them.
Every time I look at anything like this,

1642
01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:25.540
now I write debunked and I put it into just to find out and I find out is there

1643
01:33:25.541 --> 01:33:26.970
any credible sources?
Sure yet,

1644
01:33:27.370 --> 01:33:29.530
and I don't necessarily automatically agree with them,

1645
01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:32.620
but are there any credible sources that have any indications?

1646
01:33:32.630 --> 01:33:34.660
Trying to find that if there's a balance to it.

1647
01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:39.130
I've just said too many things that are not true.
Well,
because nothing comes up.

1648
01:33:39.131 --> 01:33:43.510
When I typed that in,
just a story in the La Times that comes up,
variety,

1649
01:33:43.511 --> 01:33:45.370
the devil we know or review at nighttime says,

1650
01:33:45.371 --> 01:33:48.850
should we be scared of Teflon and documentary,
Blah Blah and Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

1651
01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:50.260
In this documentary,

1652
01:33:50.261 --> 01:33:52.600
there's a farmer that lives down the down the road from where,

1653
01:33:52.601 --> 01:33:56.530
and this is 40 years ago,
50 years ago where three m was making Teflon,
right,

1654
01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:59.380
and he was complaining to them,
well,

1655
01:33:59.381 --> 01:34:02.290
the water starts wasn't supposed to be polluted.
They lied.
They,
they put,

1656
01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.690
they put their,
their runoff in his water.

1657
01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:08.280
Cows had fucking like blue teeth and shit.

1658
01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:11.530
Their eyes would turn different colors do to,
he was like,

1659
01:34:11.770 --> 01:34:14.530
he kept complaining but they push this,
they pushed him down,

1660
01:34:14.531 --> 01:34:16.750
like shut the fuck up out of Arco until he went away.

1661
01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:20.410
And then this documentary explores how other people have tried to tell his
story.

1662
01:34:20.411 --> 01:34:24.400
But no one gave a shit that Teflon was killing it.
Such a rapid rate for you.

1663
01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:27.700
Before I forget this,
hold that thought real quick.
Can you please go?

1664
01:34:27.701 --> 01:34:30.550
Cause I keep forgetting this.
Can you please Google that?

1665
01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:32.753
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1666
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:39.390
<v 0>Water bottles in target and other stores were found with the arsenic.</v>

1667
01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:46.240
No.
Yeah.
Holy Shit.
Levels of arsenic.
An unhealthy levels of arsenic.

1668
01:34:46.630 --> 01:34:48.790
Jamie,
you're so good at one hand typing.
It's fucking absurd.

1669
01:34:48.791 --> 01:34:53.020
Wizard bottle water and be okay.
Yesterday news.
Yeah.

1670
01:34:53.290 --> 01:34:57.500
What does it say?
Can't type with two hands,
Jamie.
Title other than I do.

1671
01:34:58.110 --> 01:35:01.310
<v 2>I'm like this.
I'm like searching pet goddamn popup windows.
Hey,</v>

1672
01:35:01.311 --> 01:35:04.690
fuck off the fuck out of here.
And BC news.
Don't fuck Outta here.
NBC.

1673
01:35:04.691 --> 01:35:05.830
I don't walk.
Resist.
Hey Jim.

1674
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:10.670
Bottled water brand found to have high levels of arsenic cold from stores.

1675
01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:13.640
Find brand particularly.
Oh,
okay.
Here it is.
Penn,

1676
01:35:13.650 --> 01:35:17.360
a fee l bothered bottled water sold at target and Walmart.

1677
01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:22.620
It's once you name Keurig.
Oh right.
You have to pepper in it cause they merged.

1678
01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:27.890
The brand said P,
uh,
Penafiel in Penafiel unflavored mineral.

1679
01:35:27.891 --> 01:35:30.170
Spring waters are involved in the market withdrawal.

1680
01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:33.380
They wrote a statement there voluntarily pulling the product,

1681
01:35:33.381 --> 01:35:34.550
which is sold at target and Walmart.

1682
01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:38.470
So maybe like their manufacturer had some fucking weird shit in their water.

1683
01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:41.410
They didn't.
Yes.
High levels of ours.
Longterm exposure.

1684
01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:45.040
High lives drinking increased risk for diabetes.
Share high blood pressure.
Right?

1685
01:35:45.050 --> 01:35:48.290
But they don't say what's the level of arsenic in it?
Right.

1686
01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:50.090
What does high level mean?
What would that,

1687
01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:52.400
is that how much is okay for us to have there already?

1688
01:35:52.670 --> 01:35:55.150
They're allowed to have 10 parts per billion in there and it must,

1689
01:35:55.830 --> 01:35:58.340
must have exceeded.
How much is too much?

1690
01:35:58.370 --> 01:35:59.870
How much would you snort it off someone's Dick?

1691
01:36:00.330 --> 01:36:04.100
Hundred pounds per billion or free?
Zero parts per billion.

1692
01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:06.110
Just show me a Dick Bro.
I mean,

1693
01:36:06.111 --> 01:36:09.230
how much are you willing to snort if you tell me this,

1694
01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:14.000
if you telling me are snakes not bad for you,
how much have you snort?

1695
01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:16.460
I'll tell him I'll cut it up.
Would be 12

1696
01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:23.330
by tech.
That's fucking insane.

1697
01:36:23.331 --> 01:36:26.990
By the way that there was,
there was selling shit that has high arsenic.

1698
01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:27.860
Well they didn't know.

1699
01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:30.260
I mean it just looks like water and that's the problem with water.

1700
01:36:30.261 --> 01:36:31.310
It looks like water.

1701
01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:35.690
Like he can get weird shit and water and leave it in a hot car.
Do you know that?

1702
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:39.620
Like you're boiling water bottles?
Yeah,
really bad.
You buy a bottle of water.
Oh,

1703
01:36:39.621 --> 01:36:43.310
what the fuck happened that Bob before you,
it's like a adopted dog.

1704
01:36:43.311 --> 01:36:46.760
Somebody could've been kicking that thing leaving out in the sun by the time you

1705
01:36:46.761 --> 01:36:49.790
get it man.
It's damage to the fuck knows what's in there.

1706
01:36:49.791 --> 01:36:51.410
In terms of like diseases,

1707
01:36:51.411 --> 01:36:56.000
like you can legitimately have water bottles that leak PCBs.
They,

1708
01:36:56.070 --> 01:37:00.710
they leaked some sort of estrogen mimicking chemical.
Really?
Yeah.

1709
01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.680
<v 3>The Shit with Justin Trudeau and the water bottle.
Did you see that today?</v>

1710
01:37:03.710 --> 01:37:07.730
You do put it up as,
but it wasn't today.
Did he put it up?
Well,
I saw it today.

1711
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:08.743
Did you see it earlier?

1712
01:37:10.290 --> 01:37:14.540
Justin Trudeau's asked about how he and his family are doing a better job at not

1713
01:37:14.541 --> 01:37:19.370
using plastics.
And his response is so shit fucking awful.
You can't get it out.

1714
01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:22.630
He's like,
w w we were using,
uh,
listen to this.
Fucking this,

1715
01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:26.840
this made me laugh so hard.
We wait.
Rewind it one more time.

1716
01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:31.880
At the beginning at least you and your family do to cut back on plastics.

1717
01:37:32.670 --> 01:37:33.640
Uh,
we,
uh,
uh,

1718
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:38.830
we have recently switched to drinking water bottles out of water out of a,

1719
01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:43.840
when we have water bottles,
uh,
out of a plastic,
uh,
sorry,
uh,

1720
01:37:44.150 --> 01:37:47.310
away from plastic towards a paper.
Um,

1721
01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:54.320
<v 2>no.
Listen to me.
I don't care.</v>

1722
01:37:54.321 --> 01:37:58.370
How tired are now a water out of your marriage?

1723
01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:02.730
Will somebody asked me a question like that about my job.

1724
01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:07.050
Imagine if somebody said,
hey,
um,
Joe,

1725
01:38:07.051 --> 01:38:11.580
what do you think could be done to stop a head trauma in MMA?

1726
01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:15.600
And they'd be like,
well,
we could conceivably,
there's not much,

1727
01:38:15.630 --> 01:38:19.740
but we could pad the elbows.
We get pad the knees.
We can,
I would have a thought.

1728
01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:24.300
Yeah,
I want to fucking thought that shit through.
[inaudible] through it all.

1729
01:38:24.450 --> 01:38:26.630
And there's also thinking about getting caught in a lie to the T.

1730
01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:28.440
I have plastic everywhere.
Get home.

1731
01:38:29.730 --> 01:38:31.990
Please call his wife from the blame on the way home.
Burn up

1732
01:38:34.580 --> 01:38:39.360
for us on no plane.
Go to the house.
There's not a fucking bottle in the house.

1733
01:38:39.361 --> 01:38:42.030
It's all plastic.
Everything's plastic,
no glass.

1734
01:38:42.031 --> 01:38:44.980
They throw their forks with every meal.
They stick them on foot.

1735
01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:49.590
They stick them in the sea monkey cage and feed them to turtles.

1736
01:38:49.591 --> 01:38:54.540
Fuck you.
Gesture goes houses made of plastic.
His whole house is plastic.

1737
01:38:54.541 --> 01:38:57.540
Everything.
You know what he does?
He collect those little things at six packs.

1738
01:38:57.541 --> 01:39:00.180
Come with,
hey,
just chuck them in the ocean for a laugh.

1739
01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:06.060
He goes to a lake and just puts a bunch of fucking duck killers out there.

1740
01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:11.340
Listen,
if you find a male client,
look legit.
Male feminists,

1741
01:39:11.341 --> 01:39:13.380
let me let me talk to him because I've never met one.

1742
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:19.000
Every one of them I ever met is this dude's running a scam,
right?

1743
01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:21.510
It's the same thing.
Yeah.
I love women.

1744
01:39:21.511 --> 01:39:26.340
Sweeties these non male sweeties.
I'm like,
okay,
you're trying too hard,
man.

1745
01:39:26.490 --> 01:39:29.970
Something's wrong.
It's so obvious,
man.
There's someone wrote online,

1746
01:39:29.971 --> 01:39:31.530
this guy that was like,
it was like,

1747
01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.490
I'll stand by every woman forever and know that,
and I was like,

1748
01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:39.270
craziest guy.
What are you saying?
I was going to stalk you.

1749
01:39:39.710 --> 01:39:43.680
He's going to stalk you.
His phone words sound like a normal person's words,

1750
01:39:43.710 --> 01:39:47.820
but you just have to have a deep vocabulary of crazy.

1751
01:39:47.821 --> 01:39:52.590
That is only that were those combination of words in that circumstance only

1752
01:39:52.890 --> 01:39:54.510
exist from the mind of a crazy man.
Yes.

1753
01:39:54.930 --> 01:39:59.680
Normal people don't fucking say that shit.
No,
nope.
No,
no,
no sir.

1754
01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:04.500
No.
It's super important to tell those guys.
No,
no.

1755
01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:08.280
That's why this whole incell thing,
you know about insoles.
Yes.
What to do,

1756
01:40:08.281 --> 01:40:12.390
what to do,
what to do,
what no one wants to fuck them.
What do you do?

1757
01:40:12.450 --> 01:40:16.860
What do you do?
Get your shit together.
K.

1758
01:40:16.861 --> 01:40:20.880
I went through a six month dry spell when I was 19 and the first time I had sex

1759
01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:25.440
with a girl after that I came immediately.
It was depressing.

1760
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:29.610
I stuck in there,
but yeah,
it was sad.

1761
01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:32.640
I smelled like desperation.
Okay.

1762
01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:36.150
I had very little interaction with regular people.

1763
01:40:36.170 --> 01:40:39.760
I was doing was doing martial arts and training and it was meeting girls was

1764
01:40:40.090 --> 01:40:43.590
meeting zero girls and when I got together with the girls,
I panicked.

1765
01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:47.130
You just jerking off Seavers
um,

1766
01:40:47.310 --> 01:40:51.730
I don't remember the truck off feverously and I was that age I went through a

1767
01:40:51.740 --> 01:40:54.210
really fucked up time was

1768
01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:54.730
<v 1>uh,</v>

1769
01:40:54.730 --> 01:40:59.730
when I was a young teenager where I thought that my desire for sex was a

1770
01:40:59.891 --> 01:41:04.840
weakness and then,
and that I should,
I should avoid it.
Who put that in your head?

1771
01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:07.270
What?
No one put that in my head.

1772
01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:10.120
I put it in my head because it was trying to figure out how to get better at

1773
01:41:10.121 --> 01:41:13.210
martial arts.
You,
it something had to help that no,
nothing.

1774
01:41:13.810 --> 01:41:16.000
Nothing helped that knows my,
it was pleasure.

1775
01:41:16.330 --> 01:41:21.130
That is a desire for pleasure was a weakness.
Wow.
What the fuck did this black,

1776
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:25.750
no,
it wasn't because he was recognizing that like real pleasure.

1777
01:41:25.751 --> 01:41:30.751
The only pleasure that I had gotten up to that point was satisfaction in being

1778
01:41:30.851 --> 01:41:34.510
good at competition.
So when I started being good at competition,
I rose.
Okay,

1779
01:41:34.511 --> 01:41:39.340
what is this is better than anything.
So how do I get successful again?
Well,

1780
01:41:39.341 --> 01:41:42.640
one thing you can't do is get wrapped up in anything stupid and you have to stay

1781
01:41:42.641 --> 01:41:45.790
mentally strong.
It's like,
why do you want to pleasure?
Like why?
Whooo.

1782
01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:49.240
This wound me feel so good.
I felt weak.

1783
01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:50.770
I felt like that was a weak thing to want.

1784
01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:53.350
That's a lot of good foresight because most kids at that age that our

1785
01:41:53.351 --> 01:41:56.290
testosterone levels through the fucking roof or like I want to get good at this

1786
01:41:56.291 --> 01:41:59.940
thing,
but also,
oh my God,
I want to fuck everything that walks.
It was also pry.

1787
01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:04.960
It had to be flavored by the puritanical shit that I grew up to be some dark to

1788
01:42:05.771 --> 01:42:10.240
that but not,
I don't think so man.
Because before that I was really into it.

1789
01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:15.910
Once I started fighting I was like,
I,
it was too,

1790
01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:20.380
it was also so dangerous that I was always worried about doing something wrong

1791
01:42:20.410 --> 01:42:23.080
and getting hit.
And then maybe if I had lived my life correctly,

1792
01:42:23.081 --> 01:42:26.860
I wouldn't have gotten hit.
Cause I saw a lot of guys get kicked in the face.
Man.

1793
01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:30.010
Let me tell you,
she'd been kicked in the head.
Oh,
I have no idea.

1794
01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:36.250
Zero idea a lot.
A bunch of times,
for sure.

1795
01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:39.640
Concha Times.
I don't know.
Never unconscious from that.

1796
01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:43.660
I'm never unconscious from anything.
I have dropped from a punch and a fight.

1797
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:48.360
I got a t code.
I got dropped in my lap.
It was like he hit me in the jaw and my,

1798
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:51.070
it didn't hurt per se.
It wasn't like,

1799
01:42:51.071 --> 01:42:53.710
like sometimes you get hit in the body like a liver shot.

1800
01:42:53.711 --> 01:42:57.760
It fucking hurts so bad.
It doesn't matter if you're in the middle of a fight.

1801
01:42:57.761 --> 01:43:01.840
It hurts so bad.
But the jaw didn't hurt,
but my legs just stop working.

1802
01:43:01.841 --> 01:43:04.000
Like the wind,
they just stopped.

1803
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:07.030
They just shut off and they went out from under me.
It was crazy.

1804
01:43:07.031 --> 01:43:09.700
I don't think I'd ever had it happened that way before.

1805
01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:12.610
I definitely been dinged or like wobbled,

1806
01:43:13.310 --> 01:43:16.030
like covered up and recovered.
I had had that happened before,

1807
01:43:16.031 --> 01:43:19.350
but I never had it where I just,
my shit just shut off.

1808
01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:21.070
My lights just shut off dude.

1809
01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:23.960
But I was still conscious and then I was trying to get up and I was always

1810
01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:27.040
looking fucking point,
need any point you do.
They just didn't work in.

1811
01:43:27.041 --> 01:43:28.650
Then he hit me a couple more times and it fell again.

1812
01:43:28.660 --> 01:43:29.740
The referee stopped the fight.

1813
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:34.980
So that was the worst I'd ever been hit in the head.
Not like you've ever been.

1814
01:43:34.981 --> 01:43:37.300
Not enough from Chemo,
but I was always scared of it.

1815
01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:41.410
You've been knocked out though?
No.
Never been knocked.
Never once.
No Shit.
No.

1816
01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:44.830
How many can see?
How many concussions do you have?
You think on record?

1817
01:43:46.690 --> 01:43:50.920
I don't know.
I have three.
I have three.
I know,
I think to one,
when I was a kid,

1818
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:52.070
I think I,
I know

1819
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:55.790
<v 2>I cracked my head cause I have a giant scar back there above my hair transplant</v>

1820
01:43:55.791 --> 01:43:59.900
scar where it cracked my head on this uh,
cement sewer thing.

1821
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:02.660
There was like some crane,
we were,

1822
01:44:02.661 --> 01:44:05.600
kids were running past this thing and something happened.

1823
01:44:05.601 --> 01:44:07.160
I don't remember exactly happened,

1824
01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:11.510
but involve falling and something slipping and something hitting me in the head

1825
01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:16.220
and it hit me in the head pretty fucking hard.
Or,
um,
I didn't go unconscious,

1826
01:44:16.221 --> 01:44:19.100
but the whole world went like,
yeah,
I remember,

1827
01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:23.200
I remember saying to the doctor that I'd grayed out like a grayed out,

1828
01:44:23.201 --> 01:44:26.630
but then it came back like it was a big impact on my head.

1829
01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:29.450
So it was that time than the time that I got TK owed.

1830
01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:32.480
But then the other times in between,
it was mostly just getting dinged.

1831
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:36.140
We just popped in your legs,
give out a little bit.
Then you cover up and then,

1832
01:44:36.510 --> 01:44:41.000
you know,
usually like it's inspiring,
you'll stop.
And it's a,
if it's in a fight,

1833
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:42.140
you get a,
you know,

1834
01:44:42.141 --> 01:44:45.830
either either you fall down or you get a standing eight count,
you know,

1835
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:48.680
depending on if you're boxing or kickboxing or whatever you're doing.

1836
01:44:48.681 --> 01:44:51.350
But in the gym,
you just fight in.
The Gym,

1837
01:44:51.351 --> 01:44:54.380
guys get dinged and they go down and nobody does anything to stop it.

1838
01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:57.620
And he'd get back up and you're getting hit again.
Like you really probably,

1839
01:44:57.740 --> 01:45:00.680
they'd probably should stop the sparring,
but people are,
you know,

1840
01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:03.530
guys are fucking animals,
man animals.

1841
01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:07.490
And then in a boxing gym when you're allowed to indulge in that sort of animal

1842
01:45:07.491 --> 01:45:11.180
behavior,
it gets encouraged,
especially amongst really good guys.

1843
01:45:11.810 --> 01:45:13.460
I had my fucking knees taken out from under me.

1844
01:45:13.461 --> 01:45:16.220
That's how I had my first concussion.
And I told me about that in basketball.

1845
01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:20.420
Right?
Yeah.
That sounds hard on my neck.
Well,
hell on my fucking neck,

1846
01:45:20.450 --> 01:45:25.190
hardwood basketball floor.
And I remember vividly to play two moments,

1847
01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:29.000
one people telling me to sit down because your natural reaction sometimes when

1848
01:45:29.001 --> 01:45:32.390
you get knocked out like that and bounce off your head is to get back up.

1849
01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:35.780
You know?
And I could so,
but I was unconsciously doing it.

1850
01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:40.010
And then I remember that.
And then I remember the paramedics,
uh,
ask,

1851
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:43.760
asking me to lie down and I remember saying,
I'm gonna throw up.
And I did.

1852
01:45:43.761 --> 01:45:47.180
I threw up everywhere and passed out and woke up in the hospital.

1853
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:49.310
I tell him I suck air Mac.

1854
01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:53.810
And then in fucking junior high got pops so hard in football.
I got hit so hard.

1855
01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:58.210
My Dad was like,
you got your Bell Rung.
I was listening to,
yeah,
work those.

1856
01:45:58.540 --> 01:45:59.570
Listen to Bo Jackson.

1857
01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:02.900
He's on the meat eater podcast this week and he was saying he wouldn't have his

1858
01:46:02.901 --> 01:46:06.710
kids play football.
Not Crazy.
That guy lived through hell.

1859
01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:11.300
He has a hilarious,
crazy story.
A person of his life,

1860
01:46:11.301 --> 01:46:14.750
but about getting the one time you got chaos in a game,

1861
01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:17.710
waking up and going to the wrong side and they tell,
hey motherfucker,

1862
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:18.663
you're on the wrong side.

1863
01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:22.610
And then he goes over there and then he hears a gunshot and people sees people

1864
01:46:22.611 --> 01:46:24.740
running.
He's like,
who got shot?
He goes,
it's half time.

1865
01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:28.280
He thought he was playing the wrong team.

1866
01:46:28.290 --> 01:46:32.300
He has a whole various story but it's also kind of dark man.

1867
01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:36.320
Like he's talking about crazy.
Wasn't as childhood too,
but um,

1868
01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:38.780
did you see that documentary about him or he could shoot bow and Arrow with his

1869
01:46:38.781 --> 01:46:42.110
foot.
Kenny.
Really?
Did you not see that bringing that?
You can show that.

1870
01:46:42.111 --> 01:46:44.300
Show him that he was saying you got a shoulder replaced.

1871
01:46:44.301 --> 01:46:47.510
This mother fucker is an athlete.
To a degree.
That's creepy.

1872
01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:50.130
Like keeping the dual sports door as dual sport

1873
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:53.580
<v 0>athletes.
P everyone thinks they could almost.</v>

1874
01:46:53.581 --> 01:46:56.790
No one really can play ball sports now.
He was incredible.

1875
01:46:56.820 --> 01:46:59.630
He was unbelievably talented.
But yeah,
there's documenter.

1876
01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:01.890
He's living in the woods.
He was fuck he can shoot.
He talking to him.

1877
01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:02.753
What was I talking about?

1878
01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:06.120
Since he could shoot a bullseye from a hundred yards away with his feet.

1879
01:47:06.210 --> 01:47:09.420
Thank you.
That's,
I'm talking about,
I don't know that there's a video of it.

1880
01:47:09.690 --> 01:47:12.110
They must have a photo or some shit up there.
That's a fucking this.

1881
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:17.840
But on the documentary [inaudible] 69 minute mark of his 30 for 30 yeah,
it's a,

1882
01:47:17.841 --> 01:47:20.010
it was a 30 for 30 that's what was I talking about him though?

1883
01:47:20.250 --> 01:47:24.170
I had a great store to media.
What was it?
Crazy knocked out.

1884
01:47:25.330 --> 01:47:29.160
Got My concussion about how he wouldn't have his kids play the play sports.

1885
01:47:29.161 --> 01:47:33.460
Right.
That's what football is.
Football.
Wow.
Oh my.
Wow.

1886
01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:39.390
I mean,
dude,
football point.
Injurous date of lost it.
Yeah.
It's,

1887
01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:42.750
it's insanely dangerous.
It's beautiful,
but fuck me.
It's dangerous.
I mean,

1888
01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:45.030
it's so bad.
Oh,
that's that same thing they found in hockey.

1889
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:48.510
The hits are harder than the fights people scared about the fights that hits

1890
01:47:48.710 --> 01:47:50.430
caused more concussions by far.

1891
01:47:50.630 --> 01:47:55.170
Well the soccer players have problems we can tee because of they get smoked and

1892
01:47:55.171 --> 01:47:59.710
they call it a non concuss IV.
Uh,
um,

1893
01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:03.720
brain trauma.
The goalie that just one like player of the year,

1894
01:48:04.570 --> 01:48:05.281
Robin learners,
his name,

1895
01:48:05.281 --> 01:48:08.340
I guess he gave a really good speech about his mental health issues he's been

1896
01:48:08.341 --> 01:48:12.940
dealing with.
And while he accepted as a word for Goldie,
I can't find that.
Wow,

1897
01:48:13.410 --> 01:48:15.630
this is bunch.
Yeah,
just happened last week.

1898
01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:18.790
You were talking to him about his openness to it,
to the whole crowd.
Wow,

1899
01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:21.120
that's pretty good moment.
Listen man,
it helps,
right?

1900
01:48:21.150 --> 01:48:26.130
It just is not a good thing to be involved with.
Head trauma.

1901
01:48:26.131 --> 01:48:27.360
If you can avoid it in life,

1902
01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:30.180
it can possibly happen to you in no matter what you do.

1903
01:48:30.181 --> 01:48:32.850
I mean anybody can have a head trauma,
it could be an accident.

1904
01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:36.810
But if you can find a way to avoid it probably should.

1905
01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:38.820
But in these sports you can't.
No you cannot.

1906
01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:42.540
So you got to decide whether or not you want to take that risk.
Main line,

1907
01:48:42.550 --> 01:48:44.880
he says,
I'm not ashamed to say I'm mentally ill,

1908
01:48:44.881 --> 01:48:47.950
but that doesn't mean mentally weak.
That's a fucking dope line,
by the way.

1909
01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:51.270
That is a dope line cause I have mental illness.
You Do,
you bitch.

1910
01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:58.290
Get it together.
Give it to mental doctor.
I can't show mental illness.

1911
01:48:58.370 --> 01:49:01.500
I can have a vitamin for you.
What does it,
uh,
cocaine.

1912
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:06.570
That's what fucked me up by dad was a coke addict going up.

1913
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:09.390
Now we're going to full circle.
Imagine if you were like a,

1914
01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:14.010
a slightly overweight person who might be Bert more um,

1915
01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:18.610
on the feminine side.
Bert.
And he got really mad at me like they're not perfect.

1916
01:49:19.050 --> 01:49:23.610
And I'm talking about Bert.
You said fat guy that doesn't exist.
Love you,
Bert.

1917
01:49:24.670 --> 01:49:28.140
Someone that doesn't exist.
If I was an overripe person who was sensitive,

1918
01:49:28.141 --> 01:49:31.020
super sensitive,
would you just choose that moment to be a victim?
Yeah.

1919
01:49:31.470 --> 01:49:35.010
What'd you,
how would you say,
what would you say you're cruel,
Joe?
Why?

1920
01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:39.600
Because you don't respect people like me struggle.
What did you do?

1921
01:49:39.601 --> 01:49:43.800
What did I say?
You know what you said you pick,

1922
01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:48.380
what did I say?
Fucking Alpha male hit on the case of say

1923
01:49:48.670 --> 01:49:51.310
<v 2>that you just,
I just said something.
You gotta tell me Jamie.
What did I say?</v>

1924
01:49:52.050 --> 01:49:53.830
Do you hear what I said?
Offended me.
Pick.

1925
01:49:54.010 --> 01:49:56.920
You don't even remember where to tell them what I said called him a bitch or

1926
01:49:56.921 --> 01:50:01.720
having mental illness.
Are there some bitches though?

1927
01:50:02.050 --> 01:50:02.883
Right?
Okay.

1928
01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:05.770
There's a lot of people out there that have mental illness and it's legit.

1929
01:50:05.950 --> 01:50:10.100
There's a few bitches that are faking it.
They're just pitches.
Wow.

1930
01:50:10.150 --> 01:50:12.250
How come you can't say that?
How come you can't say that?

1931
01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:15.790
Because you know it's true.
It's on everyone,
but why?
Look,

1932
01:50:15.791 --> 01:50:19.060
there's some people that are just full of shit.
You telling me to anything.

1933
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:22.300
A lot of bullshit.
All the grifters the world.

1934
01:50:22.301 --> 01:50:25.540
Some aren't going to claim depressed.
Come on.
They,
they,
they,

1935
01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:27.070
they pretend to be heirs.

1936
01:50:27.190 --> 01:50:30.060
They pretend to be dukes and they're not going to pretend to be depressed.

1937
01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:32.870
It's ridiculous.
Thank guys called a bitch.
It means he's too weak.

1938
01:50:33.330 --> 01:50:33.971
It's called a bitch.

1939
01:50:33.971 --> 01:50:37.030
It means she's too aggressive to any of us have any idea what this word even

1940
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:40.960
mean?
That it was so good.
That tweet was so good.
I wish I wrote it cause that,

1941
01:50:41.020 --> 01:50:43.440
that point is so good.
Yeah,
that's,

1942
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:45.580
I'm glad she put it on Twitter so no one could steal it.

1943
01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:50.050
It's almost like that idea.
I like that idea is like very poignant like that.

1944
01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:55.900
Yeah.
What is that fucking word?
You know,
like pussy can be great,

1945
01:50:55.901 --> 01:50:58.860
but it can also be weak.
But a pussy you can give birth.
I mean,

1946
01:50:59.570 --> 01:51:02.410
got an bowling ball comes out of that thing.
Pussies are always strong.

1947
01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:04.480
10 pound babies come out of a pussy.

1948
01:51:04.481 --> 01:51:07.900
Imagine a 10 pound baby coming out of your Dick and then respect that thing.

1949
01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:12.350
You know what I'm saying?
I mean,
what the Dick's,
what have more props?

1950
01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:17.230
Pussy be week.
It's more like compliant,

1951
01:51:17.710 --> 01:51:21.820
but it's not weak.
Like it's also a desirable pussy is not desirable to man.

1952
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:25.990
When a guy says instead of desirable calls you a pussy,
what's the first thought?

1953
01:51:26.020 --> 01:51:30.250
If someone's like,
oh,
really?
Yeah.
Oh really?
Really?

1954
01:51:30.910 --> 01:51:35.530
Yeah.
Right.
So what uh,
when uh,
when uh,
when a guy calls another guy a pussy,

1955
01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:37.360
it's a cheap insult.

1956
01:51:37.810 --> 01:51:41.980
Meaning what the Times you ready to fight and you just want to provoke this guy

1957
01:51:42.190 --> 01:51:45.130
so pussies the word counter puncher.
So what you're calling a guy,

1958
01:51:45.131 --> 01:51:48.260
a great sexual object.
You fucking nice thing I want to fuck.
See,

1959
01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:50.370
just letting them know we're about to get down.

1960
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:53.920
Nice thing I want to fuck all the time.
Get over here.
If you watch guys fight,

1961
01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:58.600
half of half of it is talking shit to each other before you get down.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1962
01:51:58.630 --> 01:52:01.480
Instigate the fight.
There's,
it's not just instigating,

1963
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:02.740
you're getting someone scared.

1964
01:52:03.530 --> 01:52:06.700
You making southern girl that you're trying to measure your confidence level

1965
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:11.170
versus there.
Cool.
Who's got the most,
if you can get someone nervous though,

1966
01:52:11.171 --> 01:52:12.850
if you can live legitimate,
gets someone nervous,

1967
01:52:12.851 --> 01:52:16.150
you can decrease their performance by a significant margin for sure.

1968
01:52:16.210 --> 01:52:18.760
It gets in there.
Scare them.
Yeah.
You could scare someone.

1969
01:52:19.690 --> 01:52:22.870
Like if you really ready to go,
but you have to be really ready to go.

1970
01:52:23.090 --> 01:52:25.630
But everybody,
if you're trying to scare someone,
they took a swing at you.

1971
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:29.020
Tyson talks about it every so many competitors talk to only when they would see

1972
01:52:29.021 --> 01:52:32.590
him,
they get nervous that we get scared and they'd fight worse because they get

1973
01:52:32.591 --> 01:52:35.580
scared.
Oh,
100% everybody.
I'm you see that guy?
You're like,

1974
01:52:35.590 --> 01:52:40.000
he didn't have to talk much.
He,
he let all his performance,
his talk,
you know,

1975
01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.760
and the most scary thing he ever said,

1976
01:52:42.761 --> 01:52:45.710
the scariest thing you ever said was we saw,
how dare they threatened me.

1977
01:52:46.820 --> 01:52:50.510
How dare these mere mortals plot out their primitive skills?

1978
01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:53.690
Is it crazy that he has such a feminine voice?
He's the masculine dude.

1979
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:57.980
My favorite boxer of all time to watch fucks everybody up because the moments

1980
01:52:57.981 --> 01:52:59.450
when he would fight would not just be,

1981
01:52:59.630 --> 01:53:03.290
I don't want to say he's like the best boxer of all time.
Who is?

1982
01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:07.040
It's either Floyd Mayweather or roared Jones Jr in his prime.

1983
01:53:07.310 --> 01:53:11.420
It's how you your tea or sugar ray Leonard or sugary Robinson or

1984
01:53:13.190 --> 01:53:16.120
Roberto Duran Goulet arguments or Muhammad Ali who is a lot of boxing guys.

1985
01:53:16.250 --> 01:53:17.570
Hey Sugar Ray Robinson,

1986
01:53:17.571 --> 01:53:21.650
because he had so many fights and he was so successful and he fought all the

1987
01:53:21.651 --> 01:53:25.670
time and he fought the hardest of men in hard,
hard time.

1988
01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:27.020
There were different people,

1989
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:32.350
but I say if you had to make sugar ray Robinson,

1990
01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:36.590
fight,
Floyd Mayweather,
Floyd Mayweather,
the box of their prime,

1991
01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:39.620
he would box them up.
I think I've,
I think floated box.

1992
01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:42.220
This is the argument of every sport ever,
right?
Every song,
whatever.

1993
01:53:42.230 --> 01:53:44.930
Who's the best at then?
Oh,
there is none.
I don't think impossible.

1994
01:53:44.931 --> 01:53:49.880
I don't think he would be technically at the level.
Uh,

1995
01:53:49.881 --> 01:53:54.330
he was ferocious.
He was a vicious knockout puncher.
He threw a double left hook.

1996
01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:55.490
Look,
it was nobody's business.

1997
01:53:55.760 --> 01:54:00.760
But Floyd Mayweather had a way of making guys look like they didn't belong there

1998
01:54:00.771 --> 01:54:03.800
with them.
Oh yeah.
The way he did it to Canelo,

1999
01:54:03.801 --> 01:54:07.030
the way he did it to pack you out of the way he did it to Mcgregor Mcgregor was,

2000
01:54:07.330 --> 01:54:10.610
was a skillful master.
I went to that fight in Vegas.
Yeah.

2001
01:54:10.790 --> 01:54:13.760
I went to that fight for shelf because it's showtime and I gotta Tell Ya,

2002
01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:15.380
Floyd Mayweather.

2003
01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:20.030
Look like he was fighting a guy who's never fought,

2004
01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:23.120
even though Phil,
you know,
he's fought a ton.
It's just he was,

2005
01:54:23.210 --> 01:54:27.860
the balance was way different.
He's a master.
He's a true magician to master.

2006
01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:31.010
He makes it look simple.
That's disgusting.
Anybody that good,

2007
01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:34.310
it looks when people used to watch like Jordan,
you'd be like,
that looks fake.

2008
01:54:34.670 --> 01:54:39.220
He's a true man.
It's just so brilliant and smooth and easy and simple and yeah,

2009
01:54:39.670 --> 01:54:41.750
it's a beautiful magic trick to make.
You think it's easy.

2010
01:54:41.751 --> 01:54:45.050
It's fucking impossible.
What he does,
sugar ray Robinson was a motherfucker,

2011
01:54:45.051 --> 01:54:45.920
don't get me wrong,

2012
01:54:46.010 --> 01:54:49.530
I just don't think he ever face anybody like Floyd because no one liked Floyd

2013
01:54:49.531 --> 01:54:54.531
existed back then because no one liked Floyd could exist in less than a guy like

2014
01:54:54.601 --> 01:54:59.390
sugar ray Robinson existed first,
right?
So sugar ray Robinson had to exist.

2015
01:54:59.510 --> 01:55:03.260
Roberto Duran had to exist.
Sugar Ray Leonard had to exist.
Uh,

2016
01:55:03.330 --> 01:55:06.890
Milton McCrory had to exist.
Donald Curry had exists.
All these killers,

2017
01:55:06.891 --> 01:55:11.000
how to exist.
And that way a guy like Floyd Mayweather who is at the tip,

2018
01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:13.370
he figured it all out.
He saw it through.

2019
01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:18.100
See Robinson was a bad mother fucker to it and he came out a lot of guys,
but he,

2020
01:55:18.110 --> 01:55:20.000
they stood in front of each other back then.
Like,

2021
01:55:20.001 --> 01:55:21.260
look how these guys are fighting.

2022
01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:25.100
They're standing in front of him and cheese and he's marking a man.

2023
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:30.290
I think he was ahead of his time and a lot of ways,
but he lost a Jake Lamata.

2024
01:55:30.291 --> 01:55:33.410
And here's my position,
although it may be a controversial one,

2025
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:37.400
I cannot envision a world with Jake Lamata,
outboxes,
Floyd Mayweather.

2026
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:41.420
I just don't see that happening.
But right now you can't control you.
I mean,

2027
01:55:41.421 --> 01:55:44.040
you can't compare errors.
Like you can't,
you too hard.

2028
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.630
<v 1>You can't,
it's too hard.
You can't.</v>

2029
01:55:45.631 --> 01:55:47.790
So it's like the same way we can't do with comedians.

2030
01:55:47.791 --> 01:55:49.380
Like if anybody ever asked me,

2031
01:55:49.381 --> 01:55:52.920
I always say that Lenny Bruce is probably the greatest of all time because he

2032
01:55:52.921 --> 01:55:55.710
was the first,
he was the guy will in the door.

2033
01:55:55.711 --> 01:55:57.960
He was the guy who did the weird shit that we would,

2034
01:55:57.961 --> 01:56:00.790
that we do when we say ridiculous,
like we've done on this podcast,

2035
01:56:01.110 --> 01:56:03.420
we say ridiculous shit.
And,
and,

2036
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:08.510
and you make it funny and at sometimes at least sometimes it as a point to it

2037
01:56:08.850 --> 01:56:12.710
and it makes you reconsider.
But like we hear you're watching Ray Robinson and,

2038
01:56:12.970 --> 01:56:17.070
and,
and Jake Lamata.
If Jake Lamata stood like that in front of Floyd Mayweather,

2039
01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:17.970
Floyd Mayweather,

2040
01:56:17.970 --> 01:56:22.290
would it still be hitting them as 1946 he would still be punching him.

2041
01:56:22.650 --> 01:56:27.390
I just,
I think Ray Robinson was the best of his era for sure.

2042
01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:31.560
And he was an amazing,
amazing boxer.
But fuck,
but I mean,

2043
01:56:31.561 --> 01:56:34.830
a lot of boxing guys like you don't know shit about boxing.
You're right.
I don't,

2044
01:56:34.890 --> 01:56:38.520
in comparison to what I know about MMA,
I know he was amazing.
I know.

2045
01:56:38.521 --> 01:56:42.150
Who's a result?
The gene foam or knock out the,
the,
the,

2046
01:56:42.151 --> 01:56:45.540
the Jake Lamata rematch me and tied up against the ropes and he just beat his

2047
01:56:45.541 --> 01:56:49.420
fucking brains out the,
when when he,
he lost a Billy Conn,

2048
01:56:49.500 --> 01:56:52.290
he was beating Billy calm,
but he got from heat exhaustion.

2049
01:56:52.291 --> 01:56:57.060
I think he and Billy comes a light heavyweight.
He's a bad motherfucker,
dude.

2050
01:56:57.300 --> 01:56:59.980
He was a bad motherfucker.
I just wouldn't you?

2051
01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:04.740
I just don't think you can compare hoists Gracie to Robert Whitaker.

2052
01:57:04.890 --> 01:57:07.080
I think they're different animals.
You know what I'm saying?

2053
01:57:07.081 --> 01:57:07.970
Like Robert Whitaker's,

2054
01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:11.430
the current middle weight champion to hoists Gracie who won the UFC and UFC one

2055
01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:15.840
he won in UFC one because Robert Whitaker of 2019 wasn't there.

2056
01:57:16.290 --> 01:57:20.130
And how many years ago was UFC?
One was a long time since 1993 so did not,

2057
01:57:20.131 --> 01:57:22.790
not even the nothing compared to that.
That was the forties man.

2058
01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:25.710
That's what I mean.
Exponentially.
Even more different.
Way Different Way.

2059
01:57:25.711 --> 01:57:30.300
Different technology alone has improved so much in the way we train.

2060
01:57:30.301 --> 01:57:32.100
How to fight or train,
how to play sports.

2061
01:57:32.101 --> 01:57:36.630
It's just continue to watch Roy Jones Jr in his prime.
I mean I saw him fight to,

2062
01:57:37.290 --> 01:57:40.590
to Roy Jones Jr when he was in his prime,

2063
01:57:40.770 --> 01:57:44.520
did things that even Robinson didn't do,
he would put his hands behind his back.

2064
01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:48.180
Right?
What guys [inaudible] on him and Kale with one punch.
Right.

2065
01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:49.830
And you'd be like what?
You said a bait.

2066
01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:54.920
He would hit guys and it would look like it was an impossible matchup.

2067
01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:58.170
Like Vinny pass.
Ian's a fought sugar ray,
or excuse me,

2068
01:57:58.171 --> 01:58:03.171
fought Roy Jones Jr and Roy Jones Jr went a full round without getting hit by a

2069
01:58:03.601 --> 01:58:04.920
punch.
Joel.
Crazy.

2070
01:58:04.921 --> 01:58:08.760
That is almost impossible and a world championship level against the guy who in

2071
01:58:08.761 --> 01:58:12.870
Vinny Pazienza was a multiple time world champion.
Does that happen today?
No.

2072
01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:17.370
No Way.
He was on another level.
Just couldn't,
he couldn't maintain it.

2073
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:20.610
It didn't maintain it,
you know,
but you can only maintain that for so long.

2074
01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:25.440
That's a shooting star,
right?
That's a bad company song,
son.
Right?
Look at this.

2075
01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:28.980
This is Roy Jones shoe.
I don't know what can I look at that?
That's James.
Tony.

2076
01:58:28.981 --> 01:58:33.630
By the way,
that he did that too,
dude.
Roy Jones Jr was on another planet Sun,

2077
01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:36.840
but you don't call it for the stoppage.
When he started fucking up any paths,

2078
01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:39.060
he had his arm out.
Dude,
I'm telling you,

2079
01:58:39.090 --> 01:58:41.950
this was like one of the beatings all beating.

2080
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:46.240
You see a guy who's at this time,
probably the best ever.

2081
01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:47.740
Look at that combination,
son.

2082
01:58:47.890 --> 01:58:50.320
Look at that combination with the rest of the referee rescues him.

2083
01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:53.230
When Roy Jones June was at his prime.
Everybody's like,
yeah,

2084
01:58:53.231 --> 01:58:56.170
but the guys who fought,
they weren't that good bullshit.

2085
01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:58.840
He was better than anybody who was so good.

2086
01:58:58.870 --> 01:59:03.130
He was on such another level that he made world class fighters look like they,

2087
01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:07.450
they weren't that good bro.
He out boxed Bernard Hopkins back then,
you know,

2088
01:59:07.451 --> 01:59:09.490
I mean he was on a fucking,

2089
01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:12.640
Bernard Hopkins has hard as luck by the way.

2090
01:59:12.730 --> 01:59:17.730
Bernard Hopkins who didn't have the same sort of dynamic explosive style.

2091
01:59:18.130 --> 01:59:21.490
Bernard Hopkins was a much more solid fundamental guy.
You know,

2092
01:59:21.491 --> 01:59:23.440
it was a different kind of style and

2093
01:59:24.970 --> 01:59:28.060
Bernard Hopkins Wind up beating Roy as Roy was on the way downhill.
Look at them.

2094
01:59:28.061 --> 01:59:31.000
He tells you on shit of Santa right in front of them.

2095
01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:36.400
Bank played basketball games like full games.
They'll fight later that day.

2096
01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:40.090
Pink Dude,
I'm telling you,
you had to see,

2097
01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:43.360
he was almost board for a couple of years because there was a couple of years

2098
01:59:43.361 --> 01:59:47.530
where Roy Jones Jr was.
It was just a show na's put him as in a song.

2099
01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:51.460
He said the new Mike Tyson is Roy Jones.
But hold on.

2100
01:59:51.461 --> 01:59:54.700
You just missed the greatest one of all time.
Go back to that one.
Back it up.

2101
01:59:54.701 --> 01:59:59.620
Watch this.
Watch this bunk.
Kao Pans behind his back and he's not even there.

2102
01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:03.250
Came behind his back was John Ruiz.
Now this is the fight that fucked him up.

2103
02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:07.180
This is why he went all the way up to heavyweight to fight John Ruiz and he got

2104
02:00:07.181 --> 02:00:11.660
to like 200 pounds.
And if you look at him,
he's pretty stout.
Then his next fight,

2105
02:00:11.830 --> 02:00:15.070
then his next fight.
Look at that.
Come on son.
But his next fight,
he had a fight.

2106
02:00:15.071 --> 02:00:18.250
Antonio Tarver and Tarver is a legit

2107
02:00:20.170 --> 02:00:24.550
worldclass light heavyweight and and Roy just didn't look the same.

2108
02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:28.180
It didn't look the same drop and all that weight coming back from heavyweight to

2109
02:00:28.181 --> 02:00:30.010
fight Tarver and Tarver knocked him out.

2110
02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:32.590
What's the weight difference that he went down to?
25 pounds?

2111
02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:34.570
That's a lot of fucks.
A lot of fucking,

2112
02:00:34.571 --> 02:00:38.450
lot of fucking a lot of fun when you're that high up.
Not only that,
let's,

2113
02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:40.570
let's be just real here.
Let's be real here.

2114
02:00:41.080 --> 02:00:46.000
There's not a lot of ways where a man is thirties gained 25 pounds come on other

2115
02:00:46.001 --> 02:00:50.750
than
De de,
De,
De,
De,
De,
De,
De,

2116
02:00:50.970 --> 02:00:55.680
de Mexican supplements.
Then in my arm.
Yeah,
dude,

2117
02:00:55.681 --> 02:00:58.690
target.
You know what say Tarver said you got excuses tonight,
Roy.

2118
02:00:58.960 --> 02:01:01.990
That's what he said to him before when they were facing each other.

2119
02:01:02.110 --> 02:01:05.290
But if you look at Roy in his fight,
he just does not look as good.

2120
02:01:05.370 --> 02:01:08.200
It just did not look as good.
He w he was more smooth.

2121
02:01:08.290 --> 02:01:11.650
He didn't look as muscular and Tara was a real problem.
Man.

2122
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:13.600
Tara was a dangerous guy.
T Roy,

2123
02:01:13.630 --> 02:01:17.200
when you're losing that much weight to get down for 200 pounds,

2124
02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:19.880
you're fucking depleted,
man.
I don't care what anybody says.
Yeah.

2125
02:01:19.990 --> 02:01:21.910
For him to take that fight,
if he was going to do it smart,

2126
02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:26.070
he should have been fucking marathon running for like a year or something to try

2127
02:01:26.110 --> 02:01:27.610
just try to lose that weight,

2128
02:01:27.790 --> 02:01:32.410
but to try to lose 25 pounds of muscle in just a few months time bunk.

2129
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:33.310
That's her right there.

2130
02:01:33.610 --> 02:01:38.610
That was the left hand that knocked him out and Tarver was a world class mother

2131
02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:40.213
back then.

2132
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:44.030
<v 0>Tarver might've knocked him out even if they did fight without any problem.</v>

2133
02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:45.470
But Roy for sure had a problem.

2134
02:01:45.471 --> 02:01:50.150
We had a real hard time making that weight and Tarver was Tara's legit as they

2135
02:01:50.151 --> 02:01:51.030
come now.

2136
02:01:52.130 --> 02:01:55.070
Roy John Tarver still fighting and Roy Jones Jr just retired Tarver as a

2137
02:01:55.071 --> 02:01:59.600
heavyweight now?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
He took some time off cause he got caught with

2138
02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:09.040
<v 5>[inaudible] thank</v>

2139
02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:11.860
<v 0>you pad pad.
He got caught with some shit.
Something happened.</v>

2140
02:02:12.370 --> 02:02:15.040
And Roy Jones just retired,
Huh?
Yes,
thankfully.

2141
02:02:15.041 --> 02:02:18.820
But he was willing to come out of retirement for Michael B.
Jordan.

2142
02:02:19.300 --> 02:02:23.380
What he was saying that he could box with them in the cause of the movie creed.

2143
02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:27.640
Oh,
moving fuck out here.
And Roy was like legitimately trying to set it up.
Why?

2144
02:02:27.641 --> 02:02:30.850
Why?
For publicity.
But he was like,
I'm gonna fuck this dude up.

2145
02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:33.880
Make a lot of money.
The shit out of him.
What the fuck?
Michael B.
Jordan.

2146
02:02:34.270 --> 02:02:36.850
But he was apparently,
he was really legitimately try to set it up.

2147
02:02:36.970 --> 02:02:39.880
We made a video where I was,
I was telling Michael B,
Jordan,
please,

2148
02:02:40.270 --> 02:02:42.400
I don't care who's talking to you.
Listen to me.

2149
02:02:42.670 --> 02:02:46.910
Do not do this yet to not do this.
Do not do this.
Your career.

2150
02:02:46.990 --> 02:02:49.600
You have no idea how bad that guy's gonna light you on fire.

2151
02:02:50.290 --> 02:02:53.130
He's going to light you on fire.
It is worst days and he's going to,

2152
02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:57.490
it was a joke,
but Justin Bieber said he wanted to fight tigers.
Yeah.

2153
02:02:57.550 --> 02:03:00.760
Dana White said set it up.
I don't know why he,
why he was joking,

2154
02:03:00.761 --> 02:03:05.170
but like the Internet ran with it.
And you know what?
I would love to see that.

2155
02:03:05.410 --> 02:03:08.440
That's why he did it.
Because he knows people.
People would pay money.

2156
02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:10.300
That's hilarious.
I've watched them the fuck out of that.

2157
02:03:10.301 --> 02:03:11.320
But you wouldn't watch that fight.

2158
02:03:12.010 --> 02:03:15.760
I guess Tom Cruise was like a high school wrestling state champion or something

2159
02:03:15.761 --> 02:03:18.680
like that.
Like,
yeah.
Yes.
Pictures of that for sure.

2160
02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:23.390
So why wouldn't you want to watch that?
[inaudible]
55 though.

2161
02:03:23.530 --> 02:03:26.260
He's 85 years old and he just broke his ankle doing a movie dope.

2162
02:03:26.261 --> 02:03:29.120
And he believes in warlocks.
I want to see him fight a fucking weird.
Okay.

2163
02:03:29.410 --> 02:03:31.210
Both super small too.
I don't know how that would like,

2164
02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:34.450
it wouldn't be a super interesting [inaudible] I met Justin Bieber when he's a

2165
02:03:34.451 --> 02:03:38.200
young fellow,
came to the UFC,
met that.
I've worked for them young.

2166
02:03:38.201 --> 02:03:39.520
We did fucking pumped with that kid.

2167
02:03:39.550 --> 02:03:42.970
It was so even when he was 16 out of 17 I don't even know what this man,

2168
02:03:42.971 --> 02:03:45.250
that ain't a way to do it but if you've got to do it,

2169
02:03:45.251 --> 02:03:49.090
he's handled it as good as any.
It's not,
that's not a way to grow up.

2170
02:03:49.150 --> 02:03:50.350
It's a terrible way to grow up.

2171
02:03:50.351 --> 02:03:53.440
But anybody says that they would handle that differently.
They don't.

2172
02:03:53.500 --> 02:03:56.080
They don't know what the fuck they're talking about.
Pretty fucking good job.

2173
02:03:56.590 --> 02:04:00.580
I think what would help him for like legitimately help him is a real struggle

2174
02:04:00.610 --> 02:04:03.670
like Jujitsu,
like get in the real martial arts.
I don't know if he's into it.

2175
02:04:03.850 --> 02:04:06.450
Well that's what I'm saying.
I think he's fighting cause he's training now is he?

2176
02:04:06.490 --> 02:04:09.130
I think he offered up a fight because he's learning how to train people talking

2177
02:04:09.131 --> 02:04:13.960
shit.
That shit is a motherfucking know.
Look at,
look at,
look at uh,

2178
02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:20.230

Wiz Khalifa when
Wiz Wiz,

2179
02:04:20.260 --> 02:04:23.320
super nice guy.
He used to be thin and now he's like,
fuck that.

2180
02:04:23.321 --> 02:04:25.540
I'm going to jack out.
Did you see the podcast I did with them?

2181
02:04:25.570 --> 02:04:29.200
We talked about it.
Yeah.
He just really got into it.
You guys,

2182
02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:33.310
you guys got baked this fuck.
Not as baked as I did with be real.

2183
02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:36.680
That's the highest I've ever been in anything.
Be Real size herself.

2184
02:04:36.810 --> 02:04:38.040
We were a a barbecued,
we

2185
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.920
<v 2>were barbecuing already and then we like when we get in the car then we're going</v>

2186
02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:45.140
to really small.
I'm like,
no
dude,
he doesn't show.

2187
02:04:45.370 --> 02:04:49.350
So he does a show about putting like weed and food on vice and those mother

2188
02:04:49.351 --> 02:04:53.640
fuckers eat endless amounts of weed on camera.
That's all they do all day.

2189
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:56.040
They smoked joints waiting to eat the weed food.
I was like,

2190
02:04:56.041 --> 02:04:59.850
this dude is legit be reels of Jetta Jetta.
He didn't even flinch.

2191
02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:04.150
I tapped out like two minutes into the car ride and we're not in the car ride,

2192
02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:05.370
but just sitting in a parked car,

2193
02:05:05.490 --> 02:05:07.890
but two minutes and to sit in the park car smoking weed.
I'm like,

2194
02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:10.260
I can't do this if I'm going to talk.
Yeah.

2195
02:05:10.510 --> 02:05:14.280
I mean if you want me to speak English,
I'm going to have to find a chill dad.

2196
02:05:14.281 --> 02:05:16.950
I'm like,
I'm going to take a break here.
I was so high.

2197
02:05:16.951 --> 02:05:20.210
But those are guys that could smoke blunts to themself.
That's crazy.

2198
02:05:20.370 --> 02:05:25.320
That watched me like Dell watch movies with three lip blunts.
Yo,
Star wars one.

2199
02:05:25.410 --> 02:05:30.330
This shit looked fake as fuck.
You know?
Um,

2200
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:34.770
what's his name?
Um,
uh,
Action Bronson does,

2201
02:05:35.780 --> 02:05:39.510
where he gets high and watch ancient aliens.
I was trying to do it last season,

2202
02:05:39.511 --> 02:05:42.600
but every time they were doing it I was busy doing something else and I couldn't

2203
02:05:42.601 --> 02:05:44.070
do it.
Dude.
He's the best.

2204
02:05:44.071 --> 02:05:48.060
They get high and watch ancient aliens to is the best and they sit around in a

2205
02:05:48.061 --> 02:05:51.840
green screen.
Yeah,
dude,
that's a show.
Good TV.

2206
02:05:51.870 --> 02:05:53.820
That's better than half of the other bullshit that's out there.

2207
02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:57.460
That's fun and new.
Well,
it's fun for sure.
Look,
I mean,

2208
02:05:57.530 --> 02:06:02.160
you think about if you can have some dude showing up at garage sales trying to

2209
02:06:02.161 --> 02:06:04.720
get the best deal.
You can't have action projects

2210
02:06:06.820 --> 02:06:11.080
and screen with his homies getting blasted.
C'Mon Bro.
Yeah.

2211
02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:15.980
Hilarious.
Big Body.
Best,
right dude,
we get his headset.
Got that.
Tommy.

2212
02:06:16.380 --> 02:06:21.330
Tommy.
Not,
not,
not really.
Tommy Chong joints right here.
Folks.

2213
02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:24.450
Look at,
look at,
look at did DJ outcome as a sleeping on the far right?

2214
02:06:24.451 --> 02:06:29.130
He's not even like,
look at him.
He's a good dude.
Action.
Yeah,

2215
02:06:29.131 --> 02:06:31.500
he's a good dude.
That dude's shit.
Let me see that.
Let me see that.

2216
02:06:31.501 --> 02:06:36.060
This is the Tommy Chong joint.
Yeah.
Calm,
gentle.
He's smoking a fat one,

2217
02:06:36.061 --> 02:06:38.460
but not like that motherfucker.
This is ridiculous.

2218
02:06:38.490 --> 02:06:41.640
Unless it's the Tommy Chong joint dropped down to that size.

2219
02:06:41.670 --> 02:06:45.090
You're never going to smile.
I'm going to keep it forever.
He's a legend.

2220
02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:48.990
Tommy Chong,
he's a legend.
I still listen to his albums when I was a kid,
man.

2221
02:06:49.410 --> 02:06:52.200
For me to just even be on a podcast with him was surreal.

2222
02:06:52.290 --> 02:06:55.710
I just didn't want to waste his time.
I was just wanting to like be nice to them.

2223
02:06:56.010 --> 02:06:58.940
Isn't that weird though for him?
Another podcast for him though,
didn't you?

2224
02:06:59.010 --> 02:06:59.730
Isn't that wild?

2225
02:06:59.730 --> 02:07:02.610
Doesn't that make you feel type of way where you're like I'm a hero,
this dude.

2226
02:07:02.611 --> 02:07:04.110
And he's like,
dude,
I love your shit.

2227
02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:08.280
I'm happy and I'm happy that Tommy Chong looks me cause I love him and Cheech

2228
02:07:09.130 --> 02:07:12.480
someone's kitchen man.
Yeah,
those guys were heroes,
you know,

2229
02:07:12.481 --> 02:07:15.510
like they were ridiculous.
They made everything fun.
There were silly,

2230
02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:16.830
like everything was all,

2231
02:07:16.831 --> 02:07:19.860
they were getting high and it was silly and I didn't even get high when I loved

2232
02:07:19.861 --> 02:07:20.910
them.
When I love,

2233
02:07:20.940 --> 02:07:23.790
when I was watching their movies and I was a kid like up in smoke.

2234
02:07:23.791 --> 02:07:24.630
What year was that?

2235
02:07:25.900 --> 02:07:30.900
[inaudible] 78 77 say okay and find that out and then find out what your big

2236
02:07:31.831 --> 02:07:35.940
bamboo came out.
Cause big bamboo was the album that looked like papers.
Right.

2237
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:38.350
<v 0>And they had it in that paper in there,
didn't they?
Yeah,
I think so.</v>

2238
02:07:38.351 --> 02:07:41.890
I think there was a giant piece of paper they did 78 was [inaudible] 78 was

2239
02:07:42.130 --> 02:07:46.330
right.
Congratulate 78 and then wait and then,
and then in that album they,

2240
02:07:46.390 --> 02:07:49.990
they pro,
they would later put an actual piece of rolling paper in there.

2241
02:07:50.050 --> 02:07:54.560
Well the a record sleeve was a rolling,
usable,
rolling papers.
Right.

2242
02:07:55.290 --> 02:07:58.920
Gigantism way bigger than that.
That's incredible.

2243
02:07:58.930 --> 02:08:03.930
Promoting illegal drugs and you gotta think back marijuana was a full on

2244
02:08:04.001 --> 02:08:08.890
schedule one drug schedule,
one schedule one 72 was big bamboo.
Oh Wow.

2245
02:08:08.891 --> 02:08:10.360
Big Bamboo was before.
Okay.

2246
02:08:10.361 --> 02:08:15.130
So I was three or five is the record six yeah,
yeah,

2247
02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:19.090
yeah.
There it is.
And there's the fucking rolling paper.
I was five years old.

2248
02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:22.960
I was born in 67 this was 72 so that's the rolling paper.
Wow.

2249
02:08:22.961 --> 02:08:25.600
They have a real one.
Look at the fucking inside cover.

2250
02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:28.500
The picture of the two of them.
That is crazy positive.

2251
02:08:28.510 --> 02:08:31.270
When he gets to that picture.
He had a mixture of them.
I pulled up picture.

2252
02:08:31.271 --> 02:08:33.340
That's crazy.
Before they were together.

2253
02:08:33.341 --> 02:08:36.780
And that Improv group he was in when they were really young.
Like before I,

2254
02:08:36.781 --> 02:08:39.400
before that.
Right.
That's crazy.
Is that what that's from?

2255
02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:41.740
It's right before that cow.
If I can find it again.

2256
02:08:41.890 --> 02:08:45.940
These guys are still doing shows.
Still selling out.
Here's the thing,

2257
02:08:45.941 --> 02:08:50.941
Santina and Rogan in 2084 we're going to be taken over fighting over dog.

2258
02:08:51.690 --> 02:08:54.970
That'd be taking her vitamins,
man.
Can you believe that though,
that that is,

2259
02:08:55.180 --> 02:09:00.010
that's powerful to have that kind of that longterm of effect of being talented

2260
02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:01.450
and producing good shit.

2261
02:09:01.690 --> 02:09:04.810
Those motherfuckers to be funny and cool for years and years and years.

2262
02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:06.400
They still have fans.
I mean,
think about it.

2263
02:09:06.401 --> 02:09:11.401
If you have fans from 72 to 2019 kapow named somebody else that's like that.

2264
02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:12.850
Who's killing it like that?
Right.

2265
02:09:12.851 --> 02:09:16.080
Who would be from that era that still doing what they do in the comedy world

2266
02:09:16.220 --> 02:09:19.270
would have been bill Cosby if he didn't have a few.
What did he do?

2267
02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:23.460
What he do happen?
I don't remember.
Oh,
you just said that wrong.
Sup Man,

2268
02:09:23.470 --> 02:09:26.740
but I mean who sees someone was tweeting from Bill Cosby's account about fathers

2269
02:09:26.740 --> 02:09:29.290
,
his wife apparently.
Right?
Isn't that what it was?
Somebody said on the Internet,

2270
02:09:29.291 --> 02:09:33.850
his wife goes real men take care of their families

2271
02:09:35.350 --> 02:09:39.160
and they imagine generally they raped chickens.
Looking at your computer going,

2272
02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:42.190
Yep,
this is a good one.
It's a good idea to put out.
Definitely.

2273
02:09:42.430 --> 02:09:47.090
Definitely a good idea to stay relevant.
Yeah.
Not a good idea.

2274
02:09:47.190 --> 02:09:48.640
It's a bad rep in prison.

2275
02:09:49.570 --> 02:09:52.750
I mean how many rapes you have to have or people forget.

2276
02:09:52.780 --> 02:09:55.090
How many rapes does it take to get the center of a jail cell?

2277
02:09:55.690 --> 02:09:57.760
What do you got checking?
Hold on.

2278
02:09:58.510 --> 02:10:03.510
It's so strange that when I was a kid he was the cleanest,

2279
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:08.050
friendliest like family guy.
He was fat Albert,

2280
02:10:08.230 --> 02:10:12.880
he was Jello pudding.
He was like this super sweet,

2281
02:10:12.910 --> 02:10:14.980
Nice Guy,
clean,
cut,

2282
02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:19.240
clean cut and that's the same thing with like the talking about like the male

2283
02:10:19.241 --> 02:10:22.810
feminist that there's guys that want women to do great because it just kind,

2284
02:10:22.811 --> 02:10:24.790
they want everybody to do great.
You know what I'm talking about.

2285
02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:27.820
But then these guys that are just weasels,
right?
Yes.

2286
02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:33.400
Must be similar to those clean cut guys and just really pushing you to not use

2287
02:10:33.831 --> 02:10:36.590
such language.
Why would you use a site like that?

2288
02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:40.970
Those guys are almost always fucked up.
Of course,
something's up.

2289
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:44.690
Something's that way.
What do you give a fuck about?
People using certain words?

2290
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:49.100
Do not know what a word is.
A word is a vehicle for conveying intent.

2291
02:10:49.130 --> 02:10:51.400
Some of them disturb you.
What does what?

2292
02:10:51.410 --> 02:10:55.340
What's going on behind your fucking screens?
Brow,
right?
It's happening in there.

2293
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:58.850
When?
When?
When you,
when you deprive people of things,

2294
02:10:58.940 --> 02:11:02.150
good God did they want it more and when they show signs of depravity,

2295
02:11:02.151 --> 02:11:04.250
that means they,
that's something deep inside of them.

2296
02:11:04.410 --> 02:11:08.630
Do you think that everyone who's like squeaky clean is a pervert?
Well,

2297
02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:12.560
have some semblance.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes,
of course.
When you preach,

2298
02:11:12.590 --> 02:11:14.750
when you preach the perfection,
what does that really mean?

2299
02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:17.050
Something's wrong with you.
Something's wrong with you,
dude.

2300
02:11:17.460 --> 02:11:19.940
Why are you telling me how to be perfect?
Why are you doing me?

2301
02:11:19.941 --> 02:11:24.470
How To fucking stop doing heroin?
Are you,
oh,
are you,

2302
02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:28.220
Duncan told me this about the Dalai Lama.
Hilarious story that he's blind.

2303
02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:29.713
Dalai Lama,

2304
02:11:30.910 --> 02:11:33.180
<v 1>um,
uh,
his,</v>

2305
02:11:33.190 --> 02:11:37.990
his mother wants him to quit doing sugar and uh,
he says,
come back in one month.

2306
02:11:38.350 --> 02:11:42.730
So it comes back in one month and uh,
he goes,
stop doing sugar.

2307
02:11:43.300 --> 02:11:45.610
And the mother's like,
well,
why did you wait a month?
He goes,

2308
02:11:45.611 --> 02:11:46.660
I want to see if I could do it.

2309
02:11:56.070 --> 02:12:00.830
<v 0>It's so poignant,
like,
oh yeah,
hey,
you should right.
Yeah.</v>

2310
02:12:00.910 --> 02:12:04.090
There's a lot of people telling you that's wild.

2311
02:12:04.091 --> 02:12:08.180
Respect women just respect and we want,
that guy just got done screaming.

2312
02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:10.930
His ex girlfriend calling her a fucking con,

2313
02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:15.550
Oh fuck is dragging you in Twitter.
Fucking bitch fucking pitch.

2314
02:12:17.410 --> 02:12:22.410
And then it's like women are goddesses must be respect to those who throw stones

2315
02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:26.620
always live in a glass house.
They always do it.

2316
02:12:26.980 --> 02:12:29.620
That's the first person to throw something is the first person that's like,

2317
02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:33.420
what's really going on with you.
Hey,
by the way,
by the way,
by the way,
by the way,

2318
02:12:33.450 --> 02:12:37.720
by the way,
you see Louie at Skank fest?
Yeah.
What a response.
Interesting.

2319
02:12:38.650 --> 02:12:42.670
Our boy,
Tim Dillon tweeted about it and people went after him.

2320
02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:46.270
He tweeted best moment of my year or something like that.

2321
02:12:46.390 --> 02:12:51.220
You know what someone said to me?
Um,
people lost it.
He said fucking loved him.

2322
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.870
Dylan.
Someone

2323
02:12:51.870 --> 02:12:55.830
<v 1>said that,
you know,
hey,
fuck you Joe Rogan.
Uh,</v>

2324
02:12:55.860 --> 02:12:59.400
he sexually assaulted women.
Like,
man,

2325
02:13:00.930 --> 02:13:05.100
that's,
I understand that people are upset about what he did,

2326
02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:07.680
but he did not sexually assault women.

2327
02:13:07.681 --> 02:13:10.710
And to say that the one,

2328
02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:12.870
the one air,

2329
02:13:12.900 --> 02:13:17.280
the one group of people that it really fucks is people who have been actually

2330
02:13:17.281 --> 02:13:21.780
sexually assaulted.
Yes.
When it got,
it's not what he does.
Not Good.

2331
02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:27.360
When a guy says,
can I jerk off in front of you?
And you say yes,

2332
02:13:27.361 --> 02:13:29.310
and he does it,
it is a big,

2333
02:13:29.311 --> 02:13:32.790
there's a big difference between that and sexual and contrary to popular
opinion.

2334
02:13:33.630 --> 02:13:36.540
Now how many people really know the story?
And again,

2335
02:13:37.230 --> 02:13:38.520
not saying that we did was good.

2336
02:13:38.740 --> 02:13:42.420
We did was definitely not good when people said no,
he didn't do it.

2337
02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:46.020
It's not like he made people do it if they didn't say yes,
he asked questions.

2338
02:13:46.140 --> 02:13:48.330
And a lot of people don't know this.
I'm not,
this is not.

2339
02:13:48.690 --> 02:13:50.700
And I saw an article in one of these papers,

2340
02:13:50.701 --> 02:13:53.610
it was saying that he's changing his story.
He's not changing his story.

2341
02:13:53.970 --> 02:13:58.500
What he said was their stories are true,
but in their stories,
he,

2342
02:13:58.710 --> 02:14:01.260
I don't think you wanted to defend every single aspect of it,

2343
02:14:01.261 --> 02:14:06.030
but as far as I know he didn't.
No one said no and they did it anyway.

2344
02:14:06.060 --> 02:14:06.690
That's what I've,

2345
02:14:06.690 --> 02:14:10.470
that's all I've ever heard in Sarah Silverman talked about how he would ask her

2346
02:14:10.471 --> 02:14:13.470
and she would say yes and he would do it.
Sometimes she would say no.
Right.

2347
02:14:13.471 --> 02:14:18.150
Sometimes you want to see you jerk off stop.
Right.
But he's a freak.
Okay.

2348
02:14:18.151 --> 02:14:18.984
He's a Weirdo.

2349
02:14:19.030 --> 02:14:24.030
This is genius comic and I don't think he's as bad as people want to believe.

2350
02:14:24.570 --> 02:14:27.720
Yes.
I think he made mistakes like a human and I don't,
you know,

2351
02:14:27.721 --> 02:14:30.750
I don't think it was good.
And again,
I don't think he's happy about it at all.

2352
02:14:30.780 --> 02:14:34.770
And by everything,
that's a a giant understatement.

2353
02:14:35.760 --> 02:14:40.260
But when does it end?
Like,
oh,
that's fine.
Is He allowed to perform?

2354
02:14:40.261 --> 02:14:42.750
When is he allowed to perform for people who forgive him?
When,

2355
02:14:42.751 --> 02:14:47.370
when is he allowed to perform?
I don't know.
Is the conversation

2356
02:14:49.110 --> 02:14:52.410
comes to a point where it's not like you're endorsing terrible behavior,

2357
02:14:52.411 --> 02:14:55.380
but you are saying at a certain point in time you got to give someone a way out.

2358
02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:59.070
Because if you don't,
then they start to recognize what you are.
Right.
Okay.

2359
02:14:59.071 --> 02:15:01.050
And you're kind of a tyrant and you're,

2360
02:15:01.051 --> 02:15:03.300
you're kind of saying you don't believe in forgiveness.

2361
02:15:03.301 --> 02:15:04.470
You don't believe in improvement.

2362
02:15:04.471 --> 02:15:08.400
You don't believe in anybody ever getting past a,
a bad deed that they did.

2363
02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:12.540
And I think,
I guess a human who's a kind tree,
try to be a kind person,

2364
02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:16.200
try to be a fair person.
You know,
you gotta,

2365
02:15:16.380 --> 02:15:20.040
you gotta let people grow and move past mistakes.

2366
02:15:20.190 --> 02:15:23.370
I don't know when it is and I don't know what someone has to say in order to get

2367
02:15:23.371 --> 02:15:27.150
you to forgive it,
but the fact that people dwell on it and unless it's someone,

2368
02:15:27.390 --> 02:15:31.650
unless you and him have a personal thing and you want to talk to him about it,

2369
02:15:31.651 --> 02:15:33.390
he should sir.
And I don't know if he has,

2370
02:15:33.391 --> 02:15:34.530
I don't know if he's done any of that stuff.

2371
02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:40.640
But I think as a culture we are way too quick,

2372
02:15:41.010 --> 02:15:46.010
not just to condemn but to attack and to continue to attack relentlessly and to

2373
02:15:46.241 --> 02:15:50.940
never want someone to get up.
And that's not a sign of a compassionate person.

2374
02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:56.360
And maybe it's partly to blame for people who don't express themselves and don't

2375
02:15:56.881 --> 02:16:00.660
give you a full version of who they are and you let people contemplate who you

2376
02:16:00.661 --> 02:16:04.290
are.
And I think anyone in the public eye has been guilty of that to some extent.

2377
02:16:04.980 --> 02:16:06.510
But this is a significant issue.

2378
02:16:07.020 --> 02:16:12.020
And I think that people immediately start taking sides and they start going girl

2379
02:16:12.511 --> 02:16:15.720
versus boy,
male versus female.

2380
02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:19.440
And I think there's real danger in US splitting up like that too.

2381
02:16:19.500 --> 02:16:24.500
I think that w w we can't get to this place where women feel like they can't

2382
02:16:25.591 --> 02:16:28.920
trust men.
And men feel that if can't trust women just universally.

2383
02:16:29.050 --> 02:16:30.610
And then you find rare exceptions.

2384
02:16:30.870 --> 02:16:34.920
<v 2>I've read shit like that before.
Like,
uh,
I read some lady wrote,
it was,</v>

2385
02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:35.861
it was kinda sad.

2386
02:16:35.861 --> 02:16:40.000
She wrote like any straight white male is trash unless proven otherwise.

2387
02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:43.900
It's like,
look,
I know it must be hard.
Okay.

2388
02:16:43.901 --> 02:16:47.500
Did I know it must be hard on the same thing to cast such a big net,

2389
02:16:47.501 --> 02:16:52.360
not just to even think Filipinos have a bad leg,
but you're abroad.

2390
02:16:52.510 --> 02:16:57.510
You're broadcasting it to 6,000 followers either putting that on your Twitter

2391
02:16:57.671 --> 02:17:00.420
page,
it's silly.
It's a crazy way of looking at compass.

2392
02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:04.660
An entire group of humans ever,
ever forever.
Does that make sense?

2393
02:17:04.830 --> 02:17:08.140
Doesn't make sense.
So what the fuck are we like,
look,

2394
02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:12.130
I get where they're coming from because they feel like they're gaining ground.

2395
02:17:12.550 --> 02:17:12.941
Sure.

2396
02:17:12.941 --> 02:17:15.580
So a guy like Louis CK comes back and they're thinking they're connecting them

2397
02:17:15.581 --> 02:17:19.300
with Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby.
And I don't think it's the same thing.

2398
02:17:19.780 --> 02:17:22.480
And I don't,
I don't,
I can't,
I don't think what he did was good.
Look,

2399
02:17:22.481 --> 02:17:23.940
I have all daughters,
man.
Anyway,

2400
02:17:24.030 --> 02:17:27.570
jerking off in front of them when they really don't want it.
Sure,
sure.
It's,

2401
02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.700
it's not good.
I'm sorry about that.
Last summer.
I didn't mean to do that.

2402
02:17:31.250 --> 02:17:34.090
That's barbecue till I just thought I'd get time to have a good time.

2403
02:17:34.091 --> 02:17:36.670
I didn't feel bad at all.
No,
but fucking come on man.
I just,

2404
02:17:36.671 --> 02:17:39.160
I just think that like we have classes of crimes you don't have,

2405
02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:41.230
you're not going to do it in this,
in this world.
You know,

2406
02:17:41.231 --> 02:17:43.880
you said they're all the same.
And then I heard someone,
I will,

2407
02:17:43.970 --> 02:17:47.590
I'll see in someone saying what he did was definitely a crime.
Um,
and I was like,

2408
02:17:47.591 --> 02:17:51.550
come on,
you might be upset that he did it,
but it's not a crime.
It's wrong.

2409
02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:53.740
It's unfortunate that the real problem,

2410
02:17:53.741 --> 02:17:57.280
the real issue is that he was in a position where these girls were admiring him.

2411
02:17:57.460 --> 02:18:00.160
Right.
That's the real,
and I think he's recognize that.

2412
02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:05.260
I don't think he's explained it to some people's,
uh,
what they desire,

2413
02:18:05.740 --> 02:18:09.730
you know,
some people's requirements.
And I appreciate that and I understand that.

2414
02:18:10.540 --> 02:18:10.720
Um,

2415
02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:15.720
I really just think what a lot of us are missing is just a lack of communication

2416
02:18:15.821 --> 02:18:18.970
and compassionate and understanding.
Yeah.
I think we're missing a lot of that.

2417
02:18:18.971 --> 02:18:20.650
Totally.
And were real,
you know,

2418
02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:22.930
we've got to think of people like anytime someone's,

2419
02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:24.730
I mean I'm going to talk about people that are serial killers.

2420
02:18:24.731 --> 02:18:27.170
I'm just talking about people who make mistakes.
You've got to treat them.

2421
02:18:27.310 --> 02:18:30.190
We're all human beings.
People make mistakes.
We fuck up.

2422
02:18:30.191 --> 02:18:33.430
Doesn't mean you're a canceled person.
You got,
we got to stop with that.
I really,

2423
02:18:33.431 --> 02:18:37.420
I really think that cause I just think that it's not helping anybody and it's

2424
02:18:37.421 --> 02:18:40.390
getting people's jollies off cause they watch someone crashed down.

2425
02:18:40.540 --> 02:18:42.340
They have people love to watch someone fucking burned.

2426
02:18:42.370 --> 02:18:46.240
And I was also thinking that also when this kind of stuff happens,

2427
02:18:46.241 --> 02:18:49.570
people don't want to ever reconsider their opinion on a person.

2428
02:18:49.571 --> 02:18:53.290
Like there's this thing about Kevin Spacey and the,
uh,

2429
02:18:53.350 --> 02:18:57.640
they made the text available of this guy who had Kevin Spacey,

2430
02:18:57.641 --> 02:19:00.970
was touching his dick going back and forth with his girlfriend,
Bro.

2431
02:19:00.980 --> 02:19:02.650
They were laughing about it.
Okay.

2432
02:19:02.651 --> 02:19:04.740
And they're trying to make it seem like this is evidence that they were,

2433
02:19:04.930 --> 02:19:07.740
that he was scared and they,
Kevin Spacey was sexually abusing them.

2434
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:10.650
They were like,
oh my God,
he's gay.
He's gay.
He's touching my dick.

2435
02:19:10.850 --> 02:19:12.340
He's gaze unzipping my pants.
He's gay.

2436
02:19:12.490 --> 02:19:17.320
This guy was texting his girlfriend while Kevin Spacey is Assholey so gay.

2437
02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:21.160
He's so gay.
I think he must be gay because I'm fucking him in his mouth now,
bro.

2438
02:19:21.220 --> 02:19:23.710
They sh they released all the text messages,

2439
02:19:23.711 --> 02:19:25.510
but they didn't release some of them.

2440
02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:28.880
And the mother said that she deleted a lot of them that are,
uh,

2441
02:19:28.940 --> 02:19:31.520
related to his frat boy,
like behavior.

2442
02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:36.480
What does that probably jokes about getting his Dick Sucked by Kevin Spacey.

2443
02:19:37.510 --> 02:19:40.700
Little Shit in there.
That's hilarious.
Yeah.
No,
there's some deception going on,

2444
02:19:40.730 --> 02:19:45.020
I think.
I mean,
I'm not a,
obviously I'm not a lawyer,
but,
uh,
I think,

2445
02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:48.500
I think they're trying to make some money.
That's what I think is horse shit.

2446
02:19:48.590 --> 02:19:52.200
I don't think this 18 year old kids worried about this 800 year old man touching

2447
02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:56.540
his dick.
You flat line.
That guy just popped me in the face.
When you're 18,

2448
02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:00.170
you'll punch the fuck out of some 65 year old pervert cow man.

2449
02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:03.490
Unless he's a small fellow.
I don't know if he's,
I don't know.

2450
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:06.470
No idea about his physical stature,
but if I was 18,

2451
02:20:06.471 --> 02:20:11.120
some guy was kept grabbing my dick,
I'd put them asleep.
Yeah.
To you go at night,

2452
02:20:11.121 --> 02:20:14.000
90% at 18.
You're like,
I'm going to fight you dude.
I'm like,

2453
02:20:14.001 --> 02:20:15.290
you're not going to fuck me man.

2454
02:20:15.770 --> 02:20:18.680
What does the messages start with the accuser texting?

2455
02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:21.050
Like he's hanging around me in the bar,

2456
02:20:21.170 --> 02:20:24.890
he's got my number and asked me to come out with him.
The girlfriend replies,

2457
02:20:24.891 --> 02:20:28.160
are you kidding?
And then sends to other messages saying what?

2458
02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:32.300
And then here it says,
sounds like he's hitting on you.

2459
02:20:32.780 --> 02:20:37.130
The man types I think he is.
And then he's grabbing my leg and expletive.

2460
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.611
Oh my God,

2461
02:20:37.611 --> 02:20:42.611
you can't say cock and goes away to say I'm not gay adding.

2462
02:20:42.950 --> 02:20:46.820
But I think spacey is uh,
the accuser continued texting,

2463
02:20:46.821 --> 02:20:50.750
saying that he was being touched inappropriately like eight times later adding.

2464
02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:52.670
And then he invited me to his house.

2465
02:20:52.790 --> 02:20:56.590
Hey pro tip pro tip,

2466
02:20:56.640 --> 02:20:59.390
which was Julie [inaudible] your Dick.

2467
02:20:59.690 --> 02:21:03.680
You gotta tell him to stop looking at the job once.

2468
02:21:03.681 --> 02:21:07.940
Does he say the guy's girlfriend?
Stop.
What the expletive fuck his ass on this.

2469
02:21:07.941 --> 02:21:11.030
I saw this.
Have Fun.
Too much fun.
I was going to get to that.
She's just Christ.

2470
02:21:11.120 --> 02:21:13.370
He reached down my pants.
What the fuck is happening?

2471
02:21:13.371 --> 02:21:17.150
Have Fun but not too much fun,
if you know what I mean.
Jesus Christ.

2472
02:21:17.151 --> 02:21:21.410
He reached down my pants.
Help.
No,
this is Kevin Ducking spacey.

2473
02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:25.220
The bitch came even spelled,
she fucked with the auto tech stuff.
He's gay.

2474
02:21:25.250 --> 02:21:29.930
He's buying me another drink.
Oh my God,
Babe.
He's gay.
I think I want to hang.

2475
02:21:29.931 --> 02:21:33.410
This kid is gay.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Why are you,

2476
02:21:33.540 --> 02:21:36.920
do you choose your rights that he got autographs and a hell of a story.

2477
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:43.040
Come on man.
Opportunistic.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe it's not gay.

2478
02:21:43.070 --> 02:21:44.210
Maybe he's just a kid.

2479
02:21:44.300 --> 02:21:46.880
How do I do at time and doesn't understand how crazy this is.

2480
02:21:46.910 --> 02:21:49.460
Not a lot of people get sexually assaulted.
Have time to text.
Okay.

2481
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:50.960
I'm just saying he's,

2482
02:21:51.140 --> 02:21:54.560
he's having fun playing around joining the fact that it was Kevin Spacey doing

2483
02:21:54.750 --> 02:21:57.230
to to them for sure,
but it doesn't sound to me in any way.

2484
02:21:57.231 --> 02:21:58.064
Like he was threatened.

2485
02:21:58.340 --> 02:22:01.220
He sounded like he let the guy touch him and maybe it should be accused of blue

2486
02:22:01.221 --> 02:22:05.360
bond.
Mr Spacey did space.
You get a nut.
Does it say that at the end?

2487
02:22:06.410 --> 02:22:08.840
But you think that he was flirting with them a little bit?
Clean them on,

2488
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:12.110
keep Kevin Spacey around.
He thinks it's funny.
It's fucked up.

2489
02:22:12.111 --> 02:22:15.080
The whole story is fucked up.
If Kevin Spacey really did do it,

2490
02:22:15.081 --> 02:22:19.250
then it's fucked up that we're joking about it.
And if Kevin Spacey didn't do it,

2491
02:22:19.251 --> 02:22:19.911
then it's fucked up.

2492
02:22:19.911 --> 02:22:22.790
This guy's trying to set him up because he just wants to make money and he's

2493
02:22:23.210 --> 02:22:24.320
ruining Kevin Spacey's life.

2494
02:22:24.680 --> 02:22:28.550
But Kevin Spacey's laugh is already in trumpet spiral.
There's a lot of shit.

2495
02:22:28.610 --> 02:22:32.610
A lot of shit grabbing.
This was a nice lady and incident.
Yeah,
that was one.

2496
02:22:32.670 --> 02:22:35.010
One of many.
But if it's a different thing,

2497
02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:37.770
if you look at that story after you read those texts,
you,
oh,

2498
02:22:37.771 --> 02:22:39.780
this is a different thing.
This isn't like,

2499
02:22:39.781 --> 02:22:42.090
he's like trying to force some guy into a bathroom,

2500
02:22:42.091 --> 02:22:44.530
bludgeoned him and fuck them boys unconscious,
partied there,

2501
02:22:44.600 --> 02:22:46.800
partied out having a good time and he said they're buying is another drink.

2502
02:22:46.830 --> 02:22:51.210
The guy is hanging around.
Yes.
He's not being forced against his will.

2503
02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:52.680
There's no one that's holding them there.

2504
02:22:52.970 --> 02:22:54.600
You got your Dick grab once and he didn't want it.

2505
02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:56.420
You don't let it happen seven more times.

2506
02:23:01.090 --> 02:23:05.550
And everyone's like,
look,
the victim is crying for help.
Yeah.
Any text,

2507
02:23:05.551 --> 02:23:09.000
someone he just grabbed my Dick Dude.
Again,
it is,

2508
02:23:09.001 --> 02:23:10.920
this is what men have to really,
truly understand.

2509
02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:14.040
It is so much different when a guy like Kevin Spacey and I again,

2510
02:23:14.041 --> 02:23:15.960
I don't know what this guy looked like,

2511
02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:18.140
but I'm gonna assume it was me at 18 right?

2512
02:23:18.450 --> 02:23:23.450
A normal cool dude who does,
you know,
athletic stuff.

2513
02:23:23.580 --> 02:23:25.240
I'm strong at 18 and I,

2514
02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:28.140
I'm not worried about him raping me as what my point is where as a woman,

2515
02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:32.070
if a guy's doing that and you guys cornered you and fear there's fear,

2516
02:23:32.820 --> 02:23:34.710
you literally literally worried this guy could rape you.

2517
02:23:34.711 --> 02:23:37.470
I hope he's not that guy that would rate me the kind of guy,
right?

2518
02:23:37.500 --> 02:23:39.900
Because women don't know if you're the kind of guy that would rape them.

2519
02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:41.490
Cause look at Ted Bundy,
man.

2520
02:23:41.490 --> 02:23:45.410
He was a handsome guy and girls would just go with him because they thought like

2521
02:23:45.410 --> 02:23:48.990
,
oh he looks good,
he's fine now he's killing them,
right?

2522
02:23:49.050 --> 02:23:52.320
So girls legitimately have to worry about that work.
Guys don't.

2523
02:23:52.440 --> 02:23:55.260
So even this guy with Kevin Spacey,

2524
02:23:55.290 --> 02:23:58.260
if he didn't like what Kevin Spacey was doing,

2525
02:23:58.410 --> 02:24:03.270
there's no indication that he said it to him,
right?
So he's probably thinking,

2526
02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:06.480
we're going to party.
I'm touching this guy's Dick.
He ain't saying shit.

2527
02:24:06.690 --> 02:24:09.870
He's just texting his friends.
God,
tell your friends,
when I Fuck your mouth,

2528
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:13.320
tell your friends I want to fuck your friends to bring those mothers under those

2529
02:24:13.321 --> 02:24:16.080
guys to bring the whole team.
I'll fuck all of them.

2530
02:24:16.620 --> 02:24:19.260
He's probably thinking he's going to have a good time because this guy's not

2531
02:24:19.470 --> 02:24:22.530
saying anything right.
Meanwhile,
this guy's texting is never does he say,
hey,

2532
02:24:22.531 --> 02:24:25.830
I told him to stop touching my dick and he won't leave me alone.
No,

2533
02:24:25.950 --> 02:24:28.560
it doesn't say that.
He invited me to his house.
We're ready to party.

2534
02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:30.870
I had to push him away from me.
I was kind of fucked him up,

2535
02:24:30.871 --> 02:24:35.470
but I guess he's drunk.
I'm coming to you baby,
cause I love you know that lol.

2536
02:24:35.690 --> 02:24:39.690
He's tricking me off in his mouth.
She says,
be careful,
have fun,
which is,
well,

2537
02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:42.750
you're out for the night.
I guess she even told him that being gay is okay.

2538
02:24:43.140 --> 02:24:45.090
She just said,
are you trying to tell me something being gay is okay.

2539
02:24:45.091 --> 02:24:45.841
That's when I responded,

2540
02:24:45.841 --> 02:24:50.280
I'm not k lol that I'll the first part for other kids not scared.
Okay.

2541
02:24:50.281 --> 02:24:54.870
This idea that he should get money because he was getting sexually assaulted.
No.

2542
02:24:54.871 --> 02:24:58.830
You're getting hit on and you're all at a,
an establishment that serves drugs.

2543
02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:03.570
The drug that reduces inhibition better than any drug,
alcohol,
alcohol,

2544
02:25:03.571 --> 02:25:06.550
and you're accepting this drug from this guy who has already touched your Dick

2545
02:25:06.551 --> 02:25:09.240
seven times.
Knowledging it.
By the way,
this isn't like a,

2546
02:25:09.241 --> 02:25:12.230
I didn't know what's happening because I didn't dictating lol.
Yeah,

2547
02:25:12.500 --> 02:25:16.600
joking about it.
My,
his Dick is in my ass.
Oh dear.
Oh,

2548
02:25:16.630 --> 02:25:18.660
what was happening?
Do you think that Kevin Spacey,

2549
02:25:18.770 --> 02:25:21.510
you should be able to sue him back counter suit for that,

2550
02:25:21.511 --> 02:25:25.850
for defamation of character just for being a bitch?
Yeah.

2551
02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:28.790
Just souffles being a bitch.
Like if there was a court of honor,

2552
02:25:29.130 --> 02:25:33.000
I'm sweater Babich like will you could a judge Santino um,

2553
02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:35.050
please welcome this case.
Uh,

2554
02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:38.620
Mr Spacey touched his boy's Dick over and over again and continue to buy him

2555
02:25:38.621 --> 02:25:40.600
drinks and the man never said no,

2556
02:25:40.630 --> 02:25:42.490
but he texted his girlfriend over and over again.

2557
02:25:42.491 --> 02:25:46.900
Then later on sued Mr Spacey for Sexual Assault.
Your thoughts,

2558
02:25:48.250 --> 02:25:50.200
young man,
you're guilty of being a bitch.

2559
02:25:51.310 --> 02:25:55.240
You must serve time as a biatch.
Okay.
Then the question is,

2560
02:25:55.330 --> 02:25:59.560
is there a real issue with him being 18 were like,
hey,
he's legal.

2561
02:25:59.590 --> 02:26:04.420
Maybe he's legal,
but maybe he's like bewildered.
Like he doesn't know what to do.

2562
02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:08.260
He's but maybe never been around a famous guy like Kevin Spacey before.

2563
02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:11.260
He doesn't know how to tell a guy to get off of them and doesn't have

2564
02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:14.740
experienced being around gay guys or maybe he's never had a guy tried to fuck

2565
02:26:14.741 --> 02:26:16.600
them.
Yeah.
But he doesn't want to get into the game.

2566
02:26:16.601 --> 02:26:19.640
The text all say that he's playing,
oh,
he's taught you meeting.
We're going to,

2567
02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:21.880
but maybe we're going to hang out with,
he's doing this game.

2568
02:26:21.940 --> 02:26:25.750
He's playing a game and material.
You're harassing the witness.

2569
02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:29.370
They can work at the bar.
Then what was he doing at the bar?
Uh,
sucking dicks.

2570
02:26:29.530 --> 02:26:33.870
Who's a gay bar?
18.
Is that a bar?
I think he worked there,
but there's what?

2571
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:37.570
They lied to him and to until age 23 that was another part of the problem.

2572
02:26:38.410 --> 02:26:42.220
The kid lied and told seven Stacy who was older than he was bom bomb bomb.

2573
02:26:42.790 --> 02:26:43.623
The plot thickens.

2574
02:26:43.750 --> 02:26:46.330
So there's bars you can go into under 21 I know you can be in there.

2575
02:26:46.390 --> 02:26:48.100
I'm just saying like what was he doing just hanging out,

2576
02:26:48.130 --> 02:26:50.980
having fun or was he working like,
well he did say he's going to buy a strength.

2577
02:26:50.981 --> 02:26:51.580
That's what I meant.

2578
02:26:51.580 --> 02:26:54.250
Was he like a busboy and like he just kept walking by him and he kept grabbing

2579
02:26:54.300 --> 02:26:56.590
the stick every time they must find work there.
I'm looking at,

2580
02:26:56.591 --> 02:26:59.380
I don't see anything that we don't know.
They keep talking about this poor fella.

2581
02:26:59.750 --> 02:27:01.370
They didn't want to run into Kevin Spacey and,

2582
02:27:01.390 --> 02:27:05.920
but it was a financial opportunity and he had capitalized,
which can happen.

2583
02:27:05.950 --> 02:27:09.910
These,
are you going to go to jail?
No.
Fuck No.
No.
These guys getting any money.

2584
02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:14.800
Yeah,
the kid hush money.
Yeah,
I get it.
How much does he want?
He'll get it all.

2585
02:27:14.990 --> 02:27:18.040
Set it that you got him drunk and then a sexually assaulted them at that bar is

2586
02:27:18.041 --> 02:27:20.770
what happened.
He worked there.
Is that what you said?
I worked there as a busboy.

2587
02:27:20.860 --> 02:27:25.780
Okay.
People,
people with wealth always get off.
Like,
what's her name?
Uh,

2588
02:27:25.781 --> 02:27:28.780
the USC people,
Lori Loughlin and it's fucked up,
man.

2589
02:27:28.810 --> 02:27:31.690
They get off the last season of house of cards.

2590
02:27:32.650 --> 02:27:37.540
Nobody gave a fuck about it.
There was a big billboard,
billboards,

2591
02:27:37.541 --> 02:27:41.230
and everybody was like,
oh,
okay.
There was a,
for your consideration.

2592
02:27:41.530 --> 02:27:46.060
What is her name again?
Uh,
uh,
Robin,
right.
Robin Wright.

2593
02:27:46.061 --> 02:27:49.490
She's amazing.
She's amazing.
One of the best actresses I've,
we've ever had a lot.

2594
02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:52.780
She needed him to play off.
He was ultimate evil.

2595
02:27:52.781 --> 02:27:55.770
That was was turning her Maury.

2596
02:27:55.780 --> 02:27:59.450
Well they killed her boyfriend's boiler roller.
Yeah.

2597
02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:02.860
Borough row and in the moot.
By the way,
in the show,

2598
02:28:02.861 --> 02:28:06.220
he's doing a lot of gang shit like hand in hand.
Okay.
We'll show he's,

2599
02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:09.100
he does get,
he gets his cock,
sucked them in a library or some shit.

2600
02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:10.510
This guy's lot of crazy shit.

2601
02:28:10.540 --> 02:28:15.490
It's a crazy fucking which why I loved and it was amazing and you needed dirty,

2602
02:28:15.491 --> 02:28:19.450
crazy fuck like Kevin Spacey to pull that character off for sure.
Look,

2603
02:28:19.620 --> 02:28:20.860
the part of you knew,

2604
02:28:21.590 --> 02:28:25.130
he knew what it was to be a crazy fuck.

2605
02:28:25.450 --> 02:28:29.630
That's like part of how he pulled that roll off.
You bought it.
Okay.

2606
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:34.750
This is not Ron Howard pretending to be bang and dudes and getting his dick

2607
02:28:35.241 --> 02:28:38.670
sucked and all that stuff.
Best roles.
He's playing a crazy guy.
Yeah,
he's crazy.

2608
02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:41.780
Yeah.
Always admit.
It's also why he's such an amazing artist,

2609
02:28:41.781 --> 02:28:45.020
but that doesn't give him a license to victimize.

2610
02:28:45.021 --> 02:28:49.880
All those people that you know when after that were sports.
It's not justifying,

2611
02:28:50.060 --> 02:28:54.410
but what I'm saying is it's amazing how someone who is fucked up like that can

2612
02:28:54.411 --> 02:28:56.120
produce,
you know,

2613
02:28:56.150 --> 02:29:00.440
like this kind of art where as an you,
like,

2614
02:29:00.441 --> 02:29:04.760
he makes a show,
right?
The show a big part of what it was.

2615
02:29:05.180 --> 02:29:09.620
Because you bought this guy as this crazy tormented,
twisted.
Absolutely.

2616
02:29:09.980 --> 02:29:13.730
I mean it was,
he was so,
he was so eloquent at it.
He has,
it was unbelievable.

2617
02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:16.220
It would just look,
it looked so natural,
so real.

2618
02:29:16.500 --> 02:29:18.770
That was probably because it was real.
Right?
100% I mean,

2619
02:29:18.771 --> 02:29:21.500
you know how many people in America,
you say for years and you're like,

2620
02:29:21.501 --> 02:29:25.100
Kevin Spacey's gay and that business has known about it and they go,

2621
02:29:25.230 --> 02:29:26.360
you're fucking out of your head.

2622
02:29:30.860 --> 02:29:35.420
You don't always gay.
But how many people in America where we go,
he's not,

2623
02:29:35.421 --> 02:29:38.900
he's not gay.
What are you nuts?
Fucking California.

2624
02:29:39.380 --> 02:29:40.410
Remember through everybody's good.

2625
02:29:40.430 --> 02:29:42.740
But that's the problem is because there's a perception perception.

2626
02:29:42.770 --> 02:29:43.461
And in the show,

2627
02:29:43.461 --> 02:29:47.510
him playing this character who's also art imitating life balancing on this world

2628
02:29:47.511 --> 02:29:51.350
of hiding a big secret.
It was just so close to home.
It was crazy.
Good show dude.

2629
02:29:51.351 --> 02:29:53.840
So good.
When she fell in love with that artist.
Oh,

2630
02:29:54.110 --> 02:29:57.250
so good with them in New York and there's pictures of them together and it's

2631
02:29:57.290 --> 02:29:59.690
like,
whoa,
this is crazy.

2632
02:30:00.290 --> 02:30:03.710
Crazy egg him naked in bed and some great examples and loft.

2633
02:30:03.711 --> 02:30:07.100
And so he needed them together after they kicked him out.
You're like,
what?

2634
02:30:07.150 --> 02:30:09.740
The damage is too strong.
When they were together.
It was amazing.

2635
02:30:09.950 --> 02:30:12.060
In the episode one that I watched the another watch,

2636
02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:15.740
everybody looks super nervous.
Everybody looked,
it looked like super.

2637
02:30:15.900 --> 02:30:18.410
It just looked.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Just looked off the show,

2638
02:30:18.411 --> 02:30:22.560
looked off.
They like,
they knew Jesus Christ.
I just fired Kevin Spacey.
Never.

2639
02:30:22.610 --> 02:30:27.110
We're going to watch it on camera.
They're like,
so we'll just continue this game.

2640
02:30:27.170 --> 02:30:30.950
It was just weird.
Yeah.
I mean,
maybe it got better as time went on.

2641
02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:35.570
I didn't see it.
You know,
who I really liked too was the,
uh,
his assistant,

2642
02:30:35.571 --> 02:30:40.490
that guy that helped him out that would do anything for him that killed Rachel

2643
02:30:40.490 --> 02:30:43.820
Brosnahan.
Yeah.
What'd you put her in front of a train?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2644
02:30:43.821 --> 02:30:45.530
That was him.
That was Kevin Spacey.

2645
02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:49.340
Kevin Spacey push the girl from the train and that was the guy went back and

2646
02:30:49.341 --> 02:30:53.870
killed the hooker.
Right.
That hooker went on to be the marvelous Mrs Maizel.

2647
02:30:53.990 --> 02:30:57.620
That's right.
Richard Branson.
Brosnahan that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's right.

2648
02:30:58.010 --> 02:31:02.240
She's dope.
She's great.
Very dope.
It's great in that Maizel show.
Yes.

2649
02:31:02.241 --> 02:31:05.450
That is a good fucking show.
You know Amazon's doing comedy specials now.

2650
02:31:05.570 --> 02:31:08.730
Are they or did Jim,
uh,
Jim Gaffigan.
Oh,

2651
02:31:08.860 --> 02:31:13.160
and Daniel did a Russell Peters and they're doing some other ones as well.

2652
02:31:13.850 --> 02:31:17.480
I'll do one.
I'll do one over there.
Amazon.
I'll do one with you like it.
Yeah,

2653
02:31:17.500 --> 02:31:20.040
I think it's cool.
Breaking the mold or the Netflix mold.

2654
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:23.730
<v 0>Everybody has Amazon prime,
dude.
Everybody does well now.</v>

2655
02:31:23.731 --> 02:31:25.440
They own the whole foods.
When you go to whole foods,

2656
02:31:25.441 --> 02:31:28.920
you get a good discount on shit.
That's why I was like,
she was like,

2657
02:31:28.921 --> 02:31:32.370
do you have your app?
You scan your fucking APP.
Nice Gay Shelf,

2658
02:31:32.371 --> 02:31:34.890
a little bit of Turkey legs.
What do you want?

2659
02:31:35.210 --> 02:31:38.760
Take a little for you saw the bags of spinach once you check out at $2 off the

2660
02:31:38.761 --> 02:31:43.710
Amazon person.
Nice.
Yeah.
Um,

2661
02:31:43.890 --> 02:31:45.060
Amazon.
Yeah.

2662
02:31:45.300 --> 02:31:49.470
Amazon and the Amazon of the fucking world man content they're doing.

2663
02:31:49.550 --> 02:31:54.120
You buy things like,
I'm gonna wear weird company.
You buy stuff with one click,

2664
02:31:54.240 --> 02:31:57.600
you can watch TV shows.
They're making TV shows.
He could go buy your groceries.

2665
02:31:57.900 --> 02:32:01.500
When did they going to open up their town and was on town?
Where is it?

2666
02:32:01.830 --> 02:32:05.630
Where's it go?
Uh,
Buffalo.
They need

2667
02:32:07.860 --> 02:32:11.610
people in Buffalo.
Like please,
would you go to Amazon town?
Would you live there?

2668
02:32:11.850 --> 02:32:15.360
No.
It'd be a mess.
Jamie,
would you live in a lot of brown boxes?

2669
02:32:15.390 --> 02:32:19.050
Everywhere you look brown boxes,
we recycle everything.
They changed every,

2670
02:32:19.060 --> 02:32:19.321
the way.

2671
02:32:19.321 --> 02:32:22.290
Like grocery stores have to work now because they have that two hour delivery.

2672
02:32:22.320 --> 02:32:25.320
Like you have to have delivery at grocery store.
It's fucking some Pete.
I know,

2673
02:32:25.350 --> 02:32:29.460
but they do that with whole foods too,
right?
Does this whole foods deliver?
Yes.

2674
02:32:29.461 --> 02:32:31.340
Yes.
We will.
Most grow most.

2675
02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:35.430
We will reach a point now when we don't go into grocery stores.
That's crazy.

2676
02:32:35.520 --> 02:32:38.550
They'll deliver.
Dude drives a kid.
No grocery stores delivered.

2677
02:32:38.820 --> 02:32:41.960
Do you remember your gross?
Never.
I've never heard of that delivered delivery.
No,

2678
02:32:41.961 --> 02:32:43.140
that didn't exist.
When did that start?

2679
02:32:43.170 --> 02:32:45.840
They do have the store to where you're walking in and just like,

2680
02:32:45.841 --> 02:32:46.740
it feels like you're stealing.

2681
02:32:46.741 --> 02:32:50.060
I haven't usually at this leave and they charge your account.
Oh my God.

2682
02:32:50.120 --> 02:32:51.900
Do you know New York?
They tested it out.

2683
02:32:51.901 --> 02:32:56.100
People just walk in and you have the APP in your phone so when you walk out it

2684
02:32:56.101 --> 02:33:00.090
registers what you have with you.
Whoa.
Fucking that's fucking insane.

2685
02:33:00.580 --> 02:33:02.340
Living in the future,
bro.
Doug,
you will net.

2686
02:33:02.400 --> 02:33:04.920
There'll be a point when we don't ever go to those things.

2687
02:33:05.040 --> 02:33:07.320
Someone just won't give.
You get an order every,

2688
02:33:07.350 --> 02:33:10.710
how long would it be before they can replicate food and all you have to do is

2689
02:33:10.840 --> 02:33:15.450
like put the bear ingredients and amino acids and shit and to some Vat and then

2690
02:33:15.451 --> 02:33:18.780
you print up anything you want.
Right up three D,
print a steak,

2691
02:33:18.900 --> 02:33:23.310
three d print an apple,
three d print a hungry for baked potato pizza.

2692
02:33:23.580 --> 02:33:28.080
Yeah,
for three d print it comes out.
Yeah,
but you know what,
what,

2693
02:33:28.980 --> 02:33:30.450
that's not going to taste good.
How do you know?

2694
02:33:30.451 --> 02:33:34.020
Because food has love in that shit.
People say that.
Oh,
you have these new cars.

2695
02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:38.100
Moons,
no sole.
Okay.
No,
but food is different.
Nutritions different.

2696
02:33:38.110 --> 02:33:41.160
You can never take,
you can't take,
you can't know.
It's says elements.

2697
02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:45.600
Just little things that they figured out how to fucking move around.
Wiggle.

2698
02:33:45.750 --> 02:33:47.610
I Dunno.
Something about there being so natural.

2699
02:33:47.820 --> 02:33:51.580
Perfect comes out with a nice like toast.
The crossed

2700
02:33:53.940 --> 02:33:56.280
your fucking computer.
Imagine

2701
02:33:58.370 --> 02:34:03.060
just the English muffin dude.
I don't think so.
There's no fucking way.

2702
02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:08.010
What did they nail it?
If they have like the perfect trochar call Saul a choice.

2703
02:34:08.150 --> 02:34:09.810
I think there's a touch to that,

2704
02:34:09.910 --> 02:34:12.440
but there is a shelter that Crawford but touch the human touch.
You needed that.

2705
02:34:12.450 --> 02:34:16.410
Like I don't feel like a robot might not be able to give a great massage.

2706
02:34:16.730 --> 02:34:18.130
Like you know they,
that the oils

2707
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:20.440
<v 3>in your hands are good when you eat with your hands just right.</v>

2708
02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:22.960
A lot of the world is still eats with their fucking hands,
right?

2709
02:34:22.961 --> 02:34:26.190
Utensils take away already people.
But people,

2710
02:34:26.630 --> 02:34:29.680
your your hands have natural enzymes that kill a lot of bacteria or as Bro,

2711
02:34:30.190 --> 02:34:31.840
while I'm not wiping my ass on my hands anymore.

2712
02:34:32.990 --> 02:34:36.430
That's why in some countries it's a real insult to try to shake someone's hand

2713
02:34:36.431 --> 02:34:39.430
with your left hand.
Right.
Cause your booty hits your booty.
Booty and player.

2714
02:34:39.730 --> 02:34:41.050
Yeah,
Bro.
Yeah,
but do you know what?

2715
02:34:41.051 --> 02:34:43.840
I still think there's something about the touch of food when you feel someone

2716
02:34:43.841 --> 02:34:45.580
touches food,
it does something to enzymes.
A food.

2717
02:34:45.790 --> 02:34:49.520
I don't know about that fucking bullshit.
You learn from your astrologer.

2718
02:34:49.790 --> 02:34:54.750
Same Brow.
You believe in the tides,
Joe.
I got to think that.

2719
02:34:54.850 --> 02:34:58.190
You know there's something about the love of food that fucking robot him.

2720
02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:00.630
You know that if he's got a good heart.
Yeah.

2721
02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:02.950
He understands enzyme to come from your fingers.

2722
02:35:03.100 --> 02:35:06.910
They told that produced in your gut enzymes are produced.
The digestive things.

2723
02:35:07.340 --> 02:35:10.930
It's in your hands.
You make sure you,
yeah,
you do.
And you figure tips.
Yes.

2724
02:35:10.990 --> 02:35:15.310
What kind of enzymes it change.
It makes it that your food is a which read this.

2725
02:35:15.670 --> 02:35:17.500
Look it up.
Look at us.
I real look it up and was like,

2726
02:35:17.501 --> 02:35:19.140
you're talking about like a cast iron skillet,
like

2727
02:35:23.210 --> 02:35:26.110
through enzymes come off your fingers for something in your hands that changes

2728
02:35:26.111 --> 02:35:30.100
the chemical composition to food that changes the flavor profiles in your mouth

2729
02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:32.670
and it makes it so you don't get sick.
Yeah,
that's amazing.

2730
02:35:32.671 --> 02:35:35.170
Dirty hands are nice until you don't get sick,
dirty hands.

2731
02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:39.990
People have this what you say before you eat ass.
We fuck in.
Lift up your booty.

2732
02:35:40.210 --> 02:35:43.510
When do you eat ass?
And then have not yet.
What do you think?

2733
02:35:43.540 --> 02:35:46.570
How do you think their dirty hands,
they died.
They died out.

2734
02:35:47.260 --> 02:35:51.410
There were 30 years old.
Give it to me for a mouth and get outta here.

2735
02:35:51.950 --> 02:35:54.160
Get on in here.
That's coming up.

2736
02:35:54.161 --> 02:35:58.130
I typed in oils and hands change what's coming up.
It's like Mike Tyson weed

2737
02:35:59.910 --> 02:36:03.550
to make up ridiculous facts.
You look at again,
Jamie,

2738
02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:08.440
give me Sean being bro,
don't just Google it.
I'll let you pick the search.

2739
02:36:08.441 --> 02:36:11.980
What would you like me to search?
Search this.
Search this.
Uh,
I got a peek.

2740
02:36:12.510 --> 02:36:14.950
All right.
Joe's gonna figure this out.
Yep.
Search,

2741
02:36:17.740 --> 02:36:19.480
search.
Search.
Uh,

2742
02:36:20.170 --> 02:36:23.440
cultures that eat with their hands don't get sick.
How about that?

2743
02:36:27.610 --> 02:36:32.560
It's just great
mind your manners.
Eat with your hands.

2744
02:36:32.980 --> 02:36:34.630
No.
Came from the same bowl as it's safe.

2745
02:36:36.100 --> 02:36:39.940
I feel like I didn't get a kit from around the world.
Look Dude,

2746
02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:41.260
there's gotta be,

2747
02:36:41.290 --> 02:36:45.250
there's some shit in people's hands that makes them not get sick when they eat.

2748
02:36:45.251 --> 02:36:49.240
What?
For years we ate without utensils.
Yeah,
but people got sick,

2749
02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:54.130
but not all the time.
Jamie got heat.
Helps that like cooking with heat.

2750
02:36:54.310 --> 02:36:57.760
Not everyone could cook with fire.
People ate a lot of raw chef for a long time.

2751
02:36:58.990 --> 02:37:02.650
You've got to find something on there and I'm looking.
You're killing me,
dude.

2752
02:37:02.651 --> 02:37:06.370
This is killing me.
I'm too high to look it up right now myself.

2753
02:37:06.371 --> 02:37:09.370
That's the bummer.
I don't even know how to do it,
man.

2754
02:37:11.970 --> 02:37:15.920
We're going to go to the bank.
Go to bank.
See what the fuck bing does.
Eating with

2755
02:37:16.030 --> 02:37:20.500
<v 0>and
sick.
Yeah.
There's gotta be something.</v>

2756
02:37:20.530 --> 02:37:24.800
Secrets of people who never get sick.
Let's see.
Let's just about sleeping,

2757
02:37:24.801 --> 02:37:27.170
sneezing,
vitamin C,
sleep it off.

2758
02:37:28.490 --> 02:37:32.990
Get a handle on stress.
Be a gym rat.
This is nothing.

2759
02:37:33.150 --> 02:37:34.820
You got nothing,
man.
Nothing coming up.

2760
02:37:36.060 --> 02:37:38.720
Got nothing son of a bitch.

2761
02:37:41.270 --> 02:37:43.850
Totally nothing here.
I don't know where you got in this room.
Hey,

2762
02:37:43.851 --> 02:37:46.190
just make it up for Joe.
Just lie when again,

2763
02:37:49.180 --> 02:37:53.240
when he comes back,
pull it and pull it.
We found so much stuff.

2764
02:37:53.241 --> 02:37:56.660
It's crazy to where have I heard this?
I've heard it somewhere.

2765
02:37:57.110 --> 02:38:00.590
Someone on the Internet is going to agree with me.
Some.
Some dude will find it.

2766
02:38:00.620 --> 02:38:03.500
The thing I had with bill Cosby or like he just filed today for an appeal

2767
02:38:03.530 --> 02:38:07.670
apparently.
Oh we did?
Yeah.
358 pages.

2768
02:38:07.700 --> 02:38:11.180
Hard fucking case to fight.
Huh?
How are we going to fight that dude?

2769
02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:13.490
Would you kill yourself?

2770
02:38:15.890 --> 02:38:20.390
I don't at him.
Tell him,
hey Jay,
Joe.

2771
02:38:20.810 --> 02:38:24.500
Jamie found a ton of fucking stuff.
Proven my shit.
Tons.

2772
02:38:24.680 --> 02:38:29.570
Fingertip QC 10 something like that.
Yeah.
No,

2773
02:38:29.660 --> 02:38:33.250
no,
absolutely not.
Couldn't find it
happens man.

2774
02:38:33.750 --> 02:38:37.150
Somebody told me have a dream and in that dream you're convincing.

2775
02:38:37.250 --> 02:38:39.920
I've heard it somewhere and then I thought,
wow,
that's amazing.

2776
02:38:40.330 --> 02:38:43.500
Cultures that eat with their hands.
There's enzymes in your hands.
They just,

2777
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:45.800
they just don't want to change the forks and they'd say,

2778
02:38:45.801 --> 02:38:50.030
make up some story about Hindu gods.
I was in Central America.

2779
02:38:50.210 --> 02:38:51.043
Yes.

2780
02:38:51.290 --> 02:38:55.760
They told me they were eating shit rocked with the flesh.

2781
02:38:56.200 --> 02:38:57.440
They would use if you were bill caught.

2782
02:38:57.441 --> 02:39:00.470
We were saying that if you were bill Cosby,
would you just kill yourself?
Yes,

2783
02:39:00.530 --> 02:39:02.570
you would write.
I would just end it.

2784
02:39:03.190 --> 02:39:06.380
I don't know what you can do when you're that far down the hole.

2785
02:39:06.730 --> 02:39:10.310
Since he didn't file an appeal,
are you my,
so it's like,
here's a perfect example.

2786
02:39:10.390 --> 02:39:11.690
When we were talking about earlier with Louie,

2787
02:39:12.050 --> 02:39:15.500
think about Louis and now thinking about,
thinking about bill Cosby.

2788
02:39:15.740 --> 02:39:17.870
Totally different.
Right?

2789
02:39:17.871 --> 02:39:21.470
But people don't want you to say that cause they're both air quotes abusers.

2790
02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:25.400
One of them is a monster.
One of them was a guy who did some stupid shit.

2791
02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:29.510
Kinky Shit.
We're Chad.
He was into it.
He asked people,
they said yes,

2792
02:39:29.511 --> 02:39:32.750
he shouldn't have done it.
He feels bad that he did it.
But you can't.

2793
02:39:32.751 --> 02:39:35.660
How do you forgive?
Bill Cosby like to take that,

2794
02:39:35.960 --> 02:39:40.340
the idea that you're supposed to forgive Louie,
which I think yes,

2795
02:39:40.430 --> 02:39:44.960
and then I don't see a path for bill Cosby to be forgiven.

2796
02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:49.400
They don't see that path when you've ruined the lives of how many people?

2797
02:39:49.670 --> 02:39:52.930
50 plus when something's that heinous.
I just don't think,

2798
02:39:52.931 --> 02:39:54.740
I think I made a point to have you ruined their life.

2799
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:58.400
You certainly certainly fuck them up.

2800
02:39:58.730 --> 02:40:00.410
Like if you wake up and you're with bill,

2801
02:40:00.690 --> 02:40:02.570
cause when you thought he was going to take care of you and your pants are down

2802
02:40:02.571 --> 02:40:05.090
by your ankles and you realize you're fucked you while your unconscious and he

2803
02:40:05.091 --> 02:40:07.960
drugged you,
that is going to fuck your head up.

2804
02:40:07.980 --> 02:40:12.200
Just going to change what you think about people that someone could just drug

2805
02:40:12.201 --> 02:40:14.340
you and treat you like meet your unconscious.

2806
02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:16.140
<v 2>They're doing things to you when you're out cold.
We're saying,</v>

2807
02:40:16.141 --> 02:40:21.000
what's our laws of forgiveness?
Well how do you forgive that?
First of all,

2808
02:40:21.001 --> 02:40:24.270
you can't because he'd Evers,
he doesn't admit it.
He never admits.

2809
02:40:24.271 --> 02:40:29.220
It never even gets to the door.
Right of like of acceptance,
of forgiveness,
of,

2810
02:40:29.221 --> 02:40:29.461
of,

2811
02:40:29.461 --> 02:40:33.210
of doing his penance or if there is a penance of as anything you'd ever do ever.

2812
02:40:33.450 --> 02:40:34.440
He doesn't even get to the door.

2813
02:40:34.610 --> 02:40:37.050
Did she never gets it then would there be room for forgiveness?

2814
02:40:37.230 --> 02:40:40.410
It's a good question.
I think it would probably open up the door to more,

2815
02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:44.730
more lawsuits.
Sure.
I think he would,
they would come storming in like hail,

2816
02:40:45.390 --> 02:40:49.380
you know?
Right.
Yeah.
But I think I know what you're saying is very smart.

2817
02:40:49.500 --> 02:40:54.030
It's saying like we're saying we were supposed to give someone like for someone

2818
02:40:54.031 --> 02:40:57.330
like Louie,
well what is the line of when you don't forgive,
right.

2819
02:40:57.360 --> 02:41:00.000
What's the line?
What is the how?
What's the number of what the line,

2820
02:41:00.001 --> 02:41:02.010
what's the atrocity like what is it that we go,

2821
02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:06.570
you can't forgive this person anymore.
What's the,
what's the line of compassion?

2822
02:41:06.571 --> 02:41:09.750
Like where do you,
where do you take line of compassion?
That's a good word.

2823
02:41:09.751 --> 02:41:10.290
That's what it is.

2824
02:41:10.290 --> 02:41:14.580
What is that ultimate where you go now you can no longer from this moment

2825
02:41:14.581 --> 02:41:14.941
forward,

2826
02:41:14.941 --> 02:41:18.330
forgive this human being and the problem is now here's where it gets slippery.

2827
02:41:18.331 --> 02:41:22.770
If you decide you're going to be the guy who says,
I'm going to kill this guy,

2828
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:26.610
someone that actually cures him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you decide,

2829
02:41:26.611 --> 02:41:29.040
if you live in a company,
look with this,
what we're essentially doing,

2830
02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:31.710
we're just doing it slow at putting them in a cage.
Right?
Right.

2831
02:41:32.040 --> 02:41:34.170
But if you were going to really decide,
hey,
we're going to,

2832
02:41:34.470 --> 02:41:36.150
we're going to remove this guy from the population.

2833
02:41:36.180 --> 02:41:39.030
I can't trust him with my kids.
We live in a primitive society.
Okay.

2834
02:41:39.270 --> 02:41:42.540
We live in some some village type society thousands of years ago.
Right.

2835
02:41:43.020 --> 02:41:45.780
That's what we all did.
What would we do when someone was like that?

2836
02:41:46.240 --> 02:41:48.600
While we'd probably try to figure out a way to get rid of them.
Yeah,

2837
02:41:48.601 --> 02:41:50.450
you kill him.
You don't have to kill him.
Yeah,
you'd have to,

2838
02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:55.600
but you'd have to figure out what are the laws that allow someone to kill

2839
02:41:55.651 --> 02:41:55.981
somebody.

2840
02:41:55.981 --> 02:41:59.310
Because you can't just let people kill people because he let people kill people.

2841
02:41:59.311 --> 02:42:01.590
Then you just come up with excuses to kill people.
Right?

2842
02:42:01.740 --> 02:42:04.620
And this is what people have done throughout history,
whether it's the mon goals,

2843
02:42:04.621 --> 02:42:07.200
the Romans,
I mean,
just go throughout history.

2844
02:42:07.260 --> 02:42:11.280
People have people fucking killed people because they could kill people.

2845
02:42:11.820 --> 02:42:13.990
So when do you,
what,

2846
02:42:14.190 --> 02:42:19.190
what is the moral distinction that you have to make where someone is,

2847
02:42:21.050 --> 02:42:25.350
they have done irreparable harm,
but that changes over time,
right?
Right.

2848
02:42:25.351 --> 02:42:26.920
That and that continually changes.
That's,

2849
02:42:27.060 --> 02:42:29.460
that's my point is like that will never stop changing from,
from,

2850
02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:31.410
from decade to decade,
from era to era.

2851
02:42:31.620 --> 02:42:35.650
What we find deplorable now will not be deplorable later.
And that see,

2852
02:42:35.910 --> 02:42:39.870
with so many aspects of our culture,
yes.
Literature,
movies,

2853
02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:44.130
the way we restrict what so,
so what we're saying is,

2854
02:42:44.490 --> 02:42:48.660
is there ever align,
is there ever a lun?
Does it ever exist?

2855
02:42:48.661 --> 02:42:52.110
Does that idea of like this is the cutoff,
does that really exist?

2856
02:42:52.111 --> 02:42:56.380
Because it's constantly moving.
It's constantly changing.
You know,
I,

2857
02:42:56.390 --> 02:43:01.080
I've said it a million times.
I've never said what Louie did was okay.

2858
02:43:01.081 --> 02:43:04.740
I think he has his,
his issues.
I don't think anybody has,

2859
02:43:04.770 --> 02:43:09.770
but I also think everybody needs to investigate what happened and find out

2860
02:43:11.770 --> 02:43:14.590
what's going to talk about what,
yes,
I'm sure.
Let him talk about it.

2861
02:43:14.860 --> 02:43:17.540
Find out what the social psychology of what he was going through.
Yeah.

2862
02:43:17.860 --> 02:43:19.030
But disturbed.

2863
02:43:19.150 --> 02:43:24.070
But what I think is happening too is that a lot of women feel like when these

2864
02:43:24.071 --> 02:43:26.530
guys that are abusers get taken out,

2865
02:43:27.130 --> 02:43:32.130
that it made it so that it was better for women and so that if they come back

2866
02:43:33.730 --> 02:43:36.640
things to go back the way they were,
this is a real,
that's a real thought,

2867
02:43:36.670 --> 02:43:38.770
you know?
Yes.
But we must have conversation.
Yeah.

2868
02:43:38.840 --> 02:43:40.330
We don't have conversation then we're fucked.

2869
02:43:40.660 --> 02:43:45.660
I mean that's a real thought with imagine being a guy like Harvey Weinstein who

2870
02:43:46.150 --> 02:43:50.560
was doing this for so long,
get away with all this fucked up shit for so long.

2871
02:43:51.370 --> 02:43:53.650
Supported,
supported by them,
support it,
support.
I mean,

2872
02:43:53.651 --> 02:43:58.330
he had a clause in his contract detailing what would happen for the first case

2873
02:43:58.331 --> 02:44:00.730
of a sexual harassment.

2874
02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:05.240
Second case support days in the contract.
So why don't,
why are there,
fuck,

2875
02:44:05.260 --> 02:44:09.610
why are they,
why,
why,
why aren't the people that support him up?
Hey cito um,

2876
02:44:10.120 --> 02:44:14.520
I'd love you to join my podcast network.
I'm thinking about promoting you then.

2877
02:44:15.130 --> 02:44:18.220
I just think you're a great guy.
You're a funny guy.
You're a talented guy up dot.

2878
02:44:18.490 --> 02:44:22.040
Thank you.
Might be a raper.
So what I want to put is the first rape.
Uh,

2879
02:44:22.041 --> 02:44:25.990
I'm going to charge you this much second.
What the fuck a fuck.

2880
02:44:25.991 --> 02:44:27.940
Imagine the first sexual harassment is,

2881
02:44:28.030 --> 02:44:32.320
I've got a figure and then the second one lawsuit has a another figure us a

2882
02:44:32.321 --> 02:44:34.570
double the finger.
They're like three strikes you're out,

2883
02:44:34.630 --> 02:44:38.620
but it's not something he can afford.
It's like two 5,500 grand.

2884
02:44:38.770 --> 02:44:42.160
He's like a billionaire.
He's Harvey wines.
He goes fine.

2885
02:44:42.190 --> 02:44:45.070
He made pope fixed and he's like,
Hey,
I'll clear it up,
tear it up.

2886
02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:50.150
He's eating food while their talk and it's fucking crumbs all down his face off.

2887
02:44:50.470 --> 02:44:54.430
He's jerking off while they're talking to glutton,
the glutton,

2888
02:44:54.570 --> 02:44:59.410
a filthy fat fucking glutton.
You can't make a better case for a glutton.

2889
02:44:59.530 --> 02:45:02.080
And that guy,
he's a metaphor for the business by the way.

2890
02:45:02.260 --> 02:45:07.030
All consuming taking right.
And this looks totally,
yeah,
he,

2891
02:45:07.150 --> 02:45:10.780
he would,
he would ruin what's beautiful.
Right.
Take what's beautiful.

2892
02:45:11.110 --> 02:45:15.640
Pretty same mouth.
This fat gut rested on their forehead.

2893
02:45:15.670 --> 02:45:19.780
He fucked.
He ruined pretty things.
Yeah,
he's far pretty things.
Horrible.

2894
02:45:20.230 --> 02:45:23.980
Fuck that guy.
But it's interesting because that is a villain in a movie.

2895
02:45:24.310 --> 02:45:27.670
He's like a,
he's a villain in a movie.
Yes.
He's like a,

2896
02:45:27.730 --> 02:45:32.260
like a bad Dick Tracy character.
You're not,
not more modern.
He's a villain.

2897
02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:37.450
He's a villain more in a fucking Harvey Weinstein movies.
What he is,

2898
02:45:37.730 --> 02:45:39.940
Oh yeah,
someone will make that film.
He's a villain and no,

2899
02:45:39.941 --> 02:45:42.790
but he's a villain in a Quentin Tarantino movie.
Right.

2900
02:45:43.150 --> 02:45:46.560
If there was a guy who was doing dark shit and then one of the girls winds up

2901
02:45:46.810 --> 02:45:49.810
leading like a,
some kick ass female character,

2902
02:45:50.020 --> 02:45:53.380
one's up shooting them and killing them.
Like I said,
Hannah,

2903
02:45:53.470 --> 02:45:57.380
what the fuck's her name?
Oh,
um,
the woman who's in kill Bill.
Um,

2904
02:45:57.910 --> 02:46:02.530
not Uma Thurman,
but the Daryl,
Daryl Hannah,
like Daryl Hannah,
Daryl.

2905
02:46:02.531 --> 02:46:06.870
Hannah winds up killing him tight,
like hit him.
Kills Him with a brick.
Oh.

2906
02:46:06.890 --> 02:46:09.980
Plus his fucking head open like Patricia Arquette

2907
02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:14.960
<v 0>when she killed Tony Soprano.
Yes.
Member.
Yes.
Right.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

2908
02:46:15.180 --> 02:46:19.340
She was doe.
Fuck.
Yeah.
Shit.
That was perfect.
He was the perfect character.

2909
02:46:19.700 --> 02:46:23.330
That Tony Soprano character that she killed when James Gandolfini in true

2910
02:46:23.331 --> 02:46:27.100
romance.
When was it Patricia Arquette sounds like.
Yeah,

2911
02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:30.440
that's our cat was just to our cats.
Well,
no.

2912
02:46:30.441 --> 02:46:33.920
What's the other art cat is to our cats.
I said,
no,
no,
no,
for sure.
I,
again,

2913
02:46:33.980 --> 02:46:36.560
it was Patricia,
Patricia,
but there's none of that as a girl.

2914
02:46:36.561 --> 02:46:40.530
There's another girl there.
Yeah.
Am I tripping?
No,
no,
no.
There is,
I'm sorry.

2915
02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:44.420
Don't you shake your head,
bitch.
She's dead.
Oh,
Shit.

2916
02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:48.830
Which one,
Bro?
You better not be wrongs.
That's even worse.

2917
02:46:50.750 --> 02:46:55.700
It's bad if you're missing.
She's not dead.
Jamie,

2918
02:46:56.360 --> 02:47:00.860
Jamie,
Jamie,
Rosanna.
Arquette.
Yes.
Oh,
Shit.
She's been in a gang of movies too.

2919
02:47:00.861 --> 02:47:05.700
She was in pulp fiction.
Yes.
Rosanna Arquette was in pulp fiction.
She was,
uh,

2920
02:47:06.290 --> 02:47:08.540
wasn't she one of the chick she was a part of,

2921
02:47:08.541 --> 02:47:12.760
like when a girl over any Marino had to overdose,
overdose,

2922
02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:16.700
a helper.
That was her.
They had to help her.
Yeah.
That was her,

2923
02:47:16.701 --> 02:47:19.370
that she was helping him with Herman.
She was to go the head shit,

2924
02:47:19.371 --> 02:47:22.310
all of her face,
as he said did.
She goes,

I should all over.
He goes,

2925
02:47:22.311 --> 02:47:24.740
who's the girl with the all over her face?
And he goes,
that's my wife.

2926
02:47:24.770 --> 02:47:28.520
And he's like,
Oh shit.
Will they like piercings or something?
Yeah,

2927
02:47:28.610 --> 02:47:31.790
she had piercings,
right?
Wasn't that it right?
He goes,
he goes,

He goes,

2928
02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:35.480
how's the chick?
Was Shit all over her face.
And he goes,

2929
02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:38.580

Anyway,

2930
02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:42.650
easily one of the best films ever.
Amazing.
Always amazing movie.

2931
02:47:42.650 --> 02:47:46.070
But Patricia Arquette and true romance,
right when she killed James Gandolfini,

2932
02:47:46.790 --> 02:47:48.140
that's she's killing the glutton.

2933
02:47:48.770 --> 02:47:52.790
Killing the big disgusting you asshole man.

2934
02:47:53.500 --> 02:47:54.510
Big asshole.

2935
02:47:54.530 --> 02:47:58.130
Shitty man doesn't give a fuck about women and he's going to kill her.

2936
02:47:58.220 --> 02:48:02.300
She fucking,

Got Blood coming down her face.
It's crazy.
Shit is dope.

2938
02:48:05.390 --> 02:48:09.710
That's a great fucking seen.
Crazy.
That is that scene.
By the way,

2939
02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:10.760
that publication scene,

2940
02:48:11.330 --> 02:48:15.320
the revive the heart revival scene's just awesome nuts.
Awesome.

2941
02:48:15.321 --> 02:48:17.210
So many scenes in that movie.
Like what?

2942
02:48:17.900 --> 02:48:20.090
I remember I saw that movie when I first moved to Hollywood.

2943
02:48:20.091 --> 02:48:23.930
It was like 1994 I think.
I first moved here and I was watching that movie.

2944
02:48:23.931 --> 02:48:25.400
I was like,
is this what it's like out here?

2945
02:48:27.320 --> 02:48:29.570
They're saying as new movie is awesome.
He said it's,

2946
02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:32.750
he said it's his best movies made since then and I've heard the reviews are

2947
02:48:32.751 --> 02:48:35.540
awesome and they're telling the audiences to not spoil it for the rest of the

2948
02:48:35.541 --> 02:48:38.240
people that are going to see is that once upon a time in Hollywood comes out in

2949
02:48:38.280 --> 02:48:42.150
like a month thread.
Pitt,
who else?
Uh,
Brad Pitt,

2950
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:46.820
Leo Dicaprio and Margot Robbie.
Yup.
They redid a bunch of Hollywood.

2951
02:48:46.980 --> 02:48:50.360
May Look at the 70s that you can still see some of it on sunset if you haven't

2952
02:48:50.361 --> 02:48:53.180
realized why some of it's been repainted and weird way as it was because of

2953
02:48:53.181 --> 02:48:56.600
those scenes they were shooting.
So I picked,
I was going,
you know Ben Harper,

2954
02:48:56.630 --> 02:49:01.120
the musician?
Yes.
Um,
couldn't name a song,
but I know who he is.
Yeah.

2955
02:49:01.610 --> 02:49:05.060
He's a dope dude.
Hit Him and I were going to dinner at Muse,
Musso and Frank's,

2956
02:49:05.420 --> 02:49:08.130
and he likes that place.
I said,
that's what it is.
Amazing.
He goes,

2957
02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:11.610
meet me a moose on,
frankly,
I love Busan Franks.
And I show up there.
I'm like,

2958
02:49:11.611 --> 02:49:14.790
dude,
what the fuck is going on?
Sure enough,
they're shooting.

2959
02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.370
Half the movie takes place in there.
Right there,
right there,

2960
02:49:17.460 --> 02:49:18.870
because it still looks like that.

2961
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:21.080
So there was like the best place for them to do it.
It's like,
that's really,

2962
02:49:21.220 --> 02:49:21.631
go hang out,

2963
02:49:21.631 --> 02:49:25.290
eat dinner while they're filming a movie right after they were until say just

2964

He's like,

But you know self saying,

02:49:52.100 --> 02:49:55.350
Dog School feels it feel,

2973
02:49:55.560 --> 02:49:58.220
you know what if fucking feels like he's been there a hundred years or for her

2974
02:49:58.230 --> 02:50:00.960
birthday.
Yeah,
I love Musso Frank's place.
They should go.

2975
02:50:01.230 --> 02:50:04.380
That should be a place where you should go to Frank's and we could do that

2976
02:50:04.381 --> 02:50:07.380
before a show.
You know,
I would love that.
I have dinner gentlemen,

2977
02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:10.290
like adults have a scratch with a big piece.

2978
02:50:10.291 --> 02:50:13.260
I'm a scotch with some ice and some sticks out in my decade.

2979
02:50:13.290 --> 02:50:15.690
We go give me a check given the Cha for like,

2980
02:50:15.691 --> 02:50:20.490
Mick Jagger likes to go there all the time too.
With Jagger.
I hope we do.

2981
02:50:20.520 --> 02:50:21.630
Really does he like to go there?

2982
02:50:21.690 --> 02:50:24.650
They went there before they had their concert on Hollywood boulevard,
like

2983
02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:31.080
buck.
That motherfucker can still dance.
Oh,
he had a heart attack,

2984
02:50:31.230 --> 02:50:34.860
had open heart surgery or whatever you have kit and he was on stage like a month

2985
02:50:34.860 --> 02:50:38.580
later struck this shit.
Just do it.

2986
02:50:38.610 --> 02:50:43.560
That just means the universe makes,
wants him to live.
He's a beast.
He's a beast.

2987
02:50:43.770 --> 02:50:46.950
He lived,
he works out every day.
Multiple Times.
Does he?

2988
02:50:49.980 --> 02:50:53.700
Yeah.
He uh,
does dancing and yoga and lifts,
weights,
all kinds of shit.

2989
02:50:54.320 --> 02:50:56.580
There was a period where he never,
he never worked at once.

2990
02:50:56.640 --> 02:51:00.810
There was a period when it was on the road and there's no way on imagine back on

2991
02:51:01.110 --> 02:51:04.590
stage after 11 weeks after having surgery.
Heart Surgery.
Fucking unreal.

2992
02:51:04.650 --> 02:51:08.730
Sounds like me,
bro.
75 years sounds like me,
bro.
I know,
bro.

2993
02:51:08.790 --> 02:51:12.900
If I'm getting heart surgery,
I'm done.
That's it.
Challenging.
Yeah.
I'm walking,

2994
02:51:12.901 --> 02:51:16.380
I'm walking our snuck off someone's Dick Enough,

2995
02:51:16.890 --> 02:51:20.370
take a bunch of water from target or whatever the fuck.
Where was the water from?

2996
02:51:20.380 --> 02:51:23.610
Water Bitch.
He works out three hours a day.

2997
02:51:24.600 --> 02:51:25.560
Three hours.

2998
02:51:26.320 --> 02:51:29.490
It's what their guitars to the doctor said they've never operated on an athlete

2999
02:51:29.491 --> 02:51:32.400
at 75 before.
So they had a really good laugh about that.
And I said,

3000
02:51:32.401 --> 02:51:35.670
he's still fit.
He works out three hours a day.
How many,
how old is he now?

3001
02:51:36.840 --> 02:51:40.950
75 if you keep going,
you didn't pause,
but if you slow down and stop,

3002
02:51:41.070 --> 02:51:44.700
your shit will break.
Joe Rogan.
That's the message of the dailies.

3003
02:51:44.760 --> 02:51:47.700
Great fucking quote.
We're going to wrap this up.
People on the road.

3004
02:51:48.180 --> 02:51:50.700
Cheeto Santina will be meet with me this weekend.

3005

3007
