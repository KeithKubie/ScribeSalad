OF THEIR BEST
AND BRIGHTEST ENGINEERS

"TITAN HAS THESE WONDERFUL
GROUPS OF SEAS.

AND SAMPLE IT AND LEARN
WHAT THAT'S MADE OF,

THEY'VE DISCOVERED
THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:51.577
OF TITAN'S METHANE SEAS IS
THAT THEY'RE RICH IN NITROGEN,

00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:56.483
AND THAT COULD MAKE IT
VERY DIFFICULT TO MANEUVER.

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:59.152

NITROGEN DISSOLVED IN THE SEA

THAT, WHEN THE PROPELLERS
TURN IN OUR JETS,

00:02:01.553 --> 00:02:02.888
IT MIGHT JUST MAKE
A LOT OF BUBBLES

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:04.858
AND NOT BE ABLE TO PUSH
AGAINST THE LIQUID.
