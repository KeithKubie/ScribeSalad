00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.890
&gt;&gt; I'm responding to Mark Cramer's video.
I was taken by the interest in individual

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.249
action and I'm a
participant -- and my name is Alfred Berkeley

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:15.980
 -- I'm a participant in
the Davos Conference and I find it interesting

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.370
to see that individuals
can actually accomplish quite a bit; empowered

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.270
by a strong idea that
resonates with other people individuals can

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.210
amplify the power of that
idea as they travel around and meet other

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.280
people.
Other people don't have to be powerful people.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.930
They don't have to be well-known people.
They just have to be people with an interest

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.660
in the success of that
idea.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.530
So I was enthusiastic about your video and
I responded hoping this

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.670
will add to the conversation.
Thank you.
