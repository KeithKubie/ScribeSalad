00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.070
Hi.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.300
My name is Jiang Wu.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.390
I'm a professor at
the East Asian Studies

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.160
at the University of Arizona.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.350
Today, we're very happy
to have Mr. Bill Porter.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.479
And Mr. Bill Porter
is the author

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.920
of several bestsellers of
Chinese culture and religion.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.120
And he also is a translator
of many Chinese poems

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.360
and Buddhist scriptures.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.200
And in 2008, he
published Zen Baggage.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.740
It was the instant
success in both China

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.550
and the English-speaking world.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.240
And today, we're going
to focus on this book,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.880
and discuss the meaning
of Zen Buddhism,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.530
and also Chinese religion,
in the past 30 years.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.780
And now, Bill, I just want
to start with your book.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.280
OK.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.190
And this book is
a great success.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.890
And as the author, can
you describe, for us,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.860
what kind of book it is,
and what kind of a message

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.070
you want to convey
to your readers?

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.130
Well, it's more of
a personal account.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.510
My books tend to be
ways of teaching myself.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.080
I write a book to learn.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.590
And so, I wanted to deepen my
understanding of Zen, or Chan,

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.370
as it's called, now, in China.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.470
And so, I'm not a writer.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.800
But I learned to write for radio
stations in Taiwan and Hong

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.470
Kong, as a travel writer.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.140
That is, I would take
a trip, and come back

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.740
to Hong Kong or Taiwan, and
do travel-related programs.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.140
And so, I learned
to write like that.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.330
And so, when I thought about
doing a book about Zen,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.030
I thought I would do
it as a travel book,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.710
and to travel through
Chinese geography,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.170
and also through time, to
China's history of Zen.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.310
And I would begin with the
beginning of Zen in China,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.110
and end with the
sixth patriarch.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.860
The first six patriarchs of
Zen were the most important

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.790
in the development.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.610
And so I visited
the sites associated

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.980
with each of these six teachers,
and wrote about my own trip

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.090
in visiting these places, my own
impressions, my own feelings.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.300
And then, I would
interview Zen masters,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.910
in each of these places,
about their lives,

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.745
and about their practice.

00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:46.120
And so, it was
that kind of book.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.810
It was sort of like a
personal travel narrative,

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.960
along with brief outlines of the
history of Zen in each place.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.940
And also, it begins
with a reflection

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.110
on the nature of
Zen, and on language,

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.910
especially because Zen is
sort of unique among religions

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.480
in the world in disdaining
language-- or at least

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.760
recognizing that
language is more

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.960
of a problem than a solution.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.390
And so, that's what I did.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.550
So first of all, you
advise we read your book

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.279
as a personal account of
your travel experience.

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:24.820
That's right.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.220
Yeah.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.400
And again, it's a travel that's
not just through geography,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.970
but also through Zen.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:33.820
OK.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.270
So why travel is so
important for you

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.990
to understand Zen Buddhism?

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.980
I don't think travel is.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.860
I think I could just as
easily understand Zen

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.840
without traveling.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.670
But this was also a book that
I envisioned as introducing

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.640
Westerners to Zen.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.900
And so, I was trying to, as you
might say, learn more about it

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.790
myself, but also record
it in a way that would

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.410
be instructive to Westerners.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.500
So I could begin at
the beginning of Zen,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.800
with Bodhidharma,
and take readers

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.680
through the history
of Zen, and also,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.450
at the same time taking them
through the geography of China,

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.900
and why things developed
in certain places the way

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.700
they did.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.910
So the geography is very
important in your understanding

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.280
of a Chinese Buddhism,
and Zen Buddhism.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.150
Well, especially in Zen.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.710
Of course, geography plays a
crucial role in the development

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.270
of any civilization.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.130
And Chinese
civilization developed

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.960
along the Yellow River.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.840
And once there was
a civilization,

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.650
a wealthy civilization, they
developed trade connections

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.740
with the Mediterranean
via the Silk Road.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.280
And the Silk Road ended
along the Yellow River.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.860
And, so when Buddhism
first arrived,

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.320
it arrived in the Yellow River
capitals, Luoyang, and nearby,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.600
in Chang'an.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.330
But there was no Zen
Buddhism at that time.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.280
Zen didn't show up
until around 500 AD.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.130
But when it did,
the first teacher

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.200
went up to the Yellow
River, but was not

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.600
very successful-- Bodhidharma.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.410
And his own disciple, the
second patriarch, Huike,

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.220
was not that successful either.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.300
But there was a religious purge
in China, at a certain time,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.660
and the second patriarch had
to leave the Yellow River,

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.760
and go down to the Yangtze.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.910
And then, he taught somebody.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.240
And then, he went back up to
the north, and was assassinated.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.220
But that person he taught--
the third patriarch--

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.220
had two disciples.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.650
And one of them became
the fourth patriarch.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.470
And up to this time, Zen
had been a very limited

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.510
religious tradition.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.940
The teachers each had only
a handful of disciples.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:15.250
But with the fourth patriarch,
he had 500 disciples.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.760
And his major
disciple had 1,000.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.340
And his major disciple
had 3000, and so forth.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.830
And so, zen makes this explosion
in the sixth and seventh

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.920
century, with the
development of the idea

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:38.520
of practicing a spiritual
tradition in a commune.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.550
There had never been this sort
of communal practice in China

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.840
before.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.810
There were a few attempts
by some early Taoists,

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.690
but they didn't last long.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.840
But when you see Zen
develop, it develops

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.610
along the Yangtze in
an ecological niche

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.717
that I would call the
high mountain basin.

00:06:58.717 --> 00:07:00.300
Maybe, sometimes,
it wasn't that high.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.050
But it was a mountain basin.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.560
That is, instead of
building your monastery,

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.870
and having your disciples
live on a mountain

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:12.240
side, or a mountain top, or
at the foot of the mountain,

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.820
or even in an urban
setting, instead of that,

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.150
you locate your religious center
in a mountain basin, where

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.710
you have hundreds of acres
of flat, arable, well-watered

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.050
farmland.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.110
And thus, you develop a
community of practitioners

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.870
who live and practice together.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.940
So up until the
fourth patriarch,

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.950
Zen was simply the practice you
do on the meditation cushion.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:42.120
And Zen, of course, the original
meaning of the word "zen,"

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.780
was "zenna."

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.050
So it's from the
Sanskrit, "dhyana."

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.070
And when it came to China,
people would say "zenna."

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.800
And then, later, they got rid
of the "na," and became "zen."

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.400
But the original approach
to this tradition was just,

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.140
Zen is simply sitting
in meditation.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.440
But suddenly, you get
this community develop.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.480
And then, Zen becomes your way
of life-- washing the dishes,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.410
working in the fields,
walking around,

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.350
taking a hike in the
mountains, watching the moon.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.950
Your whole way of
life becomes Zen.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:22.200
And this is what gave Chinese
Zen its distinctive flavor.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.140
Because we don't even
know about Zen in India.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.750
It was such a small sect,
we don't know, even,

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.490
if it existed.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.100
Some scholars think it
never existed in India.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.049
But it's very hard
to prove something

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:37.289
exists when there's only a
couple of people doing it.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:40.020
And probably,
Bodhidharma, Zen probably

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.850
would not have been
noticed in China

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:46.080
if it was just Bodhidharma, and
Huike, the second patriarch.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.330
But once you get
these big communities,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.020
of 500, 1,000 people,
you get a major impact

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.420
on Chinese culture.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:53.920
Exactly.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.660
Yeah.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.870
And I think this is what I
wanted to show in this book

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.680
that I was writing, of how Zen
developed, coming from people

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.980
who were great in their
meditation practice,

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.950
but had very little impact
outside of that practice.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.900
Of course, once the
fourth patriarch developed

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.100
this community, their
disciples wanted

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.590
to respect their teachers,
and their teacher's

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.150
teacher, the teacher's teacher.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.340
And so, these early
figures in Zen

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.670
become more famous-- like
Bodhidharma, and Huike.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.620
But when they were
alive, they were not

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.340
famous at all-- barely noticed.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.200
So we can see, actually,
you're y Chan Buddhism

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.510
monks take advantage of
geography, and transportation.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.240
So when they choose
a good location,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.790
actually, their sect or religion
can develop much faster.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.390
Now, that's true.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:56.580
And by locating in these
mountain basins, when

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.370
there are wars, everything
is swept, on the plains,

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.540
by armies.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.910
But up in the mountains,
they're left alone.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.490
So if there are local
bandits, or wars going on,

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.160
these zen centers
were not affected.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.690
In fact, they were,
themselves, small armies.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:12.240
Right.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.630
Because you have 500, 1,000
people living together,

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.024
they could defend themselves.

00:10:17.024 --> 00:10:18.780
Yeah.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:23.300
So you have a very deep
understanding of Zen Buddhism.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.620
And before and after
the travel, did

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.240
you find your understanding
of Zen changed?

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.590
Or do you have a
very short definition

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.450
about what is Zen Buddhism?

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:38.400
Again, students can memorize,
to take exam, to write it down.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.050
I know it's hard,
but try your best.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:47.670
Well, again, Zen is
a spiritual tradition

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.790
that encourages
its practitioners

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.310
to free themselves of concepts.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.950
And because you're
becoming free of concepts,

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.220
you're also becoming
free of language.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.880
And so, for me to use
language to define--

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.220
That's why I say it's hard.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.900
It's like a fly trying
to get off fly paper.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.370
I'm just going to get stuck.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.610
And so, sometimes,
people would define Zen

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:17.220
as pointing to the moon.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.730
And the teacher's
teaching of Zen

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.190
would be the finger
pointing to the moon.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:27.720
But Zen is the moon, and not
the finger pointing to the moon.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.350
And so, Zen is a tradition that
developed all kinds of ways

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.726
to try to get people
to look at the moon.

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:35.350
And, of course, the
moon is their mind.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.870
The moon is simply your mind.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.850
But how does a teacher get
you to look at your mind?

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.960
Because we don't necessarily
think that our mind

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.830
is important at all.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.340
We just go about our life.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.030
We want to feed our
belly, and do some work,

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.590
and make some money,
live in a house

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.560
so we don't get rained on.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.840
We don't think about our mind.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.770
But in Buddhism,
everything is mind.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.310
You can't get away
from your mind.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:05.360
But to realize this
in your daily life,

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.270
from the time when you
get up in the morning,

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:10.810
to the time you go to
bed, takes some practice.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:15.370
And so, Zen developed
ways of practicing.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.660
Of course, meditation
is an important one.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.780
But also living together
with other people who

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.230
are practicing,
reading a few books.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.080
A few books can be helpful
in pointing the direction.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.600
But again, these are all
just fingers-- fingers

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.740
pointing to the moon.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.510
And eventually, when the
teacher thinks you're ready,

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:36.490
the teacher tries to instruct
you to go further-- that is,

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.130
to go directly to your own mind.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:43.270
And so, probably the most
famous kind of instruction

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.520
is have a cup of tea.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.760
Right.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.340
Instead of saying Zen is
this, and this, and this,

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.320
Zen is, have a cup of tea.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.440
And then, the teacher
tells you, taste the tea.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.050
So Zen is tasting the tea.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.540
It's something
only you can know.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.600
And so, this is what
I could tell students.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.100
Zen is an attempt to
get people to experience

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.350
their own awareness.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.640
So it's an ongoing process.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.140
It is.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:11.660
Yeah.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.996
And every teacher is going
to approach it differently.

00:13:13.996 --> 00:13:14.495
Exactly.

00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:15.160
Yeah.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.730
So in the '70s, when you
first study, or learn,

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.530
Zen Buddhism, Chinese
Buddhism, you studied with monk

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.650
from Wutai Shan, you mention
in your book, called Shou Ye.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:28.480
Is this the kind of Zen
practice he told you?

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:34.460
He was a Hawaiian monk,
but he was from Wutai Shan.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:38.180
And I met him in New
York City, in Chinatown.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.990
I was studying anthropology
at Columbia, then.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:45.350
And I met him, and
every weekend he

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.790
had a meditation retreat
in the countryside.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.420
And so, I started joining
him on the weekends.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.970
And I really was
impressed with that.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.810
And I found meditation much
more interesting than working

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.230
on a PhD in anthropology.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.810
Indeed.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.940
And so, I gave that
up and went to live

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.620
in a monastery in Taiwan.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:10.980
But Shou Ye was the first
practicing Buddhist I ever met.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.730
And I was very impressed
with him-- the way he taught,

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.770
his demeanor.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:19.340
He was not austere.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.900
He was very happy-- a happy man.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.340
He liked to laugh.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:27.000
And so, I said, that's the
kind of teacher I can admire.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.220
Sure.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.416
So we can imagine
how powerful he was.

00:14:31.416 --> 00:14:31.915
He was.

00:14:31.915 --> 00:14:33.140
He persuaded you.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.370
Yeah.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.200
He did.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.170
And also in your
book, you mention

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.300
you interviewed so many Zen
teachers and practitioners

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.140
in China.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.350
So did you find that, actually,
they practice Zen Buddhism

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.120
sincerely, generously?

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.190
Are there any teachers
who, according

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.980
to your understanding,
actually is a real Zen master?

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:53.870
Oh, yeah.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.040
Of course.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:01.130
Probably the greatest Zen
master of the last 100 years

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.440
was Hsu Yun-- Empty Cloud.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.340
Empty Cloud, yes.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.090
And he had a number of
disciples who also became

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.520
really great Zen masters.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.730
Master Jing Hui, who died
a couple of years ago.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:20.100
And master Fo Yuan, who died
about five or six years ago.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.990
I'd say those were probably
the two most important, or most

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.330
powerful Zen teachers I met.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:32.690
And also, in Hong Kong,
[INAUDIBLE], Master

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:33.830
[INAUDIBLE].

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.380
All three of those,
they were all disciples,

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:41.030
and they were all personal
attendants, of Empty Cloud.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.800
When they were young
monks, they all

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.090
served as the
attendant of Hsu Yun.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:47.540
And so, learned from Hsu Yun.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:52.430
So Hsu Yun's influence is
really strong in China,

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.350
and in the world of Zen.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:58.310
He taught a lot of people.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.280
And a lot of his disciples
became great teachers.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.710
And they're still alive.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:10.850
But the main thing is,
his disciples were also

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:11.830
good teachers.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:16.520
And they instructed
a lot of people.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.670
And so, that's why, today,
when you go to China, Zen

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:22.590
is very much alive and well.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:27.050
In fact, perhaps, it's never
been in better condition.

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:30.590
Of course, there's two different
ways of looking at Zen.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.420
There's the actual
practice, and then

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.980
there's the material
outer appearance,

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.020
you might say-- the
monastery, the nunnery.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.820
And China's become
such a wealthy country.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.430
And so many Chinese
are Buddhists.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:52.290
They have been donating lots
of money to monasteries.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:55.290
And Zen monasteries
have received

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.710
millions, and millions,
and millions of dollars

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:02.040
every year, from
different benefactors.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.440
Sometimes it's just
the local farmers,

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.450
or the local Buddhists,
but it's also

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.800
billionaires have donated
significant amounts of money

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.190
to the reconstruction
of monasteries.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:19.030
You could say this is
good, and this is also bad.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:23.410
Because you get money, you
can build a nice monastery,

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:28.119
and you can have rooms with,
maybe, only one person in it,

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:29.860
instead of 10.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.480
And you can also have hot water.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.400
So you could take a hot shower.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.690
And you have great food.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:40.600
So the living conditions in Zen
monasteries is incredibly good.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:46.570
But, of course, because
they're built like palaces,

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.390
you get tourists
coming every day, too.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:53.190
And this can be very disturbing
for religious practice.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:59.560
And so, in a sense, there's a
religious Renaissance going on,

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:04.610
in China-- not only in Zen,
but in all factors of religion.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:05.920
I tell people it this way.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.650
This is my humorous
way of describing it.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.650
I say, the second
thing a Chinese person

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:17.200
does when they become rich is
they send it to the next life.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.720
The first thing you do is
you take care of your family.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.730
But the second
thing is you send it

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:23.980
to your family in the next life.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.040
And the place you do this
is your local monastery

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.040
or nunnery, or the
shrine-- local shrine.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:36.400
These are the places that
have the money transfer codes.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.050
If you go to the
monastery, they have

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.960
a way of sending your
merit on to the next life.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.960
So wealthy people have been
giving their large sums

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.260
of money to these places,
with the hope that they're

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.230
gaining a lot of merit, and this
merit will do them some good

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.840
in the next life.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.890
And again, and
this is a problem.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.566
Maybe, about 10 years
ago, it was a good thing.

00:18:59.566 --> 00:19:00.940
But it's now
getting to the point

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.650
where it's not
necessarily a good thing.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:08.350
Because the people who are
in charge of a monastery

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:12.670
have to be very careful
when they accept this money.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.220
It can really, actually,
destroy the way of life

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.990
they have created,
because then, they

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.860
have to accept all of these
visitors coming there.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.652
It's a big problem.

00:19:21.652 --> 00:19:22.151
Sure.

00:19:22.151 --> 00:19:23.590
I can understand
what do you mean.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.920
Because recently, I
visited the Shaolin Temple,

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.410
and met Abbot Shi Yongxin.

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.560
AND there's a lot of
controversy surrounding

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.940
Shaolin Temple, because
they face exactly

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.550
the same problem you mention.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:39.010
Well, Yongxin has come
up with a solution.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:42.760
What he does is he says,
well, we have Shaolin Temple.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.840
There's nothing we
can do about it.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.490
So we'll take the money we
get, and we'll use that money

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.110
to build practice temples.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.640
Right.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.140
And so, that's what
he's been doing.

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:56.410
In the countryside, he's been
building small temples, where

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.750
maybe about 20 monks live.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.820
And there's no tourists.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.250
And so that's his solution.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:08.710
But everybody has to
do it a different way.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:12.550
So you mentioned about
the modern challenges,

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.110
and also hopes.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:16.240
And, on the other
hand, it's a tradition.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.840
Because Zen in such a tradition,
has influenced the very much

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.010
by the past.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:24.090
So did you see, in your
interview, or your observation,

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.030
actually, the Zen
Buddhism in China,

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.630
they're actually
paying much attention

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.910
to revive this
tradition, so the future

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.680
is going to look like
their practice is

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.730
more traditional, just like
we have read in the books?

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:37.780
Yes.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:38.290
Yeah.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:39.290
[INAUDIBLE] in the past.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:44.470
Yeah I'd say they're very
aware of keeping things simple.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:50.530
And following the
traditional way of practice

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:54.850
that was developed over
a long period of time.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.540
Every monastery-- a Zen
monastery-- the most important

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.820
place is the meditation hall.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.580
And even today, if you
go into a Zen monastery,

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.871
and you're a monk, or you're
a nun, you have the right.

00:21:08.871 --> 00:21:10.370
Because, if you
live in a monastery,

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.430
you have to also do work.

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:15.740
But if you go to
a Zen monastery,

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.840
you can go to the meditation
hall and never leave.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.740
You have the right to just
stay in the meditation hall,

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:24.940
and do nothing.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:28.041
And you're highly respected
for doing that, of course.

00:21:28.041 --> 00:21:29.290
Not many people could do that.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:33.460
So meditation has become
the most important thing

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.570
in a Zen monastery.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:36.950
But right next to that is work.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.600
Everybody has to sweep,
work in the fields--

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.980
Communal labor.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:46.150
That's also, I should mention,
another problem for Zen

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.760
monasteries, is because,
during the Cultural Revolution,

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.390
and the years that followed, all
of their land was taken away.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.500
Yes.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.190
And the importance of land
is you could grow food,

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.840
and support yourself.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.180
If you lose that land,
then you're dependent.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.930
Where are you going
to get the money from?

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:04.264
Well, you get it from donations.

00:22:04.264 --> 00:22:06.138
But if you're going to
get it from donations,

00:22:06.138 --> 00:22:08.920
you have to open your doors,
and let in pilgrims-- which

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.620
is OK-- but tourists,
with bullhorns,

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.690
and making a lot of noise.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:18.820
So that's a big problem is, how
are you going to get your food?

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:21.550
And a lot of Zen
monasteries have

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.160
been very successful in
convincing the local government

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.870
to give them back some land.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.640
But actually, they
don't give it back.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.930
But you can buy it back.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:29.430
OK.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:30.020
Yeah.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.140
And it's very expensive.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.030
It's very expensive.

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.630
But they're doing
their best to do that,

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.870
because it's really important
to be self-supporting.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:43.480
And again, the thing that
distinguishes Zen in China

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.980
is that it's a way of life.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.880
It's a way of life--
you support yourself.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.010
You get up in the morning,
and you have food.

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.920
But then you've got to
go work to get that food.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.560
Instead of going out
and going to a job,

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.540
you have a field where you grow
the vegetables, and so forth.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:02.920
So plant is really important.

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.270
That's what Fo Yuan used
to stress at his temple.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.300
He would laugh at people
when they'd come to him

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:14.860
and talk about their problems
with the local governments,

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.570
and stuff.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:17.470
He said, all you have
to do is get land.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:19.931
If you can just get land,
all your problems are solved.

00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:20.430
OK.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:21.346
I see.

00:23:21.346 --> 00:23:22.690
Yeah.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:23.390
OK.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:26.840
So in the West, actually, we
get to know about Zen Buddhism

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.250
through Japan.

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:29.740
So this varied
pronunciation of Zen

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.920
is actually Japanese
pronunciation of Chan.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.770
So according to
your observation,

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.500
can you tell the difference
between the Chinese Zen

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.360
and Japanese Zen.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.430
So what exactly
things are different?

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:45.550
Of course, the Japanese
Zen originated from China,

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.270
in the past.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.990
But right now, do you
have any observations?

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:56.260
Not really, because I've
never been to a Zen monastery

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.690
in Japan where I've lived
for a period of time.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:23:59.650
I visited them.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:01.060
So I'm just an outside observer.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.470
I'm a tourist.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.280
So I can't really
speak about it.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:13.280
But I do know that, from my
superficial view of things,

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.310
Zen monasteries
in China and Japan

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:19.990
reflect the personalities
of the two cultures.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:24.190
The Japanese are
very regimented.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:27.610
And they love regimentation.

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:30.940
And I like to tell
people-- again,

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:36.670
in a humorous way-- that Chinese
are basically anarchists.

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:38.410
They respect power.

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:41.320
But they would just as soon
be left alone, thank you.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:46.150
And so, when you go to a
zen monastery in China,

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:49.120
naturally, they have
rules and all this.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.940
But you can, when you're
in the meditation hall,

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.960
you can make some noise.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.670
You can adjust yourself.

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:57.383
But in Japan, you get hit.

00:24:57.383 --> 00:24:57.883
Exactly.

00:25:02.142 --> 00:25:03.040
Also eating.

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.860
Everything you do in
a Japanese monastery

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.580
is regimented, like
you're in the army.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:14.920
And in China, it's
much more relaxed.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:15.880
So how about Taiwan?

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.710
You have been living in
Taiwan for such a long time,

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:23.120
and comparing Chinese Buddhism,
Zen Buddhism, in mainland,

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.780
and right now looking
back at Taiwan.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.020
Are they moving towards
the Taiwan type of Buddhism

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:30.450
in the future?

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:35.170
Well, they are in
the sense of money.

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:39.400
I think, when I first got
to Taiwan in 1972, people

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.405
used to laugh at me for
being a Buddhist-- I mean,

00:25:42.405 --> 00:25:43.030
Chinese people.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:44.571
Because they'd say,
why are believing

00:25:44.571 --> 00:25:46.840
in that superstitious nonsense?

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:51.760
But as Taiwan became
wealthy, the Taiwanese people

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.940
started expressing their
own religious devotion.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.180
And they started donating money
to these Buddhist temples,

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.890
like at Fo Guang Shan.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.140
And they became
incredibly wealthy,

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.740
and thus very influential
in the form of Buddhism

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:10.840
that was practiced in
Taiwan, which is mainly

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.320
pure land Buddhism-- chanting
the name of the Buddha

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.220
to be reborn.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.990
But also, there's some Zen, too.

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:20.470
But when I first got
to Taiwan, in '72,

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:22.630
I only knew of two
Zen masters who

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:26.860
actually had zen monasteries
and small groups of disciples.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.570
There's only a few of them.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.270
Zen has never played
much of a role

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:35.830
in Taiwan, because there's never
been much Buddhism until 1949--

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:40.570
Until the Kuomintang left
China and came to Taiwan.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:44.050
They brought with them a lot
of very famous Zen masters,

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.120
came with them.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.200
But they were all very old.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.690
And so, I visited them
when I first got there.

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:51.670
But they had no following.

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:53.770
The government was
taking care of them.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:54.940
Everything was OK.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:59.290
But they were basically
living in an old age home.

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:02.270
Zen had almost no
impact in Taiwan.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.300
Oh, I see.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.740
So the future of Zen is
actually back in China.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:07.240
Yeah.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.120
Absolutely, I'd say.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.000
So I have one more question.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.350
So that plan, I'm
writing a book which

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:21.310
is entitled How Buddhism
Changed World Civilization.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:23.560
So it is a book
about the evolution

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.280
of Buddhism in India and
China, Tibet, and all

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.850
the East Asian countries.

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:30.790
I want to show how
Buddhism actually

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:34.190
impact human civilization in
the past, and the present.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.234
So if I ask the same
question to you.

00:27:36.234 --> 00:27:37.150
Do you have an answer?

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:38.900
How are you going to
answer this question?

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.280
How Buddhism changed
world civilization?

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.310
Well, all I know
is what I've seen.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:50.200
I can't speak for all of
Southeast Asia, or South Asia.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:28:03.080
But from my own
perspective, Buddhism

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.620
is almost an enemy
of civilization.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:10.010
I wouldn't say an enemy, because
that sounds too aggressive.

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:13.860
But civilization, ever
since it's developed,

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.160
has seen nothing
but war after war,

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:21.770
after war, aggrandizement
after aggrandizement,

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:28.070
as people try to
control territories.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:33.000
But Buddhism-- the central
practice of Buddhism--

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.380
is one of peace
and non-possession.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:42.930
So it's like it has--
what shall I say?

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:46.080
It's not a great
supporter of civilization.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.080
That makes sense.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.110
It's not necessarily an
enemy of civilization,

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:52.440
but it's not a great
supporter of civilization.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.740
Because it's about
paying attention

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:59.700
to your own awareness, and
through the cultivation

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:00.270
of wisdom.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:03.060
But wisdom is based
upon compassion.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:07.680
And so, the wiser you become
as a Buddhist, the more you

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.790
realize that you are one with
all beings-- and especially

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:14.130
your fellow human beings.

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:17.040
So how can you conduct wars?

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.460
And how can you base wars based
on possession of territory,

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.570
and buildings, and
houses, all this.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:30.840
So that would be my
answer, is that Buddhism

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.380
has had an impact on
civilization in the sense

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:39.840
that it is not supported the
major themes of civilization,

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.930
in terms of more and
more, and more, and more.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.290
But Buddhism, in a sense, is
more Taoist-- less and less,

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:47.830
and less, please.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:48.630
That makes sense.

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:49.130
Yeah.

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:50.640
This is very insightful.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.880
I'm going to write
this into my book.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.620
Well, don't quote me.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:55.151
Yeah.

00:29:55.151 --> 00:29:55.650
OK.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.030
Thank you, Bill, for
spending time with us.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.010
It's a great pleasure
for us to have you, here.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.260
Well, Professor Wu, thank you.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:04.190
And I hope your
students enjoy this.
