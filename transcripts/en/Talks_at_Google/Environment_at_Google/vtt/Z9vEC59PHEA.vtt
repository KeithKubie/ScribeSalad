[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.472 --> 00:00:10.180
MARY CORCORAN: Well,
thank you very much.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.569
I'm absolutely terrified.

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:13.110
That's the first
thing I have to say.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.230
Because Caroline told me
this was a "perk" of the job.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.120
And I teach at
third level, where

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.482
lectures would be considered
purgatory rather than perks,

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:23.940
where it's something that people
have to get through to try

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.320
and get to the other end.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.230
So it's really exciting
for an academic

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.840
to be invited to come
and talk to Google people

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.190
because you are the unknowable--

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.620
the group of people
that we all hear about,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.930
the millennials, et cetera.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.179
But we know very
little about you.

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:44.970
So I hope that I'm
going to learn something

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.470
from you guys today.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.890
And Caroline told me that the
theme Google has set this year

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.610
is fostering connection.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.600
So what I've tried to
do is prepare a talk.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.270
And I decided that I wouldn't
do the whole PowerPoint thing,

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.520
that I would actually
try and use some props.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.450
So I'm going to be
channeling Mary Poppins.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.739
And I don't have Mary
Poppins's carpetbag,

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.320
but I borrowed my son's
disgusting rucksack.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.180
Which I realized is damp because
it was down at Electric Picnic,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.660
so my props might be getting
a little bit shabby inside.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.560
So I thought I would try
to use a few props to get

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.290
you thinking about
the sociological

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.750
meaning of connection.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.850
And really, connection
is at the core

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.120
of what it is to be a human.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.450
And that's what
sociologists look at.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.340
We look at how
people are, how they

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.450
experience the world in
terms of their connectedness

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.914
with others.

00:01:36.914 --> 00:01:39.330
And that's really important
because to connect with others

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.270
takes you out of
the privatized self.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.470
And it creates, then, for us,
a public realm in which people

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.580
can interconnect.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.410
And I suppose what
I'm trying to argue

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.870
is that there is a
continued significance

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.780
to that connectedness
in the digital age.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.530
And I'm arguing, really,
in a sense, for a material

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.190
understanding of connectedness.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.970
So what I'm going to talk to
you about is connectedness

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.759
or connectivity, not in
terms of the digital sphere,

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.000
which is where you guys all
work and excel, but in real,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.640
grounded, rooted, co-present
kind of connectivity,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.430
which has been central to the
work that I've been doing over

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.250
the last--

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.910
I don't even want to say it--
three decades as a sociologist.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.500
So I'm not going to talk
about the Internet of Things.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.620
I'm going to talk about
the sociology of things.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.440
And if I have time, I'll try and
move on and talk a little bit

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.510
about disconnect because
there's another side

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.030
to this whole
connection narrative.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.550
But we might leave that
aside and do questions

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.370
if we've run out of time.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.200
OK, so prop number one, a
little drum roll, please?

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.538
[AUDIENCE DRUMMING ON DESKS]

00:02:50.538 --> 00:02:53.220
[LAUGHS]

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.090
MARY CORCORAN: OK.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.430
This is prop number one.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.770
So you can have a look at that.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.643
Tell me what I've
just thrown at you.

00:03:00.643 --> 00:03:02.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.124
MARY CORCORAN: The
smell is unintentional.

00:03:06.124 --> 00:03:07.410
AUDIENCE: It's a cushion.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.285
MARY CORCORAN: Right.

00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:10.960
AUDIENCE: With a
nice [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.850
MARY CORCORAN: OK.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.350
OK.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.120
Do you want to throw it back?

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.300
Super.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.734
OK, so it's a cushion.

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:18.150
It's in a sort of
a tweedy fabric,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.930
and there's some
buttons on it, right?

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.322
SPEAKER: Let me screw
that mic on you, sorry.

00:03:21.322 --> 00:03:22.072
MARY CORCORAN: Oh.

00:03:22.072 --> 00:03:22.816
Apology.

00:03:22.816 --> 00:03:23.482
SPEAKER: Cheers.

00:03:23.482 --> 00:03:23.920
Thank you.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.420
MARY CORCORAN: OK,
so I'm just going

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.420
to tell you a little back
story to this cushion.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.840
There's a farmer,
a large farmer,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.660
living in the
southeast of Ireland,

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.910
married, and produced
eight children--

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.400
seven girls and one boy.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.760
In due course, the farm
and the farm house,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.460
all of the wealth if you
like, created by that farmer,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.720
was willed to the only son.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.190
And the seven daughters
got their weddings,

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.940
which is kind of--

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.440
I'm not talking in
the 19th century.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.370
I'm talking the
late 20th century.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.240
So the seven daughters
were given their marriage.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.300
It was, in effect, a dowry which
their father settled on them.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.450
The man, this farmer, was
widowed quite early in life.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.850
And then he was
predeceased by his son.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.740
So in fact, his farm ended
up going out of the family.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.660
And when he died, he
really left no belongings

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.200
except the clothes
that he retained.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.250
Now, his seven daughters
had, throughout their lives,

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.390
and particularly in his later
life, taken care of him,

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.010
cooked for him, cleaned for
him, taken him out, and so on.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.500
So after his death,
one of the sisters

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.620
discovered his old
suit in the wardrobe.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.280
And she took it and she
made seven cushions out

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.470
of her dad's old suit.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.830
You can see some of the buttons
and everything featured on it.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.710
OK, so what am I
trying to say here?

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.360
Well, I think it tells us a
story about the Irish family.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.506
And it is about connectedness
between members.

00:04:54.506 --> 00:04:56.130
Before we think about
that, let's think

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.610
about the other
things it tell us.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.950
First of all, it shows us how
patriarchal Irish families

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.570
traditionally have been.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.290
The incredibly rigid gender
roles and gender norms

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.430
that underpinned the way in
which that family actually

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.600
functioned.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.560
Now, today, we're moving towards
more egalitarian family forms.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.010
But that notion that
there is a patriarch,

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.830
and that they
dictate who and how

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.710
the wealth that the family
has been created is dispersed,

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.130
is still very significant.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.680
And that is often talked
about as a patrilineal line

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.280
of descent, that anything
that is useful or valuable

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.590
must go down through
the male line.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.110
And particularly
in Ireland, we have

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.380
a history of strong
property lot rights

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.720
and a form of
inheritance which focused

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.460
very much on a son,
a single son, really,

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.700
disinheriting the
rest of the family.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.960
And that relates right
back to the famine.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.180
So what we see there is
how a kind of history

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.170
imprints itself on the social
practice of modern day.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.260
But obviously, also, this
man was a paterfamilias.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.520
He was the head of the family.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.550
He was loved and respected and
remembered after he is gone.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.050
And that brings me to his death.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.550
I mean, death, in Ireland,
is a particular kind

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.850
of way of recreating
connections.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.880
Death in Ireland is
very ritualistic.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.490
Particularly if you're a
member of the Catholic church,

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.650
there are a whole series
of rituals that you

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.260
go through when somebody dies--

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.350
from removal, to
Mass, to Month's Mind,

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.060
to annual graveyard, masses,
to creating memorial cards,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.760
and so on.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.730
And they're the
ways, really, that we

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.120
try to keep that deceased
person somehow alive,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.990
somehow connected to
the continuing reality.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.770
And I just like this, because
I think the cushion represents

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.350
an innovative way of maintaining
some sense of connectedness,

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.530
of belonging to someone
who is deceased,

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.310
and keeping the memory alive
in a kind of really practical,

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.110
material culture way.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.250
It's not a nap.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.510
It's a cushion.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.760
But every time somebody sits
on that cushion or farts

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.620
on that cushion,
they might think

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.700
about the dad or the grandfather
who once actually inhabited

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.850
the suit.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.830
OK, are you ready
for the next prop?

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.330
OK.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.640
[RATTLING BAG]

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.420
OK.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.878
I'm not going to
throw this one out

00:07:28.878 --> 00:07:31.500
in case somebody doesn't
throw it back to me.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:37.110
OK, so my second prop is
a packet of Tayto Crisps.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.530
Tayto Crisps are the number
one crisps in the Irish market,

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.970
and they are beloved of
Irish people worldwide.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.760
Mr. Tayto, as you
can see, is about

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.300
as far removed from Kim
Kardashian as you can imagine.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.930
But he holds a very dear
place in Irish hearts.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.420
And what's interesting
about Tayto is, as a brand,

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.580
it doesn't travel.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.690
It has never been able to
make it into any other market,

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.600
except amongst the Irish.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.150
Now back in the 1980s, I
undertook a PhD in sociology

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.360
in New York City.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.340
And I hadn't chosen a
topic for my thesis.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.390
But while I was there,
I was working one summer

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.020
in a restaurant downtown.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.230
And I just became aware of this
large number of Irish people

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.990
who were running
around, waitering

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.550
and waitressing in
these restaurants,

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.237
and I became one of them.

00:08:31.237 --> 00:08:33.570
And I discovered that they
were all then going back home

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.679
in the evenings to little
ethnic enclaves in Queens

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.360
and in the Bronx.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.360
And these, now, were a group of
people who were undocumented.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.930
They were there without papers,
without social security cards,

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.080
working, if you like,
in the informal economy.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.540
But of course-- and so
it presented itself to me

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.890
as a topic to investigate.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.550
So I ended up doing my doctorate
on the undocumented Irish

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.890
in New York.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.120
And of course, one of
the things that happens,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.790
if you're an nondocumented
immigrant in particular,

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.960
is that you are really very much
confined to an ethnic enclave.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.130
Your connections cannot
be really outside of that,

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.490
because you have this sort of
legal status issue that acts

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:19.480
as a barrier against
any kind of interaction.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.100
So with the Irish in
New York in the 1980s,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.790
they were intensely
ethnicized, if you like.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.130
They were really
dependent on power brokers

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.590
in the Irish American
community to give them jobs.

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.330
They were dependent
on landlords who were

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.790
willing to accept cash in hand.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.740
And of course, they all
congregated together

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.710
in the pubs in the
Bronx and in Queens.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.030
And what did they do?

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:47.450
They swilled lots of beer, and
they consumed boxfuls of Tayto.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:51.510
And the Tayto had to be
imported from Ireland, as did--

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.910
and this, now, is going back
in the '80s, it's very much

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.290
pre-internet--

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.730
Gaelic games-- major effort
to get them onto television

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.280
screens that could be shown
in pubs so that people

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.380
could connect in with them.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:09.150
People used to telephone home,
like, from a dial up phone,

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.630
to put money on horse
races back in Ireland,

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.380
and then phone a few hours later
to see if their horse came in.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.340
So the point really is that,
even though those undocumented

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:24.090
Irish in the '80s, they were
thousands of miles from home,

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.690
not really able to integrate in
mainstream American culture--

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.730
at least there were some
constraints on that--

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:35.520
they nevertheless, maintained a
very strong high identification

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.650
with their sense of
Irishness, but also

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.410
with their sense of home.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.670
And that, I think, can
happen in multiple ways.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.300
I mean, nowadays we talk
about Skype and Facebook

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.520
and all of these
things connect people

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.170
across space and across time.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:53.550
But I think Tayto Crisps have
a role to play here as well.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.520
Because they are
something from home.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.540
They're quintessentially Irish.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:02.070
They've got this absolutely
horrific brand, Mr. Tayto,

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.830
who somehow has
managed to survive

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:08.610
in a world of
aesthetic perfection.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.670
And it links us back, right?

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.480
It links us back.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.800
And it is easily transportable
and provides a particular kind

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.150
of sensory experience.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.530
I'm sure most of
you in this room

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.590
have that lovely pleasure
of opening a bag of crisps

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.670
and getting your
first munch of it.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.410
And I think that that really
represents a symbolic linking

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:29.490
back to home.

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.470
But it also--

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.050
I mentioned earlier,
that imprint of history--

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:37.540
it does relate
back to the potato.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.860
The potato in Irish, culture
going right back to the famine,

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.280
that there's something about
spuds that Irish people love.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.380
We just can't go
for more than three

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.500
or four days without
having a spud.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.530
And Tayto Crisps are
quite a good substitute.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.500
In fact, I was at my
brother-in-law's 50th birthday

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.707
party in Alexandria,
Virginia last weekend.

00:11:58.707 --> 00:12:00.540
And one of the things
that was brought over,

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:04.860
apart from the Barry's tea, was
a large box of Tayto Crisps.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.600
So it's not just
technology that links

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.860
people across space and time.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.180
I think it's also
sensory experiences,

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.860
material artifacts,
if you like, that

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.680
can create that same
kind of connectedness.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.250
OK.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.070
How am I doing for time?

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:21.570
Yeah?

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:22.500
Not too bad.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.790
OK, so prop number three--

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.355
da, da, da, da--

00:12:26.355 --> 00:12:28.730
I can see you're all just
getting carried away with this.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.115
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:30.115 --> 00:12:31.090
OK.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:36.670
Exhibit 3, everybody
recognize what we've got here?

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.057
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:38.890
MARY CORCORAN: Yeah?

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.360
Football jersey, right?

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.930
Dublin-- the best
team at the moment--

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:46.560
the winners.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.280
OK, so we put our
football jersey up there.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:50.930
OK.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:56.340
So sport-- all forms
of sport really

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.450
develop a following that is
predicated on identification,

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:03.030
connection to
something or someone.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.100
So it can be a connection
to an individual

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.740
like the way in which
a lot of Irish people

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.135
like Conor McGregor.

00:13:09.135 --> 00:13:11.640
Or it can be a
connection to a team,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.680
like the Dublin
footballers, or the Kilkenny

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.234
hurlers, or the New
England Patriots,

00:13:16.234 --> 00:13:17.400
or whatever the case may be.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.400
There goes our
construction outside.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.020
OK.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.570
And what I was arguing, what
sociologists would argue,

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:29.100
is that people turn to sport
and other experiences like music

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.360
for an experience of
what Emile Durkheim, back

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.830
in the 19th century, called
collective effervescence.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.140
I think it's a fabulous term.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:41.830
Durkheim was writing
about religion.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.890
He was trying to
understand why people

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.640
had created religion,
why people created a god

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.320
and focus on that.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.100
And Durkheim argued
that what we do, really,

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.990
in creating religion
is that we want

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.620
to celebrate society,
i.e., the social connection

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.430
between each other.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:06.060
But it's difficult to do that
in the everyday profane, sort

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.630
of lived life.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.770
So what people did was to
create a kind of godlike figure

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:13.170
and to sort of transfer
onto the god figure

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.792
that sense of identity,
of connectedness.

00:14:15.792 --> 00:14:18.000
So in other words, that god
is simply reflecting back

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.170
to us, ourselves, society.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.274
Now, religion, I
mean, obviously,

00:14:25.274 --> 00:14:26.565
that's a huge area to get into.

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:29.700
In some parts of the world,
religious experience,

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.490
religious effervescence
has intensified.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.070
But in the Western world, it
has really been declining.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.510
And what sociologists
have noticed

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.840
is that things like sports
and music, in a way,

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.200
have become a kind of
replacement or substitute

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.400
for religion.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.780
So if we think about that, if we
think about people heading off

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.660
to the All-Ireland
final, Dublin and Mayo,

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.220
you can actually
see the same sort

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:56.010
of processes going on that
would have traditionally gone

00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:00.350
on around a religious event or
a religious kind of experience.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.420
So usually there's a kind
of a build up, right?

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.220
People are getting ready.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.070
I remember when I was a
kid, for Mass on Sunday,

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.580
my dad would just take out
six children, Catholic family,

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.260
take out all the
shoes and polish them

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.090
all on a Saturday night for
us to go to Mass on Sunday.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.100
That was a build up.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.380
It was saying something
special is going to happen.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:23.610
Same-- people here will start
listening to commentary,

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.200
checking stuff out,
making sure they

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.290
have the latest, up-to-date
version of their jersey, and so

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.310
on.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.740
Sports events, like
religious events,

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.770
also really rely on
group interaction,

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:39.090
on people coming together, and
focusing on sacred symbols.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:41.280
Within the church, it's
all about the altar, what

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.705
the priest is doing, and so on.

00:15:42.705 --> 00:15:44.640
On the field, it's
about the champs,

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.710
waving the scarves
at the right time,

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:50.340
singing, screaming,
profanities at the ref when

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:53.400
they are required So
all of that, in a way,

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.360
is about strengthening shared
beliefs, values, aspirations,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.080
and emotion.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.449
So whether you're doing
it at Mass on Sunday,

00:16:00.449 --> 00:16:02.490
whether you're in Croke
Park, whether you're down

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.620
at Electric Picnic,
you're engaging

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.190
in a process of experiencing
what Durkheim called

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.290
collective effervescence.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.890
And I think that is a really
important way in which we

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:18.090
sort of materially and
physically connect with others.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:21.414
So putting on that jersey
immediately puts you

00:16:21.414 --> 00:16:23.580
into a place where you're
playing a particular role.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.670
You're making a statement about
a particular set of values

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.670
and belongings that you embody.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.520
So that's really, if you like,
the symbolic value of sport.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.420
But there's also a very powerful
instrumental or functional

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.950
value to sport.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.350
And particularly-- and
I'm speaking really

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.450
from the Irish context
here, and from research

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.430
that I have done,
but particularly

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:49.010
in terms of inculcating a sense
of belonging in communities.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:52.170
Now a few years
ago, I got to debate

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.170
with Robert Putnam,
a very famous Harvard

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:59.100
political scientist, who wrote
a book called "Bowling Alone."

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.980
And it was about the decline
of community in America.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.339
And he used that metaphor, that
nobody went bowling in groups

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:06.157
anymore in America.

00:17:06.157 --> 00:17:07.740
And that this was
really, if you like,

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.837
easing into the body politic.

00:17:09.837 --> 00:17:11.670
And I remember when I
was debating with him,

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:15.060
I had one great
argument as my retort.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:19.380
The Gaelic Athletic
Association, the GAA,

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.650
which was founded in Ireland in
the 1880s as part of Ireland's

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.920
attempt to self-determine
as a separate country,

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.880
with separate value system,
culture, practices, et cetera,

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.212
to Britain.

00:17:31.212 --> 00:17:36.030
The GAA is a nationally
organized, voluntary

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:36.930
organization.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.390
Voluntary-- so
people are not paid.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.150
And it operates
in the 32 counties

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.320
of the Republic of Ireland.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:48.150
It operates in every tiny
locality throughout Ireland.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.010
A few years ago myself
and some colleagues

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.520
did a-- now, we know that it's
very powerful in rural Ireland.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.030
And apart from
Dublin, mainly it has

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.940
been rural teams
that have really

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.530
been the top performers,
if you like, historically.

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:05.820
But Dublin has grown.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.455
And Dublin, I think, anyone
here who is a betting person,

00:18:08.455 --> 00:18:10.080
will surely think
that Dublin are going

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.460
to absolutely destroy Mayo.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.260
I'm sorry for
Mayo, the underdog,

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.810
but I think Dublin
are going to win.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:16.520
Well, how is it so
strong in Dublin?

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.350
Dublin is a metropolitan area.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.860
Well, we did some research
on new suburban communities

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.982
in and around the
hinterland of Dublin.

00:18:24.982 --> 00:18:26.940
And one of the things
that we were trying to do

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:31.500
was to investigate, are the
suburbs, the new suburban areas

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.750
of Dublin, the areas
that have grown 5,

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.140
10, 15 miles from the city
center, are they really

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.350
the social deserts
that we hear about?

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.880
Because suburbs get
a terrible press.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.830
They get a terrible
press from the movies,

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.750
in literature,
where they're always

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:49.980
seen as the places that suck
you dry and destroy your soul

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:54.410
and turn you into a broken
down alcoholic or a manic sort

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:56.910
of Annette Bening in
"American Beauty."

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:59.650
So the suburb, then--

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.220
some we would say-- and
particularly, "The Irish Times"

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.680
had taken an absolute
dislike and thought everyone

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.740
should be living in high
rise in the city center.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.190
Anyone who's in the burbs--

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:09.660
social death.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.901
So we went and we investigated
four of these suburbs.

00:19:12.901 --> 00:19:14.400
And we found,
actually, they're not.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.920
They're places that
people really like to live

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.440
and that most people
choose to live in.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.170
And we found, really, there
are very strong levels

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.180
of identification with place.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.020
And that identification with
place is connected to a village

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.410
being there, a little bit of
history, a bit of tradition,

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:32.400
a bit of heritage.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.220
Something like that made
a big difference to people

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.500
because it gave them a sense
of connection to the place.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.030
It was a place that
you could call.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:42.810
For example, in Ratoath
in County Meath,

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.695
people were very
aware that there

00:19:44.695 --> 00:19:46.800
was a history of horse
racing in the area

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.310
and that it was a very
pastoral environment.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.610
And that was really important
to their self-identification

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:53.821
as suburbanites.

00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:56.070
We also found that people
had a lot of social supports

00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:00.090
in terms of five or six people
that they could call upon

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:04.110
to mind a child, to borrow
a little bit of money,

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:07.380
to share a problem with
on an ongoing basis, which

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.120
is actually
internationally quite high,

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.015
having five to six people
in your close network.

00:20:12.015 --> 00:20:14.640
And the third thing was we found
a lot of social participation.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:20.370
But the main factor of social
participation was the GAA.

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.870
So people of all
ages were involved.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.790
It was a kind of a hub
that got children--

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.390
because it really mentors
children from a young age,

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.290
it brings those parents into
these circuits of sociability

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.430
that then operate.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:38.040
And of course, that doesn't
just operate in suburban Dublin,

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.740
it operates in the
Irish diaspora,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:45.480
beyond Ireland, where we have
GAA clubs in places like Dubai.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.310
So it's actually creating a
kind of a social capital that

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.770
forms a social glue
for people, that

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.995
keeps a community connected.

00:20:54.995 --> 00:20:57.120
And I what's particularly
interesting about the GAA

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.360
is that it's actually
cross-generational.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.480
So you can get involved in it
as a 5-year-old, 10, 15, 20.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.300
You can stay as a
mentor, as a trainer.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.900
You can actually join
your local GAA club

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.090
as an aging person like myself--

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:16.260
the over 55's-- and you can get
a cheaper drink in the club.

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:16.855
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:16.855 --> 00:21:18.870
And that, in itself, is a bonus.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.020
We found very high
membership rates

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.940
in Leixlip, County Kildare,
mainly because of the cheaper

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.170
drink in the bar.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.060
But the point, really, is
a little bit more serious

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:28.650
than that.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.810
But there are certain
kinds of social processes.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:35.880
And I think the GAA is
very particular to Ireland,

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:40.210
that can create and foster
this sort of connection.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.690
OK, so fourth-- [LAUGHS]

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:44.960
[AUDIENCE DRUMMING ON DESKS]

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.340
Like, I'm an academic,
so I'm really

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.173
supposed to have something
to do with books.

00:21:49.173 --> 00:21:52.100
So I brought a book
I'll just pass around.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.110
Copy-- you can just
pass it around.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:58.950
So this is a little project
I wanted to tell you about.

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:00.660
Because, again, I
think it's an example

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.260
of material culture being
able to express something,

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:09.120
to give a message, to give voice
to an experience that otherwise

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.490
isn't often heard.

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.370
So there's this wonderful
artist called Mary Burke, who

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.440
is Dublin-based, but
she's spent all her life

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.190
painting suburban portraits,
mainly suburban portraits

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.560
in middle-class County Dublin.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.700
So she got involved
in West Tallaght.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:31.470
West Tallaght is one of the most
disadvantaged areas in Ireland.

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:35.380
When you talk to the
people there, as I did,

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.980
they often use terms,
like, it's like Beirut.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.600
It's Apache land up here.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.970
So they really have
internalized this sense

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.480
that they're off the edge, that
they're a kind of a war zone,

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.030
if you like, beyond the norm.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:52.630
Now, what we did was Mary Burke,
the artist, Tallaght Community

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:54.940
Arts, and myself got together.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.870
And 10 families were selected
to have a portrait painted

00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:59.620
of their house.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.200
Now, these are mostly
social housing units,

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.650
so they're not salubrious
South County Dublin dwellings.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.590
They're pretty ordinary
social housing.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.560
So what Mary did was to
photograph each house,

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.720
and then to paint an individual
portrait of each one.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.930
And then I interviewed all of
the families involved, mainly,

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:22.390
really, to find out from them,
their understanding of home,

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:25.930
what that the house
meant to them, and so on.

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:28.450
And then what we did
was to produce it

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.590
as a book, which shows the
process of the portraits being

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.780
painted, and then has
an essay by myself which

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:40.040
tries to interpret what
home means to the people who

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.200
were involved.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.060
Now, I think what's
interesting about this

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:46.520
is that when we talk about
disadvantaged people, people

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.270
in Tallaght West,
they're often focused on,

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:51.520
from a deficit model.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.960
They're people that need things.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.550
They're people
that have problems.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.680
They're people that
can't manage their lives.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.480
They're dysfunctional,
they're chaotic, et cetera.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.910
But by doing this
project, we were

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.880
able to provide a much
more positive resource

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.230
model of the people.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:07.300
Because what we did
was really to focus

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.350
on their energy, their
imagination in how they dwell,

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.990
how they live
within their homes.

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:16.900
And what we found is that,
much like everybody else,

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.570
home means certain things
to people in Tallaght West.

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.330
They love it as a
physical structure.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:25.750
They talked about the
sturdiness of the house.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:29.050
They loved it as a
territory, a place

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.464
where they could set markers.

00:24:30.464 --> 00:24:33.130
And that's really important in a
place like Tallaght West, where

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.842
you don't have control over
the external environment, where

00:24:35.842 --> 00:24:38.050
there might be a bit of
anti-social behavior going on

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:39.530
outside your front door.

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.950
So it becomes really
important to know

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:43.750
that you can close
the door on that,

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.254
that you can draw
your net curtains.

00:24:45.254 --> 00:24:47.170
And you'll see, if you
flick through the book,

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:48.700
that everybody has net curtains.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:53.290
So they can look out,
but people can't look in.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:57.250
And home is a place of
self-expression and identity,

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:57.750
right?

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.583
Of course, the difference
is that for people

00:24:59.583 --> 00:25:01.990
in Tallaght West, a lot of
the time they're dreaming.

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:03.200
So I interview them--

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.930
say, I'd love to do this.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.460
I'm going to try and paint this.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.490
At some point, I
would like to do--

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:11.620
if you're middle class,
if you have resources,

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.270
you can actually
make the changes.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:14.230
They want to change.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:19.210
They want to inscribe their
own kind of identity on it,

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.120
but it often remains
kind of aspirational.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.490
And of course, a lot of
the decor in these homes

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:28.380
are family portraits, family
portraits all over the walls,

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.090
another way of connecting
in with family.

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:36.760
And homes also operated for them
as a social and cultural unit.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.074
If you have a home, your family
can come in and out of it.

00:25:40.074 --> 00:25:41.740
I am really stressing
this because we're

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.660
living in a moment
in Ireland where

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.910
there's a massive problem
with homelessness.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:49.690
And when you think about how
the so-called disadvantaged

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:54.340
in this book talk about
how significant home is,

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.380
it actually makes it
all the more stark

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.170
what people who are
homeless are missing.

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:03.280
So having a home means that
people come in and out.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.630
Your parents come by.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:06.800
Your father comes
down to do the garden.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.630
Your children are in and out.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.530
And pets-- that was the
biggest revelation for me

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:13.660
was the amount of
people who absolutely

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:19.000
adore having dogs,
cats, lizards, goldfish,

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.440
et cetera, in their home.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.570
And that those pets
themselves take

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:25.090
on a personality of their own.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:25.616
OK.

00:26:25.616 --> 00:26:26.740
So why am I stressing this?

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.350
Because I think in the
production of these set

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:32.650
of portraits-- by the way,
the portraits were exhibited

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.270
in Tallaght and in a few
more places around Dublin--

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.870
but amazingly, each
portrait was, then,

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:42.250
presented to the family
whose home had been painted,

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:46.900
which is a total inversion of
the normal situation, where

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.710
art that is publicly
on display usually

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.270
goes into private collections.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:55.390
In this case, the art that
was produced, if you like,

00:26:55.390 --> 00:27:03.060
went back to the people
whose homes had been painted.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.500
And it wasn't, if you
like, commercialized

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.940
in the normal way.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.430
In fact, it was just a
temporary public good.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.497
People could see
it, but it wasn't

00:27:11.497 --> 00:27:13.580
something that was out
there in the public domain.

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:17.230
So I think what is most
significant about the book is

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:21.970
that it tries to reframe our
understandings of how people

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:24.520
live in places that are a
little bit off the grid,

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.660
off the beaten track.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.480
And it challenges some
of the stereotypes

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.380
and some of the
assumptions that we make

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.200
about people who live there.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:32.860
OK.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:37.790
So moving on, fifth
and final prop--

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.362
if it hasn't become--

00:27:39.362 --> 00:27:40.600
yeah.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.750
Is my basil plant, OK?

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:46.060
It's a nice little
bit of greenery.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.580
Actually, this is becoming quite
a nice little tableau here.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:54.530
OK.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.720
When is a plant
not just a plant?

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.580
Well, when it becomes a
basis for social belonging

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:04.010
and when it starts to produce
social and civic dividends

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:05.990
for the community.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.840
So one of the things I've been
doing over the last few years

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.000
is working with a
group of Europeans

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.360
across 23 countries in Europe,
looking at urban agriculture.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.520
Because what we've noted
is that, particularly

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.480
since the downturn,
the crisis of 2008,

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.100
there's been a massive
resurgence in urban agriculture

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.310
across Europe.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.610
And I use that term
extremely widely, because it

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:32.930
can be anything from growing
fruit and veg in a window box

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:36.380
to actually setting up an
urban farm, a proper, sort

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:38.210
of commercialized
urban farm, where

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:43.640
you're trying to produce
and supply a local market.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.630
So in a way, if you like, one
of the unintended consequences

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:51.920
of austerity was a new interest
or a renewal of interest,

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.410
I should say, in issues
to do with food--

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:59.030
food provenance, food
security, self-efficacy--

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:03.710
being capable or able or
knowing where something grows,

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:07.040
how it grows, and how
to harvest and tend it.

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.800
And food justice-- the
idea that all of us,

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.170
really, ought to
be able to access

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:17.880
good quality, high quality
food that is locally available.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.720
So as I said, with
the European project,

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.280
we looked at examples
right across Europe,

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.760
and we looked at different
levels of urban agriculture.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.610
And what, really, we found right
across the way is that these

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:35.570
are fantastic facilities,
based in cities,

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:40.160
in and around peri-urban area
that are accessible to people--

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.620
and again, it's
regardless of age--

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:46.820
that can be used by unemployed
people, by homeless people,

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.910
by people with special needs,
people with disabilities

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:54.590
and that there is huge kind
of social benefits to getting

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.800
your hands dirty with soil,
cultivating, and seeing, if you

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.430
like, the fruit of your labor.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:02.030
So it probably is the opposite
of digital production,

00:30:02.030 --> 00:30:05.510
in that, you actually
get a sort of a product

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.930
after starting with a seed and
doing lots of things to it,

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.120
right, in the process.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.830
Now I was particularly
interested in this

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.050
because we did a
little bit of research

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:19.400
which looked at urban allotments
in Dublin and also in Belfast.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.910
And as you know, Belfast is
a very, very segregated city.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.740
So anyone who's
been to Belfast will

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.970
know that, territorially, it
is very divided along sort

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:30.560
of ethnonational lines.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.710
So you know when you're
entering a nationalist area,

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.180
because there'll be murals.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:38.000
The sidewalks will be painted
green, white, and orange,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.510
or red, white, and blue.

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:42.920
So there's constant
signifiers in the public space

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.840
of the city telling
you this is Catholic,

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.300
and this is Protestant.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.960
And of course, in the era of the
peace process, lots of attempts

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.710
are being made to bring the two
communities together, right?

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:57.220
And lots of resources
have gone into that.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.135
But what we found was that--

00:30:59.135 --> 00:31:01.640
and it's a slightly
overlooked space--

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.610
that, if we look at the
kind of politics of place

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:07.310
around urban
agriculture in Belfast,

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.530
you find something
very interesting--

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:14.090
that the agricultural
plots that people utilize

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:20.000
are actually a place where
ethnoreligious differences are

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.800
parked at the gate.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.570
So the whole focus of coming
into an allotment site,

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:28.130
and taking out your tools, and
doing your bit of gardening,

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.170
and opening your flask,
having a cup of tea,

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.630
is all about cultivation.

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:34.860
People don't talk
about politics.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.310
They don't ask each other
about their background.

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:41.420
It's a public space where
there is a single focus,

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.910
and you do not have to
become intimate with others

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:44.680
or know anything.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:46.430
So we found that a lot
of the time, people

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:47.990
only know people by
their first name.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:51.640
But politics is
parked at the gate.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.140
And we found that
particularly interesting,

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:59.210
that something as basic
as just growing vegetables

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:01.700
could, if you like,
have a role in creating

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.790
a more equitable version
of the contemporary city,

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:06.740
particularly when we
think about a city

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.555
where there are
serious problems.

00:32:11.531 --> 00:32:12.030
OK.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.010
So I've just a few
more minutes left.

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:17.950
So I'll just try and pull some
of that together a little more.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:19.905
So when I was thinking
about this talk,

00:32:19.905 --> 00:32:23.740
and about focusing on
connections and connectedness,

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.080
I also started to think,
OK, I can talk a little bit

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.330
about some research I've done.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:28.920
I can show how we are connected.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.110
But there is also a
flip side to that,

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.984
which is disconnection
and disconnectedness.

00:32:33.984 --> 00:32:35.400
And one of the
things that I think

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.940
has gone through each
of these five examples,

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.400
which is somewhat serendipitous
because I kind of just

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.770
pulled them together
rather eclectically,

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:46.260
is the whole issue
of social class.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:50.880
And social class is interesting
because social class does

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.000
reinforce connection
within class,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.279
but it also creates
division between classes.

00:32:58.279 --> 00:32:59.820
And I mean, that's
not a new insight.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.730
That's exactly what Marx was
saying in the 19th century,

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:05.190
and what Max Weber also said.

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:07.740
And indeed, Marx and
Weber both argued

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:10.560
that social class is
based around one group

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.580
having something,
one not having it.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:15.920
Weber was a little bit more-- he
talks about things like status

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.600
and access to power as well.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.020
But more recently, a British
sociologist, Mike Savage,

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:26.370
did this really cool thing at
the great BBC class survey.

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:27.870
It was a piece of
academic research,

00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:31.290
but it was also done through
a kind of an outreach

00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:33.900
through the BBC to the
British public where

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.470
they tried to kind of unpick
a little bit what does class

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:39.600
mean in the contemporary world.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.880
And he borrowed from
Pierre Bourdieu,

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.860
the French sociologist,
to argue that, when

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.360
we think about
class now, we have

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:49.260
to think about it as economic
capital, which means money,

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.640
and wealth, and land.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.850
We have to think about it
as cultural capital, which

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:58.740
means being able to appreciate
and engage with cultural goods

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:03.630
like being able to go to
festivals, listen to music,

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:07.140
appreciate art, play
sports, use the gym,

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.630
and so on, and also having
educational credentials,

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:12.600
which, of course,
you all have tons of.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.870
So cultural capital is
really important, probably,

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:18.150
I think increasingly, the
most important capital.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.100
And thirdly, there's
the social capital,

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.800
which is our contacts
and connectedness that

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:27.150
allow people to create a social
network around themselves which

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.350
they can then draw upon.

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:30.239
OK.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:32.909
So just thinking back, then, on
what I've been saying and using

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:37.290
my props from the perspective
of social class, in Ireland,

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:40.409
land has always
been and continues

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:44.590
to be a hugely powerful
resource in our society.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:48.270
So Marx and Weber both talked
about the propertied class

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.580
and the property-less class.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.880
And amazingly, that is the
world that we live in today.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.760
We live in a world where people
either are homed, or have

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:01.110
homes, or access to homes,
or people are homeless.

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:05.490
And that sort of really
strong commitment to property

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:08.220
and the right to
property is strongly

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.500
enshrined in our constitution.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.820
It cannot be removed.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.480
And interestingly, Iceland
underwent a, sort of,

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:20.430
a crowdfunded constitutional
review a couple of years

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:23.580
ago, where it sort of
was a crowd-based attempt

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:26.130
to rewrite the
Icelandic constitution.

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:28.950
They couldn't get any
change on the right

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:31.290
to property in
that constitution.

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:34.830
So in Ireland, I think, that
has been a huge obstacle

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:38.800
to creating a basis for greater
cohesion in our society.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.470
So we go back to our farmer.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:44.700
Seven daughters, one son,
but that precious boy

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:49.770
must get that farm so as not
to lose that family resource,

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:51.300
that it must be retained.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.090
So that sort of notion
of land and property

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:59.840
and how you hang on to what
you have is really significant.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:04.470
And I spoke about the Tayto,
as the Tayto-loving Irish

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:05.280
immigrants.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.060
But that didn't really
encompass all of the immigrants.

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:12.750
Because we can't assume
homogeneity amongst immigrants

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:14.730
living in any society.

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:18.000
There are very clear
class differentials

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.580
in terms of people's access
to economic, cultural,

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.200
and social capital.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.830
So when I did it-- because I did
a lot of research on the Irish

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:28.230
abroad, and then I did
research on returners,

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:29.730
people who came back.

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:34.770
And I came up with a
kind of a typology.

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:37.140
I don't actually-- I
only made 15 copies.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.190
I was very pessimistic about
how many people would show up.

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:42.390
So you can just
have a look at it,

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:45.780
or pass it on to somebody else.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.366
So what I was trying to
do there was to show that

00:36:48.366 --> 00:36:50.740
if you're thinking about who
a migrant-- and some of you,

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.820
I'm sure, are immigrants
in this room--

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.650
you can actually
think about where do I

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.300
fit on a migration typology?

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.180
So this is the typology I
generated to try and capture

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.870
that notion that, when
we're in the world,

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:07.200
we all have access to these
different kind of resources.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.280
So I've described three
different types of emigrant.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:12.500
And this is all based on
research on Irish people.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.620
But I think some of
it actually would

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:19.030
work for Polish and Lithuanian
and Romanian as well.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.890
So the reserve
army immigrants are

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.560
the ones that Marx
talked about, the people

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:27.220
who basically are the sand
crew lot, the people who

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.500
have little skill,
little opportunity,

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.600
and will go anywhere for work.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:34.030
The global adventurers
are the kind

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:37.930
of flexible, mobile,
contingent people--

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:41.650
gap years, two-year
visa in Canada,

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:44.400
want to spend a bit of time
out of my home country.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.440
And the cosmopolites
are the elites--

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.830
the international, circulating,
transnational people who

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:53.800
go where people
beg them to go, who

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.830
are at the very, very
top of their profession,

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.290
and essentially spend
50% of their lives

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:01.520
on a jet flying
around the world.

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.400
So then, what I'm
suggesting is that we

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.620
can understand their
experiences in terms

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.410
of the different opportunity
structures they face,

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:11.140
different decision makings
they are able to make,

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:15.050
their primary goals, which are
all different, their persona.

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:18.640
So my argument is that the
Irish I met in New York

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:19.830
were the undocumented.

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:23.080
They didn't have
many rights, legally.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:27.040
That forced them into a strong,
kind of ethnic orientation,

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.740
and so they end up being
Tayto Crisp eaters.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:33.220
Whereas, people who go to
work in one of the big four

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.740
financial firms in
New York are going

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.410
to be sipping
Manhattans in Manhattan.

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:41.314
They're not going to be
out in Queens eating Tayto.

00:38:41.314 --> 00:38:42.730
And you can see
at the end, I just

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:45.910
said, the overall status
position for reserve army

00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:47.410
people-- it's precarious.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:49.270
And there's a lot of
research in sociology

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:53.350
now going on about the
precarious workplace, which

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:55.060
is actually growing.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.100
The global adventurers
are the hipsters.

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.620
And maybe there's a lot
of hipsters in this room.

00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.330
The cosmopolites are
the citizen-like people.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:05.050
These are the people that won't
be impacted by Brexit, that

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:09.100
are just above all of that,
that just are extremely

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.630
well-secured in their position.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:12.940
OK.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.960
I'm going to finish
up in just a second.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.460
OK.

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.250
So I wanted to make that point
about class and the migration

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:19.450
issue.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:21.760
I talked about the suburbs
as great places to live,

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.310
and people really sort of
connecting with each other

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:25.769
through things like the GAA.

00:39:25.769 --> 00:39:27.310
But I also would
like you to remember

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.230
that Dublin is one
of the most spatially

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:32.050
and socially segregated
cities in Europe.

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:35.980
We don't mix our social classes,
and we don't mix our housing

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.740
types in Ireland.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.990
Private home ownership
is glorified.

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:43.930
Anybody else who doesn't
own their own home

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:47.770
is somehow a failure, hasn't
got on the property ladder,

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:49.420
didn't do it right.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:53.240
People in Ireland do live in
either affluence or in poverty

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.230
and Tallaght West is
one example of that.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:57.280
Even with sport--

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.680
I emphasized the whole GAA
thing, the community thing--

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:03.250
but we know that sport
itself is class stratified.

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:05.170
And that certain
sports, rugby, are

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:08.410
associated with a particular
form of social class

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:11.830
reproduction through
private school education,

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:14.870
through having the right kind
of social networks, and so on.

00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:18.760
Whereas other sports like
boxing and martial arts,

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.800
like Conor McGregor,
traditionally

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.786
are really based in a
working-class male culture.

00:40:25.786 --> 00:40:27.910
The last example I talked
about were the allotments

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:29.260
and the urban agriculture.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.590
And to me, they do
have some potential

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:33.880
around this social integration.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.700
Because on allotments, as I
already mentioned in relation

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.400
to Northern Ireland,
people meet as strangers,

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.660
and they can remain so.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.520
There's no obligation
to get to know people,

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.144
to hang out with
them, to have anything

00:40:44.144 --> 00:40:46.810
to do with them beyond
the on-site cultivation

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:47.930
or activity.

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:50.260
So they fulfill a
very important role

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.300
associated with urban
public life, which

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:56.320
Richard Sennett has written
really eloquently about.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.680
That, we all need spaces that
are relatively open to all,

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:04.840
no cost of entry, where people
can congregate, communicate,

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.660
encounter each other
in fleeting exchanges,

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:10.480
and where there's just a
level of confidence and trust

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.940
that makes it work, but
doesn't mean that we ever

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.700
have to become anything but
sort of passing strangers

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:16.900
to each other.

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.340
And those spaces are important.

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.670
Because they do generate a
sense of subjective competence,

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:25.140
but also a sense of
collective belonging,

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.760
that we are connected to others.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.290
So I think they form part
of a public realm which

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:35.260
offers the potential
for intersection

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:38.470
points between different
class groupings.

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:42.069
And I've used allotments
as an example of that,

00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:44.110
and the allotments that
we've looked at in Dublin

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:46.600
definitely have lots of
eviden-- one of the things

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.130
that people described
the allotments

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:50.440
as is social levelers.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:51.880
Everybody's got their boots on.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.280
It doesn't matter who you
are, or where you come from,

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.320
we're all doing the same thing.

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.630
If you go to cycle one
of the fabulous greenways

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:01.870
around Ireland now, Waterford
or Westport, again, they're

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:05.245
spaces of social intersection--
all kinds of people on them,

00:42:05.245 --> 00:42:08.737
all kinds of bicycling, all
kinds of levels of fitness,

00:42:08.737 --> 00:42:09.820
and they all mix together.

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:11.930
If you go for a swim in
the Forty Foot, which

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:16.010
I do frequently, or in Seapoint,
you will meet all of human life

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:17.820
there, I guarantee you.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:23.090
So really, my final point is
to make an argument that we

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:25.520
believe in connection, that
we believe in connection

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.460
as something which
is about co-presence,

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:33.470
and that these kind of public
realm spaces that are open,

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:38.210
that are social-leveling
spaces, are very distinct from

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:40.970
privatized, policed spaces--

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:44.840
spaces like shopping malls,
like gated communities, or even

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.800
social media to some extent,
which is highly individualized

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.440
and where everyone is
heavily surveilled.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:55.970
So I'm arguing for the
promotion, creation,

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:59.930
and inhabiting the
public realm because I

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:03.290
think that is a way of pushing
back against the forces that

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:04.880
would divide us--

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.410
and we know what
those forces are--

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:09.890
and the forces that would
demonize the other in society.

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:11.390
Thanks very much
for your attention.

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:14.440
[APPLAUSE]
