Speaker 1:          00:00          Should someone always be detached? Okay. Straightforward question. The answer is no. Someone shouldn't always be detached cause otherwise you aren't enjoying anything in your life. So don't always be attached, detached. No. But at the same time, that being said, you should be aware all the time if you are getting sucked into the emotional vortex, right? You've got to be aware of that. Once you have that awareness, you don't need to be attached all the time at all. Yeah, you can. I'm not always detached at all, but, but I've got clear warning signs when things start going sideways and I started going down some vortex, I know immediately and I just attach. So it's really easy. It's, but it's, it does take practice and eventually you realize that you know when you're feeling overwhelmed, when you're feeling emotional and you're feeling angry or you're feeling frustrated, when you start feeling those things and you've sent them really quickly and you recognize them, you just attach, boom, you're done.

Speaker 1:          01:09          So that's what you've got to do. Start recognizing those red flags so that you can enjoy the good things. And when something starts getting crazy, you can detach. Yes. So it's like an overall skill of being able to control when to detach and when you don't have to. Being able to identify when you need to detach, then being able to detach then you're good. So it's like it's a matter of being capable of making an accurate, beneficial choice. Yes. But the identification is the hard part. Yes. People, what happens to people when they talk to me is they go the after the fact, they realize I lost my temper and I did this. Yeah. Okay. You didn't detach it in time and that's why you ended up there. Yeah. So or I said some things to my, you know, my ex girlfriend that I shouldn't have said cause I got to emotional.

Speaker 1:          01:59          Exactly. You didn't attach in time. You got crazy and emotional. So the skill that you're missing is identifying when you're starting to get too emotional, whatever that emotion might be. Once you identify it, boom, detach, take control, then you can take control. Yes. And make tactical moves, not emotional moves. That's ultimately the art, you know, to make the move. You know how like did you two guys, if they never actually know, you know what the moves, when you're emotionally detached, the moves actually aren't that hard. They're actually usually pretty obvious. Like you're, you're in a fight with your girlfriend and, and you're starting to go down the wrong lane. As soon as you detach, you go, oh, I know what I need to do. I should say I'm sorry and tell her that we can go to the restaurant that she wants to go to or whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:43          You know what I mean? The, the movers are not actually that hard, but we never make good moves when we're being emotional. Instead we just go, no, I don't want to go to that restaurant. We went there three weeks to go, I don't care if I said that to you. You deserve me to say that to you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That, that's a, you go down the wrong path. But what if like detached the whole time, even when problems don't arise, you know, like then we don't have a relationship. Right. That's what I mean. That's a problem. That's what I'm saying. [inaudible] all the time. That's what I'm, that's the answer to the question. Right? So it's like you've reiterated it for everyone. Yeah, man. That's what I'm here for. I think a lot of times you don't have guys will ask you, Hey, I want to learn Jujitsu.

Speaker 1:          03:17          I want to learn to mess people up. It's like, Bro, that's not really what it is. Did you get to, is having the skills to quote unquote mess people up? But what you learn ultimately is you put yourself in a position where you can make that decision. Is it time to mess someone up or not? You know? And you just have to control the situation. So that's really what most people that start with the vision. No, I want to build a mess people up. Most people continued that, that do continue on the journey of what you did to arrive at a point where they realize that they don't want to abuse this power that they now have. Most people, yeah, there's a small percentage of people that don't, that are bullies. They were bullies when they started and they become more effective. Bullies. Yeah. More fearful, more more fear in posing bullies, which sucks.

Speaker 1:          04:04          But you did see his power. That's why you got to have some of it. Yeah. Agree. But compare it to like a, I dunno anything where it's like striking based or whatever. It's like you, it like I've said this for, I'm not gonna go deep in it, but you go from zero to 10 when you throw a strike that's you're already at 10 you know, you can't just throw a light one and be like, okay, are we cool now? You know, kind of thing goes, not cool. Nope. You slapped me in the face man. Cool it all you brought it to 10 when he knocked him out or not. So because like I see, I see my kids and what you're talking about can happen very easily when other people are in the group with my kids. I mean, yeah cause they'd been training. Did you get too, so even like against any normal kid there is no factor.

Speaker 1:          04:48          Yeah. Like I see me and my son will be wrestling around with some kids. No factor. Yeah. And it's, you know, it's kind of cool. Yeah. Cool. It's real cool. Yeah. You know, my kids aren't like Jujitsu, like there's kids out there that are sick, competitive, Jujitsu all the time. Yeah. Right. Yeah. That's not what I'm talking about. Like just knowing Jujitsu a hundred percent correct. Yes. And, but when I see kids doing Jujitsu, especially like, I'm not saying in the necessarily, even in a tournament, I'm just saying in Jujitsu, in class, even at the beach or whatever, when I see them, I'm like, man, I wish I could have done Jujitsu when I was a little kid. You don't find that it'd be, yeah, man. Yeah. Make up for it now. Try it.
