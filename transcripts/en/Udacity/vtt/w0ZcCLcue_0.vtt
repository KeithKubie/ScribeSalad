00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
When we heard all of those different
languages what we were really hearing

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.460
was a communication system
that was specific to Homo Sapiens,

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.260
which is human language.
Human language is open and symbolic.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.750
It has rules of grammar that allows user
to express abstract and distant ideas.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.338
By open, we mean that the system
is dynamic, and it's free to change.

00:00:20.338 --> 00:00:23.166
In fact, we see changes
in language across time

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:27.622
when words take on new meanings.
Or new slang words appear. So in language,

00:00:27.622 --> 00:00:32.289
we have words which are put together
into specific rules of syntax and grammar.

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:36.110
So, grammar, then, is the entire
set of rules for combining symbols

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.625
and sounds to speak and write
a particular language.

00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:43.763
So, each language has its own
distinct sounds for saying things.

00:00:43.763 --> 00:00:46.041
Just as we saw in the beginning
of the lesson,

00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:49.805
when many of our Udacity friends said
a version of, I think, therefore I am.
