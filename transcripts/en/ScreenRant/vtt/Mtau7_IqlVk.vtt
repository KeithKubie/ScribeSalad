00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.130
Being an actor isn’t an easy gig.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.440
Imagine what it would be like to live in someone
else’s head for months at a time.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.510
Sure, they get paid well, but sometimes the
job takes it’s toll nonetheless.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.800
Here are 10 Famous Actors Who Broke Down On
Set.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.460
Jared Leto
Now that Suicide Squad has been released for

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.510
mass consumption, the shroud of secrecy over
Jared Leto’s Joker has been lifted.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.279
Although he featured heavily in the marketing,
the Joker somehow still remained a mystery.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.240
After hearing about the unconventional gifts
Leto sent to his cast mates, some people began

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.560
to wonder about the actor.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.680
Dead animals and used condoms were some of
the presents, and the recipients were less

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.090
than enthused.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.410
Co-star Margot Robbie went on the record saying
she was legitimately scared of the actor during

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.410
filming.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.600
And when you consider the research Leto did
in preparation for the character, he had no

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.760
reason to smile.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.711
Sir Ian McKellen
Sir Ian McKellen has been acting since the

00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:57.100
1960’s, and has over one hundred credits
to his name.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.830
Beginning with theatre, McKellen has honed
his craft over time and been cast in some

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.980
of Hollywood’s most legendary roles.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.310
But most audiences will recognize him from
his work as Gandalf, in the big screen adaptations

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.610
of J.R.R Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings
series.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.500
Beginning with the main trilogy from 2001-2003,
the actor reprised his role in the recent

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.930
prequel series The Hobbit.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.430
But a lot has changed between 2001 and now.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.380
And while the first movies were shot with
as many manual effects as possible, the filmmakers

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.220
opted for more CGI the second time ‘round.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.520
Realizing he was now performing alone on a
green-screened soundstage, the actor began

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.090
to weep, seemingly longing for the days when
acting was a team sport.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.141
Lawrence Tierney and Quentin Tarantino
Quentin Tarantino’s movies aren’t for

00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:40.141
everyone.

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:43.370
They’re usually violent, profanity-laden,
and propped up by a series of pop culture

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.370
monologues.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.141
Since Tarantino has been on the scene for
a couple of decades now, the director has

00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:50.219
established his style and amassed a hardcore
fanbase in the process.

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.329
But back when he was the new guy, the filmmaker
encountered a little too much resistance,

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.180
and ended up in a tussle with Hollywood legend
Lawrence Tierney.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.890
Apparently the actor didn’t trust that Tarantino
knew what he was doing, and the altercation

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.079
escalated into a full-on beatdown.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.860
This can of woop-ass was opened on the first
week of filming, and thankfully the two men

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.810
didn’t have to work together after that.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.070
Shelley Duvall
If you wanna make an omelette, you’ve gotta

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.430
crack a few eggs, right?

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.370
Well when Stanley Kubrick was working on The
Shining, he egg he cracked was one of his

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.370
leads.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.450
The director picked on Shelley Duvall so relentlessly,
that the actress had more than one breakdown

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.750
over the course of filming.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.670
Plus, Kubrick stopped anyone who tried to
intervene on her behalf.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.090
And claimed that it was all part of the process.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.319
While it’s hard to say how the movie would
look if everything was hunky dory during filming,

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.840
there’s an argument to be made about basic
human respect.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.159
But when the final product is artistically
stunning, that doesn’t seem to matter.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.120
Christian Bale
After the summer release of an all-female

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.940
Ghostbusters, the whole world is now familiar
with the concept of “blind rage”.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.650
But before we all became so enlightened, it
was still shocking to see such genuine anger

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.560
stem from trivial occurrences.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.769
When filming Terminator: Salvation in 2009,
the director of photography became the target

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.459
of Christian Bale’s ire after accidentally
distracting him between takes.

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.220
Bale is a serious actor with serious methods.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.680
And any crew member who doesn’t respect
that - accidentally or otherwise - is in for

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.950
a really loud, incredibly angry wake-up call.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.780
After the D.O.P got caught in the middle of
a verbal shit-storm, audio of the interaction

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.860
made it’s way to the internet.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.470
The actor apologized for his outburst, sort
of, and then moved on with his life.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.569
And since he’s not the kind of person we
want to piss off, we’re gonna move on now.

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.569
Sean Young
All things considered, it’s a miracle that

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.270
a movie like Blade Runner ever got made.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.650
Based on the book Do Androids Dream of Electric
Sheep? by Philip K. Dick, the film is an intense

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.650
one.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.430
The studio threatened to pull the movie’s
budget, and actually made good on their threat.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.000
Director Ridley Scott had to be persuaded
to take on the job.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.159
And after filming a scene where co-star Harrison
Ford gets a little too violent, actress Sean

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.650
Young called for a time out.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.500
Apparently, to ease the tension, Ford flashed
his buttcheeks around set and made everyone

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.500
giggle.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.860
Wesley Snipes
When Wesley Snipes showed up to make Blade:

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.510
Trinity, his attitude wasn’t great.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.210
And acted like a kid being forced back to
school after an awesome summer break.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.030
Snipes was snippy with director David Goyer
right from the get-go.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.549
And it didn’t take long for the two men
to come to blows.

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.620
Goyer showed up with some grizzly biker-looking
dudes the next day and Snipes allegedly took

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.120
to his trailer instantly.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.909
Chain-smoking pot, and communicating exclusively
through post-its, the actor went full teenager.

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.519
And pouted for the rest of the shoot.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.459
Jessica Chastain
Sometimes in order to tell a story, actors

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.230
have to put themselves in situations that
make them squeamish.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.350
The issue of using torture to gain information
is complex, and the subject of great debate.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.940
Talking about it is one thing, but having
it happen right in front of you is another.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.480
Jessica Chastain had to take a long break
after filming a waterboarding scene for 2012’s

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.660
Zero Dark Thirty.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.300
Even though it’s a highly-controlled environment
in reality, movies wouldn’t be movies if

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.480
they didn’t feel real.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.500
And for everyone on set that day, the mood
was an tense one.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.110
Martin Sheen
Anything that could go wrong, did go wrong

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.920
during the filming of Apocalypse Now.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.610
The movie was doomed from the start.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.710
Weather delays, wild animals, and sick cast
and crew all made for a horrible shoot.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.970
It’s no wonder Martin Sheen had a complete
emotional breakdown after getting wasted in

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:59.970
front of the camera.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.610
The hotel room scene is 100% real.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.980
The blood, the booze, the tears- all of it.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.530
The actor even suffered a heart attack at
another point.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.390
His character’s turmoil feels genuine.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.780
And unfortunately, that’s because it was.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.350
Daisy Ridley
Daisy Ridley went from being an unknown to

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.700
having a major Hollywood presence overnight.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.360
Thus is the power of the Star Wars franchise.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.260
The Force Awakens was a hugely successful
installment, and brought both hardcore and

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.300
brand new fans together.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.160
But on the first day of filming, Ridley wasn’t
sure how much longer she’d be sticking around.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.230
It turns out the actress was on the receiving
end of criticism from director JJ Abrams,

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.190
who thought her performance was “wooden”.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.290
In the big picture, that comment might seem
inconsequential.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.090
But if someone said that to you on your first
day, in front of dozens of people, you’d

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.630
probably take it pretty hard, too.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.630
So what do you think of our list.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.990
Did we miss any actors who broke down while
filming?
