00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.730
- [Instructor] A gym that
specializes in weight loss

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.090
offers its members an optional dietary

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.130
program for an extra fee.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.420
To study the effectiveness
of the dietary program,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.900
a manager at the gym takes a
random sample of 50 members

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.080
who participate in the dietary program

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.150
and 50 members who don't.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.500
The manager finds that
those who participated

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.070
in the dietary program, on average,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.730
lost significantly more weight

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.270
than those who didn't participate

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.030
in the program in the past three months.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.480
The manager concludes
that the dietary program

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.810
caused the increased weight loss

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.380
for the gym members
during that time period.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.410
So pause this video, and
see, and think about whether

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.450
you think the manager is
making a valid conclusion

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.453
based on this study.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.580
Alright, so let's first
just make sure we understand

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.410
what the manager is concluding.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.190
The manager is saying that
there is a causal relationship

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.590
between the dietary program,

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.420
that being on the dietary program

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.420
causes increased weight loss.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.290
And they would be able
to make this conclusion

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.360
if it's a well designed
experimental study.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.450
And you might say, well what does

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.290
an experimental study look like?

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.400
Well in an experimental study
you have a control group

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.280
that wouldn't have the dietary program,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.690
and then you would have a
treatment or experimental group

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.370
that does have the dietary program.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.660
And then you would see, hey if these folks

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.600
are actually seeing more weight loss,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.330
and if it's statistically significant

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.730
then maybe you can conclude
the causal relationship

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.250
that the dietary program
is causing the weight loss.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.680
And this kind of looks like
that, until you think about

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.640
how folks were assigned
to either of these groups.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.350
It would be a well
designed experimental study

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.460
if you took random samples
from the broader population,

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.490
so you took a random sample,
so that's our random sample

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.920
from the broader population.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.190
And then from this group
you randomly assigned folks

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.340
to either the control or the treatment.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.520
So you're randomly assigning,
and then the people

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.270
who happened to be in the treatment group,

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.490
not the people who chose to be in it.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.910
Well those people, you'd say,
you need to be on this diet

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.790
and you make sure that
they are on that diet.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.900
And then if you see a
statistically significant

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.490
increased weight loss then you might

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.180
be able to make this conclusion.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.490
But that's not what happened over here.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.400
In this situation, we
didn't randomly select

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.900
from the broader population
and then randomly assign

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.570
folks to these groups.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.490
What happened is people
self selected into either

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.630
being in the dietary program,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.700
or not being in the dietary program.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.090
I'll say, not the dietary program.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.960
And then what they did is
that they randomly sampled

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.970
from the dietary program to put them in,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.510
I guess you could say the treatment group

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.810
and then they randomly sampled
from this control group.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.370
And so in this situation
you have a significant

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.210
confounding variable, people
essentially self selected

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.600
themselves into the dietary program group.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.680
And that you could view
as a confounding variable,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.040
and so it doesn't allow you
to make this causal connection

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.460
because people who selected themselves

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.220
into the dietary program,

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.110
maybe they're more
motivated to lose weight.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.770
Maybe they can afford the money
and that wealth association

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.740
is associated with being
able to eat better,

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.920
and maybe being able to lose more weight.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.620
Now a conclusion that the
manager might be able to make

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.440
based on this study is that
there is an association

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.000
between participating
in the dietary program

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.210
and weight loss, but once again

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.153
you can't establish the causality.
