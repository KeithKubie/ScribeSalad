00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For this question, we're going to think about a table that, by the way, is a table.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
On this table we're going to put a giant spring.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here's the spring, uncompressed, not stretched, totally at equilibrium,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
totally boring, so let's compress it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The way we're going to do that is by squeezing it back a distance Î”x,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and by putting a little block here with mass m, of course.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Of course--I shouldn't even have to say it--this table is frictionless.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Of course, this table has some height h and the spring has some constant, some stiffness, k.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
When I squeeze this, if I let go what's going to happen?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The mass is going to fling forward and shoot off and land somewhere over here.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Your job for this question is to tell me what is this distance d.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now, you can't answer it yet. Let me give you some numbers.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The height of the table is 2 m. The mass is 1 kg.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Î”x is 25 cm--not meters.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The spring constant is 350 N/m.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
That should be enough information for you to tell me what is d.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
How far will this object fall from the table when it finally lands?

00:01:05.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You can enter your answer here in meters.
