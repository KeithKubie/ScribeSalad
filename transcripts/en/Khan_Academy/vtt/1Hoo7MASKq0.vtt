00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:02.495
Voiceover: These are some
questions that I'm going to

00:00:02.495 --> 00:00:05.003
answer for the Financial
Times that they may use in an

00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:07.584
article that they're going
to do about the Khan Academy.

00:00:07.584 --> 00:00:11.336
The first question; to what
do you attribute your ability

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:14.607
to effectively digest,
synthesize and teach such a

00:00:14.607 --> 00:00:17.418
wide variety of topics?

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:21.526
I guess the simple answer is
that I really enjoy doing that

00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:26.662
and I think by a set of
circumstances, either by

00:00:26.662 --> 00:00:29.978
maybe the way my brain works or maybe just

00:00:29.978 --> 00:00:31.835
circumstances or maybe
ways that I've been taught

00:00:31.835 --> 00:00:35.333
and I don't remember where
that might have come from.

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:39.893
I learned a long time ago that
there's two ways to get by

00:00:39.893 --> 00:00:42.604
in our system and actually
I'll say in our system or

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:45.868
maybe more broadly in society,
you can go and look at

00:00:45.868 --> 00:00:47.938
knowledge as something
where you're memorizing

00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:49.657
things or you're pattern
matching things or you can look

00:00:49.657 --> 00:00:51.622
at it as something to conceptually

00:00:51.622 --> 00:00:54.035
understand and digest and synthesize

00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:57.571
and I think I was fortunate
enough at an early age to

00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:00.475
be much better at the
digestion and the synthesis

00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:02.453
than the memorization
or the pattern matching.

00:01:02.453 --> 00:01:07.148
I actually think I have
quite a bad memory.

00:01:07.148 --> 00:01:11.689
That's how I think I was
able to do reasonably well

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.251
academically and then later
on it transferred over into

00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:21.006
actually contributing in my work life.

00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:22.201
I think there's a natural
high; I don't think

00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:23.882
I'm unique there. I don't
think there's a unique

00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:25.286
quirk to my personality.

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:29.075
I think when people really
do learn things it's one of

00:01:29.075 --> 00:01:29.938
those natural highs.

00:01:29.938 --> 00:01:32.003
It's one of those things that
differentiates human beings

00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:34.744
from most other animals is
that we really like learning.

00:01:34.744 --> 00:01:38.110
We really like understanding
and we really are

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.849
naturally curious.

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:43.940
It's actually maybe a little
bit sad that more people aren't

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.273
as excited about trying
to digest and synthesize

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:48.336
a wide variety of topics.

00:01:48.336 --> 00:01:50.673
Actually just to focus on the second part,

00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:53.156
a wide variety of topics,
what's interesting about that

00:01:53.156 --> 00:01:57.827
for me and I learned a lot
of this to some degree from

00:01:57.827 --> 00:02:01.155
my former jo working for
an investment fund and

00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:02.721
analyzing a bunch of
different companies and a

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:06.414
bunch of different
industries is the more topics

00:02:06.414 --> 00:02:09.412
you look at, the more that
you see that there are

00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:12.241
common underlying themes
and there more connections

00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:13.258
you're able to make.

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:15.610
The more you're able to
have a philisophy of how the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.627
world works.

00:02:16.627 --> 00:02:20.828
I actually think it builds
your understanding of

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:22.583
every field, the more
fields that you look at and

00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:23.910
you're able to see connections.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.405
If you just focus on one
field, it'll actually narrow

00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:31.100
your view even of that one field.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.606
The next question; where
does this polymathic mastery

00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:36.319
of such varied subjects come from?

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.485
There are plenty of intelligent
people who could study

00:02:37.485 --> 00:02:39.410
up on these subjects and
not be able to communicate

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.837
them so effectively.

00:02:42.407 --> 00:02:44.225
A similar answer as the
last; to some degree

00:02:44.225 --> 00:02:46.198
the same answer as the last.

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:50.403
I enjoy looking at things,
I enjoy learning things,

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:53.275
and I enjoy thinking.

00:02:53.275 --> 00:02:55.276
I like sitting on a park bench
just thinking about things

00:02:55.276 --> 00:02:56.669
and you need something to
think about and so that's why

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.404
I like studying different
topics and I like seeing where

00:02:59.404 --> 00:03:01.494
there might be parallels or
where there might be ah-ha

00:03:01.494 --> 00:03:03.673
moments or there might be
magical things about that

00:03:03.673 --> 00:03:05.269
subject that maybe
people didn't realize or

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.654
maybe emphasize properly.

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:11.403
The second part about not
being able to communicate,

00:03:11.403 --> 00:03:13.207
I agree there are plenty
of intelligent people who

00:03:13.207 --> 00:03:15.535
could study up on these subjects.

00:03:15.535 --> 00:03:17.536
The not being able to
communicate them effectively

00:03:17.536 --> 00:03:22.869
I think there are people
out there and I'm hoping

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.003
more and more of them do
decide to communicate them

00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:26.952
effectively and I'm hoping
we can find them and maybe

00:03:26.952 --> 00:03:29.950
they can even join the
Khan Academy faculty.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.606
I think the important that
a lot of people who do

00:03:32.606 --> 00:03:35.155
have subject matter expertise,
they sometimes have the

00:03:35.155 --> 00:03:41.019
difficulty of getting into
the mind of a learner.

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.985
I'll be frank, a lot of the
way I view the world is fairly;

00:03:43.985 --> 00:03:47.820
I think I have fairly simple
models in mind and I've

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.336
gotten good at taking
complex things and creating

00:03:49.336 --> 00:03:51.068
simple models in my own mind so that

00:03:51.068 --> 00:03:53.209
I can work with those models.

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.406
I think some people are
actually good at keeping

00:03:55.406 --> 00:03:56.827
complicated models in their mind.

00:03:56.827 --> 00:03:58.898
When you have a complicated
model in your mind,

00:03:58.898 --> 00:04:00.669
it's obviously much
harder to communicate them

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.480
because it's complicated,
but I think most of those

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.716
models can be distilled down
to a more simple and more

00:04:05.716 --> 00:04:08.072
elegant ways of thinking about things.

00:04:08.072 --> 00:04:10.335
Next question; were you
always drawn to such a

00:04:10.335 --> 00:04:12.218
variety of subjects, how do
you maintain your curiosity,

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:14.298
is there anything that
strikes you as too dry to

00:04:14.298 --> 00:04:16.269
learn and teach?

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.002
Once again, yes, I was always drawn -

00:04:19.002 --> 00:04:21.228
Well you know, actually
I'll take that back.

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:24.364
Early in my life there were
two things that I really liked.

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:28.940
I really liked art and
drawing and painting when I

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.140
was very early on.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.537
When I was actually in
school, people viewed me as

00:04:32.537 --> 00:04:34.406
the art guy, the guy who
would draw pictures and

00:04:34.406 --> 00:04:37.069
cartoons and stuff like that

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:38.947
and I really mathematics.

00:04:38.947 --> 00:04:41.276
What I didn't enjoy in my
earliest schooling is I

00:04:41.276 --> 00:04:43.473
wasn't a big fan of reading
and I wasn't a big fan of

00:04:43.473 --> 00:04:46.733
writing in my early school
and I viewed those things

00:04:46.733 --> 00:04:48.853
that I just wasn't good at.

00:04:48.853 --> 00:04:51.269
Sometimes when I used to
read, I would just sit and

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:53.407
fixate on one sentence and
have to read it over and

00:04:53.407 --> 00:04:54.654
over and over again and it would take me

00:04:54.654 --> 00:04:56.578
forever to read a page.

00:04:56.578 --> 00:04:59.779
It was something that
actually frustrated me a lot.

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:03.533
It wasn't until later that
I kind of, I don't know,

00:05:03.533 --> 00:05:05.464
to some degree destressed
how I viewed those some of

00:05:05.464 --> 00:05:07.760
those things and I let
myself explore things

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.748
without the stress of
judging myself or having

00:05:09.748 --> 00:05:12.691
other people judge me that
I started realizing wow,

00:05:12.691 --> 00:05:13.953
I actually do like reading and

00:05:13.953 --> 00:05:16.548
I actually do like writing,
this is a form of communication

00:05:16.548 --> 00:05:18.738
and I love just thinking
analytically about how do

00:05:18.738 --> 00:05:20.275
you make an argument.

00:05:20.275 --> 00:05:24.910
I think the underlying lesson
there is when you thought

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.669
you didn't like something
and then you learned that

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.941
not only do you not not
like it but you actually

00:05:28.941 --> 00:05:33.704
like it, you're like well maybe
I'm prejudging everything.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.604
The second part of this
question, is there anything

00:05:35.604 --> 00:05:39.936
that strikes you as too
dry to learn and teach, no.

00:05:39.936 --> 00:05:41.141
There's nothing.

00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:43.821
There's things that right
now I perceive as dry,

00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:47.072
but my gut feeling tells me
that it's just the way it has

00:05:47.072 --> 00:05:49.228
been taught or marketed to the world

00:05:49.228 --> 00:05:51.230
that people make it dry.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.004
One of my big discoveries is even

00:05:53.004 --> 00:05:53.995
something like accounting.

00:05:53.995 --> 00:05:55.494
You tell someone accounting
and they think it's this

00:05:55.494 --> 00:05:57.667
dry subject, but I remember
when I went to business

00:05:57.667 --> 00:06:00.075
school, kind of this big
ah-ha moment was this is a

00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:01.269
really fascinating subject.

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:02.669
It isn't just about bean counting.

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.007
It isn't just about bookkeeping.

00:06:06.007 --> 00:06:10.342
It's about using symbols
and numbers to reflect a

00:06:10.342 --> 00:06:13.407
certain reality of what this
business or this process

00:06:13.407 --> 00:06:15.574
is actually doing.

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:16.608
When a lot of people hear that,
they still might say well,

00:06:16.608 --> 00:06:19.718
that's not that, but trust me,

00:06:19.718 --> 00:06:21.366
it can be very interesting.

00:06:21.366 --> 00:06:23.403
In fact, this whole financial
crisis is driven people's

00:06:23.403 --> 00:06:27.575
different philosophies or
understanding of accounting.

00:06:27.575 --> 00:06:32.863
I think my philosophy and I
haven't had a topic yet that

00:06:32.863 --> 00:06:35.876
has disproven this philosophy
is that what's dry is

00:06:35.876 --> 00:06:38.789
how the topic is presented,
not the topic itself.

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.804
Really almost any topic
can be very intellectually

00:06:42.804 --> 00:06:46.403
interesting if it's
looked at the right way.

00:06:46.403 --> 00:06:49.070
What do you do for fun? What do you read?

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.956
What movies, films and arts do you enjoy

00:06:50.956 --> 00:06:53.542
during your free time?

00:06:53.542 --> 00:06:54.939
One could get the
impression that Khan Academy

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:56.669
is all you do.

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:59.406
In terms of fun and this
answer has changed a lot

00:06:59.406 --> 00:07:04.214
over the last three years
since having children,

00:07:04.214 --> 00:07:07.720
so my time is limited now
and I can't do all of the

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.603
stuff that I used to like to do.

00:07:09.603 --> 00:07:11.343
One of the things that I used
to like to do when it was

00:07:11.343 --> 00:07:13.007
just me and my wife or
even before I was married,

00:07:13.007 --> 00:07:16.269
I liked the outdoors a lot.

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:17.069
I liked to go hiking.

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:19.150
It's something I hope to
do with my children soon,

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.074
but they're a little too
young to go hiking or

00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:24.939
camping just yet, but that
is one of the things I really

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:29.603
liked doing, just outdoors things.

00:07:29.603 --> 00:07:38.157
I'm a hobbyist guitarist and
painter and I don't claim

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:40.866
at all to be good at those
thing, but they are things

00:07:40.866 --> 00:07:42.340
that I like to do for fun.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.669
They're a form of creative expression.

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:51.007
In terms of what do I
read, I read a lot of

00:07:51.007 --> 00:07:54.120
science fiction which may
not surprise a lot of people,

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.489
so a lot of science fiction
and frankly I also like to

00:07:57.489 --> 00:08:01.298
revisit a lot of the books
that I was forced to read,

00:08:01.298 --> 00:08:03.669
so to speak, in high school and college.

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:05.273
When I revisit them and
I'm reading them for fun,

00:08:05.273 --> 00:08:07.336
I'm starting to really enjoy them.

00:08:07.336 --> 00:08:09.330
Frankly, I read a lot
of science fiction and

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.235
I read a lot of the classics
for fun and I've found

00:08:12.235 --> 00:08:14.736
that they take on a new light.

00:08:14.736 --> 00:08:16.401
One, when you read them for
fun, you're a little older

00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:20.593
now and you have a little
bit more perspective on life.

00:08:20.593 --> 00:08:21.800
Although hopefully, I have a lot more

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.672
perspective to get.

00:08:23.672 --> 00:08:26.819
Science fiction, they're fun.

00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:28.662
They're fun by themselves,
they tend to be good stories,

00:08:28.662 --> 00:08:32.153
but they kind of expand
your mind and really

00:08:32.153 --> 00:08:33.991
make you think.

00:08:33.991 --> 00:08:36.075
A lot of things that we take
for granted in our society,

00:08:36.075 --> 00:08:38.484
science fiction books are
really good at exposing them

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:41.038
as somewhat arbitrary and
that there are other ways to

00:08:41.038 --> 00:08:43.003
do things and I think there really are.

00:08:43.003 --> 00:08:44.962
They are some of the
best things you can read

00:08:44.962 --> 00:08:48.341
to expand your view of what is possible.

00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:49.340
What movies, films and arts do you enjoy

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.610
during your free time?

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:57.574
Once again, I love science
fiction and I love epic

00:08:57.574 --> 00:09:02.409
things generally, whether
it's Braveheart or

00:09:02.409 --> 00:09:05.330
Lord of the Rings or the Godfather movies.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.200
I don't think I'm alone in
liking those types of things,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.206
but my wife every now and
then gets me to watch an

00:09:12.206 --> 00:09:15.857
episode of Felicity on
Netflix and I enjoy that too

00:09:15.857 --> 00:09:19.003
which is a little bit embarrassing.

00:09:19.003 --> 00:09:20.339
One could the impression that Khan Academy

00:09:20.339 --> 00:09:21.080
is all you do.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.783
Well, it's a lot of what I do now,

00:09:22.783 --> 00:09:24.624
especially with children I think.

00:09:24.624 --> 00:09:26.739
I try to during the day,

00:09:26.739 --> 00:09:28.536
focus on Khan Academy,
in the evening focus on

00:09:28.536 --> 00:09:32.562
wife and children, but
within that context I try to

00:09:32.562 --> 00:09:34.737
at least to have one good
book to read while I'm

00:09:34.737 --> 00:09:38.336
travelling or maybe
right before I go to bed.

00:09:38.336 --> 00:09:39.866
Now that my kids are getting
a little older I'm getting

00:09:39.866 --> 00:09:41.808
a little bit more time to
go back to a little bit of

00:09:41.808 --> 00:09:44.200
the outdoor stuff and a little bit of the

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.531
creative projects.

00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:48.054
What do you want Khan Academy

00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:49.606
curriculum to encompass?

00:09:49.606 --> 00:09:51.146
Is it K-12 basics on
math and science or is it

00:09:51.146 --> 00:09:52.485
broader than that?

00:09:52.485 --> 00:09:54.724
Will it ever be complete?

00:09:54.724 --> 00:09:57.376
The second answer is easy to answer; no.

00:09:57.376 --> 00:09:59.071
It will never be complete.

00:09:59.071 --> 00:10:01.609
I think there's an infinite
number of topics to cover and

00:10:01.609 --> 00:10:03.685
I think we can always
improve on what's covered

00:10:03.685 --> 00:10:05.870
and we can always attack
it from a different angle.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.072
I don't think it will ever be complete.

00:10:08.072 --> 00:10:10.225
It isn't just K-12 basics.

00:10:10.225 --> 00:10:13.476
In fact, even now it
isn't just K-12 basics.

00:10:13.476 --> 00:10:16.987
There's a lot of content
about college level material,

00:10:16.987 --> 00:10:18.737
even graduate level material.

00:10:18.737 --> 00:10:21.561
There's stuff about economics
and finance and we've

00:10:21.561 --> 00:10:24.873
just brought on two
art history professors.

00:10:24.873 --> 00:10:27.228
They're the new first
editions to the Khan Academy

00:10:27.228 --> 00:10:29.974
faculty and they're doing
art history really at an

00:10:29.974 --> 00:10:33.942
advanced level and we're
starting to do some videos

00:10:33.942 --> 00:10:37.030
with professors at
Stanford medical school and

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.852
other places where we're
attacking even medical stuff.

00:10:39.852 --> 00:10:42.948
There's no end and we
really want it to encompass

00:10:42.948 --> 00:10:48.075
everything that helps people
form a view of the world

00:10:48.075 --> 00:10:50.782
and understand the world
around them and become

00:10:50.782 --> 00:10:54.928
productive and happy and people
with rich lives, I guess.

00:10:54.928 --> 00:10:56.667
So it's pretty much everything. (laughs)

00:10:56.667 --> 00:10:58.692
Next question; as Khan
Academy continues to find a

00:10:58.692 --> 00:11:00.736
larger audience, do you
have any concerns about a

00:11:00.736 --> 00:11:03.400
growing number of students
learning from one source?

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.136
Is there a risk of having
a uniformity of primary

00:11:05.136 --> 00:11:07.472
materials for students?

00:11:07.472 --> 00:11:10.026
We think about this issue
and this is why we are

00:11:10.026 --> 00:11:12.472
expanding the faculty and
there's actually going to be

00:11:12.472 --> 00:11:14.538
someone who joins also
on the math side and she

00:11:14.538 --> 00:11:17.336
teaches things with slightly
different view, although,

00:11:17.336 --> 00:11:20.869
I think we have similar sensibilities.

00:11:20.869 --> 00:11:23.400
Our goal is to iterate and
we're actually starting to

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.961
get more analytical about
what makes a video good.

00:11:26.961 --> 00:11:28.538
If someone makes another
good video on something or

00:11:28.538 --> 00:11:30.780
there's another way to view
things, we hope to include

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.030
those in the library.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.866
We don't think we'll have a
million different teachers, but

00:11:33.866 --> 00:11:35.870
we think on a topic you
might have two or three

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.701
different view points on something.

00:11:37.701 --> 00:11:39.283
We think that's good.

00:11:39.283 --> 00:11:41.523
We're also starting to
introduce across the board

00:11:41.523 --> 00:11:43.000
and we've done this with
the medicine videos and some

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.873
of the economics videos
is we're starting to have

00:11:44.873 --> 00:11:46.272
conversations in our videos.

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:48.610
This is what the two art
historians do, Beth Harris

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.469
and Steven Zucker.

00:11:49.469 --> 00:11:51.736
They have art conversations,
so it's them two talking

00:11:51.736 --> 00:11:54.208
about a piece of art or
me and a professor talking

00:11:54.208 --> 00:11:56.272
about some scientific phenomenon.

00:11:56.272 --> 00:11:58.026
You're really getting a
conversation and seeing that

00:11:58.026 --> 00:11:59.550
there's two sides to it.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.736
Frankly, I think it's better.

00:12:02.736 --> 00:12:04.878
You can go to a university that has many

00:12:04.878 --> 00:12:07.376
professors, but when you take
intro to American History,

00:12:07.376 --> 00:12:08.804
you get only one source.

00:12:08.804 --> 00:12:11.326
You're getting that one
professor or there is only one

00:12:11.326 --> 00:12:14.207
textbook right now that
dominates each field.

00:12:14.207 --> 00:12:18.137
We actually think we can
provide more voices than what

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:19.804
is traditionally provided.

00:12:19.804 --> 00:12:21.706
The powerful thing about
the internet now is I don't

00:12:21.706 --> 00:12:24.647
think anyone can capitalize
as one voice and if anyone

00:12:24.647 --> 00:12:27.078
did, especially if that was
bad quality, they would lose

00:12:27.078 --> 00:12:31.206
because the internet gets
rid of all intermediaries.

00:12:31.206 --> 00:12:32.547
There's no gate keepers anymore.

00:12:32.547 --> 00:12:35.141
It's not like we're a publishing
firm 50 years ago where

00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:37.474
only what's published
is what people get at.

00:12:37.474 --> 00:12:39.672
Now people can get anything
anywhere and frankly,

00:12:39.672 --> 00:12:42.604
anyone can do what I did
over You Tube and people are

00:12:42.604 --> 00:12:45.291
and I think that's a really
healthy thing that you can

00:12:45.291 --> 00:12:48.406
always get the other points of view.

00:12:48.406 --> 00:12:54.009
Next question; why are
you focusing on education?

00:12:54.009 --> 00:12:56.672
I guess the simple answer
is, well I guess this may be

00:12:56.672 --> 00:12:59.468
all together are you concerned
about public education.

00:12:59.468 --> 00:13:06.405
Regardless of whether we're
all professional educators,

00:13:06.405 --> 00:13:09.160
we've all spent significant time in the

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.537
education system.

00:13:10.537 --> 00:13:12.066
I'm no exception.

00:13:12.066 --> 00:13:14.269
I did just have a nagging
feeling while I went through

00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:16.669
it that there's got to be
a better way to do this.

00:13:16.669 --> 00:13:18.169
I saw how many students
were just pattern matching,

00:13:18.169 --> 00:13:20.006
how many were memorizing,
how little retention people

00:13:20.006 --> 00:13:24.059
have, how many resources
people have, and still not

00:13:24.059 --> 00:13:25.943
coming out on the other
side having done creative

00:13:25.943 --> 00:13:30.231
things and really
stretched their thinking.

00:13:30.231 --> 00:13:32.653
It seems like we're at an
inflection point in history

00:13:32.653 --> 00:13:36.803
and this is the information
revolution and it's crazy

00:13:36.803 --> 00:13:42.385
that almost every other field
is getting revolutionized

00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:43.542
except for education.

00:13:43.542 --> 00:13:46.135
I think it's just right
for it and just answering

00:13:46.135 --> 00:13:47.984
some of those early
questions about my interests,

00:13:47.984 --> 00:13:48.982
it's what I love doing.

00:13:48.982 --> 00:13:52.339
I entered the investment
world because I loved learning

00:13:52.339 --> 00:13:53.603
about different issues.

00:13:53.603 --> 00:13:56.005
I loved talking to an
ag producer one hour and

00:13:56.005 --> 00:13:57.273
talking to a railroad
company the next hour and

00:13:57.273 --> 00:13:58.543
talking to a software
company the next hour and

00:13:58.543 --> 00:14:01.669
talking to a natural gas
pipeline owner the next hour

00:14:01.669 --> 00:14:03.553
because you'd learn how the world works.

00:14:03.553 --> 00:14:07.287
That's what education is,
learning how the world works,

00:14:07.287 --> 00:14:10.979
learning ways of thinking.

00:14:10.979 --> 00:14:12.809
Sometimes with the goal
of becoming a productive,

00:14:12.809 --> 00:14:17.482
happy member of society with a rich life.

00:14:17.482 --> 00:14:18.980
I can't imagine anything
better to focus on I guess

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.672
is a simple answer.

00:14:20.672 --> 00:14:25.342
It's something that's
interesting to me personally,

00:14:25.342 --> 00:14:29.144
but obviously it can scale
now and it has ripple effects

00:14:29.144 --> 00:14:32.152
that can go on not just
for a few years, it can go

00:14:32.152 --> 00:14:33.480
on for generations.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.945
It's one of these epic
ideas and I already told you

00:14:36.945 --> 00:14:39.268
I like epic things.

00:14:39.268 --> 00:14:40.910
Are you concerned about the
state of public education

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.008
in the US?

00:14:42.008 --> 00:14:43.348
I'm concerned about the state of

00:14:43.348 --> 00:14:44.689
public education everywhere.

00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:47.539
In fact, I'll say I'm
concerned about the state of

00:14:47.539 --> 00:14:51.806
education everywhere.

00:14:51.806 --> 00:14:55.414
Franky, people dump on
the public schools a lot,

00:14:55.414 --> 00:14:57.870
but I don't think the private
schools are much better.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.140
They're selecting for
students who would probably

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.613
do well if you gave them a
textbook and who come from

00:15:03.613 --> 00:15:06.002
college educated families
who are wealthy, who can

00:15:06.002 --> 00:15:07.469
afford private tutors.

00:15:07.469 --> 00:15:09.617
They charge them out here in the Bay area

00:15:09.617 --> 00:15:12.021
$30,000 a year.

00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:14.028
I don't know what they're
doing with those resources

00:15:14.028 --> 00:15:16.694
and I don't see substantially
different results from

00:15:16.694 --> 00:15:20.403
private schools charging
$30,000 a year to the public

00:15:20.403 --> 00:15:22.806
schools that are serving
the same demographic.

00:15:22.806 --> 00:15:24.025
They seem to be about
the same or some of those

00:15:24.025 --> 00:15:26.141
public schools are even better.

00:15:26.141 --> 00:15:27.945
I actually think the whole
model and it's even true

00:15:27.945 --> 00:15:31.402
of...People talk about our
university system as the

00:15:31.402 --> 00:15:32.872
best thing out.

00:15:32.872 --> 00:15:34.275
They do good research.

00:15:34.275 --> 00:15:35.400
That's why they're famous.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.652
That's why they are but in
terms of how they're teaching,

00:15:38.652 --> 00:15:42.832
there's nothing that I
find particularly ground

00:15:42.832 --> 00:15:47.540
breaking or something that
you can't improve upon.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.692
I think there's a lot that can be done.

00:15:49.692 --> 00:15:53.129
I'm actually concerned
about the general state of,

00:15:53.129 --> 00:15:54.440
actually when you say
education, I'm concerned about

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:59.689
the general state of
people's learning in life,

00:15:59.689 --> 00:16:03.203
irrespective of what the
education system if doing.

00:16:03.203 --> 00:16:05.273
What are your thoughts on
the importance of primary

00:16:05.273 --> 00:16:06.791
education as a means to a productive

00:16:06.791 --> 00:16:10.438
and prosperous society?

00:16:10.438 --> 00:16:11.606
That's what it's all about.

00:16:11.606 --> 00:16:15.771
If you don't have that
primary education, there's no

00:16:15.771 --> 00:16:17.695
way to have a productive
and prosperous society.

00:16:17.695 --> 00:16:21.970
You need basic security, you
need basic infrastructure

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:24.545
and you need an educated population.

00:16:24.545 --> 00:16:27.731
It's now true more than ever.

00:16:27.731 --> 00:16:31.941
Back in the old days,
there were jobs where just

00:16:31.941 --> 00:16:35.336
raw labor was relevant,
but with technology that

00:16:35.336 --> 00:16:37.943
becomes less and less relevant every day.

00:16:37.943 --> 00:16:41.133
In order for people to be
productive and to contribute

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:44.273
and to feel needed, they really have to

00:16:44.273 --> 00:16:47.136
step up the chain.

00:16:47.136 --> 00:16:48.779
Raw labor is needed
less and less because of

00:16:48.779 --> 00:16:51.332
mechanical technology and because of

00:16:51.332 --> 00:16:53.885
informational technology.

00:16:53.885 --> 00:16:56.006
Processed oriented white collar work

00:16:56.006 --> 00:16:57.358
is also going to go away.

00:16:57.358 --> 00:16:59.112
It's just going to push
everyone, the really

00:16:59.112 --> 00:17:02.619
needed jobs are the highly creative ones.

00:17:02.619 --> 00:17:04.934
It's not good enough
just to teach people some

00:17:04.934 --> 00:17:08.269
process or some formula
or some pattern matching.

00:17:08.269 --> 00:17:09.663
We have to teach them to be creative,

00:17:09.678 --> 00:17:11.473
we have to teach them to innovate,

00:17:11.473 --> 00:17:15.269
to problem solve things that
they've never seen before.

00:17:15.269 --> 00:17:18.796
Yes, I think it's not just an ingredient.

00:17:18.796 --> 00:17:20.776
It's actually the foundation
of having a productive and

00:17:20.776 --> 00:17:22.499
prosperous society.

00:17:22.499 --> 00:17:25.075
Last question; is it your
hope that Khan Academy can

00:17:25.075 --> 00:17:26.870
help reverse some of the
losses we have suffered

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:29.359
in the quality of public schooling?

00:17:29.359 --> 00:17:31.867
Just going to the previous
education, I don't think

00:17:31.867 --> 00:17:33.405
it's about public schooling
or private schooling or

00:17:33.405 --> 00:17:35.947
primary or secondary education.

00:17:35.947 --> 00:17:42.195
I hope it can help elevate
the state of knowledge

00:17:42.195 --> 00:17:45.613
or learning generally
and I won't make any bold

00:17:45.613 --> 00:17:47.783
claim that we've solved
the problem yet or we're

00:17:47.783 --> 00:17:49.862
anywhere close to it, but I
think what's exciting about

00:17:49.862 --> 00:17:53.073
Khan Academy is that we
have a lot of traction and

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:55.472
we're trying to be as
thoughtful about improving

00:17:55.472 --> 00:17:57.610
on what we have.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.136
You combine the traction
with our ability to iterate,

00:18:00.136 --> 00:18:02.803
move quickly and improve and
hopefully in a thoughtful

00:18:02.803 --> 00:18:05.406
way and we can only get better.

00:18:05.406 --> 00:18:06.831
I think we're really just
in the top of the first

00:18:06.831 --> 00:18:09.266
inning and there's a long
way to go here, but I'm

00:18:09.266 --> 00:18:12.514
hoping that it can
improve the state of how

00:18:12.514 --> 00:18:15.000
people learn generally.
