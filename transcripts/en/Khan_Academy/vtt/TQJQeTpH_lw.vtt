00:00:00.838 --> 00:00:02.973
Voiceover:One rainy Saturday morning,

00:00:02.973 --> 00:00:06.165
Adam woke up to hear his mom complaining

00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:07.811
about the house being dirty.

00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:10.789
"Mom is always grouchy when it rains,"

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.949
Adam's brother said to him.

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:14.982
So Adam decided to figure out

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:17.214
if this statement was actually true.

00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:18.261
For the next year,

00:00:18.261 --> 00:00:20.163
he charted every time it rained

00:00:20.163 --> 00:00:22.316
and every time his mom was grouchy.

00:00:22.316 --> 00:00:24.164
What he found was very interesting.

00:00:24.164 --> 00:00:26.483
Rainy days and his mom being grouchy

00:00:26.483 --> 00:00:29.611
were entirely independent events.

00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:32.154
Some of his data are
shown in the table below.

00:00:32.154 --> 00:00:35.139
Fill in the missing values
from the frequency table.

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:39.945
Let's see, we have raining
days and not raining days

00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:42.330
and the total days that
he kept the data for.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.751
And then he tabulated on or let's say,

00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:45.168
the raining days whether his mom

00:00:45.168 --> 00:00:46.720
was grouchy or not grouchy.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.447
And on a not raining day whether his mom

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:51.191
was grouchy or not grouchy.

00:00:51.191 --> 00:00:53.248
And there's a total of 35 days it rained,

00:00:53.248 --> 00:00:56.119
330 days that it didn't rain.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:02.052
And then 73 times his mom was grouchy

00:01:02.052 --> 00:01:06.400
and 292 times his mom was not grouchy.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.625
So the first thing is how
do we figure this out?

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:10.256
We have these 4 boxes here.

00:01:10.256 --> 00:01:12.383
It's not clear that we can just...

00:01:12.383 --> 00:01:15.120
we have enough information to fill it out

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.448
just with this table.

00:01:16.448 --> 00:01:18.232
But we have to remember what they told us.

00:01:18.232 --> 00:01:21.283
They told us that his mom being grouchy

00:01:21.283 --> 00:01:26.113
and it raining were
entirely independent events.

00:01:26.113 --> 00:01:29.937
Another way of saying that
is the probability of his...

00:01:29.937 --> 00:01:31.999
Let me do this in color that
you're more likely to see.

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:33.239
Another way of saying that...

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:34.304
So independent events,

00:01:34.304 --> 00:01:36.295
that means that the probability...

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:38.230
My pen is acting up a little bit.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.119
Probability that mom is grouchy.

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:40.832
So let me write that.

00:01:40.832 --> 00:01:41.743
Mom...

00:01:41.743 --> 00:01:42.544
My pen is really...

00:01:42.544 --> 00:01:54.347
Mom is grouchy given it is raining.

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:56.715
It shouldn't really matter
whether it's raining.

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:59.106
It should just be the same
thing as the probability

00:01:59.106 --> 00:02:08.100
of mom being grouchy in general.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.195
So what does that tell us?

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.131
Well we can figure out the probability

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:13.443
that mom is grouchy in general.

00:02:13.443 --> 00:02:17.507
She's grouchy 73 out of 365 days.

00:02:17.507 --> 00:02:21.173
So the probability that
mom is grouchy in general

00:02:21.173 --> 00:02:31.355
is going to be 73 divided by 365.

00:02:31.913 --> 00:02:33.492
And so [are these] just
based on the data we have.

00:02:33.492 --> 00:02:36.145
That's the best estimate
that mom is grouchy.

00:02:36.145 --> 00:02:37.923
The probability that mom is grouchy.

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:40.705
It's the percentage of days
that she's been grouchy.

00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:42.888
So that is .2.

00:02:42.888 --> 00:02:45.664
So based on the data,

00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:47.025
the best estimate of the probability

00:02:47.025 --> 00:02:52.824
of mom being grouchy is .2 or 20%.

00:02:52.824 --> 00:02:54.680
And so we should have the probability

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.912
of mom being grouchy
given that it's raining

00:02:56.912 --> 00:02:58.849
should be 20% as well.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:59.761
So this number...

00:02:59.761 --> 00:03:01.024
So given that it's raining,

00:03:01.024 --> 00:03:03.080
we should also have 20% of the time,

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.250
mom is grouchy because

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.297
these are independent events.

00:03:05.297 --> 00:03:06.649
It shouldn't matter whether
it's raining or not.

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:07.970
This should be 20%...

00:03:10.507 --> 00:03:13.667
She should be grouchy 20%
of time that it's raining

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:15.508
and she should be grouchy 20% of the time

00:03:15.508 --> 00:03:16.779
that it's not raining.

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.960
That's what would be
consistent with the data

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.735
saying that these were
entirely independent events.

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:25.057
So what is 20% of 35?

00:03:25.057 --> 00:03:26.919
Well 20% is 1/5th.

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.260
1/5th of 35 is 7.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.255
And once again,

00:03:31.255 --> 00:03:33.919
all I did is I said 20% of 35 is 7.

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:38.591
And if that's 7 then 35 minus 7.

00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:41.735
That's gonna be 28 right over there.

00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:44.111
And then if this is 7,

00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:51.535
then 73 minus 7 is going to be 66.

00:03:51.535 --> 00:03:54.518
And 330...

00:03:54.518 --> 00:03:56.095
I guess there's a couple
of way we could do it.

00:03:56.095 --> 00:03:56.870
We could take...

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.270
Actually we could just take 292 minus 28

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.663
is going to be...

00:04:03.663 --> 00:04:07.727
Let's see 292 minus 8 would be 284.

00:04:07.727 --> 00:04:11.192
Minus another 20, 264.

00:04:11.445 --> 00:04:12.285
And do the numbers all add up?

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:12.828
Yes.

00:04:12.828 --> 00:04:17.349
66 plus 264 is 330.

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.133
So the key realization here is

00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:21.254
what he's saying he found
was very interesting.

00:04:21.254 --> 00:04:22.941
Rainy days and his mom being grouchy

00:04:22.941 --> 00:04:25.324
were entirely independent events.

00:04:25.324 --> 00:04:26.652
That means that the probability

00:04:26.652 --> 00:04:28.580
of his mom being grouchy...

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.389
It shouldn't matter whether
it's raining or not.

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:31.420
It should just be...

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.116
It should be the same probability

00:04:33.116 --> 00:04:34.557
of whether it's raining or not.

00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:36.316
And our best estimate of the probability

00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:38.077
of his mom being grouchy is

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:40.212
on the total days, is 20%.

00:04:40.212 --> 00:04:41.661
And so if the data's backing up

00:04:41.661 --> 00:04:43.157
that it's independent events

00:04:43.157 --> 00:04:45.229
then the best way to
fill this out would be

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.509
the probability of his mom being grouchy

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.004
on a rainy day or not rainy
day should be the same.

00:04:52.004 --> 00:04:55.148
And that's what we filled
out right over here.
