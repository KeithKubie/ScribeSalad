00:00:00.674 --> 00:00:02.520
- [Voiceover] The landscape
artist who designed

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.457
New York City's Central
Park believed that providing

00:00:05.457 --> 00:00:08.916
scenic settings accessible
to all would not only

00:00:08.916 --> 00:00:11.994
benefit the public's
physical and mental health

00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:16.357
and also foster a sense of democracy.

00:00:16.357 --> 00:00:19.283
So immediately this one sounds weird,

00:00:19.283 --> 00:00:21.773
and the reason why it sounds weird is that

00:00:21.773 --> 00:00:25.529
we start saying, "not
only," and when you hear

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.321
a not only or when you read a not only,

00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:30.207
you expect to see a but also.

00:00:30.207 --> 00:00:32.121
So you would normally
expect to see someone say,

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:37.121
"Hey, I not only," say, "ate a sandwich,

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:42.622
"but I also," or "but also.."

00:00:42.622 --> 00:00:46.812
Not only did he eat a
sandwich but also he ate a...

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:50.381
Or he drank a cola, or he had some fries.

00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:51.875
Or, but he also.

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:55.278
So you would expect a but also as part

00:00:55.278 --> 00:00:58.016
of that construction, and we see over here

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:00.832
they do an and also.

00:01:00.832 --> 00:01:03.360
So I don't like it as it is,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.663
so I'm gonna rule out the first choice.

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:06.525
That's always the one as it is.

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:08.133
So do they have a but also here?

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.094
And they do.

00:01:09.094 --> 00:01:11.351
But also foster a sense of democracy.

00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:12.539
So really the right one...

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.763
Because whenever you see a not only

00:01:14.763 --> 00:01:17.468
you also want to see a but also.

00:01:17.468 --> 00:01:19.685
So the landscape artist who designed

00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:22.483
New York City's Central
Park believed that providing

00:01:22.483 --> 00:01:26.074
scenic settings accessible
to all would not only

00:01:26.074 --> 00:01:29.181
benefit the public's
physical and mental health

00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:33.145
but also foster a sense of democracy.

00:01:33.145 --> 00:01:35.442
Yeah, that sounds exactly right.

00:01:35.442 --> 00:01:37.198
The not only says, "Hey,
not only did you do

00:01:37.198 --> 00:01:38.925
"this one thing, but you did other things.

00:01:38.925 --> 00:01:40.879
"But you also did this other stuff."

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:44.879
So this one is definitely the best answer.
