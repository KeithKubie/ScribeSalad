00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
&gt;&gt; So, hello, everyone. Thank you all for
coming out. We are very happy to have Justin

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.860
Fox here today in the office to talk about
his new book, "The Myth of the Rational Market."

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.080
This is Justin's first book, but he has been
a blogger and contributor to the Times Magazine

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.740
blog for--since 2007. And before that, he
worked for Fortune Magazine for over a decade.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.650
So we are very excited to have him here in
the office today. So, everyone, please welcome,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.130
Justin Fox.
&gt;&gt; FOX: And it looks like I'm going to have

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.070
to stay close to this mic, so I'll like lean
on the podium. I don't know. I thought what

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.180
I should do is start with a story that goes
back to my--when I was first starting out

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.280
at Fortune Magazine. It kind of explains why
I ended up writing this book and why I think

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.540
it matters. And, luckily, a financial crisis
happened to make lots of other people think

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.620
it matters, too, but I was writing this book
long before that came along. What is was is

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.110
I just got in to Fortune. I haven't been a
business journalist before. I'd just been

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.320
sort of a general interest business writer.
But somehow, I ended up covering the intersection

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.280
between corporations and financial markets,
corporations in Wall Street. And one of the

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.749
first big stories I wrote for the magazine
was about the whole weird practice of managing

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:23.909
earnings and managing Wall Street's consensus
earnings forecast and trying to beat the consensus

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.490
by a penny. And this whole dance that developed
early in the early to mid '90s and, I mean,

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.770
actually, the founders of this company made
a really big deal about not wanting to participate

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.889
in that dance, but that was later. So this
was 1997, and it was very clear that there

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:47.600
were huge amounts of effort at the CFO levels,
CEO level put into making sure that you beat

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.939
the consensus earning target of all the Wall
Street analysts by at least a penny or two.

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.450
And as I was--so I documented this talk people
about why they did it, and I thought it would

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.709
be interesting to look at the academic literature
on this whole phenomena. And it turned out

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:07.680
there were lots of papers by accounting professors
explaining that, yes, there was lots of evidence

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.671
that companies did weird things in order to
make their quarterly earnings, first of all,

00:02:12.671 --> 00:02:18.360
come out smoothly rising over time, but, second
of all, to meet these consensus targets. But

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.710
then there was this really weird thing about
all of this accounting literature is when

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.000
they went around to try to explain why, they
came up with kind of weird things like maybe

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.300
it had something to do with their bonus structure
or maybe it was some debt covenant, but they

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.790
basically weren't allowed to talk about the
sort of most obvious reason why all the CEOs

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.090
thought they were managing their earnings,
which was to affect their stock price. And

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.700
the reason for that was because if you were--had
a Ph.D. and got a Ph.D. in accounting in the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.610
last 25, 30 years, you were taught--because
accounting is sort of this--taught as the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.750
subset of academic finance--you were taught
that you couldn't fool the market, that as

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.730
a corporate executive, you couldn't--I mean,
unless you were out right lying, but if you're

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.260
using relatively transparent things like just
shoving earnings into one quarter instead

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.319
of the next, that people can see through.
But that should actually have absolutely no

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.739
impact on stock price and, therefore, that
can't be why anybody was doing it. And I remember

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.140
that struck me as a little strange of the
time. I ended up writing the article just

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.799
saying, well, maybe all these CEOs and CFOs
are crazy to be doing this. I kind of left

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:29.790
it at that. And I came across a couple of
similar conflicts between what everybody in

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.340
corporate world believed and what all these
lessons out of academic finance and accounting

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.830
were. In other words, it was about stock options
accounting, which was a big, controversial

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.430
thing in the late '90s. Basically, all the
accountants thought it should be accounted

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.150
for as an expense. Everybody in Silicon Valley
said that would be a disaster because the

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.829
feeling was somehow it would cause all the
stock prices of Silicon Valley companies to

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.040
collapse. That was one--that was a bad reason,
the better reason why, it would just cause

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.019
executives to give out fewer of them. So,
I did a lot of that writing. I was sort of

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:07.489
puzzled by this lack of interest in the academe
in the thought that maybe markets weren't

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.349
always--be able to see through everything.
I went away. I went to London. I was Fortune's

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.739
Europe guy for a couple of years, came back
and was in the office in New York in 2002

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.910
and just happened to pick up this book by
a Caltech economist, specialized in finance,

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.440
where I just sort of leafing through, I realize
he was saying that actually he didn't believe

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.330
anymore that markets could see every--see
through everything and were perfectly efficient.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.580
And very quickly, as I started looking through,
I realized right around when I'd written that

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.140
first article for Fortune in '97, there had
been this big shift in academic finance. There

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.520
were lots of people questioning whether something
like the tech stock bubble of 1999 and 2000

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.169
could be explained by anything other than
just people going a bit nuts. And that struck

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.159
me as a good idea for an article, wrote an
article for Fortune called--I think it was

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:07.580
called, "Is the Market Rational? No, But Neither
Are You, So Don't Think You Can Beat It."

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.990
It was a very investing focus because it was
a foreign investor guide. And then that led

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.750
to this book. Some guy from a publisher, Harper-Collins
came and said I should write a book about

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.710
that and nobody had ever--from a reputable
publisher had ever asked me to that before,

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.030
and, so, I said yes, which is something I
regretted greatly over many of the last five

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:32.410
or six years. But it's okay now. And what
I--so what I thought is I don't want to write

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.389
this polemic. I just want to the story of
why did all these accounting professors and

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:42.199
finance professors and a lot of economists
come to believe that financial markets, the

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:47.000
stock market in particular, were so smart
and able to see through everything and not

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.090
subject to bubbles and everything else. And
the story I came up with is it was this combination

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.590
of things. I mean, there are certain elements
that have been there in economics forever

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.280
because there are certain elements of truth
to it. Markets are smart. They react to things.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.510
They can see through people's nonsense sometimes.
And the whole idea of Adam Smith's invisible

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:14.449
hand of market forces moving things in relatively
positive direction without--because of the

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:18.740
actions of lots of selfish people looking
out for themselves, that's been around forever,

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:25.009
but we've developed after World War II was
this combination of, first, it was the rise

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:30.070
of statistics and mathematical modeling, not
just in economics but all over the corporate

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.629
America and a lot of that, I mean, it was
partly because of advances in statistics.

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:42.150
A lot of it was just because World War II,
the experience. I mean, U.S. and U.K. used

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.419
statistical thinking in a way that the Axis
Powers did not. And it really helped. They

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:51.350
called this operations research. It was the
term [INDISTINCT] for what they were in general

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:57.379
doing. And a lot of economists were involved.
Milton Friedman spent part of World War II

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:02.199
helped--helping working at this statistics
office at Columbia University, helping figure

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:08.500
out things like how many pieces you want to
score in artillery shell into--so, to determine

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.470
whether it blows up into lots of little pieces
or just a few big ones. And it's a risk [INDISTINCT]

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.080
thing. If it's the big pieces, they cause
more damage if they hit. If it's the little

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.090
pieces, they are more likely to hit but they
cause less damage if they hit. And during--in

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.970
the middle of the Battle of the Bulge, they
were actually gunnery officers who flew back

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:32.610
to Washington to consult with Milton Friedman
about what to do, which obviously gave him

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:37.960
and other economist a certain confidence in
what they could do with these tools. So, there

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.919
was that. There was the collapse of what had
been for awhile there on the first part of

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:47.740
the century in the U.S., kind of the dominant
economic tradition, which was they called

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:53.050
themselves institutionalists, mostly. And,
really, the guy now who most of us remember

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.150
who was part of this tradition is John Kenneth
Galbraith, but it's sort of this historical,

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:03.740
literary way of looking at economics that's
very appealing to journalists like me, but

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:10.650
totally had no answers during the Great Depression.
And so people started looking to people like

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.500
John Maynard Keynes, who really was a more
conventional economist who was just willing

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.919
to have different ideas. And then the other
part of it was just sort of political waves.

00:08:18.919 --> 00:08:25.410
There were these beginnings of a libertarian
backlash against the New Deal and Great Society

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:31.600
and all of these programs. And so these things
all came together at Chicago and at MIT. And

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:38.430
at MIT the focus was on statistics and the
math and this idea that randomness was this

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:42.512
really important concept to understanding
pretty much everything that goes on in the

00:08:42.512 --> 00:08:48.800
world. And it is in so many things. And it
sort of came about as this way to tweak all

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:55.440
these people who thought you could stock charts
and divine truth out of the fact that over

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.180
the past 40 years, if you have like head and
shoulders is one thing, that that will lead

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:06.510
to some result afterwards. And what a lot
of statisticians and economists from the '30s

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.610
and to the '50s were able to show is you could
create all those same patterns with random

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:17.110
processes. So, there was that coming out of
MIT, which was basically market movements

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:22.910
are akin to random movements, they're really
to predict. I mean, maybe you can--maybe some

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:27.790
people can, but, in general, there's no easy
picking in the stock market. That came together

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:34.230
with Chicago where everybody agreed with that
but gave it this more ideological phrase where

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:41.480
it became this idea that, "Well, if markets
were perfectly, rationally reflecting all

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:46.410
available information that's out there, then
their movements would be random because they'd

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:53.040
just be reflecting--I mean, news is random,
so they would be reflecting changes in news,

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.279
changes in risk assessment to a certain extent,
but there would be no really to detect patterns

00:09:58.279 --> 00:10:02.790
in them. So, the idea of a rational market
would be a random market. Market seemed to

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:07.380
be pretty random; therefore, markets must
be rational. And that led to this whole research

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:14.300
project at Chicago of finding evidence that
market, the stock market in particular, was

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:20.380
really doing a great job of assigning prices
to things. And in one line of research was

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.280
just looking at mutual fund performance and
finding that mutual funds as a group didn't

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.300
beat the market. And, now, that seems kind
of obvious because mutual funds are such a

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.350
big part of the market, and I think that was
part of the explanation for why they did it

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:38.190
in the '60s either. But the idea up to then,
the stock market investing was dominated by

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.600
individual investors so the [INDISTINCT] more
professionals are going to do better than

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.700
them. And here are a bunch of highly-paid
professionals as a group, especially when

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:52.139
you adjust for their volatility of their performance;
they didn't do any better than the market.

00:10:52.139 --> 00:10:57.970
So that was one bit of evidence. Another bit
was that prices reacted really swiftly to

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:02.170
new information. Often, new information that
hadn't been publicly disclosed, markets could

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:08.710
sniff it out. And, again, these are all valid
points and--but it kind of came together into

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:15.410
this all-encompassing view of the world that,
basically--I mean, the simplest way to put

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:19.950
it is "the price is right." And there actually
was a professor at the University of Rochester,

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:25.070
which was sort of University of Chicago junior
in the 1970s, who would start his classes

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:31.550
by yelling, "The price is right! The price
is right!" So, that was the belief. And there

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.900
was this side element that seemed to come
attached to all of these, and it doesn't have

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.680
to be--and these don't have to go together,
but, I guess, because all these people were

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.730
saying that, "OK, markets are unpredictable.
We can't predict prices. Nobody can predict

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.430
prices," but they still want to give people
something useful. What they said is, "Well,

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:53.930
we can't predict price movements, but we can
say something about the riskiness of a particular

00:11:53.930 --> 00:12:00.310
security." And, for the most part, they just
measured riskiness as volatility. I mean,

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:05.839
they came up with more convoluted ways. And
so coming out of this, here's this bunch of

00:12:05.839 --> 00:12:11.690
people, young finance professors from Chicago
and MIT and increasingly elsewhere--Berkley,

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:19.950
Stanford, UCLA was a real hotbed as well--coming
along in the '70s who had this pretty clear

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:26.920
view of how the world worked. And it was one
in which there was no point in sneaking around

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:32.850
trying to figure out which particular stock
to buy and beat the market that way. There

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:37.720
was a lot of point in owning stocks because
over time I did lots of historical research

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.649
that had performed really well over time,
and there was an explanation for that. It

00:12:41.649 --> 00:12:46.959
was because they were riskier over short periods
and, therefore, over time that should reward

00:12:46.959 --> 00:12:53.600
you. And so that's my method of rational market.
That's--it probably--it peaked between about

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:59.770
the--in academia--between the late '60s and
early '80s. And what sort of impact did it

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:03.839
have? Well, the--I mean, some of the first
things that came from these people were all

00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:10.130
these measurements of investing performance
that--like the sharp ratio, alpha, et cetera.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.970
They're really big in the institutional investing
world, but they find their way into other

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:18.589
things like Morning Star ratings and stuff
like that. The second thing was index funds

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:23.579
which--I love index funds and I think they're
great things for lots of reasons, and you

00:13:23.579 --> 00:13:27.529
don't have to believe markets are efficient
or rational to think an index fund is a good

00:13:27.529 --> 00:13:32.361
idea, but I don't think index funds would
have happened in the '70s. The first one in

00:13:32.361 --> 00:13:37.200
an institutional level was right around the
corner here at what was then Wells Fargo Global

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.440
Investors, it became Barclays Global Investors.
I don't know if it has become BlackRock Global

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.230
Investors now or what, but it's going to be
global investors. And then Vanguard--Jack

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:53.540
Vogel invented--well, created the first index
fund for retail investors a few years later.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.380
Option pricing models and the rise of derivatives
markets, again, it could have happened without

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:02.079
this belief that prices are rational, but
it makes a lot more sense to believe in an

00:14:02.079 --> 00:14:06.980
option pricing formula which is based on existing
prices of the underlying securities, if you

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:14.009
believe those existing prices mean something.
So, that was led to that. In the law, there

00:14:14.009 --> 00:14:19.230
was huge transformation of thinking about
corporate information disclosure and lots

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:23.649
of other things because of this idea that
markets are really efficient. And then in

00:14:23.649 --> 00:14:30.149
terms of deregulation, clearly, this thing
he played a role in it, but a lot of the financial

00:14:30.149 --> 00:14:34.889
regulations that fell apart in the '70s just
fell apart because they weren't designed to

00:14:34.889 --> 00:14:40.200
cope with inflation and you had things like
Reg. Q that said you could only pay whatever

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.149
was 5 percent on the savings account. It didn't
work very well when inflation was 10 percent.

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:49.779
So, I don't want to give too much credit to
this myth in all of the changes that happened,

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:56.019
but the thing that definitely did happen starting
in the '70s was this sort of "financialization

00:14:56.019 --> 00:15:00.220
of American life" where financial markets
came to play a bigger role. People, instead

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:04.220
of having their money in a bank, they have
it in a market account. And then, increasingly,

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.660
instead of having money in a pension, they
had it in a Farrow and Kaye (ph) Mutual Funds.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.519
And, again, this happened for lots of reasons
outside of what a bunch of professors at Chicago

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:17.570
said. But this whole idea that markets are
these great rational things made it a lot

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:24.040
more palatable, made this a popular thing.
Now, what's interesting is right about in

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:30.320
the early '80s, the first young professors
looking to raise some hell started raising

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.610
their hands, and Bob Sheller, who's now a
familiar face with his floppy hair on TV and

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:41.730
everywhere else, he's a Yale economist and
a prolific author--he wrote a paper that,

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:46.500
I think, was published in '81, and he was
sort of raising a hand, "Yes, but..." And

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:52.529
it was, gee, it looked like the movements
of stock prices were a whole lot more volatile

00:15:52.529 --> 00:15:57.940
than any--and the particular thing he picked
was the dividends that were subsequently paid,

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.450
but lots of other people did research with
just about every other fundamental variable

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:07.410
you can come up with, and it was clear that
the market's movements were much more volatile.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:12.480
And then another guy who is sort of prominent
these days, Larry Summers, who is a young

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:18.880
economist at Harvard--well, initially, MIT
then Harvard at that time. He did this paper

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:27.390
sort of showing that it was impossible to
tell a rationally unpredictable market from

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:34.399
an irrationally unpredictable market unless
you had, I think it was a 150 years of data.

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:38.350
And so it was just basically the point that,
you know, maybe the market is random, which

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:47.000
means prices are rational, but maybe not.
Nobody knows. And so as the years went by,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.810
more and more of these ideas that everybody
was so sure about in the '50s and '60s got

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:58.420
taken apart in academic finance. But the interesting
thing that was going on in the wider world

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:05.290
is the 1990s were happening. And in sort of
the popular world, in the popular press, in

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:10.810
corporate America and everywhere else, markets
seemed to be working really well. And it wasn't

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:14.510
just the fall of the Berlin Wall and all of
that. It was that compared to what, say, the

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:19.970
German or Japanese economy, which were these
very bank-dominated, don't-rely-on-the-price-is-set

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:25.030
in financial markets to determine all that
much, they were struggling. The U.S. and the

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:31.400
U.K. were doing great. And so--and these fascinating
things happened. Like Larry Summers, who had

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:37.460
been this huge critic of financial markets
in the '80s was suddenly working first at

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:42.721
the World Bank, then at the Clinton administration,
basically saying, well, you know, they're

00:17:42.721 --> 00:17:48.052
flawed but they work a whole lot better than
anything else. And I guess one way to look

00:17:48.052 --> 00:17:52.310
at it is Milton Friedman talked about--he
had this famous line about monetary policy

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:57.600
like Fed decisions, they have effect on the
real economy with long and variable lags.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:03.820
And I think the same--the same is true of
ideas, intellectual ideas that come out of

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:09.110
universities and elsewhere is they're starting
to have their impact on a popular culture

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:16.150
years after they did on campus. And I just--I
mean another classic thing in the '90s, is,

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:22.820
before the 1990s, if people were talking how
big a company was, it was always its revenue

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:27.140
or its profits. And those are both flawed
measures, all agree. But in the '90s, it switched

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:31.180
completely to you just talk about the market
gap and that tells you everything. And, again,

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:36.450
it is moral encompassing, but as we learned
at the end of the '90s, it can give you some

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:42.680
kind of weird measures of who is important
and who is not, so, which bring us all to

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:48.490
then to kind of "what went wrong?" And--I
mean, clearly the simplest thing of what went

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:53.310
wrong is lots of people were given mortgages
that there's no way they could have afford

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:59.820
to pay back unless housing prices kept rising.
And the sort of more complicated--I mean,

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:05.400
I was just trying to come up with the one--one
line explanation is that the markets for mortgage

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.550
securities failed to price--they failed the
price risk. And what it turned out to be,

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:15.380
and I think the problem that financial markets
have is they really did it differentiating

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.710
like the riskiness of the two different companies,
of comparing two different companies, even

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:25.290
different industries. What they're really
bad at is--and it's understandable--is gauging

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:30.600
the risk that they themselves create. And
I think that's what happened in the mortgage

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:35.810
market is that the increasingly lax lending
standards. I mean, obviously some of this

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:41.820
was brought on by regulatory decisions and
the sort of obsession in Washington with people

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:45.950
owning homes, but in the end they were for
the most part private investors around the

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:50.400
world buying these mortgage securities, and
they were buying them for way too cheap, given

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:57.580
how risky they were. And the thing about that
is that happens. It's happened again and again

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:03.270
throughout history, that these moments have
come when people decide to just utterly ignore

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:07.710
the potential riskiness of things and just
look only at potential returns. And so you

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:15.410
can't blame that on this myth of the rational
market. What you can say though is that regulators

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:21.090
and bankers and homebuyers and a lot of other
people were sort of singularly unprepared

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:27.900
for what happened because of the dominance
of this view of financial markets in which

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:34.560
things always happen. Prices always move for
a reason and price movements are commonly

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:40.940
rational enough to be accounted for in pretty
simple risk models. And that's kind of where

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:47.580
we are now. And I don't--again, this book
I've written is--it's a story about where

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:52.620
these ideas came from, where the challengers
came from, and the sort of muddle we're in

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:59.130
right now. I haven't written the answer, and
I don't think anybody has it at the moment.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:05.260
One of the issues is just because markets
are flawed and have these bubbles and panics

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:09.720
and crashes, it doesn't mean that you're going
to come up with some government regulators

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:15.680
who do things better. And in fact one of the
problematic things I think about especially

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.870
banking regulation is there was this movement
over the past decade or two to have more flexible

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:26.200
banking regulation, give regulators more leeway
to do what they think, they thought was right,

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:32.810
but they caught up in all the same craziness
that markets do. So, the two things that keep

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:38.600
coming to mind is, one, this financial market
bubbles seem to cause a lot more damage when

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:43.720
they're built on debt rather than equity.
So you had the '90s tech stock bubble which--I

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.090
mean, it caused a lot of damage in the Bay
Area but it wasn't this economic disaster

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:52.060
because for the most part people were putting
up money that they had no contractual right

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:59.180
to get back. They were willing to take that
risk, whereas with the mortgages and housing,

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:04.200
it was much more debt-fueled bubble and, you
know, people have contracts. They're supposed

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:09.170
to get paid. Those break down, you start having
all these big troubles in the financial system.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:14.140
So, clearly, some limitations of leverage
in boom times make sense. I don't know what

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:20.880
that limitation ought to be. And then--but
the other obvious thing is markets are these--financial

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:27.260
markets, in particular, are just spectacularly
efficient institution, but it's a really bad

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:31.470
idea to have a society that's entirely run
by them. And I'm not saying we did exactly,

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:36.580
but there were times in the late '90s when
it—-we seemed to be coming close. It's—-there

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:43.290
is a reason why we have these obviously less
efficient but at least different bodies from

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:50.060
charitable organizations to religious ones
to corporations themselves to governments.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:55.410
Diversity brings better answers for the most
part, and I think diversity of sort of the

00:22:55.410 --> 00:23:00.230
structure of economic institutions is part
of that. So that's where I am now in the story.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:13.750
I would love to move it up to Q&amp;A. Yep?
&gt;&gt; Okay. Sure. So just a question on indexing

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:17.960
and John Bogle. I mean, there's, you know,
a notion that for an individual price there's

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.930
some irrationality and all kinds of behavioral
things going on, but in aggregate, across

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:26.520
the market where you have indexing for the,
you know, basically, the entire marketplace,

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:30.960
what is your view in terms of the role of
rational decision-making or the fact that

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:36.860
you basically are able to max that or at least
obviate some of the behavioral consequences

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:41.261
by indexing?
&gt;&gt; FOX: Well, I love indexing but I--the mean

00:23:41.261 --> 00:23:46.700
reason I loved it 'cause—-well, first of
all, because I've just realized over the past

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:52.630
10 or 15 years that, you know, part time,
I'm probably a bad investor period. I'm doing

00:23:52.630 --> 00:24:00.110
it part time in the evenings, I'm just crapped
out. So I'm better off advocating some of

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:04.000
that, and just saying, "Okay, I don't think
the market is perfect, but I think it probably

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.340
knows better than me most of the time." But
the mean reason is that indexing is cheap,

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:15.490
and this sort of really basic equation that
it was espoused by people like Bill Sharpe

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:19.870
and Jack Bogle in the '60s and '70s, so there
are some identification with the efficient

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.810
market, rational market idea, but it doesn't
really have to go together. It's just that

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:29.390
investors, as a whole, are going to trail
the market by the amount of their costs, I

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:34.500
mean, because investors as a whole are the
market. Any sort of costs, that subtracts

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:40.310
from what you're going to make. So, if you're
an investor whose costs are lower than the

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:44.150
average costs, then you're doing better than
most people. I mean, you're already doing

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:49.560
better than most people regardless of anything
else. I mean, the issues with indexing—-I

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:54.590
mean, obviously, one issue would be if everybody
indexed, then prices will be totally crazy

00:24:54.590 --> 00:25:01.240
because it would just, everybody it'd be—-and
to a certain extent, the actual efficiency

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:07.850
and rationality of markets is probably dependent
on how many people believe in their efficiency

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:11.240
and rationality because--and it is interesting
that a lot of these ideas came about after

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:18.850
this long period from the '30s through the
'60s where there weren't many people participating

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:23.750
in the stock market. Those who were participating
were, up until the early '60s, were very heavily

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:29.920
skewed towards value investors like Benjamin
Graham, and they were making prices steadily

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.820
more rational as that time went by. And if
you look back at the history of prices where,

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:44.370
you know, it just decided to stop about 1932,
it was this calm, steady, sensible movement.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:49.210
But now I can't remember where I was going
about. Oh, well, I'll come up to—I'll come

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:52.390
up with the next question. Another question?
Yep?

00:25:52.390 --> 00:26:01.970
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT] issues with the efficient
market theories, something that enabled the

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:08.220
crisis is, in America, people's comfort with
sort of living on debt and not saving enough.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:13.160
And so I was wondering if you could give your
perspective on how that sort of came to be

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:18.021
in our culture and what enabled that, you
know, amongst like maybe mortgage securities

00:26:18.021 --> 00:26:22.170
or whatever it was.
&gt;&gt; FOX: Well, I mean, I do think one reason

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:27.610
is sort of related to this efficient market
idea, which is that--and we've had since the

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:32.900
early--this kind of debt explosion, there've
been a steadily rising indebtedness from the

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.130
'30s, but you can just call that kind of a
correction of after people had totally freaked

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.170
out about debt in the Great Depression. But
starting in the early '80s, there was this

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:46.680
pretty dramatic rise in consumer indebtedness,
and it was clearly financed indirectly but

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:54.070
nonetheless really by the people from overseas--first,
Japan and, later, these broader group of countries.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:58.750
And anytime there, you know, there have been
books and books written about all the horrible

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:04.630
indebtedness of America, and this is terrible,
and--I mean, two things would happen to discredit

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:08.860
those people. One, the debt levels kept rising
and we're okay, and the other was there was

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:13.850
an argument, well, who are you to say the
smarter than these financial markets which

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:18.490
decides it's okay to give all this people
this the [INDISTINCT]. So, that's part of

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:25.320
it. The other part, I mean, it's clearly there—-it's
cultural experience. I mean, Germany, because

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.700
of the more recent and more searing experience
it went through first with inflation in the

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:36.280
'20s and then with other economic collapse
after World War II, that seems to be a country

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:41.210
much less comfortable with debt than we are.
And I think, you know, something about the

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:46.230
whole American way of doing things. It's about
being hopeful and thinking things are going

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:50.320
to turn out better. So, we probably should
have hired [INDISTINCT] a lot of countries.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:57.450
But I do think this idea that there's no—-you
can't have a wrong level of debt because this

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:02.750
is what the market decreed. I do think that
played at least a partial role in why no one

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:10.380
ever tried to do much about it. Yep?
&gt;&gt; Okay, since we're a technology company

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.750
and one that is obsessed with speed, I was
wondering if you could say anything about

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:17.130
high frequency trading and how that might
affect rational pricing.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:21.790
&gt;&gt; FOX: Well, one of the interesting—-happily,
I wrote in my column this week about that,

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:22.790
so...
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:28.090
&gt;&gt; FOX: No, but I'm not totally, because I've
been reading the stories for several weeks

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:35.020
and just wondering what, what are these people
doing? One of the things, because, clearly,

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:39.721
if you see everything from this idea that
markets are generally efficient and if you

00:28:39.721 --> 00:28:45.860
throw more resources at them, they're only
going to get more efficient. And that's what

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.840
the people who defend high frequency trading,
it's just creating more liquidity, it's lowering

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:55.641
cost for everybody else. It's all a good thing.
The one flipside of that, and the problem

00:28:55.641 --> 00:29:01.460
is the people who are concerned about it really
can't bring much of anything but vague fears.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:07.540
But there's clearly, when you introduce sort
of a new level of speed to the market and

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:15.240
especially if other parts aren't at that rate
yet, you end with these pretty bad dislocations

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:22.370
sometimes. I mean, 1987 crash was, among other
things, very much it seems to me this interaction

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:30.020
between this really fast Chicago futures markets
in S&amp;P 500 Futures and the like and then still

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:35.690
totally manual New York Stock Exchange. And
so you had the futures prices adjusting really

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:42.440
fast and that suddenly sent all these floor
brokers in New York to sell stocks and unleash

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:47.320
this panic because they didn't go together.
So, there's some level—-some weird--I get

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:52.750
the concern that weird little thing happens
in the high frequency trading world could

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.960
suddenly cascade out into the rest of the
markets and nobody would know how to handle

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:02.540
it at first. Eventually, we figured it out
and it will be fine. The other thing is there'd

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:07.330
been--these guys at the—-it was initially
down at the Santa Fe Institute and now I think

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:15.030
the main guy who's doing it is Blake Lebaron
at Brandeis, they do this experimental security

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:21.100
markets on computers and create these agents
who have pretty simple beliefs about, you

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:26.230
know, they'll something simple like stock
prices are going to keep going up for awhile

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:32.900
and then if--and then they adjust their beliefs
reality hits them in the face. And one of

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:37.090
the really interesting things they've discovered
with these markets is if their agents are

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:42.690
sort of slow and take awhile to adjust their
beliefs to change market circumstances, you

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:48.290
get markets that look pretty much like those
out of financial theory. They're like rational

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:52.660
expectations market. But you start speeding
them up and having them change their minds

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:56.890
really quickly and interact with each other,
and you get more volatility and more fluctuation

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:02.240
and more bubbles. And I don't know, quite--so
there's some level at which—-at least in

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.500
financial markets, not necessarily in the
rest of life—-but in financial markets,

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:10.890
since everybody is sort of reacting, anticipating
what everybody else is doing, that extreme

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:16.450
speed might bring you less efficient, less
rational pricing. And I don't know the answer

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:22.680
to that, but I don't think it's a crazy fear.
I think that could be true. One of you guys

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:27.000
back there?
&gt;&gt; I have a question on your thought about

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.250
the "Wisdom of Crowds," which is a book that
gets a lot of credit at Google and in many

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:35.020
ways is built in to what we do, and so a book
called "The Myth of Rational Markets" could

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:38.490
be viewed as somewhat of an attack on the
"Wisdom of Crowds." And I'm just curious if

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:43.490
you've read "Wisdom of Crowds" or just how
you view that notion compared to what you've

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:48.650
written.
&gt;&gt; FOX: I love that book. And Surowiecki came

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:55.990
to my book party. But I think--I think it's
only wrong, I think that concept is wrong

00:31:55.990 --> 00:32:00.970
to a certain extent in financial markets.
I think, if you're doing a prediction market

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:06.641
where there's something going to happen at
the end of that period, you don't have any

00:32:06.641 --> 00:32:10.930
room for a bubble. People just make their
predictions and it's really--if you have a

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:14.070
diverse bunch of people making predictions,
you get a better result than you would if

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:18.180
you just asked one expert. So, in that sense,
the "Wisdom of Crowds" is absolutely right.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:22.180
I think the issue with financial markets--and
it's kind of funny, it's all coming---I mean,

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:27.290
Keynes' has this famous chapter of his "General
Theory," which is this mostly unreadable book,

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:32.560
but chapter 12 is this depiction of financial
markets and he is just describing how hard

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:38.460
they are because basically you're anticipating
what other people are anticipating that other

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:44.090
people are going to do. And in the stock market,
I mean, at least in some--in futures and option

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.940
markets, there are expiration dates, so, at
a certain point, you come to, okay, it has

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:52.440
to be this. But in stock markets, I mean,
there are potential-—people can take a company

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:57.730
private or there can be a merger. There are
events that can happen that sort of--or a

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:04.380
company can liquidate that force the prices
to come in contact with reality, but over

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:08.740
really long periods of time, it could just
be different people's opinion interacting

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:12.660
with each other. And so, yeah, I think it's
a totally valid concept. I don't think it

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:18.890
applies in the same way to financial markets
because basically financial markets are prediction

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:24.240
markets about prediction about predictions,
and that's different from just a straight

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:32.370
prediction market.
&gt;&gt; So, let's assume that tomorrow, policymakers

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:38.111
come around to your view of things and assume
that markets are irrational. Well, what do

00:33:38.111 --> 00:33:41.420
you think that should imply for the structure
of institutions either in terms of controlling

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:50.330
connectiveness or size or kind of just overall
risk levels and what we as a society should

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:54.980
do to hedge?
&gt;&gt; FOX: If I have the answer to that--well,

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:59.940
because obviously, I mean, one level within
the federal reserve system, there's this queer

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:04.910
thinking now that up until after Greens-...
a year or two after Greenspan left, the idea

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:08.750
was always "we know there are bubbles, we
are not trying to claim that markets are always

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:13.149
perfectly rational, but we can't identify
them ahead of time and so, we'll just clean

00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:17.230
up afterwards." And that was sort of the Greenspan
ethos the whole time he was head of the Fed.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:21.980
Now, you are hearing a lot of voices at the
Fed saying, well, actually we can identify

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:26.250
when debt levels are going up a lot and we
can do something about that. We don't necessarily

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:30.270
have to say that prices are wrong in the markets,
but there's something we can do sort of lean

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:36.810
against the wind in terms of the debt cycle.
Beyond--in terms of interconnectiveness of

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:40.290
institutions, I wonder about that because
lots of people think, oh, if only we just

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:45.870
had smaller financial institutions, this would
all be fine. I think some of what you've--what

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:50.570
we've seen about the way markets--financial
markets behave is you can have lots of smaller

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:55.659
institutions and they all lean in the same
direction and has the same impact as one big

00:34:55.659 --> 00:35:00.580
institution going bust. So, I don't know that
that solves as many things as lot of people

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:06.410
think. And you look at the financial systems
that have survived this crisis best and I'm

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:10.720
sure in some cases is just the luck of who
is regulating them. But Canada has just this

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:18.010
clear case of a system that it's like five
big institutions all of which do everything--banking,

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:22.440
stock brokerage, investment banking--and they
came through the crisis brilliantly. It was

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:29.720
just there was more sense there of that idea
of keeping debt from getting out of hand.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:37.460
There's one back here?
&gt;&gt; You mentioned value investing earlier,

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:42.131
and I've seen several interviews with Warren
Buffet where he talks about how he wants to

00:35:42.131 --> 00:35:46.296
buy a company. He looks at the business. He
looks at the management, and he looks at the

00:35:46.296 --> 00:35:50.550
numbers, and he looks at the stock price,
and if the market is undervalued and the company

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:55.650
[INDISTINCT] buys it. Is it really that easy?
Or are you saying that the numbers are irrational

00:35:55.650 --> 00:36:00.730
and shouldn't be trusting him like that?
&gt;&gt; FOX: If--I mean, easy, I don't know, but

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:06.711
I think it's that simple in the sense that
that's one of the--I talked about Larry Summers

00:36:06.711 --> 00:36:11.720
and Bob Schuler, but one of the other interesting
things that happened in the late '80s and

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:18.090
early '90s is this research by a lot of sort
of hardcore orthodox finance professors, including

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:22.700
Eugene Fama, the guy who authored the original
efficient market hypothesis, well, basically

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:28.460
showed that over time value stocks win, value
stocks outperform the market. And a lot of

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:33.140
the--this sort of orthodox finance crew has
struggled with that and the explanation Fama

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:37.850
gives is it's because somehow the value stocks
are riskier therefore they're going to do

00:36:37.850 --> 00:36:43.800
better. I think, an equally good argument
is that value investing is riskier, especially

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.780
if you're a professional investor, because
if you're an agent for somebody else's money,

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:53.430
then exactly when should you be staying out
of stocks is when everybody wants to get into

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:58.040
stocks and exactly when you should be getting
in is when everybody wants to get out. And

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:03.370
the genius of Buffet is he set up his business
where he's not dependent on anybody else's

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:07.660
money. He just all these companies that have
nice cash flow and he has to invest that however

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:12.300
he wants. It doesn't matter what Richard Hathaway
stock price is. Everybody can abandoned him.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:17.160
He still has the cash to invest whenever he
wants to. So, I think the big reason value

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:21.590
investing works is it's hard especially for
professionals. It's actually one of those

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:26.870
things that might be easier for individual
investors if they have the right mental framework

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:37.520
to be able to deal. Anything else? Yeah?
&gt;&gt; I spent a lot of times working with Wal-Mart

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:42.790
and their betting the farm on this newly frugal
customers, and their hypothesis goes something

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:50.680
like, you know, "we've hit a permanent reset
button, people will rethink value, will rethink

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:55.950
the shopping experience" and, certainly, they're
benefiting from that. They say things like

00:37:55.950 --> 00:38:02.350
"on the other side of these recession, people
will have to rebuild their nest eggs," they,

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:07.860
you know, they'll have a changed mentality
for a long time. So, I'm just thinking, do

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:13.690
you believe that? There's a lot been written
about that. And if you do or don't, what does

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:18.570
that mean for the markets? And what does it
mean for stocks like Wal-Mart and others?

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:25.560
&gt;&gt; FOX: First of all, I do believe it. But
everybody was saying the same thing, although

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:30.930
probably to some lesser extent in the early
'90s. There was just a meeting the other day

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:36.250
at Time and someone was reminding us although
we had cover story and like 1991 or 1992 about

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:41.430
the new frugality, I think this was a bigger
crisis, people are in more financial trouble.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:47.870
It's more likely to actually stick. And to
use a little Google Wisdom of Crowds, I watch

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:53.220
the little top 10 blog post on time.com all
the time, see how I'm doing, and there's this

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:57.040
brand new blogger we've got who we haven't
given any special publicity to or anything.

00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:01.340
He's some guy living out in the woods in New
Hampshire, writes the cheapskate blog. And

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:06.760
it's like six out of the ten top posts are
invariably his posts, just saying, you know,

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:14.910
can you eat well on $50 a week, et cetera.
So, in terms of what that affects, I mean,

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:20.920
I think at one level, companies that cater
to that to a very value oriented audience

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:26.120
do better. At the other level, it just seems
to me that you're not going to have--you are

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:31.720
going to have this long period of indebtedness
either shrinking or not growing very much

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:40.270
at all. And if you look at over from early
1980s until now, or especially until like

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:46.290
five or ten years ago, a lot of the rise in
corporate profitability and in stock prices

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:50.700
had at least or partly be related to people
taking on more debt and spending more. And

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:56.950
so if that's not there, that's something that
weighs on financial markets overall I would

00:39:56.950 --> 00:40:00.210
think. I mean, it's a healthy development,
but it means that you don't automatically

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:08.120
get a booming stock market out of it. Yep?
&gt;&gt; I was interested in your views on loss

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:12.880
aversion and how you think that skews individual
and institutional investment decisions?

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:18.200
&gt;&gt; FOX: That, I mean, interesting, when I
started writing this book, I thought it would

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:25.101
be this history of first the rise of this
hyper-rational view of markets and investing

00:40:25.101 --> 00:40:29.610
and then its replacement by behavioral finance
and behavioral economics and all these ideas

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:36.310
like loss aversion that, basically, instead
of just sort of rationally looking at all

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:43.180
possibilities and weighing the risks, you
are much more concerned about going back from

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:50.240
your current state than weighing equally whether
you're back or forward. So, clearly, it affects

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:55.070
individual decision-making. And, I mean, at
the institutional level, I'm sure it's there.

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:58.510
I think there are so many other interesting
factors at the institutional level because

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:02.840
of the added complication of being an agent
and having customers that you are working

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:10.540
for. The thing that's difficult though is
finding ways that that's reflected in prices.

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:15.410
And that's been one of the really interesting
things that basically behavioral finance is

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:20.190
brought--given all these great answers about
how you could better structure a 401K program

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:25.380
or just how individuals should think about
investing. It hasn't really delivered much

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:30.390
of all on why prices do what they do and that
leads a lot the kind of old guard finance

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:35.830
people to say, oh, we won. And it's not only
that, it's just--we've got this model when

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:40.180
there's no perfect clear model that explains
everything. There are just different explanation

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:52.180
for different things. Anything else? Yep?
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if you had heard of the

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:56.680
Austrian Business Cycle Theory and how much
credence you put into it because a lot of

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:59.410
the stuff you've been talking about touches
on things that are kind of predicted by the

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:05.860
Austrian School.
&gt;&gt; FOX: Yeah, I mean, I gave some play to

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:10.790
some Austrians in the book and I thought at
times about going much more in-depth and,

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:16.590
you know, spending Vienna in the 1880s, the
rise of Austrian theories. And I didn't for

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:22.140
a couple of reasons--one was that just if
I'm looking at--it is basically a book about

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:28.440
mainstream thinking, academic thinking about
these ideas. And Austrian ideas, I mean, there

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:34.210
were moments like when Hayek wrote the Road
to Serfdom and his paper about information

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:38.870
and prices that they were very influential,
but on a whole, they haven't been. And I guess

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:44.130
the one other thing--and I don't think this
is like the actual Austrians from way back

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:49.020
when, but a lot of the people who call themselves
Austrian Business Cycle theorists now, it's

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:53.110
strikes me as this very simplistic view of
the world where everything is the federal

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:58.570
reserves' fault. And my problem with that
is we had financial crisis in booms and busts

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:04.320
before we have a federal reserve, so, it just--and
we actually created the Fed because we thought

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.910
it would get us out of them. And, clearly,
it hasn't, although, they've been less frequent.

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:13.031
So, I don't know if it's--you could argue
that that's a problem because if you don't

00:43:13.031 --> 00:43:16.870
have them frequently, people don't learn how
to deal with them and you end with really

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:21.770
big crises like this or the great depression,
where if you just let it happen every 10 years,

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:29.060
you'd less of a problem. So, I don't--I mean,
I'm fascinated with those discussions, those

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:33.670
arguments, it's something in the end I decided
I would have to add another 200 pages to my

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:37.910
book but I didn't have time for so I didn't,
but maybe some other time.

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:46.990
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you very much Justin.
&gt;&gt; FOX: Thank you. This is fun.
