Oy, you guys, no, I can’t. Food coma…uhhhh….

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.009
Good day, everyone, Amy here on DNews.

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.009
It’s the holidays!

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.210
Which means it’s time to visit family and
eat a startling number of ginormous meals,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.500
which will undoubtedly come with the all-too
familiar food coma.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.400
Though it sounds kinda funny and made up,
a food coma is actually a real, medically

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.990
recognized condition. Properly called postprandial
som-no-lence, it’s that sensation of being

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.820
so deliciously full that you can’t move
until you eventually fall asleep.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.129
Medically speaking, a food coma comes down
to a shift in activity in the autonomic nervous

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.180
system. It’s the system that controls involuntary
action of organs, heart, and glands, and incorporates

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.480
the sympathetic nervous system responsible
for the “fight or flight” response and

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.020
parasympathetic nervous system that lets your
body rest and digest. After ingesting a large

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.129
meal, the autonomic nervous system starts
favouring the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.469
decreasing your awareness in your sympathetic
nervous system, making you feel lethargic.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.180
But more often, turkey is the common scapegoat.
The myth always circulates around the holidays

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.710
is that tryptophan in turkey gives you that
sleepy feeling. It’s partly true. Tryptophan

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.180
is an amino acid that produces serotonin in
the brain for that sated feeling, and serotonin

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.960
produces the hormone melatonin that makes
you sleepy.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.490
But tryptophan is also found in other poultry
and meats, cheese, yogurt, fish, and eggs

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.119
— basically things non-vegans eat throughout
the year, so you can’t blame turkey, which

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.840
incidentally has less tryptophan than chicken.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.640
Tryptophan binds to other proteins in the
blood, but it’s too bulky to easily make

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.790
it through to blood-brain barrier. Other smaller
proteins get through more easily, preventing

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.299
tryptophan from entering the brain. So it
can’t trigger the production of serotonin

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.590
or melatonin. Tryptophan needs helps, and
it gets it from carbohydrates. Yup, carbs

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.619
are the culprit behind food comas.

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.990
So here’s how it works. Ingesting carbs
stimulate insulin production, the hormone

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.509
that helps your body turn sugar into energy.
Insulin also helps drive protein out of the

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.689
bloodstream and into cells. But some proteins
remain in the blood, like the protein albumin

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.759
that binds to tryptophan. So if levels of
tryptophan are in the blood are lower than

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.819
other protein levels, the sudden loss of protein
from the blood after a rise in insulin makes

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.530
it so the relative amount of tryptophan rises.
It’s now a more dominant protein, and with

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.550
less competition, it has a much easier time
getting through the blood-brain barrier, hitting

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.300
the brain to make serotonin and melatonin.
And it gets better. Because tryptophan can

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.379
be stored in your body, you can get the carb-induced
food coma long after you’ve finished dinner.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.660
That slice of pumpkin pie might be the carb
hit your body needs to start the process that

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.800
makes serotonin.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.810
So go ahead and eat your massive holiday meal
and enjoy knowing exactly why you’re going

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.940
to fall asleep at the table. Though how your
body handles tryptophan-bound proteins can

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.530
change if you’re sick or on medications,
so everyone’s food coma will be a little

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.410
different. And speaking of turkey, Anthony
and Cristen talk about why turkey gets such

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.800
a bad rep for the food that makes you sleepy
in this video right here.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.260
