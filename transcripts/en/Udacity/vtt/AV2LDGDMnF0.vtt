00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.420
We just decided that we need to add a 1 into this expression, in order to

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.125
complete the square. So we're going to want to have x squared plus 2 x plus 1

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:14.119
inside these parentheses. My question is can we go ahead and replace x squared

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.831
plus 2 x with x squared plus 2 x plus 1, without changing anything else in our

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:21.150
equation? Please answer yes or no.
