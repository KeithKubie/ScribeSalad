00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now the Udacity offices are in Palo Alto, CA, which is very close to San Francisco.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
San Francisco is notorious for its hills and the difficulty of parking.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
When you pull up to a spot in San Francisco, you have to pull your emergency brake

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and that locks the tires and prevents them from rotating.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The force that keeps you from sliding down the hill though is actually what's called the force of friction.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And that exists between the tires and the road.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I didn't draw the arrow coming from down there, but that's really where the force exists.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now obviously friction can only do so much.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Obviously if you park your car on a hill that's completely vertical, well, you're in trouble.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Friction is not going to provide enough force to prevent you from  falling down the hill.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
On the other hand, if you park in a pretty gentle hill you should be fine.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I want to know what's the angle where your car is going to slip.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
There must be one. Let's figure out what it is.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So let's say for your tires and this road surface

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the force of friction  has a maximum value of 80% of the car's weight.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I want to know what is the steepest angle hill, and this is what angle I'm talking about here,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that you can safely park on, so if the hill got any steeper you're in trouble when the car falls down.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Enter your answer here in degrees.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
If you're not sure what to do go back to the previous lesson

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and learn some more about inclined planes.

00:01:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And if you're still confused, go to the forums. I understand this is quite a tricky question.
