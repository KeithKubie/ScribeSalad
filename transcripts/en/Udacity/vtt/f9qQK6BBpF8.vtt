00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.840
I now like to begin looking at how you're going to deal with, you, and

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.220
you'll know, relationships that show up in your analysis model.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.080
In your ultimate program, there aren't any, direct representations of those,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.840
particular relationships, so during design you need to

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.560
come up with a strategy for how you're going to deal with them. First one we

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.620
like to look at is generalization. Now, object oriented programming languages

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.360
have a feature called inheritance, and I want to take a minute to describe to

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.670
you the differences between inheritance and generalization, because it can

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.260
get you into trouble if you just routinely treat one as the same as the other.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.470
First off, Generalization is an abstraction between two classes that mean that

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.530
all instances of the child class are also instances of the parent class.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.890
Inheritance, on the other hand, is an implementation technique, whereby messages

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.080
sent to a child may be delegated to a parent. You can use inheritance to,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.410
implement Generalization, but you have to be careful how you do it.
