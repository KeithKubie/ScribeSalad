yeah generally the whole point of SP is

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:38.140
yeah generally the whole point of SP is
 

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.590
yeah generally the whole point of SP is
so that it acknowledges the system-wide

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:40.600
so that it acknowledges the system-wide
 

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.980

the size large medium or small and that
 

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:56.490
the size large medium or small and that
could be related to the system font size

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:56.500
could be related to the system font size
 

00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:00.240
could be related to the system font size
as well so I might and that's what it

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:00.250
as well so I might and that's what it
 

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:02.100
as well so I might and that's what it
kind of asking for yeah it's probably

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:02.110
kind of asking for yeah it's probably
 

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:03.900

see it in like news reading apps and so

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:03.910
see it in like news reading apps and so
 

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:05.520
see it in like news reading apps and so
now that they'll quite commonly have a

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:05.530
now that they'll quite commonly have a
 

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:07.710
now that they'll quite commonly have a
text size option that you bump it up a

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:07.720
text size option that you bump it up a
 

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.960
text size option that you bump it up a
little bit if you like it so I guess

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:09.970
little bit if you like it so I guess
 

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:11.490
little bit if you like it so I guess
that's what the users are requesting so

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:11.500
that's what the users are requesting so
 

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:13.680
that's what the users are requesting so
yeah beyond so you could say hey go to

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:13.690
yeah beyond so you could say hey go to
 

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:16.200
yeah beyond so you could say hey go to
settings and change this setting if they

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:16.210
settings and change this setting if they
 

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:17.310

don't to change the font size of their
 

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.870
don't to change the font size of their
entire device and they just want to

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880
entire device and they just want to
 

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.950
entire device and they just want to
change it your application

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.960
change it your application
 

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.480
change it your application
that's fair enough I could understand

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:21.490
that's fair enough I could understand
 

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:22.650
that's fair enough I could understand

two options so think about yeah we're
 

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:29.760
two options so think about yeah we're
going to make sense for your app whether

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:29.770
going to make sense for your app whether
 

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:37.800

got the end on that side so yeah so open

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:28.150
got the end on that side so yeah so open

garden stopped doing the NFC and they're

00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:31.090
garden stopped doing the NFC and they're
 

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:34.320
garden stopped doing the NFC and they're
just doing the Bluetooth only mmm or

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:35.950
communicating and that's where they open

up a VPN tunnel between all the

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:38.170
up a VPN tunnel between all the
 

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:40.200
up a VPN tunnel between all the
different devices and they measure the

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:40.210
different devices and they measure the
 

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:41.640
different devices and they measure the
output and they share the bandwidth

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:41.650
output and they share the bandwidth
 

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.350
output and they share the bandwidth
between them so if another device comes

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:43.360
between them so if another device comes
 

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.280
between them so if another device comes
on and

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:44.290
on and
 

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:46.290
on and

using whatever HSPA or whatever it'll

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:50.410
using whatever HSPA or whatever it'll
 

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:52.830
using whatever HSPA or whatever it'll
they'll share bandwidth and go back and

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:52.840
they'll share bandwidth and go back and
 

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.510
they'll share bandwidth and go back and
forth if only one has it they'll all do

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:54.520
forth if only one has it they'll all do
 

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.640
forth if only one has it they'll all do
it and since it's a VPN tunnel it only

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:56.650
it and since it's a VPN tunnel it only
 

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:58.730
it and since it's a VPN tunnel it only
looks like it's coming from that device

00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:58.740
looks like it's coming from that device
 

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:03.210
looks like it's coming from that device

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:03.220
okay the extra question is just learned
 

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.830

internships in Europe I'm guessing a

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480
internships in Europe I'm guessing a
 

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.440

Google as user experience so I don't

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:13.450
Google as user experience so I don't
 

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:14.760
Google as user experience so I don't
think anyone here knows I think if you

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:14.770
think anyone here knows I think if you
 

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:17.160
think anyone here knows I think if you
go to a little contrast jobs yeah Google

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:17.170
go to a little contrast jobs yeah Google
 

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:19.200
go to a little contrast jobs yeah Google
adjusters then go to the internship

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:19.210
adjusters then go to the internship
 

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:20.730
adjusters then go to the internship
section I'll have all the details I

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:20.740

don't know where the internships land
 

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.330
don't know where the internships land
but there certainly is use experience in

of the question in the chat string so I

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520
of the question in the chat string so I
 

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.970
of the question in the chat string so I
have one question

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:34.980
have one question
 

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:39.210
have one question
if we extend application class sometimes

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:39.220
if we extend application class sometimes
 

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.830
if we extend application class sometimes
when we clear the activities from the

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:40.840
when we clear the activities from the
 

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.860
when we clear the activities from the
stack by pressing the back button and we

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:43.870
stack by pressing the back button and we
 

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:46.020
stack by pressing the back button and we
then launch the app sometimes the last

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:46.030
then launch the app sometimes the last
 

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.970
then launch the app sometimes the last
instance of the application class is

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:47.980
instance of the application class is
 

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:51.410
instance of the application class is
still there but the application object

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:51.420
still there but the application object
 

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.400
still there but the application object
stays alive for as long as the process

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:53.410
stays alive for as long as the process
 

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:57.720
stays alive for as long as the process
alive so it's singleton so yeah there's

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:57.730
alive so it's singleton so yeah there's
 

00:40:57.730 --> 00:40:58.680
alive so it's singleton so yeah there's
not much else to say other than that

00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:58.690
not much else to say other than that
 

00:40:58.690 --> 00:40:58.980
not much else to say other than that
really

00:40:58.980 --> 00:40:58.990
really
 

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:02.250
really
umm I'd wonder why are you trying to why

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:02.260
umm I'd wonder why are you trying to why
 

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.100
umm I'd wonder why are you trying to why
this is affecting your app and because

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:05.110
this is affecting your app and because
 

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.900
this is affecting your app and because
even if the state you're trying to keep

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:06.910
even if the state you're trying to keep
 

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:08.850
even if the state you're trying to keep
is specific to an activity that you

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:08.860
is specific to an activity that you
 

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:12.600
is specific to an activity that you
should be activating an application yeah

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:12.610
should be activating an application yeah
 

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:15.930
should be activating an application yeah
so only keep sort of global stuff that's

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:15.940
so only keep sort of global stuff that's
 

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.730
so only keep sort of global stuff that's
you don't care the lifetime live really

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:17.740
you don't care the lifetime live really
 

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.460
you don't care the lifetime live really
in application just of like a she is not

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:20.470
in application just of like a she is not
 

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:25.440
in application just of like a she is not
constant you can always empty the back

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:25.450
constant you can always empty the back
 

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:29.220
constant you can always empty the back
stack yeah I think the question is more

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:29.230
stack yeah I think the question is more
 

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:32.490
stack yeah I think the question is more
about why sometimes application keeps

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:32.500
about why sometimes application keeps
 

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:36.750
about why sometimes application keeps
alive then why it doesn't so when you

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:36.760
alive then why it doesn't so when you
 

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.280
alive then why it doesn't so when you
press back and lock but I say what

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:38.290
press back and lock but I say what
 

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:39.750
press back and lock but I say what
you're reporting is expected behavior

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760
you're reporting is expected behavior
 

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.730
you're reporting is expected behavior
but yeah it's probably that it doesn't

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:41.740
but yeah it's probably that it doesn't
 

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:45.210
but yeah it's probably that it doesn't
work as you imagine it works BEC isn't

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:45.220
work as you imagine it works BEC isn't
 

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:49.230
work as you imagine it works BEC isn't
closed from McKee's it's always the same

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.240
closed from McKee's it's always the same
 

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.410
closed from McKee's it's always the same
problem when you when you talk to

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420
problem when you when you talk to
 

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.200
problem when you when you talk to
Android developer starting the

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:54.210
Android developer starting the
 

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:56.640
Android developer starting the
difference between the home and the back

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:56.650
difference between the home and the back
 

00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:57.630
difference between the home and the back
button in

00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:57.640
button in
 

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.309
button in
I think the activity is close when you

00:41:59.309 --> 00:41:59.319
I think the activity is close when you
 

00:41:59.319 --> 00:42:03.569
I think the activity is close when you
put back or home you have to watch the

00:42:03.569 --> 00:42:03.579
put back or home you have to watch the
 

00:42:03.579 --> 00:42:06.839
put back or home you have to watch the
video when you download the apk yeah of

00:42:06.839 --> 00:42:06.849
video when you download the apk yeah of
 

00:42:06.849 --> 00:42:23.750
video when you download the apk yeah of
the lifecycle

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760
 

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:31.230
I was just asking like if if have a

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.240
I was just asking like if if have a
 

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.910
I was just asking like if if have a
stack of activities and I've convinced

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:32.920
stack of activities and I've convinced
 

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.710
stack of activities and I've convinced
me to press it back when all the

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720
me to press it back when all the
 

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:37.200
me to press it back when all the
equities from the stack and where all

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:37.210
equities from the stack and where all
 

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:38.220
equities from the stack and where all
the activities are cleared my

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:38.230
the activities are cleared my
 

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:39.779
the activities are cleared my
application gets closed and then I

00:42:39.779 --> 00:42:39.789
application gets closed and then I
 

00:42:39.789 --> 00:42:42.059
application gets closed and then I
realize the application the instance of

00:42:42.059 --> 00:42:42.069
realize the application the instance of
 

00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:45.240
realize the application the instance of
my last instance of application class is

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:45.250
my last instance of application class is
 

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.880
my last instance of application class is
still there I mean like when I come back

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:47.890
still there I mean like when I come back
 

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:50.490
still there I mean like when I come back
all the values which is like radius link

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:50.500
all the values which is like radius link
 

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.769
all the values which is like radius link
to the application object are still

00:42:52.769 --> 00:42:52.779
to the application object are still
 

00:42:52.779 --> 00:42:56.809
to the application object are still
there that's right that's correct yeah

00:42:56.809 --> 00:42:56.819
there that's right that's correct yeah
 

00:42:56.819 --> 00:43:01.259
there that's right that's correct yeah
expected okay that's expected behavior

00:43:01.259 --> 00:43:01.269
expected okay that's expected behavior
 

00:43:01.269 --> 00:43:06.390
expected okay that's expected behavior
yeah that's so that the when you launch

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400
yeah that's so that the when you launch
 

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.160
yeah that's so that the when you launch
the app again it's in the cache it'll

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:08.170
the app again it's in the cache it'll
 

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:10.220
the app again it's in the cache it'll
it's faster next time isn't it correct

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:10.230
it's faster next time isn't it correct
 

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:12.390
it's faster next time isn't it correct
yeah I know it'll do those things to try

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400
yeah I know it'll do those things to try
 

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.339
yeah I know it'll do those things to try
and keep and activities and applications

00:43:14.339 --> 00:43:14.349
and keep and activities and applications
 

00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:16.319
and keep and activities and applications
around and kill them when it's got

00:43:16.319 --> 00:43:16.329
around and kill them when it's got
 

00:43:16.329 --> 00:43:20.880
around and kill them when it's got
memory pressures yeah so if you actually

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:20.890
memory pressures yeah so if you actually
 

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:22.620
memory pressures yeah so if you actually
need to force those brownies to reset

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:22.630
need to force those brownies to reset
 

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:25.470
need to force those brownies to reset
just grab them on pause or somewhere

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480
just grab them on pause or somewhere
 

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:29.789
just grab them on pause or somewhere
further down the lifecycle and reset

00:43:29.789 --> 00:43:29.799
further down the lifecycle and reset
 

00:43:29.799 --> 00:43:30.180
further down the lifecycle and reset
