00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.864
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.940
SPEAKER 1: Quite
simply, Jancis is

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.960
one of the most respected
wine writers and wine critics

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.300
in the world today.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.590
She's been writing about
wine for more than 40 years.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.000
She writes daily for her
website, JancisRobinson.com.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.950
She's the FT's
wine correspondent

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.150
and has written more
than 20 books about wine.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.320
In 1984, she was the
first person outside

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.410
of the wine trade to become
a master of wine, which

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.760
is quite a tough thing to do.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.740
And she sits on the Royal
Household Wine Committee,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.220
where she chooses
wine for the queen.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.310
And she was also awarded
an OBE for her services

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.470
to the wine industry.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.310
JANCIS ROBINSON:
That's brilliant.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.720
SPEAKER 1: It's just
a brief summary.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.540
JANCIS ROBINSON: But it's
accurate, which is amazing.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.640
SPEAKER 1: And today she's
here to talk about her latest

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.670
book, which is "The
24-Hour Wine Expert,"

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.030
and also an online
course on a platform

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.290
called Udemi around
mastering wine.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.200
Oh yes, so you'll find
details on a little green slip

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.010
on your seats.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.030
So you started your career
writing for the wine trade, so

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.190
magazines like Wine and Spirit.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.360
And you've written many
books that are like a Bible

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.600
or encyclopedias
of the wine world,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.496
such as "Oxford Companion
to Wine or Wine Grapes."

00:01:34.496 --> 00:01:35.870
Can you tell us
about the journey

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.100
from that to this,
which is quite

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.330
a beginner's guide to wine?

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.820
JANCIS ROBINSON: Sure.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.070
Well, "The 24-Hour Wine
Expert" came about really

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.760
via our 24-year-old
daughter, Rose.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.920
She was between jobs, and she
was fed up with all her friends

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.940
who had masses of
questions about wine

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.350
and kept saying to her,
your mother's a wine writer.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.430
You must know the answer.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.660
And so she decided that
she would write a guide

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.880
to wine for her age group.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.220
And she went about it in
a very sensible way, which

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.050
was to have a kind of focus
group for all her friends,

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.140
well lubricated by my
wine tasting leftovers,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.160
and said to them, what would
you want in a guide to wine,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.740
and made a record of all
the questions they had

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.390
and the topics that they
wanted to have covered.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.820
And then she was offered
a nice job on Vogue,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.320
so she didn't-- she's
now at Refinery 29.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.640
And so she abandoned the idea.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.510
But I'm from the north of
England, so I don't like waste.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.160
I decided-- oh, no.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.530
So that was one
reason that I did it.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.810
The other reason--
you're filming this,

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.060
aren't you, so I've got
to be a bit tactful.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.140
The other reason is that
a contemporary Dutch wine

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.990
writer that I know had
written a book in Holland that

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.490
was a big success there called
"Wine Expert in a Weekend."

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.940
And he was very keen
that there would

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.250
be an English version of it and
that we would do this together.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.910
And I was far too busy
doing "The Oxford Companion

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.972
to Wine"-- the fourth
edition came out last year--

00:03:21.972 --> 00:03:23.430
to sort of really
take it on board.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.730
And he kept nagging
me, nagging me.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.710
Finally, I read his book, or
an English translation of it,

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.430
and I didn't think
it was quite right.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.530
It was sort of aimed at quite a
middle aged to elderly couple,

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.610
and he told them
go into the store

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.030
and buy that and then do that.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.180
But by this stage, he was
really in the heavy nagging,

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.920
so I sort of had
to do something.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.960
And so I decided that I
would do it completely

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.860
from scratch, my way.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.750
But I have to
acknowledge that he was

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.650
the one who nagged me into it.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.832
So it's a kind of
two-pronged attack.

00:04:03.832 --> 00:04:05.290
SPEAKER 1: Big
thanks to him, then.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.706
JANCIS ROBINSON:
Yes, [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:06.706 --> 00:04:09.720
SPEAKER 1: And what sort of an
audience did you have in mind?

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.630
JANCIS ROBINSON: Very, very--
sometimes some of my wine geeky

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.070
friends say, how did
you manage to get

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.240
the whole of the million-word
"Oxford Companion to Wine"

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.490
into that little book?

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.940
It's not the idea at all.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.510
It's got nothing to do with
my great big reference books.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:31.550
It's for people who really
like to drink wine, and want

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.310
a shortcut to the essentials
of wine, not wine geeks.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.800
If people want to get
further into it, that's fine.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.870
There's no shortage of
other sources of material.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.880
But this is just the essentials,
and the most common things,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.480
the practical things
that people want to know.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.720
So it does lean
heavily on Rose's list.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:00.080
And I've never produced a book
that's as cheap as that-- 4.99.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.030
It's ridiculous.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.567
It is coming out in
America in September.

00:05:06.567 --> 00:05:08.650
And the American publishers
are putting a hardback

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.700
on it, which seems
a bit weird to me.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.700
SPEAKER 1: It's so thin.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.292
JANCIS ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:05:13.292 --> 00:05:17.910
It really does fit into a pocket
or a bag or whatever, yeah.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.786
SPEAKER 1: Well, I've
done the course online.

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:21.118
JANCIS ROBINSON: The online one.

00:05:21.118 --> 00:05:22.400
SPEAKER 1: The online course.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.350
And I really loved that it
was just a practical guide.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.630
And I will say that it was also
a great way for me to clarify

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.000
all the silly questions
that I had in my head

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.750
and I'm not quite brave
enough to ask other people.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.690
But you certainly
answered them for me.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:48.650
So I thought maybe we could go
into like a myth-busting game

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.610
for wine.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.230
So these are the things that
you taught me on the course.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.880
So let's start with number
one, which is tasting wine.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.530
So you go into a restaurant,
and you get a little sample

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.000
to taste.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.740
The purpose of that is so
I can see if I actually

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.980
like the wine or not.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.320
JANCIS ROBINSON: That is
definitely not the reason.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.690
You are not allowed to send
a wine back just because you

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.330
don't like it.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.280
The purpose of that
giving you a taste

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.580
is twofold, for you
to check two things.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.680
Well, first of all, they
show you the bottle.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.430
If it's a decent
place, they should.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.670
And they should show it to you
with the label fully exposed

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.920
so you can check the name
of the wine and the vintage,

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.440
and that they're
always the same.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.920
It's amazing how often they
give you another vintage.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.670
SPEAKER 1: Really?

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.170
JANCIS ROBINSON: Because it's
the next one on or something.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.090
It's not always worse, but
it's amazing how inaccurate

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:48.030
some wine lists are.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.750
So you're checking that
it's what you ordered.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.660
You're checking-- they should
open it in front of you,

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.300
because there have been
instances of people ordering

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.290
very expensive bottles
and then the bottle

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.600
is brought to you
already opened.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.220
And in an old-fashioned
unscrupulous place,

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:13.330
sometimes they would put an
inferior wine in that bottle.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:18.430
Then you take a smell
of it, and you're just

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.310
checking that it's
not at all moldy,

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.020
that it's fresh and fruity,
because if it's stoppered

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:31.660
with a natural cork, sometimes,
in about 3% of cases,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.240
sometimes, it will
have a cork taint.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.330
It will have been
tainted by a moldy cork.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.400
If it's a really
bad case, it will

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.990
smell unappetizing and
moldy, and you just

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.600
won't want to drink it.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.480
Trouble is that cork
taint comes in degrees,

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.230
and you can get a mild
cork-tainted wine,

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:58.330
which possibly only the wine
maker would know was tainted.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.930
You will have a mouthful of it
and say, it's not very fruity,

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.570
it's not great, but it
hasn't got an obvious fault.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.000
So you have to be a real
confident professional

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.590
to send back a bottle that's
got a mild cork taint,

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.340
and you've really got to know
how the wine should taste.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.020
But basically it's to check that
it hasn't got a really bad cork

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.030
taint.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.530
And then it's also to check,
which you can do either

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.940
by having a mouthful-- and cork
taint should be perceptible

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.250
just on the nose, as we say.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.260
But if you have a mouthful,
or feel the glass,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.840
you can check whether the
wine's at the right temperature,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.220
because wine is amazingly
sensitive to temperature.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.260
We can come onto
that a bit later.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.940
And very, very often
in a restaurant

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:44.750
they serve red wines too
warm, because they've

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.330
read that red wine should
be warmer than white.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.760
And if a wine gets too
warm, even a red wine,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.890
it loses its refreshment factor.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.030
It's sort of heavy and soupy.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:59.070
And very, very often we ask
for an ice bucket, actually,

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.209
for a red wine,
especially if it's

00:09:01.209 --> 00:09:02.750
in a place where
they've been keeping

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.920
the red wine above
the bar or next

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.050
to the kitchen or something.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.540
Or if it's a white
wine, they often

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.890
chill it very, very
fiercely, because they've

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.820
read that white wine
should be chilled.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.440
And if something is too
cold, whatever it is,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.140
you can't actually
smell anything.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.940
So if they're serving you a
white wine and it's too cold,

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.530
then just say, please don't
put it in an ice bucket.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.520
Leave it on the table,
that kind of thing.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.890
So that's what you're checking.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.250
But you're not allowed just to
say, nah, I don't like this,

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.480
because they've opened it.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.160
And I'm saying this because
my husband was a restaurateur.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
Our son is now a restaurateur.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.980
So I have a slight--
they'll be out of pocket

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.430
if you just send it back.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:48.970
SPEAKER 1: OK, another one.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:53.090
I'm looking at a wine list
and I've been told in the past

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:55.230
that you don't want to
choose the cheapest one.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.230
You don't want to choose
the most expensive one.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:01.880
Choose the second least
expensive bottle of wine.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.070
JANCIS ROBINSON: That's
sort of an urban myth,

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.710
or it's a very common
myth that the cleverest

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.500
choice is the second
one, the second cheapest.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.380
And all restaurateurs know
that, so they put the wine

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.670
with the highest profit
margin second on the list.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.880
So it's not clever
to choose the second.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.230
What is clever--

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.310
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.410
JANCIS ROBINSON: And
especially nowadays,

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:30.900
when we have so many
waiting staff who

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.770
are enthusiastic
about wine, and quite

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.430
a lot of heavily
trained wine enthusiasts

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.920
as wine waiters or
just restaurant staff,

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.390
ask their advice.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.000
I do.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.860
I'm probably the
person in London

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:50.470
who asks more advice from
sommeliers than anybody.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:54.000
There's almost an inverse
rule that almost the more you

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.910
know about wine,
the less embarrassed

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.322
you are about asking about
it, and the less you know,

00:10:59.322 --> 00:11:01.790
you think, ooh, I don't want
to show off my ignorance,

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.550
so, oh, I see that
name on there.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.480
I've heard of Chablis.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.110
I'll go for that, whereas
the wine professionals will

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:09.920
look down a wine
list and go, I know

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.120
that, I know that-- oh, I've
never heard of this Ecuadorian

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.810
lesser-spotted thing.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.600
I'll ask for that.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.070
But then you would say to the
waiter, have you tasted this?

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:21.730
What's it like?

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:26.480
Or you spot something else,
is that too old, or is it--

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.920
so they want to share
their knowledge.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.980
In the old days, wine
used to be served

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:40.090
by underpaid elderly
waitstaff, often not speaking

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.690
very good English, whose
kind of defense mechanism

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:46.220
was to be snooty, and didn't
really know very much.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.790
It was a waste of time
asking them for advice.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.350
But now the wait
staff are much more

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.090
likely to be young,
enthusiastic,

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:56.270
and knowledgeable, and would
love to discuss your wine

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.620
choices with them.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.120
SPEAKER 1: I've
personally graduated

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.170
from saying, can you
recommend a red, to saying,

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.016
I really like pinots--

00:12:05.016 --> 00:12:06.890
JANCIS ROBINSON: That's
the best thing, yeah.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:10.450
The first question of a good
som will be, what do you like?

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:12.030
What do you normally
like drinking?

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.480
And don't be ashamed
of saying, I don't

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.720
want to spend more than x.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.520
That just helps them.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.910
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.162
One last one, which is all
wine gets better with age.

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:27.870
JANCIS ROBINSON: That's
definitely wrong.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:37.580
By volume, probably about 95%
of the wine sold in this country

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.530
does not get better with age.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.114
I'm talking volume here, not
by the number of listings

00:12:45.114 --> 00:12:46.030
or anything like that.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.670
But the big sellers
are mass-market bottles

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:54.230
that are put on the
supermarket shelf

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.790
straight from the bottling line.

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.460
Their stock in trade
is youthful fruitiness.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.410
And they're not made to last.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:06.870
So drink them, whatever
color, even reds-- no point

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.080
in cellaring most of them.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.620
One great variety that can
age reasonably well-- two

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.780
that I think of--
Riesling among whites.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:20.830
No hurry to drink
that, generally.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.860
And Cabernet
Sauvignon among reds.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.580
That will last reasonably well.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.900
But the commercial
stuff, don't age it.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:35.180
But most of the wines that
I write about are designed

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.950
to age, do improve with age.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.760
But they're-- I have to
admit that by volume,

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:45.680
they're the top 5% of interest
to me, and I hope my readers.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.020
But Blossom Hill is not very
interesting to write about.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.012
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:52.008 --> 00:13:54.310
SPEAKER 1: You taste how many--

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.860
JANCIS ROBINSON: I think it's
about 10,000 wines a year.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.980
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.490
OK, so you're definitely
the right person

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:02.520
to answer this question.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:10.390
What regions do you think
are underrated today in terms

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.040
of quality and/or value?

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.720
Maybe you can tell us
about a white and a red.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.580
JANCIS ROBINSON:
Well, to get value,

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.510
go for unfashionable wines.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.050
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.520
JANCIS ROBINSON: And
it's just starting

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.330
to catch up, but only
just, so it's still

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.300
a great value-- Muscadet had
a period out in the wilderness

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.190
where it was thought of
as having no character.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.770
And it's having a wonderful
renaissance at the moment,

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.460
and it's had a couple
of nice vintages.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.090
'12 was a great vintage,
'14, '15 good vintages.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:45.900
And it lasts.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:46.570
It ages.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.580
It's made from a grape which
is a cousin of chardonnay,

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.850
and it's serious wine.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.260
It's just that it hasn't
got a serious reputation.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.820
So Muscadet is one.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:01.052
In fact, so low are the prices
that Muscadet farmers are going

00:15:01.052 --> 00:15:02.260
out of business all the time.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.670
So they need you.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.080
Please support them.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.020
And the wines are not expensive.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.590
Beaujolais is the sort of red
wine equivalent of Muscadet.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.360
After the success of
Beaujolais nouveau,

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.000
we all fell out of
love with Beaujolais.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.520
But nowadays they're
not making it

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.690
as a nouveau sort of
accelerated style.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.650
They're making it as proper
red wine, still not expensive.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:28.430
So those are obvious
French bargains.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.980
What people don't
generally realize

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:36.750
is that Bordeaux makes most of
the most expensive red wines

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.270
in the world, but makes
so much wine that there

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:42.440
is brilliant value at the
bottom, at what they call

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.500
petite chateaus, sort
of little properties

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.170
that aren't famous ones.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.910
I mean, I have a wine of
the week on the website

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.950
every Friday, and I
had one the other day,

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.110
it was from the
Wine Society, which

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:57.080
is a great place to buy wine,
because it's a co-operative.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.740
They're not in the
market to make money.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:06.380
And they had a 2009
Medoc for under 10 pounds

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.750
a bottle that was just
gorgeous, because 2009

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:12.890
was a very ripe vintage, so
it's drinking beautifully now.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.680
So that's France.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.620
South African wine
generally is underpriced,

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.660
and I think that although
South Africans think

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.410
they're better at
making reds than whites,

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:25.690
I think they're better at
making whites than reds.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:31.020
And because they get that cold
current up from the South Pole,

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.170
they're good at keeping
natural freshness in the wine.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:40.610
So I think South African
whites are very good.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:44.530
And actually Chile
is very good value.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.660
There's a lot of rather
boring, particularly red,

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.950
wine from Chile.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.840
But it's very dependable.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:56.200
If you're in, I don't know,
a Travelodge somewhere you

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.870
don't want to be, with a
not very good wine list,

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:05.730
then Chile would be probably
the most reliable choice.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.069
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:13.510
So recently Decanter,
the magazine,

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.530
published some
articles, or there

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:20.880
was a lot of press about a
blind taste test of, I think,

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:27.280
16,000 bottles, and the winner
was Asda, the supermarket wine.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:32.700
And it was a Malbec retailing
at 4 pounds, 37 pence.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.110
JANCIS ROBINSON:
Well, the winner

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.580
was Asda's PR department--

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.876
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:37.876 --> 00:17:40.800
JANCIS ROBINSON: --rather
than the wine, really.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:46.250
They put the most amazing
spin on-- this wine,

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:47.981
I think it normally
retails at 6.99,

00:17:47.981 --> 00:17:49.480
and when they did
the publicity they

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.260
put it on special promotion.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.620
And it did-- I'm not involved
with the Decanter World Wine

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:55.670
Awards.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.020
Magazines nowadays are finding
it very, very difficult

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.600
to make money because
subscriptions and ad

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.291
revenues are down.

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:04.457
Don't need to tell you this.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:12.320
But one good money spinner
is to organize competitions,

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.130
because they charge
quite a lot to enter.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:19.370
And so every year they organize
the Decanter World Wine Awards,

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.360
and yes, there were
a lot of entries.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.670
But this Asda wine didn't
come top of the whole thing.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:29.000
It won one section.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.880
I haven't tasted it.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.080
But the corollary of that is
something which I actually say

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.120
very explicitly in the book.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.080
There is no direct relationship
between price and quality

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:40.940
with wine.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.390
There are lots of overpriced
wines, a few underpriced ones

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:48.757
that we've just mentioned,
and-- well, again, I

00:18:48.757 --> 00:18:50.840
don't have to tell you,
every marketing department

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.100
needs its segmentation
and its icon wine,

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.980
and then its premium wine.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:02.780
And they put the prices
up, not always, in my view,

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.530
because the wine is
better at the top.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.640
It's more, they've
spent more on it.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.760
They put it into
more new oak, say,

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.650
which increases the
production costs.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.460
But I very often, when
tasting a range of wines,

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:19.380
find myself preferring not-- my
favorite wine isn't necessarily

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.650
the most expensive.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.310
Often it's been
the most tarted up,

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.190
but not necessarily
the nicest to drink.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:30.282
SPEAKER 1: When we're
out in the supermarket

00:19:30.282 --> 00:19:34.160
or our favorite
independent wine merchant,

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.104
there must be some kind of a
minimum price level, though.

00:19:38.104 --> 00:19:39.020
JANCIS ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.330
SPEAKER 1: Can you
make-- for example,

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.770
what's your opinion on
supermarket wines in general?

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:48.020
JANCIS ROBINSON:
Well, in the '70s,

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:51.230
in the '80s in particular,
British supermarkets

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.000
were highly competitive
wine departments.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.360
And they saw wine as a
major way to bring footfall,

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.070
encourage footfall, and
they put a lot of effort

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:07.940
into optimizing the quality
of what was in the bottle.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:12.190
But in recent years--
not least because

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:16.510
we went through a period when
every year the duty went up,

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.400
but it was on a kind of rolling
thing, a sort of multiplier.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.230
So George Osborne could
get up, announce the budget

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.760
and say, as for wine
duty, no change.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.060
No change meant the
same old multiplier,

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.950
the same old
percentage increase.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:36.100
So the public didn't understand
that duty was going up.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.850
And so the supermarkets just
had to absorb the extra costs,

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.717
which meant that--
one of the reasons,

00:20:42.717 --> 00:20:45.050
although there are several
others, that the quality went

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:45.810
down and down.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.660
Also, they don't have
as much pride now.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:53.520
The wine buying teams in general
are sort of very much inferior

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.600
to the accountants.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.650
So I'm not nearly as excited
by the supermarket ranges

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:00.150
as at one stage I was.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:03.670
And I'm a big champion
of the mushrooming number

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.340
of independent wine retailers.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.470
Of course, they
can't buy in bulk.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:13.190
They can't give you a $4.99
bottle that you could even

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.960
think of enjoying.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.690
Probably the minimum
for something I think

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:24.090
would be probably 7 pounds.

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:27.150
Start at 7 pounds, or 6.99.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:30.422
And that sweet spot for when
you're not paying over the odds

00:21:30.422 --> 00:21:32.880
and you're sort of, with any
luck, getting what you pay for

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.410
is sort of between 7 and 17
pounds, something like that.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.899
And you're really
getting what you pay for.

00:21:40.899 --> 00:21:42.690
SPEAKER 1: Still quite
reasonable, I guess.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:43.490
JANCIS ROBINSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:43.870
SPEAKER 1: Seven pounds isn't--

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.680
JANCIS ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.550
And a good independent wine
store should be-- really,

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:52.530
there's so much
inexpensive wine around,

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.740
they should be choosing what
they're offering at the lowest

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.590
end carefully.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:01.930
SPEAKER 1: So as I've
learned to taste properly,

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:07.230
one of my challenges is-- so
there's sight, smell, taste.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:11.490
The last two steps, and in
particular flavor descriptors,

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.360
is something that I
find quite amusing,

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.170
because I read
descriptions and I'm just

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.500
unable to quite get there.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.000
And then you read descriptions
that are frankly ridiculous,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.880
like in that documentary som,
they talk about, what is it,

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.460
a freshly cut garden hose.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.700
I don't know, I've never smelled
something like that before.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:36.700
JANCIS ROBINSON: No, I--

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.260
SPEAKER 1: How do you train?

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:38.700
JANCIS ROBINSON:
How do you train?

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.710
Well, do you want to?

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:40.816
Do you need to?

00:22:40.816 --> 00:22:41.768
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:41.768 --> 00:22:42.720
SPEAKER 1: I guess so.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.845
JANCIS ROBINSON: All right.

00:22:43.845 --> 00:22:47.630
Well, it does help--
to remember flavors,

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.730
it helps to attach
words to them.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:51.890
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:54.260
JANCIS ROBINSON:
But I would say just

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.054
follow what it reminds you of.

00:22:56.054 --> 00:22:57.720
I mean, I don't think
it's any-- there's

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.840
no point in me saying--
I mean, I could

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.616
say this reminds me of x and y.

00:23:05.616 --> 00:23:06.990
But I wouldn't,
because we've all

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.640
got different tasting
equipment hidden

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.070
inside and different preferences
and different intolerances

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.160
and things that we can't
sense and things we're

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.030
particularly sensitive to.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:21.390
You're going to experience
something different.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:26.260
So I would just
try to concentrate.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.700
I mean, I've given in here
sort of my common descriptors

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:34.350
of various grapes are
as what might be a help.

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.990
But if there's something
that strikes you,

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:41.184
then try and remember it,
and look for it again.

00:23:41.184 --> 00:23:41.850
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.650
JANCIS ROBINSON: But
I'm lightly skeptical

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:48.410
about these tasting notes where
people-- and they exist-- where

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:53.750
people list 20 different
unrelated flavors

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:57.970
or aromas in a wine.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:03.810
Sometimes it just seems
as though-- I have never

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:06.380
tasted 20 different
things in a wine,

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.380
and I've tasted some
fantastic wines.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.940
I believe that
physiologists say it's

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.750
pretty impossible to
sense more than three

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.500
or four things in one substance.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.680
SPEAKER 1: So I have hope.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.670
JANCIS ROBINSON:
Yes, definitely.

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.880
SPEAKER 1: Top three
tips-- so from this book,

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.232
there are many tips.

00:24:29.232 --> 00:24:31.690
JANCIS ROBINSON: Well, I think
the first thing is to follow

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:33.570
your own likes and dislikes.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:36.900
There is no such thing
as rights and wrongs

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.040
in wine appreciation.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.580
It is just important to
discover what you like

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.430
and to follow that.

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:48.610
It is not wrong to
hate all red wines.

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:53.280
Most inconveniently, both of our
daughters only like white wine,

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.660
which is a pain
because 80% of the wine

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.410
that I taste, and I am sent a
heck of a lot of free samples,

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:02.140
is red.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:06.640
And I'd love to give it to them.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.250
And some people
have intolerances

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.570
to red wine or white
wine, that sort of thing.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:15.890
The second thing
is if you do want

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:21.400
to maximize your enjoyment of
wine, and learn a bit more,

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.520
I know I should say buy
my book, buy my course,

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.920
look at my website.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.880
In fact, there's a lot that's
free on JancisRobinson.com.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.600
About a third of it is
free, including a lot

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.920
of sort of basics of wine.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:39.770
But I think the most useful
thing to do practically

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:46.070
is to identify a local
independent wine merchant

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:48.690
and try to establish a
relationship with them,

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.520
a bit like you would
with a bookseller.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.220
I think there are strong
parallels between wine shops

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:54.539
and booksellers.

00:25:54.539 --> 00:25:56.330
And you know how you'd
go into a bookseller

00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:00.110
and say, I really enjoyed this
book, what would you recommend?

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:03.470
So go, say I really
like pinot noir,

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.440
not so sure about
California ones,

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.250
but what would you recommend?

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:11.250
And allow them to lead you on.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:13.590
It's in their interests
to give you good advice.

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.220
If they don't, then
try another store.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.430
But in London, we're
spoiled for choice.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.870
And that, I think is-- and
they love talking about it,

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.380
just the same way as
the wine waiters do.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.190
So capitalize on that.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.400
So that's two, isn't it.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:38.040
Tips-- I think also,
don't underestimate

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.280
the importance of temperature.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.766
A lot of reds taste nicer
if they're reasonably cool.

00:26:44.766 --> 00:26:46.432
SPEAKER 1: What's the
right temperature?

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.140
JANCIS ROBINSON:
Well, not a hot room.

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.600
Cool, straight from a
cellar sort of thing.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.010
SPEAKER 1: 17, 18?

00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:58.500
JANCIS ROBINSON:
But you're not going

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.640
to go around sticking a
thermometer in, are you?

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.240
Yeah, about 17.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:03.820
SPEAKER 1: I might, though.

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:04.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.860
JANCIS ROBINSON: Yeah, about 17.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.510
But sometimes down at 15.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:11.440
And it's only really
champagne and things

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.040
that you want to be
really cool, down to 10,

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.840
11, that kind of thing.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:21.340
And the fuller-bodied
the white, the warmer you

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:26.680
can serve it to encourage
the smells and the flavor.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.600
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:34.570
Old World versus New World, so
that sort of elitist attitude

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:38.686
that exists, particularly
maybe in Bordeaux or Burgundy.

00:27:38.686 --> 00:27:43.040
It feels that the playing
field is a lot more level now

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.215
than it was years ago.

00:27:45.215 --> 00:27:46.840
JANCIS ROBINSON:
Well, as I was saying,

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.660
my FT article tomorrow
is about this year

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:55.380
is the 40th anniversary
of the tasting that turned

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.960
the world of wine upside down.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:00.010
It was in Paris and it was
called the Judgment of Paris.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:01.630
And a friend of mine,
Steven Spurrier,

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:05.590
got a whole load of France's
top tasters together.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:08.660
He wanted to show
them these wines

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:13.000
that he'd found in California
that were really good.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.204
But at the last minute,
he realized none of them

00:28:15.204 --> 00:28:16.620
had tasted California
wine before,

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.220
and they might be
prejudiced if they knew.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.980
So he decided that he would
organize a blind tasting,

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.680
mixing them up with some of
France's most revered wines.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.730
And guess what?

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.080
They all preferred
the California ones.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.400
This was in 1976.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.810
They were absolutely--
they didn't believe it.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:37.710
They thought it
was a fluke result.

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:42.100
They said, oh, it's because
French wines need longer

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.550
to mature.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:46.340
And so he organized it
again 10 years later,

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.860
and Californians won again.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.240
So that showed, slowly,
because the Old World

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.660
was slow to accept it,
that New World wine

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:59.290
could be really very good.

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:03.520
And all sorts of
other developments--

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.950
the Australians had masses
of very highly trained wine

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:10.040
makers, and they swept through
Europe, particularly the sort

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.570
of underresourced
co-operative sellers,

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:16.200
teaching the gospel
of winery hygiene

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.640
and how to keep
the fruit in wine.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:22.480
So they upped the quality
of inexpensive Europe,

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.750
Old World wine
quite substantially.

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:30.620
And Old World producers,
their children,

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.730
the people who
are now in charge,

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:36.740
would routinely have a stint
in a New World, at least

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:40.260
one, if not several,
New World regions.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.800
But at the same time,
New World wine producers

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.830
got rather taken by
this notion of terroir

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:50.050
and started to get
fascinated about how

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:55.380
little local features actually
influence what's in the bottle.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:59.320
So the result of
all that has been

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.920
a massive drawing
together, really,

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:07.560
of Old World producers being
much more technically qualified

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.610
and having friends
throughout the New World,

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:12.180
and accepting that the
New World makes good wine,

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:15.880
and New Worlders actually
wanting their wines

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.320
to be more than just
technically perfect,

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.860
but to absorb some of the
best of the Old World.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:26.170
And they're rather envious
of all the tradition.

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:29.400
So it's not really
a battle anymore,

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.220
taking the best of both worlds.

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:35.540
SPEAKER 1: So In the future,
let's say 20 years out,

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.220
no real difference?

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.480
It's very much about
region and producers, even?

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.520
JANCIS ROBINSON: It's
all about specifics

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:46.550
and local, yes, nowadays, yeah.

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:49.520
SPEAKER 1: So one
of the things that

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:54.520
has helped me learn about wine
is the associations that you

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.660
make in the book.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.549
So if I like white burgundies--

00:30:59.549 --> 00:31:00.715
JANCIS ROBINSON: Yes, then--

00:31:00.715 --> 00:31:04.120
SPEAKER 1: Then what would I--
so maybe you can suggest a few.

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.680
So let's say I like
white burgundies,

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.630
but they're really expensive.

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:10.177
What are my alternative choices?

00:31:10.177 --> 00:31:12.010
JANCIS ROBINSON: OK,
well, the obvious thing

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.860
is to go for chardonnay,
which is the same grape,

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.460
and places that are
making wines really

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.180
quite like white burgundy.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.860
Australia, which used to
make these great big fat sort

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.610
of Bridget Jones type wines--

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:24.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:27.880
--has done a complete
volte face and is now

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.100
making very good copies of white
burgundy, in fact sometimes

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.090
almost too austere.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:35.730
So that would be
an obvious place.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:38.070
Also, South Africa's making
very good chardonnay,

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:39.780
as I said, well priced.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.590
And even Chile's got
some good chardonnay.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:44.640
And there's been a sea
change in California

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.600
whereby they're
making more and more--

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.880
they've still got some quite big
fat Chardonnays in California,

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.824
but some more
Burgundian ones as well.

00:31:51.824 --> 00:31:52.990
But they're quite expensive.

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.300
California wine's
quite expensive.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.144
SPEAKER 1: So let's
shift gears a bit.

00:31:58.144 --> 00:32:01.100
Googlers are a techie
bunch, and there's

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:05.390
been an explosion of
wine apps and websites.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:08.120
Do you think there's a place for
technology in the wine world?

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:08.980
JANCIS ROBINSON: Oh, yeah.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.396
Well, you just got
to look around.

00:32:10.396 --> 00:32:12.750
Everyone's using their
label-scanning apps.

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:18.500
And it's had a huge
effect on us wine writers.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.370
You know, there
was a time not that

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:25.890
long ago when there were
really just a handful of wine

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:30.920
authorities around the world,
and they'd sit on a pedestal

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:35.270
and hand down their
judgments on tablets of stone

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.370
and with scores, and everybody
would follow them slavishly.

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:40.880
Not anymore, which
actually is very healthy.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.040
I used to say what I wanted to
do in my working life was not

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.557
tell people what to like, but
give people enough information

00:32:47.557 --> 00:32:49.890
that they had the confidence
to make up their own minds.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.240
And that is happening
at a massive rate.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.410
And now that you
can share pictures

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:58.160
of what you're
drinking and people

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:02.620
are getting recommendations
from a much, much wider range

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:07.420
of recommenders, whether it's
friends, soms, the odd wine

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.320
writer.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.100
It's all much more democratic.

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:14.540
I wrote-- the review section,
it's called Life and Arts,

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:18.530
of the Financial
Times on a Saturday,

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:21.190
I think it was only last
September when the "New Oxford

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:22.150
Companion" came out.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.000
I wrote a piece
called something like,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.530
What Future for Expertise?

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.810
It's on my website, as well.

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:30.200
And it was a very,
very popular article,

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:34.820
because I think it was maybe
one of the few from somebody

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:39.400
who'd sort of made a reputation
in a field addressing

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:44.610
what it's like to exist
in a new landscape.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:45.620
It was interesting.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.210
SPEAKER 1: Do you
have any favorites?

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:47.730
JANCIS ROBINSON: Favorite--

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:49.005
SPEAKER 1: Whether it
be websites or apps?

00:33:49.005 --> 00:33:51.296
JANCIS ROBINSON: Of course
I've got a favorite website.

00:33:51.296 --> 00:33:52.696
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:52.724 --> 00:33:53.890
SPEAKER 1: Apart from yours.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.070
JANCIS ROBINSON: I don't
use label-scanning apps,

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:03.100
because it's my life.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:09.650
I kind of-- I think one of
my favorites, the site I

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:12.440
use the most, maybe
semiprofessionally,

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.639
but it's hugely useful
for any consumer,

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:19.600
is WineSearcher.com, which
is the price comparison.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:23.820
There's only one good wine
price comparison site,

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.136
WineSearcher.com.

00:34:25.136 --> 00:34:27.469
And funnily enough, it's based
in New Zealand, actually.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:31.070
It was set up by a guy
who built Berry Brothers'

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:34.639
website for them, and then went
back to his native New Zealand.

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:37.459
And it is-- honestly, it
can save you a fortune.

00:34:37.459 --> 00:34:39.250
And it's also very
interesting, because you

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:42.739
see the variation in prices in
different markets and things

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:44.110
like that.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:48.679
And the retailers have
to join, so it doesn't

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:50.320
list every single retailer.

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:53.440
But lists a heck of a
lot of them-- very good.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.139
And it gives you the average
price throughout the world,

00:34:57.139 --> 00:35:01.450
and you can search by market,
by country, and in the US

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:02.660
you can search by state.

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.350
And it's very good.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:06.080
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:09.010
So continuing with
the futuristic theme,

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:10.890
let's talk trends.

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:15.680
So these days, you hear a
lot about organic, natural,

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.080
biodynamic wines.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:22.392
Can you demystify what
it all means, please?

00:35:22.392 --> 00:35:24.100
JANCIS ROBINSON: Well,
organic, you know,

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:28.000
is quite straightforward,
minimizing agrochemicals.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.430
And I don't think I could
tell blind an organic wine

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:33.790
versus a conventionally
made wine.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:38.646
Biodynamic is--
sounds very weird.

00:35:38.646 --> 00:35:40.020
The operations
are done according

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.250
to the phases of
the moon, and it

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:45.870
involves sort of
tizan and little sort

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:49.200
of homeopathic
doses of chamomile

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.990
buried in a corner of a
vineyard in a cow horn.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:53.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.620
Honestly, and it sounds
completely crazy,

00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:00.410
and no one has
managed to advance

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:04.150
any scientific
explanation or reason.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:07.860
However, an awful lot of
very, very good wine producers

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.080
have adopted
biodynamic viticulture,

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:15.940
because it does seem to
result in vines and soil that

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:20.430
look so much healthier
and produce wines

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:23.610
that very often, in a
blind tasting I will think,

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.510
I think that's biodynamic.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:27.460
They have a sort of
extra vitality to them.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:31.840
I know this sounds
a bit weird, but it

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.790
could be that to obey
biodynamic strictures,

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:38.210
you have to pay such
a lot of attention

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:43.210
to each individual vine that
that is the consequence.

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:45.470
And it may not matter
that you are not following

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:47.400
the phase of the moon.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.720
That said, Burgundy is probably
the most traditional wine

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:56.220
region, and even everyone
in the younger generation

00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:01.030
knows that when the moon
is in a certain position,

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:03.780
the lees will be all
stirred up in the barrel,

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.900
so don't do your bottling then.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:09.540
And you wait until the
moon is in the right phase

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:10.420
to do your bottling.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:14.130
And that's just something
they've observed.

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:15.510
SPEAKER 1: And natural?

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:17.140
JANCIS ROBINSON:
Natural, [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:19.160
Natural is very
trendy, as you know.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.540
Natural means you haven't
really added anything,

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:28.850
and you glory in not adding
anything, which is great.

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:31.230
The only trouble in my book
is that it doesn't always

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.420
result in a good wine.

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.909
For me personally,
it's not enough

00:37:34.909 --> 00:37:35.950
that the wine is natural.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:37.366
First of all, it's
got to be good.

00:37:37.366 --> 00:37:39.690
If it can be good and
natural, that's fine.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.970
But there are still,
although the overall quality

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:44.790
of natural wine has been
increasing, there are still,

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:47.150
to me, a lot of
faulty natural wines

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:49.180
that taste like cider gone off.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:53.330
Or there's a particular
compound which apparently

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:55.870
only about a third of the
population is sensitive to,

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:58.820
and I can only assume that
the naturalistas are not

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.070
sensitive to it.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:04.300
It's sort of how you would
imagine an old rodent

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.539
cage smelling.

00:38:05.539 --> 00:38:07.834
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.250
And some of the
wines are like that,

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:14.550
so you've got to be a
bit careful, I think.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:17.820
But that said, there is a great
movement throughout the world

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.970
now for a new generation
wanting to make

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:23.290
not just copies of the old
classics, but new sorts

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:23.790
of wine.

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:26.110
And a lot of those are natural.

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:28.130
So I think it's great
that they exist.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:31.370
I think on a list, it helps
have them separated out

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:33.510
so you know what you're getting.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.880
So for instance,
our son puts them

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.880
on the list under
off-piste wines,

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.800
so you know that
they're different.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.330
Although funnily enough, I was
just this morning before coming

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:48.380
here I was reading through a
transcript of an interview that

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.490
a Polish wine writer
had done with me,

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:55.800
and he had written out, because
he'd had the same question,

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.220
so I explained about
off-piste wines,

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:02.695
and he'd written off-piste as
O-double-F, hyphen P-I-S-S-E-D.

00:39:02.695 --> 00:39:03.415
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:11.040
SPEAKER 1: I could ask
you many questions,

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.170
but maybe Googlers
in the room would

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:15.930
like to ask some questions.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:17.890
So please don't be shy.

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:18.430
Questions?

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:19.884
Whoa.

00:39:19.884 --> 00:39:21.154
You.

00:39:21.154 --> 00:39:23.070
JANCIS ROBINSON: I don't
think you need a mic.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:23.490
Yeah,

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:24.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I don't know
if I need a mic, either, but--

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.930
SPEAKER 1: Perhaps
for filming purposes.

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:26.720
JANCIS ROBINSON: Oh, yes, sorry.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.270
Sorry.

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:31.010
AUDIENCE: So I feel like I've
done many kind of wine 101s,

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:33.970
but I find the next
step quite scary.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:36.730
So do you pick a country, do
you learn about a country,

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:38.970
do you learn about
a specific region?

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:40.090
What about vintages?

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:42.120
So what do you recommend
for sort of 201

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.320
in terms of learning wine?

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.173
JANCIS ROBINSON: Do
you know the WSET?

00:39:47.173 --> 00:39:50.110
Wine and Spirit
Education Trust is

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.810
the-- I did all their
courses when I first started,

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.900
and it's the things that lead
up to the master of wine.

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:59.190
They're based in London,
although they're global now.

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:02.910
They're world's biggest
wine educating body,

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:06.780
and they have a series
of scaled courses.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.870
And a lot of them are evening.

00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:11.676
So I would look into those.

00:40:11.676 --> 00:40:14.410
On our website, under
the learn section,

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:16.560
we have something
called courses,

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:20.020
and we've got a long
list of wine educators

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.730
all around the world,
quite a lot in London.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.900
I think what I
like about WSET is

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.260
it's very-- they force
you to learn everything.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:38.500
You can't just follow what
happens to take your fancy.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.840
There's another good guy
called Michael Schuster

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:46.670
who gives regular wine courses
in Islington, actually.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.140
But have a look at a list there.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.720
Christy's do wine
courses, but they

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:55.330
tend to be a little bit just
very, very fine wines, really.

00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:58.196
And they tend to assume a
bit of knowledge, I think.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:08.450
AUDIENCE: How did you get
into the wine writing?

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:11.980
How did you transition
from Oxford mathematics

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.440
and philosophy into doing this?

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.310
JANCIS ROBINSON:
Well, when I graduated

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:20.880
it was way back in '71, when
the subjects of wine and food

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.800
were thought of as being
terminally frivolous.

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.410
So although I knew that I
was most interested in wine

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:29.230
and food even then,
I didn't dare say

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:31.430
to my friends I was going
into either of those,

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:35.920
because they'd have said, what
a waste of an Oxford education.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.320
So I spent three years
in the travel business,

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:39.570
because I like travel.

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:44.610
Then I dropped out to
France for a year, Provence,

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:46.630
surrounded by vineyards.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:48.140
And by that stage,
of course, I was

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.310
surrounded by people for
whom eating and drinking

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:53.290
is what life's all
about, in France.

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:58.340
And so I was determined that
when I got back to London,

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.510
I would find a job in
either wine or food.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:09.880
And as a little tangent, my
husband, the restaurateur--

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:13.090
I used to be a cook quite
a bit, but by the time

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:16.670
we had two children, in '84, my
husband, who at first couldn't

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:18.210
cook at all, but
having a restaurant

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:21.080
got fascinated by it, sort
of said, stand aside, madam.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.910
I will now do all the cooking,
and has done all the cooking

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:26.390
in our household ever since.

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:31.160
In one of our son's restaurants
last week, he basically

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.160
sent around an email
to the family saying,

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.930
hey, you'll never guess what.

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:38.430
This guy came in and said
that he interviewed mom

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:41.590
to be a cook in his wine bar.

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:44.190
And Rose then responded
by that saying,

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:46.620
was it a tarte
tatin-focused wine bar,

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.671
because that's the
one dish that I cook.

00:42:48.671 --> 00:42:50.435
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.380
But I was, at that
stage, looking

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:54.550
at food as well as wine.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:57.280
But I found this job
as assistant editor

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:04.690
of a wine trade magazine at
a dramatic reduction in pay.

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:06.420
But I learned on the job.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:08.930
I immediately signed
up for the WSET courses

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:12.520
so that I did actually have
some-- when I was interviewed,

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.000
the publisher said we're having
quite a lot of applications

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:15.700
for this job.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.283
We've having quite
a bit of difficulty

00:43:17.283 --> 00:43:19.290
choosing the right
person, because either we

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:22.220
choose a wine expert and have
to teach them how to write,

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:24.180
or we choose a
journalist and have

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.560
to teach them all about wine.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.309
He looked down at my
application and said,

00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:29.610
you, of course, are
neither of these things.

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:30.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.830
Nevertheless, you're the
favorite for the job.

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:35.470
And afterwards,
when I quizzed him,

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:41.050
he said it was because I'd
shown that I could organize

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:43.330
the skiing side of
Thomson Holidays,

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:46.650
and that I would organize--
what I didn't know,

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:48.860
I would organize myself.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.990
And I had done quite--
I'd been the restaurant

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:54.310
correspondent of ISIS
when I was at university

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:55.404
and things like that.

00:43:55.404 --> 00:43:57.070
And I'd written for
the Good Food Guide,

00:43:57.070 --> 00:44:01.524
so I think I wasn't
a total illiterate.

00:44:01.524 --> 00:44:03.190
And then it just went
nicely from there.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:07.840
It was great timing, because
I started in the end of '75,

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:15.280
just as the British were kind
of getting into wine and travel.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.210
AUDIENCE: What impact
do you think Brexit

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:19.520
will have on our beloved wine?

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:20.352
Sorry.

00:44:20.352 --> 00:44:21.310
JANCIS ROBINSON: Sorry.

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:25.050
No, I'm not a groaning at you.

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:27.560
Well, prices will go up.

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.190
All wine prices will go up.

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:34.560
A few of the more
savvy wine importers

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.600
bought currency
forward, but they're

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.970
going to go up eventually.

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:44.370
One short-term effect
was that London

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:47.850
is a center for fine wine
trading throughout the world.

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:53.130
We are an absolute--
Asia is catching up,

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:57.980
and as soon as we voted,
the fine wine traders here

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:02.510
were-- they're cleared out.

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:06.440
Well, as the pound plummeted,
rather, cleared out of stock.

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.210
The fine wine traders are
now desperate for stock,

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:12.647
busy calling around all
their customers saying, now

00:45:12.647 --> 00:45:13.480
is the time to sell.

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.450
We'll buy your wine
collection from you,

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:19.050
because they don't want
to have to go into Europe.

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.140
And a lot of French
Bordeaux [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:27.640
were plundering the collections
of British fine wine traders.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.690
Not good.

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:33.370
Oh, I did think of one
good thing, though.

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:41.830
The EU has a fund to promote
EU wine in non-EU countries.

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:43.020
So--

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.632
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:49.000
AUDIENCE: I'm a big
fan of your writing,

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.500
and I actually did a few courses
with Richard Hemming, who--

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:51.810
JANCIS ROBINSON: Oh, right.

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:52.270
Oh, good.

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:53.440
AUDIENCE: --so a big fan,
I'm really [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.920
And I recommend him, actually.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:56.660
If you can get him to do
courses, he's excellent.

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:57.640
JANCIS ROBINSON: I
don't even where-- where

00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:58.760
does he give his courses?

00:45:58.760 --> 00:45:59.870
He works for me,
but I don't know.

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:00.700
AUDIENCE: It was something
organized through,

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.239
I think it was the London
Wine Association or something.

00:46:03.239 --> 00:46:04.155
JANCIS ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:46:04.155 --> 00:46:04.890
AUDIENCE: LWA or something.

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:05.280
JANCIS ROBINSON: Yes.

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:05.420
AUDIENCE: Academy.

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:06.440
JANCIS ROBINSON: It
will be on that list,

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.580
anyway, and on the website.

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:08.922
And he's very nice, very easy.

00:46:08.922 --> 00:46:10.130
AUDIENCE: SPEAKER Super nice.

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:12.359
JANCIS ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:46:12.359 --> 00:46:14.150
AUDIENCE: I'm a big--
I buy most of my wine

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.785
through wine [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:14.785 --> 00:46:15.770
I really like it.

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:17.550
Is it like-- people
stock-- I don't

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:19.300
have any space for a
cellar, but I suppose

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:20.510
I could buy a bit more wine.

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:21.430
What do you think about--

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:23.510
JANCIS ROBINSON: Well, the
value place to store wine

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:24.510
is at the Wine Society.

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:27.562
AUDIENCE: So what I
was going to ask is,

00:46:27.562 --> 00:46:30.020
what is the value of doing
that, of building up, let's say,

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.580
a stock of a few
hundred bottles?

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:34.224
Nothing crazy, but
does it make sense?

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:36.890
I mean, are you saving money, or
are you just kind of just tying

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:40.286
up money in stuff that you've
going to save on later?

00:46:40.286 --> 00:46:42.160
JANCIS ROBINSON: Usually
you're saving money.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.290
I mean, the vintages, the
'09 and '10 and Bordeaux were

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:49.200
exceptions, which the Bordelaise
were desperate to get as much

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.000
money out of the Chinese as
possible and they overpriced

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.540
the wine.

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:57.440
Britain is not a very good
place to buy mature wine

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.820
by the single bottle in.

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:03.470
You can generally by it
by the dozen bottles.

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:10.550
So if you want to get your hands
on wine that's-- drink wine

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:15.070
when it's fully mature, then it
probably is a good idea to lay

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:16.329
it down, as they say.

00:47:16.329 --> 00:47:18.370
AUDIENCE: Always cheaper
than buying a sportscar.

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:19.828
JANCIS ROBINSON:
It's a lot cheaper

00:47:19.828 --> 00:47:21.520
than buying a
sportscar, much cheaper.

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.710
And it's sociable.

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:25.770
You can share it with your
friends more-- more friends

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:27.594
than a sportscar.

00:47:27.594 --> 00:47:29.380
AUDIENCE: Do you
think climate change

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.360
is going to have an
impact on which regions

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.650
are interesting to--

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:35.220
JANCIS ROBINSON: It's already
having quite a massive impact.

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:40.940
And in fact, one of the
approx 3,000 free articles

00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:43.590
on my website I
published quite recently

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:47.420
was specifically which regions
have been most affected,

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:49.220
and what have been the
most obvious effects

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:50.650
in the world of wine.

00:47:50.650 --> 00:47:55.680
One of the more obvious ones
is the poleward expansion

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:58.500
of the wine regions
of the world.

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.510
There's not too much
further the south

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:03.150
the Southern Hemisphere
wine regions can go

00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:04.960
before topping into the ocean.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:08.230
But countries that now have
thriving wine industries

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:12.430
include Denmark, Sweden,
Holland, Belgium,

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:16.380
England, and there's
even a vineyard in Norway

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:19.880
now, which has yet to
ripen a crop successfully,

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:22.270
but it has been planted.

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:24.260
So that's very obvious.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.240
Alcohol level's
going up, generally,

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:29.365
because of more, hotter summers.

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:35.050
And say somewhere like--
and then places running out

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:36.930
of water, terrible
water shortages

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:40.370
at times in California, and
particularly the inland areas

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:41.300
of Australia.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.930
Quite a lot of grape
farmers have given up

00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:48.110
in those inland, irrigated areas
because it's just too expensive

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:49.254
to buy the water rights.

00:48:49.254 --> 00:48:51.170
And there's also been a
problem with salinity,

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:54.435
so to get good quality water
is too much of a challenge.

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.590
And so in general, in
established wine regions,

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:03.710
there's a move for people
to find cooler areas.

00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:07.320
You see that in
Burgundy, for instance.

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.830
AUDIENCE: So in
Oxford, they're kind

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:11.390
of notorious that the
colleges have wine cellars.

00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:16.510
Have you ever been around them,
and which one has the best wine

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:17.010
collection?

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:17.885
JANCIS ROBINSON: Yes.

00:49:17.885 --> 00:49:20.380
The best one is
All Soul's, which

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:22.000
has no undergraduates at all.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.420
And I have been around that
one, and it is amazing.

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.950
I haven't been--
actually, I went round

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:31.780
to write an article for Wine and
Spirits, which I left in 1980.

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:36.050
So I'm not at all up to speed.

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:38.420
But we made a television
program about the cellars

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.640
at Lincoln, actually,
and it, like lots

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.760
of the Oxbridge
sellers, has sold off

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.140
a lot of vintage ports.

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:47.610
They used to serve a
lot of vintage port,

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:50.650
but don't anymore.

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:56.100
But as I understand it, the job
of wine steward at the Oxbridge

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.910
colleges is highly
sought after, and there's

00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:01.100
massive backstabbing to get it.

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:06.060
There are lots and lots
of tastings in Oxbridge.

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:08.340
The merchants, that's
one of the places

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:10.230
where you can sell fine wine.

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:13.750
So it is a good-- Oxbridge is
a good place to taste wine,

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:17.790
and certainly that was where
I was introduced to fine wine

00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:21.820
and had my seminal bottle of red
Burgundy, which made me realize

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:24.496
just how good wine could be.

00:50:28.869 --> 00:50:29.910
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:32.750
From a marketing perspective,
are there any tricks

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:35.670
that you have that
you'd use to make a wine

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:37.660
seem like it tastes better?

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:40.690
And I guess there's a
certain amount of ceremony

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:45.992
that can influence how
people perceive taste.

00:50:45.992 --> 00:50:47.700
And I don't know
whether that's something

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:49.960
that you address at
all, and the sort

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:54.620
of things that you do to
help anticipation of a taste

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:56.490
and anticipation is
something that actually

00:50:56.490 --> 00:50:58.900
does improve the taste.

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:02.260
JANCIS ROBINSON: Well, most
of the time I'm judging wine,

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:07.610
and so I have no interest in
making-- I want it as it is.

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:09.290
I'm almost looking for faults.

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:12.399
I'm analyzing it.

00:51:12.399 --> 00:51:14.690
There's a huge difference
between tasting and drinking,

00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:16.950
and tasting is what
I do during the day

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:19.330
and I want to minimize
the effects of alcohol

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:22.730
and I spit everything out,
and I'm super critical.

00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:25.719
But in the evening,
it's drink time,

00:51:25.719 --> 00:51:27.510
and that's a completely
different activity.

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:29.920
And you're right, I want
to make the wine taste as

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.530
good as possible,
particularly when

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:34.590
I'm serving wine to friends.

00:51:34.590 --> 00:51:38.370
One very useful
trick is that if you

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:40.690
have a young red
wine, which is still

00:51:40.690 --> 00:51:43.600
high in tannins, these
sort of chewy things

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.720
that will preserve it
for quite a long time,

00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:49.770
but in youth they can be
quite astringent and obvious,

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:53.810
the warmer you serve it the less
obvious the tannins will be.

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:58.180
So that would be, say, a young
red Bordeaux, a young Cabernet.

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.490
Serve it just a
little bit warmer

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:05.230
than you would serve an old
wine, and it will taste softer.

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:10.580
And if you actually have it with
a dish which is itself chewy,

00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:13.920
like a steak or a roast
or something like that,

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:16.460
the wine will seem less chewy.

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:20.430
And so those would be
good tips for flattering

00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:21.820
a young red wine.

00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:30.410
Don't-- wine is pretty-- unless,
it's a really sweet wine,

00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:34.110
wine is pretty
wrecked by sweet food.

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:38.600
I mean, I look at people--
just the other night

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.790
I was amazed to see people
ordering another glass of wine

00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:43.695
as the pudding
arrived, and I thought,

00:52:43.695 --> 00:52:46.690
that's not going to
taste of anything.

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:52.540
So just be careful about serving
wine with anything very sweet.

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:57.580
And I suppose things
that are very, very acid

00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:02.360
sometimes are tricky
partners for wine.

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:05.810
And remember what I said about
temperature generally before.

00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:09.280
That can help.

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.810
AUDIENCE: Just a question
around like, white wine and fish

00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:14.445
and red wine and
meats, and do you

00:53:14.445 --> 00:53:16.220
have a rule of when
do you actually

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:18.400
have white wine with meat, or--

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.100
JANCIS ROBINSON: No.

00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:29.320
If it's a very, very simple
poached sole, very delicate,

00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:35.080
say, then yes, to have a great
big, massive, chewy red wine

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.320
wouldn't be a great match.

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:40.620
But a pinot noir, sort of light,
fruity red, absolutely fine.

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:44.860
It's more about the color--
less about the color,

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:48.850
more about the dimensions of
a wine, really-- great big.

00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:51.000
If you're having
a rich stew, then

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.890
have a kind of
big, powerful wine.

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:57.552
And a delicate food, then have
a delicate wine, sort of thing.

00:53:57.552 --> 00:53:58.760
But the color doesn't matter.

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:02.580
In Bordeaux, they
make largely red wine,

00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:06.110
and they're always serving
fish with the red wine.

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:09.260
But in general, a
fruity red is better

00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:11.200
than a chewy red with fish.

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:15.921
So pinot noir would
be a good choice.

00:54:15.921 --> 00:54:17.712
AUDIENCE: I have a less
technical question.

00:54:17.712 --> 00:54:18.894
JANCIS ROBINSON: Yes.

00:54:18.894 --> 00:54:20.810
AUDIENCE: Does the queen
have a favorite wine?

00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:21.890
JANCIS ROBINSON: No.

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:22.602
AUDIENCE: No.

00:54:22.602 --> 00:54:24.310
How often do you get
asked this question?

00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:25.910
All the time?

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:28.190
JANCIS ROBINSON:
Especially abroad.

00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:31.149
No, I don't think
she's a big wine fan.

00:54:31.149 --> 00:54:31.690
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:33.523
JANCIS ROBINSON: But
she needs a lot of wine

00:54:33.523 --> 00:54:35.130
for all those
receptions and things.

00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:39.900
But because it all comes
out of the privy purse,

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:43.480
we can't afford-- we don't
go for very expensive things

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.910
for big receptions, because
we know the Daily Mail would

00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:46.770
get hold of it.

00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:48.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:53.610
But it is fun to walk
into Buckingham Palace.

00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:56.540
I still get a sort
of childish thrill

00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:00.450
showing my driver's license
to the policeman on the gates

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:03.530
and then crunching
over the gravel.

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:05.030
SPEAKER 1: One last
question for me.

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:08.940
So we touched on English wines.

00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:12.560
And there's a thriving
sparkling wine industry.

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.020
Do you have any
favorite producers?

00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:16.460
JANCIS ROBINSON: Yes, I do,
and quite a few, actually.

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:20.650
And again, I put them at
the end of an FT article,

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:23.490
so they're at the end of a free
article on JancisRobinson.com.

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:26.880
If you put English
wine in the search box,

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:30.420
choose not tasting notes,
but everything else.

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:34.150
I listed about 12.

00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:38.000
But one very good one,
Hambledon is very good,

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.900
came top of a blind tasting
I did with Champagnes.

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:43.812
I mean, beating the Champagnes.

00:55:43.812 --> 00:55:45.020
SPEAKER 1: Thank you so much.

00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:46.103
JANCIS ROBINSON: Pleasure.

00:55:46.103 --> 00:55:48.370
[APPLAUSE]
