[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:11.800
- So welcome, everyone,
back to the final,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.700
the keynote lecture, which is
about to begin, and then two

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.030
more very stimulating panels.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.820
So we're very pleased to welcome
as our keynote speaker Valerie

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.320
Steele.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.190
In the interest of time, I'm not
going to give too much detail.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.190
As for the other speakers,
you have a more detailed

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.880
description in the pamphlet.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.140
But Valerie Steele is
director and chief curator

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.480
of The Museum at the Fashion
Institute of Technology,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.690
where she's organized more
than 25 exhibitions since 1997.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.200
And she's also authored
more than 25 books,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.735
which is amazingly prolific.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.570
And I think you'll
see she's noted

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.300
not only for her scholarship
but for her ability

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.280
to communicate about
the whole fascination

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.230
of the history of fashion.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.750
So without further
ado, Valerie Steele.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.208
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.570
- So fashion is
supposed to be a form

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.990
of nonverbal communication,
which means that you all

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.990
ought to be able to
read my clothing,

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.720
if not the clothing
of 500 years ago.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.980
So I'd like to start--

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.230
where's the
microphone out there?

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.670
If someone can
get the microphone

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.680
or just stand up
and project, I'd

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.090
like you to tell me what you
can tell about me by what I'm

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.360
wearing, what I look like,
and how I might differ

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.170
from people of 500 years ago.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.610
- You're a New Yorker.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.850
- Because I'm wearing black,
he says I'm a New Yorker.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.810
Well, it's true.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.912
New Yorkers tend to wear black
but only in some neighborhoods.

00:02:12.912 --> 00:02:14.370
I tell you, on the
Upper East Side,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.600
those rich ladies
don't wear black.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.100
What else?

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.740
- [INAUDIBLE] a businesswoman.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.300
- Businesswoman-- eh, not quite.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.880
I'm an administrator,
which means I'm not loved.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.650
But I'm not exactly business.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.240
I'm not raking in the money.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.670
How did you read
business, though?

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.340
- The suit.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.020
- The suit.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.350
The suit, exactly.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.450
OK, so it reads like business.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.330
That's right, like that
Victorian cartoon where

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.280
the man says, I mean business.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.845
- Have you taken dance?

00:02:40.845 --> 00:02:41.470
- Say it again.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.540
- Have you taken dance?

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.060
- I took it very briefly,
although I'm really

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.910
a horseback-riding
girl, not a ballet girl.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.130
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.756
- Yes.

00:02:51.756 --> 00:02:54.130
- Great sneakers,
probably loves shoes.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.240
- I do love shoes.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.780
I do.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.480
But whereas I used to be called
the high-heels historian,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.360
now I'm in sneakers
90% of the time.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.840
I was in the gym, this
public gym for poor people.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.270
And this guy lifting
400 pounds stops,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.870
and he looks at this pair
of sneakers, and he goes,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.010
are those [INAUDIBLE] sneakers?

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.110
And I said in my
snobbyist voice,

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.230
why, yes, these are
[INAUDIBLE] sneakers.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.690
And he said, yeah, I like
the crinkle leather version

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.460
better--

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.097
put me in my place.

00:03:23.097 --> 00:03:23.680
Anything else?

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.980
Yes.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:24.976
- You're comfortable.

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:26.970
You look comfortable in that.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.777
- Comfort is a
psychological state.

00:03:28.777 --> 00:03:30.360
If I were wearing
my corset, would you

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.450
say I was comfortable?

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.950
- No.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.870
- Probably you
wouldn't think so.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:34.860
One more thing.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.723
Anything else?

00:03:35.723 --> 00:03:36.490
- Pants.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.210
- Pants, that's right,
different than her.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.560
So that's one of the key gender
differentials for centuries

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.360
in the West, that
women have been

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.120
wearing some kind of
long skirt or dress,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.690
and men have been wearing
some bifurcated garment,

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.780
in this case tights
rather than trousers.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.340
So let's see.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.750
We'll just move on a little bit.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.270
Another aspect of
fashion is, in addition

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.920
to gender differentiation,
it has also frequently tended

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.260
to highlight sexual or secondary
sexual characteristics.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.270
We usually think of
this in modern times

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.269
as breasts and hips and bums.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.339
But, of course, in
the Renaissance,

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:23.894
the codpiece highlighted
the male penis.

00:04:23.894 --> 00:04:29.340
If you go from
roughly 1860 to 1955,

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.140
you find, also, this fairly
rigid sexual dimorphism

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.220
in clothing.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.710
Now, if you looked
at other cultures,

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.920
like Japan or
Indonesia, or if you

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.900
looked at 18th-century
Europe, you

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.910
might not be quite so stark.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.670
Because in 18th-century
Europe, upper-class couple

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.400
might both be wearing a
pink, silk suit embroidered

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.080
with flowers and lace.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.930
And in Indonesia, they'd
both be wearing sarongs.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.640
But it wouldn't be the same.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.120
I mean, I remember in
Indonesia, foreigners

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.630
kept wrapping the sarongs the
wrong way for the other sex.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.935
And people would tell
them, you got it all wrong.

00:05:06.935 --> 00:05:07.810
You're crossdressing.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.080
And people were, eh, who cares?

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.870
But it was very upsetting
to the Indonesians

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.510
to see people doing that.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.860
And then this classic image
of mid-century Americana where

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.950
the different clothes also have
very much to do with different

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.790
roles--

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.680
goes right back to
the chimpanzees.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.110
So you've got the
going out and fighting

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.600
in the world versus staying
home with the kiddies.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.660
But notice, also, the very
dressed-up homemaker look.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.030
At that time, you have books
like Wife Dressing, which

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.460
emphasized that you had
to dress in a feminine way

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.980
so your children
would model correctly

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.840
what women were
supposed to be like,

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.850
and you should never
wear blue jeans at home.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.267
Even if you're
cleaning the floor,

00:05:49.267 --> 00:05:52.500
you should wear a girdle so you
looked appropriately feminine.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.750
So a lot of it had
to do with clothing

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.290
being used to condition you
for appropriate roleplay.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.230
Obviously, there were
self-conscious attempts

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.050
to change that with unisex.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.860
Rudi Gernreich developed this
unisex style for men and women,

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.570
particularly caftans, although
most attempts at unisex

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.080
have been drawing on
the male vocabulary.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.880
As one lesbian put it in the
1980s, when cock is king,

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.470
go for the codpiece.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.010
There's no point in copying the
clothing of the weaker and more

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.120
despised sex.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.910
You ought to copy the
clothing of the powerful sex.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.810
And in fact, it's fairly rare
that men have copied things

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.770
from the female wardrobe.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.640
It was really
extraordinarily rare as late

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.090
as the 1970s for men to
wear earrings, for example.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.800
And only gradually, particularly
with sports figures doing it,

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.400
did regular men get in touch
with their inner pirate

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.010
and take back earrings
from the female wardrobe

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.320
and say, no, we can
wear earrings, too.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.780
In general, the idea is
to dress like someone

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.450
who has more power.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.300
You see it with uniforms, too.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.730
Police women in
the United States

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.430
used to have to
wear a skirted suit.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.360
In many states, they also
had a smaller gun, which

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.660
they had to carry in a purse.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.830
They also had to wear shoes
with heels and sometimes

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.450
a stupid little hat.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.930
As one woman who later became
a police captain in Virginia

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.420
put it, you can imagine
it was hard to chase

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.290
the perpetrator when you
were dressed like that.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.040
But the point is, you
weren't supposed to.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.540
You were supposed
to be doing things

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:36.210
like helping lost children.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.180
Later on, when the
federal legislation

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.360
was passed mandating
equal opportunities,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.090
including equal kinds of
uniforms for police officers.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.870
Now, I'm going to talk
about several aspects

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.940
of my own research
over the years, which

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.560
have tended to focus on sex
and gender issues in fashion.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.390
And people seem to
write the same--

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.500
my friends said we all write the
same book over and over again,

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.880
intended to be this way for me.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.380
Corsets were the way I got into
fashion in the first place.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.820
I had a very checkered history.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.530
I dropped out of high
school, ran away,

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.720
lived in a
lesbian-feminist commune,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.120
never finished high school,
couldn't get into Harvard,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.840
was rejected.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.960
They said, you're
not Harvard material.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.860
But I ended up later on going
to graduate school at Yale.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.710
And my first term at Yale--

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.260
I was there studying modern
European cultural history.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.130
We had to give a report
on two scholarly articles.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:34.960
I don't remember what I read.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.210
I assume it was something
about the French Revolution.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.870
But my classmate, Judy Coffin,
reported on two articles

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:44.500
from the feminist journal
Signs arguing about the meaning

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.150
of the Victorian corset.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.580
Was it oppressive to women,
or was it sexually liberating?

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.550
And it was just like
a light bulb went on,

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.280
and I realized fashion's
part of culture.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.030
I can do fashion history.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.780
So I did, thereby
destroying any opportunity

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.710
of having a career in academia.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.570
But this is the image that
people have of corsetry.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.760
This is an 18th-century
caricature,

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.230
but people always think of--

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.090
I wish I had a
dollar for every time

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.670
I've heard someone in
a corset exhibition

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:20.120
saying, remember Scarlett
O'Hara and the 16-inch waist?

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.810
This is really hardwired
into everyone's memory.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.410
In fact, men sometimes
wore corsets, too.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:31.240
And you have exactly the same
type of caricature for dandies.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.990
But tight lacing was
really a very small part

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:41.200
of what corsetry meant in
the more than 300, 400 years

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:48.260
that it lasted, from about
1500 into the mid-20th century.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.770
So if you look at something
like Manet's Nana.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.190
You see that part of what's
going on with the corset

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.880
is it's not just a waist
cincher, which would emphasize

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.812
what anthropologists call
the waist-hip differential,

00:10:02.812 --> 00:10:06.260
much bigger in a
woman than a man.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.890
For a young woman,
it might be 0.7.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.660
For a man, it would be 0.9.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.420
In other words, the waist
is 9/10 of the size.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.670
But also, it's like a brassiere.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.640
It's pushing your bust
up and supporting it.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.450
And it's also an element
of underwear, in this case

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.460
luxurious, blue,
satin underwear.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.830
At this time, people
thought of that kind

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.290
of luxurious underwear
as associated

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.570
with the aristocracy of vice.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.210
Only courtesans and
actresses wore that.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:39.730
But very soon afterwards, any
fashionable women did, too.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.085
These are from the
mostly men's magazine

00:10:42.085 --> 00:10:46.750
La Vie Parisienne centerfolds
before and after the corset.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.490
Improved-- for example,
if you were too skinny,

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.150
you were padded out,
which is very common.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.130
We think of corsets just
squeezing people in,

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.360
but padded corsets
are extremely common.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.860
Corsets, which, in the middle,
the woman's figure's supposed

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.320
to be great, but her
breasts are starting to sag,

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.660
so you lift them up, et cetera.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.410
As one doctor put it
in a book in the middle

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:12.460
of the 19th century,
a corset is a lie,

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.670
but we prefer the
lie to the truth.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.770
So the idea was it was
going to improve all

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.700
of these flawed female bodies.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.310
And then you have
another centerfold

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.460
looking at different
kinds of corsets, anything

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:31.300
from the young girl's
very simple bust bodice

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:37.150
to the one with the black
corset and the blue stockings,

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.920
the laundress who's
thinking of going

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:44.320
bad, to this elaborate colorful
satin and vulgarly trimmed

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.720
corsets that
cocottes would wear,

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.210
corsets that were
scented so they'd

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:52.960
smell more as they got hotter.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.990
But the woman in the
center has no corset.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.270
She's just wearing
a silk undershirt.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.640
And they say that,
actually, that

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.830
would be best, is
what they say, if you

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.090
didn't have to wear a corset.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.570
Unfortunately, they say, there's
usually more need for one

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.810
rather than less.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:16.720
But what's interesting is
already by about the 1890s,

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.080
and certainly by
1900, 1902, you see

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.960
more and more
photographs of women,

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.570
actresses, et cetera,
wearing corsets

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.090
and then they're fit
in their fashions.

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.580
And they interview these
ladies and they say,

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.380
who's your favorite couturier?

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.060
Who's your favorite jeweler?

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.890
Who's your favorite corsetiere?

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.530
And very often the
women will say,

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.510
I don't need to wear a corset.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.510
And you look at the
photograph and you go, babe,

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.050
you are so wearing a corset.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.400
But it's already started to
seem that it will be better

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.810
if you didn't need to wear one.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.710
The corsets are already starting
to be reinterpreted no longer

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.770
as a sexy but necessary
part of underwear,

00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:00.580
but as being something
that only older, fatter,

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:05.100
sagging bodies
would somehow need.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.430
This business with a tight
lacing comes in large part

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.220
from a lot of
fetishistic letters

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.230
in particular in
English magazines,

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.290
like the English women's
domestic magazine where they

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:19.320
retail and copy over
and over all kinds

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.200
of fantastical stories
about tight lacing

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.280
boarding schools, which have men
who are cross-dressed as girls,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.550
and Mademoiselle de Beauvoir,
the sexy sadistic French

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.280
mistress, is lacing them
up tighter and tighter

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.015
from 15 to 14 to 13 inches.

00:13:35.015 --> 00:13:36.390
So in other words,
they're mostly

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.750
kind of sexual fantasies.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.440
And some of the magazines
have advertisements, including

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.930
those for men's
corsets, which, again,

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:50.470
are part of a sexual
subculture of some men

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.650
cross-dressing and
wearing corsets,

00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:57.270
and a lot of sexual fantasies
going on, and sometimes being

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:57.900
acted out.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.790
So it's not in the
boarding school actually,

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.070
but it might be in
specialized brothels

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.830
where you could dress
up as the schoolgirl

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:09.330
and then have a Mademoiselle
Beauvoir whip you or lace you

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.840
or whatever you
wanted her to do.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.170
This is from a modern
day tight lacer

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:20.900
who I met in the course of
working on my fetish book.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.630
And then this whole
idea of fetish,

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.370
I'm going to move from
corsets in general

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.790
to fetish, including
corsets, was

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:32.480
something that took up several
interesting years of research

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.460
for me.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.210
It was very funny.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:37.127
And people were like,
well, weren't you scared

00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:38.690
to go to those fetish clubs.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.270
And I went to Dartmouth.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.965
Let me tell you.

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:44.930
Those perverts were gentlemen--

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.140
gentlemen-- compared
to fraternity boys.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.800
So from that world of sort
of a sexual underworld,

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.360
the punks took corsets.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.940
And they brought them back
out and made them outerwear,

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.820
just as they took safety
pins and garbage bags

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.060
and all kinds of things which
were seen as being deliberately

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.310
revolting and provocative.

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.260
And here you see
Vivienne Westwood,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.590
the first famous designer
who was originally a punk.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:13.060
And you can see
what she's doing is

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:16.150
kind of like an
18th-century-style corset

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.216
but now, of course, with
plastic boning, et cetera.

00:15:19.216 --> 00:15:22.570
This was then picked up,
especially by Madonna

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.910
with her Jean-Paul
Gaultier corsets

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.710
and for Blonde Ambition.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.410
And once this
happened, then corsetry

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:33.760
stopped being just sort of a
high-end or a homemade thing,

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.820
and you started getting all
kinds of $30 bustiers sold

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.260
on East Eighth Street.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:40.030
And underwear as
outerwear became

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.270
kind of a recognized theme.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.970
When I did my corset
show, in addition to

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.670
the history of corsets
over the centuries

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.970
and the history of high fashion
designers using corsets,

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:55.000
I also had lots of sort
of club kid corsets.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.700
And, obviously, this one in
the center is a fantasy corset.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.280
But most of the others
were quite inexpensive,

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:07.030
sort of rubberized corsets
worn by men as often as women.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.700
And here-- this is a
high-fashion corset

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.560
by Christian Lacroix.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.350
And the model's being
laced up backstage

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:18.190
by Mr Pearl, who was a
corsetiere and tight lacer

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.430
and is the only person
that I've ever walked down

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.090
the street with in New York
where people's heads flipped

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:27.490
around when they went
to look at Mr Pearl

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:31.250
because he really did have
an incredibly tiny waist.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.250
And he was very disgruntled
that when I took him

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.670
both to FIT and the Costume
Institute at the Met,

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:40.690
none of the corsets were
as small as his own corset.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.710
So much for many historical
16-, 17-inch waists.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.850
So most of us associate
corsetry with bondage.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:52.240
And bondage and discipline--
there's overlap there between

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:57.790
corsetry and fetishes in
general overlap with S&amp;M--

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:01.090
also overlap with
cross-dressing and with the idea

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.310
of the high-heel
shoe being, in a way,

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.430
the sort of modern-day
equivalent of a corset.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.849
When you hear people
anathemizing fashion,

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:11.560
they seldom mention
corsets anymore

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.700
except as a historical evidence
of patriarchy torturing women.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.700
But they frequently
mention high-heel shoes.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:23.040
High heels had, in the
past, been worn by men too.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.740
Here you have a red
man's high-heeled shoe--

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:31.210
but rapidly became associated
with women's clothing

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.585
and then became the focus of
a particular sort of fetish.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.460
And then this one from
Vienna, of course--

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.000
1900-- where the phallic
symbolism of the high heel

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.720
is made rather
painfully evident.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.500
That was intended to be
inserted into somebody.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.680
And then you have, again,
the crossover from hemale

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.240
to shemale--

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.800
so the idea that you're
transformed by switching

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.230
into a different kind of shoe.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.390
And, in fact, I was
once trying on shoes

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.730
in a shoe store in New
York at Jeffrey's, and I

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:10.760
kicked off my loafers and put
on a pair of high-heel shoes.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.760
And this man who was
lurking nearby leaned over

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.610
and leered, now you look sexy--

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.080
from changing shoes.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.200
So, apparently, shoes do have
this sort of magical effect

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.090
on some people.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:27.200
And then, of course, the
idea, which I got very clearly

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.600
reinforced from talking
to dominatrixes,

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:34.160
are things like corsets and high
heels are very much associated

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.630
with the power dominatrix figure
and the idea that they're--

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:40.610
featuring Freudian
terms-- that they're

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.430
being endowed with all of
these phallic signifiers.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:47.030
But, also, in more practical
terms, as one dominatrix said,

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.410
it makes you taller.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:49.790
And that's a power thing.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.920
Like the chimpanzees,
you want to be bigger.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.800
You want to be at least as tall
as this guy who's paying you--

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.920
and also that the
corset's going to be--

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:01.190
is sort of your viscerally
hard body at that point.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:05.810
So Freud, of course, was not
right about a number of things.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:09.080
But he specifically said that
fetishism would prevent men

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.880
from becoming homosexuals.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.250
But, of course, homosexual
men have fetishes

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.160
just as heterosexual
men and some women,

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.100
although fetishizing,
in general,

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.500
seems to be more
the norm for males

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.170
and somewhat more
unusual for women--

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.230
at least in the
sense of fetishizing

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:34.100
of having a necessary
sexual state of arousal

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.900
associated with a fetish.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:40.340
So everyone fetishes to
some degree or another.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.640
In other words, everyone
has some preferences.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.300
They might like
redheads, for example,

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.670
or they might like people
who have big breasts

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.180
or who are men who
are tall or whatever.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.340
But if you have a
level 2, then that's

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.860
really quite a bit
more important to you.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:01.230
Level 3-- you can only
really achieve orgasm

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:05.330
with a redhead or a tall man
or someone with big breasts.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.700
And level 4-- you don't
really need the person at all.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.520
You just put on the shoes
or whatever it is yourself,

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.100
and the person is unimportant.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.070
So that kind of fetishizing
is much commoner

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.840
among men than women.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.230
So various kinds of
garments can be fetishized.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.940
Anything can.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.230
I mean, an undershirt can.

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.910
Underwear, in
general, is something

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.520
that's likely to be fetishized.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.790
Traditional view was because
it was hiding the last moment

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:35.000
that the woman could still
be regarded as phallic.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.520
And this is from
a fetish magazine.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.270
But men's underwear-- also
quite often fetishized.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:47.070
The famous giant billboard
above Times Square--

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:52.220
And I was told how when
this was photographed,

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.550
the model was padded out
in a very interesting way

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.690
with Wonder Bread--

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.090
that the crusts were cut
off, and the Wonder Bread

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:01.490
was gently molded
around his penis

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:05.840
to give a more
pronounced basket.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.480
So other kinds of
second-skin materials

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.900
are frequently fetishized,
particularly leather.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.500
Older people will recognize
this from The Avengers.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.820
Well, this was a real fetish
outfit from a fetish company

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:23.360
with only-- the facial mask
was taken off for the TV show.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.270
This from the '70s
is so fascinating

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:30.080
because it was from the
Montgomery Ward fashion show.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.570
So you think it's only
going to be really

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:34.900
out-there designers
like Versace who are

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.320
going to do fetishy clothes.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:37.550
On the contrary.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:41.030
In the '70s, which was sort of
the era of sexual liberation,

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:44.150
you had this kind of
imagery just running

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:47.460
throughout the whole
fashion culture.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.360
You definitely also
had by the '70s

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.380
a whole leather
man culture, which

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.980
had been incubating in
big cities in the US,

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.740
in particular, since the 1940s.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.280
And the leather man culture
then had an influence

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.990
on Versace's clothes.

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:07.400
So Versace said in an
interview that before he

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.210
did this, his famous
bondage collection,

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.290
he had tried about
eight years before.

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:13.340
And he did a show.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.440
And he said they turned
the lights up on him.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.720
It wasn't a Paris, Milan show.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.185
It was in some other town where
they were doing a fashion show.

00:22:21.185 --> 00:22:23.060
And he said, they turned
the lights up on me,

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.420
and they said these clothes
belong only in a leather bar.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:30.110
And he said, and now, look--
socialites in bondage.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:33.230
So I was interviewing a bunch of
leather fetishists, and I said,

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.140
so what do you think of
the Versace collection?

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.210
And they said, we hate it.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:39.695
And I said, why.

00:22:39.695 --> 00:22:42.320
And they said because you can't
tell whether somebody is really

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.670
into something now or just
making a fashion statement.

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:50.180
But that, of course, is true
of anything that's a good look.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.140
Fashion will immediately
hoover it up and transform it.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.090
So this is from an exhibition
that I did a few years ago,

00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:58.430
A Queer History of Fashion--

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.380
From the Closet to the Catwalk.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.040
And we got a leather man
ensemble and the Versace thing

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.210
and then various
other leather looks.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.600
Leather's been an important
component of fashion

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.030
in general for some
of the same reasons--

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:18.320
because it has that
hard body feel.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.080
It's associated with
kind of tough imagery,

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:25.490
like motorcyclists, and it has
that whole interesting smell

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:26.450
and sound.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:29.540
Leather creaks and smells in a
very interesting and visceral

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.290
way.

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:33.710
But I think one of the key
things about both the corset

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:38.150
and leather is the association
with the hard body.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:41.870
I remember when my students
used to say to me, well,

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:45.143
why was it that women
gave up wearing corsets.

00:23:45.143 --> 00:23:47.060
And I used to tease them,
and I said, oh, they

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.352
didn't give up wearing corsets.

00:23:48.352 --> 00:23:51.500
They just internalized it
through diet and exercise

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.810
and plastic surgery.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.540
The idea was that you
couldn't rely anymore

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:59.060
on whale bone or metal
to push your fat around.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:03.470
You had to have a body that
was itself a hard body.

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:08.000
And that has been expressed in
innumerable styles of fashion

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.600
for women and for men because
that hard and vulnerable

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.501
robot-like body is associated
with invulnerability.

00:24:16.501 --> 00:24:22.230
And then various kinds of
sexual cliches in costuming.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:27.270
And what's most interesting
is the cutoff points at neck

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:32.290
and wrist, the idea of
body parts being isolated;

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.710
the corset on an evening
gown from the 1950s--

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:38.590
Jacques Fath, very
sexy evening gown--

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:40.930
and then the idea
of cross-dressing,

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:44.450
which has appealed
to many people,

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.590
including some women,
for quite a long time.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.290
This was, of course,
Yves Saint Laurent

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:54.340
from the 1970s, in which he said
that he was directly inspired

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:58.120
by Marlene Dietrich in Morocco.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.580
Then you've got other kinds
of power suiting, though.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.190
It doesn't have to be
hard or overtly sexual

00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:06.130
like a codpiece
or a hard corset.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.290
You have all the sort
of status dressing.

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.080
And as you said before, like the
business suit-- it's kind of--

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.050
I think, well, that's a
symbol of status and money,

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.820
among other things.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.570
Then you have the whole kind of
physical beauty and strength,

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.250
which, in and of
itself, is something

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.628
that you try and
approximate in clothing.

00:25:23.628 --> 00:25:25.420
One of the reasons that
business suits have

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:29.110
been so popular for so long
is because they camouflage

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.863
all of the myriad
flaws in male bodies

00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:33.280
just the way corsets
were supposed

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.470
to do for female bodies.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:39.760
And then you have the whole idea
of different, separate sexual

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:44.230
undergrounds, which would have
their own specific styles where

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.680
you could signal to other
people that you were one of them

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.550
and not one of those other
straight vanilla people.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:55.750
So another image
here, also from when

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:57.190
I did A Queer
History of Fashion,

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.110
was the idea of Oscar Wilde.

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.890
And Oscar Wilde was very into
fashion, both men's fashion

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.840
as he wore it and
women's fashion,

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.760
editing a fashion magazine.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.610
And so this idea of
his look at first

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:14.920
was something which mixed male
and female signifiers as well

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.350
as historicizing and
aristocratic things

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.960
like showing off the
legs in knee breeches

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.790
and wearing velvet,
which was associated

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.340
as a woman's material.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.820
This came from a book, George
Chauncey's Gay New York,

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.805
from a 19th-century
guide of types

00:26:29.805 --> 00:26:33.460
you might see in New York,
including, on the Upper Side,

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.730
a man who'd be wearing a
short jacket and tight pants

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:40.518
and might have
curly, longer hair.

00:26:40.518 --> 00:26:43.830
And then the whole idea
of the dandy, which became

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:46.170
a really important gay icon--

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.060
here in a kind of
almost butterfly

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:53.380
dandy style with Count
Robert de Montesquiou.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:56.830
And then here in the kind of
female dandy-- the very, very

00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.860
important
early-20th-century lesbian

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:03.220
look, which, again, is borrowing
from the male upper-class

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.270
wardrobe.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:06.850
Extremely important,
pivotal look

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:09.940
in the history of
lesbian fashion

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.460
and also of women's
fashion in general.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:16.630
So you saw it ubiquitously
in, say, Brassai's photographs

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.210
of lesbian bars in Paris.

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:22.810
And you also saw it in
images of fashionable women

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.730
as that whole kind
of garcon look

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:29.170
took over as being
the fashionable style.

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.930
Marlene Dietrich, of
course, who really

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:34.450
was an important figure
in terms not only

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:37.780
of wearing full-scale men's
dress off-screen as well

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:41.470
as on-screen, but also
pioneering wearing trousers

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.870
and being a sort
of bisexual icon

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:47.340
for fashion people
for generations.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.050
We got some of
her clothes, which

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:55.420
we posed next to the Saint
Laurent in Queer History.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.670
And then, of course,
one of the key reasons

00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:01.210
why you have LGBTQ
styles has been a way

00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:04.570
to signal in a hostile
society so that you could meet

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:08.740
other people who would also be
queer and without cluing out

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.350
people who might be
straight and hostile.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:15.040
So those varied, but they
included things like dyed hair,

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.230
red tie, suede shoes, et cetera.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:23.010
Yves Saint Laurent posed
here on leather cushions

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:26.680
for his early perfume ad--

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:31.240
and then the very much
politicized gay styles

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.210
of the AIDS era and beyond.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:38.120
And then we haven't even
talked about the erotic appeal

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.290
of the uniform--

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:42.290
but is one which goes
right back in history so

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:46.070
that both male and female
brothels in 19th-century Paris

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.350
had a range of uniforms.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:52.790
So people who had a fetish for
nuns or a fetish for soldiers

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:56.180
from a particular regiment
or sailors or brides

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.746
could find all those
costumes at the brothel.

00:28:59.746 --> 00:29:01.620
And then I'll just
show you, so you

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:05.130
can see how
advertising for fashion

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.650
picks up on not just
gender stereotypes,

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:10.770
but also a lot of
sexual stereotypes.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:14.820
These are a few years old,
so this is no longer--

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:19.090
obviously, no longer current
Balenciaga, nor current Gucci.

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:20.790
The current Gucci
ads couldn't possibly

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:23.730
be any more different than this.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.590
Hugo Boss is like--

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:26.770
same with the Hermes--

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:28.830
that's like rich
people's white clothes.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:30.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.240
And then this is
probably Saint Laurent.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.250
But, again, it's that sort of--

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.260
it's the hipster,
cool, rock chick

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:41.010
look, which is ubiquitous
in fashion advertising.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.800
Céline, which was, for a
while, the sort of smart

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.950
women's fashion that was not
going to be all these sexual

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:50.420
stereotypes-- kind of
quirky women's style.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:56.120
And then, although women may
not be as often sexual fetishes

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.660
like men, certainly,
commodity fetishism

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:02.480
is running rampant
throughout society.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.210
And that, as they
say, is another story.

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:09.230
But it's an incredibly important
part of the fashion story

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:10.410
as well.

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:12.428
So thank you very much.

00:30:12.428 --> 00:30:14.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:18.044 --> 00:30:21.610
- So thank you, Valerie,
for a wonderful talk.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:24.190
We have time for questions.

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:27.540
Again, please come
to the center.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.400
And I know there'll
be a lot of people

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:34.210
who want to ask questions,
so please ask questions.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.285
Keep the questions short
so that we can accommodate

00:30:37.285 --> 00:30:38.410
as many people as possible.

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.090
- Thank you so much, Dr. Steele.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:44.350
I was intrigued and troubled
by Professor Peters' comment

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:47.260
earlier today that
sex is the naked body,

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.570
and gender is the clothed body.

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:52.180
I was wondering if you
wanted to either trouble

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:56.890
or expand on that idea, in
particular around the idea

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:00.220
of gender-nonconforming
fashion and the way

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:04.630
that sexuality and fetishism
has been de-emphasized

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:08.740
in new designers looking to
promote a nonbinary idea.

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:09.520
- Right.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:14.110
Well, people always-- a
lot of people hate fashion.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:16.960
And one of the main
crimes of fashion

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.140
is it's seen as being
artificial, not natural.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.440
But the idea that the
body itself is natural

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.380
is, of course, a
complete fantasy

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:31.540
because we structure our
bodies in innumerable ways--

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.940
that we're taught
to stand and walk.

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.020
We cut our hair.

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:35.830
We shave.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:38.890
We do all kinds of
things to our bodies.

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:43.420
And, really, I think rather than
pitting body versus clothing,

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.840
it's more useful when you're
thinking of the relationship

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.270
to think of the
body-clothes unit

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:54.520
as being what you're using to
convey aspects of identity.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.920
So the very same garment--

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.830
say, a corset-- is going
to convey different things

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:03.400
on a male or a female body, and
depending on what kind of body

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.110
it is.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.370
Blue jeans
historically were seen

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:09.550
as being something that
molded to a variety

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.310
of different bodies and told
sort of different stories

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:17.935
about who you were
because the garment was

00:32:17.935 --> 00:32:20.760
in close connection
with the body.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.660
Now give me the second
half of the question

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.615
again about how
fashion has been--

00:32:25.615 --> 00:32:30.580
- --sort of desexualized from
designers that are promoting

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:34.390
gender-nonconforming aesthetic
and how does that filter

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:39.050
in with the kind of sexiness of
the fetish [INAUDIBLE] world.

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:46.540
- I think that some designers
have tried to de-emphasize

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:51.010
overt sexual
characteristics in clothing.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:55.480
But others have,
in fact, stretched

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:59.620
the idea of taking something
which might be stereotypically

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.100
sexy in one area and
seeing what happens if you

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.660
have other people wear it.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:07.810
So, for example, pink
has, in the West,

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:12.070
been seen as a feminine
color for quite some time.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:15.160
And yet over the
last 10 or 15 years,

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.890
it's been more and more
appropriated by men,

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:21.560
and it's acquired a
range of other meanings.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.220
It's been associated
with the LGBTQ community

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:26.920
and, particularly, with
sort of queer radicals

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.930
within it who see
the rainbow as being

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:34.370
more bourgeois and pink as being
a more radical queer color.

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.750
It also was picked
up in a very big way

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:42.130
by African-American men,
particularly coming out

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:44.150
of the whole hip-hop experience.

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:47.590
And it took about 10
years for Caucasian men

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:50.980
to start tiptoeing
towards the kind of pink

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.500
is this sort of
masculine or, at least,

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:57.580
androgynous color, although you
had a long history within rock

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:01.510
and roll and earlier
musical forms of pink

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.390
as being a rebellious color.

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:07.090
Now, Elvis wore pink, of
course, and had a pink Cadillac.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.909
But in that way, he was
actually copying, probably,

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:14.199
Sugar Ray Robinson, the
African-American boxer.

00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:17.739
And then later on, the bass
guitarist for The Clash

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:21.100
said how pink was the only
real rock and roll color.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:26.590
So you can destabilize
the sort of sexualization

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:30.310
either by trying to do something
which is gender neutral,

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:33.070
which is really kind of
hard to do because it's

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.620
almost always going to
tilt towards, I think,

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.070
the male clothing vocabulary.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:42.670
You can get men in
skirts or caftans,

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:44.275
but it's a harder sell.

00:34:44.275 --> 00:34:46.750
You got them in earrings, so
you can get them in anything.

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.450
But it's a harder sell.

00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:52.030
But, also, you can destabilize
the symbolism of something

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:55.480
which has been seen as feminine
and sort of rebrand it.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.760
But I think, very often,
to make it popular,

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.730
you don't rebrand it as asexual.

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:04.180
You brand it as being
kind of both sexual

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.490
or a range of sexual
because, really,

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:08.740
how many people want
to be sexually neutral.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.930
They want to have
their own expression

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.810
of their own sexuality,
whatever that is.

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.300
But, usually, except
for people who

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.130
really identify as asexual--

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:22.870
usually, they do want to have
some kind of a sexual appeal

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:26.060
to other people or
to some other people.

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:26.560
Yeah?

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.510
- Hi.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.190
I have a question
that I hope may

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:31.570
resonate with some
other folks in the room.

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:33.720
So my identity for as
long as I can remember

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.210
has been around being
an intellectual being,

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:39.630
and so this idea
that I give time

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:43.590
to think about how I present
myself was antithetical.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:47.190
And so it's only very
recently that I got a real job

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:49.620
and had money to spend on
fashion that I've started

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.230
to think maybe this is
a variable in my life

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:53.820
that I can play with.

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.740
Do you have any advice?

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:56.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.290
Well, no.

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.230
Well, OK.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:02.730
Again, other people in this
room are also at Harvard, right?

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.930
Harvard has a very
particular style.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:06.510
I was educated at MIT--

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.210
very different style there.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:11.500
So we're professional folks.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.123
We also have private lives.

00:36:13.123 --> 00:36:14.790
And I'm just curious
about your thoughts

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:18.210
about being intellectuals who
also care about how we dress.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:19.300
- Yeah.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.440
This is something that
I have experienced

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.645
from the very
beginning of my career.

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:31.010
Fashion is despised widely
in American society.

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:35.960
But it is especially despised
within American academia.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.790
I wrote an article
once called "The F

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:41.150
Word," which was in Lingua
Franca, the academic journal.

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:45.020
And I literally could not
get any academic colleagues

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.770
to go on record with
their name to say anything

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:52.490
about fashion because they
didn't want to be associated

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:54.980
with it at all, even
people who I knew

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:58.610
were quite interested in
fashion, because the idea is

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:01.760
that the life of the mind
means that the life of the body

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.750
is immaterial, especially
when it's not even the body,

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:09.140
but it's like this
flayed extra skin,

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:13.520
this low, bourgeois,
anti-feminist, consumerist,

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.720
conformist thing that somehow
you have to put on your body.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:22.940
But we intellectuals really
don't follow any style.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.680
And, to some
extent, that's true.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.870
I mean, I would say
academics are probably

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:30.680
the worst-dressed middle-class
occupational group in America.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.940
But, nevertheless, they are
buying their own clothes.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:38.060
In only a handful of instances
are their mothers still buying

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.230
their clothes.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:42.860
And, therefore, it behooves
them to take some responsibility

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:47.060
for their clothes and decide
what makes them happy to wear.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.645
And I think that's
really the answer.

00:37:48.645 --> 00:37:51.020
Of course, we said you look
comfortable in what you wear.

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:55.070
Basically, especially now,
there are very few social rules,

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:58.400
even in the job situation,
about what you have to wear.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.380
So you might as well
try and figure out

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:05.240
what makes you happy to
wear because, otherwise, you

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.430
can just outsource it to mom.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:08.180
She'll pay for it.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:11.120
But apart from that, there's
probably a downside to that

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.940
as well because it does
sort of convey something

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:17.500
about who you are and
what you think you are

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.490
and that you do, in fact,
think about who you are,

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:23.185
which is not a bad thing
to do even for a brainiac.

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:27.150
- Hi.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:30.090
So you mentioned when you
were talking about the corset

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:33.180
that there is a lot of
interactions between women

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:37.040
wanting to borrow from a
masculine style that is either

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.930
of a higher class or of
a gender association that

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.110
has more power.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.520
I actually took a really
brilliant class at school

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.100
at Harvard taught by
Professor Jonathan

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.163
Square on fashion and slavery.

00:38:49.163 --> 00:38:51.330
And I was wondering if you
could talk more about how

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:53.288
you see the sort of
interaction-- you mentioned

00:38:53.288 --> 00:38:55.677
Gucci is really changing the
way that it presents itself,

00:38:55.677 --> 00:38:57.510
and a lot of that has
to do with streetwear.

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:00.590
And I was wondering if you had
any thoughts on how streetwear

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:03.930
is becoming to be so
powerful in fashion

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:06.360
and how design houses
have historically

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.890
borrowed from marginalized
populations as well.

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:11.850
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:14.940
The standard old sort of
19th-century Veblenesque thing

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:18.060
is that the fashions are set
up high, and they trickle down,

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.420
and that middle-class people
imitate upper-class people.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:26.160
However, very often-- and even
at least as early as the 18th

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.520
century and probably earlier,
although my own studies

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.830
don't go really before
the 18th century--

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:35.820
you found elite people borrowing
from working-class dress

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:39.190
and sometimes even
borrowing cross-culturally

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:41.490
so that in 18th-century
London, there

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:45.090
were upper-class men who were
wearing styles of coats which

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:47.460
were like the kind of
thing that coachman wore

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:51.270
and definitely affecting a
kind of rough working-class

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:52.680
demeanor.

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:56.580
And then you also had some
who were cutting their hair

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:58.000
like mohawk haircuts--

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.450
I mean, sort of centuries
before the punks.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:04.680
So you had this kind of
appropriation frequently.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:09.720
I think it has to do with
a very widespread fantasy

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:12.750
that working-class men or
men of other ethnicities

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:15.090
are more masculine
and more virile

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:19.410
and that you can get that
if you can assimilate

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:21.870
some aspect of their appearance.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:26.340
And then there's also all
kinds of middle-class leftists

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:30.060
who, again, saw working-class
men as being not only probably

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:33.690
more virile, but also more
sort of authentic and real.

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:37.920
So you get that whole kind of
fantasy of-- it's this really

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:41.010
kind of a variant of the fantasy
of a natural man or even sort

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.210
of the natural savage--

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:44.640
that you're going down
there, and you're finding

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.050
somebody who's authentic.

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:48.660
And you're trying to
get that authenticity.

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:50.940
So you often will find--
you found that in the '60s

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:54.810
all the time with the idea that
blue jeans or certain kinds

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:57.150
of ethnic clothing
were more authentic

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:59.580
than bourgeois fashion.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.160
So there are many,
many occasions

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:07.600
when people have
appropriated styles of dress,

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.820
hairstyle, tattooing.

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.160
I mean, think of all
the endless styles--

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:16.290
everything from Japanese to
Maori tattoos to Dayak tattoos

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:18.085
that people have appropriated--

00:41:18.085 --> 00:41:19.710
although nobody
actually yet is talking

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:22.080
about tattoo cultural
appropriation.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.080
But as with fashion,
it's there too.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.060
And there's usually
a sense that there's

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:32.310
something more desirable,
more authentic in that culture

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:35.750
than in your own culture.

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:37.250
And, of course, the
fashion industry

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:40.460
has been doing this
for a very long time.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.740
But, especially
since the 1960s--

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:46.250
the idea that you're
copying streetwear.

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.590
Also, you're copying
active sportswear.

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:52.760
So there are huge numbers
of young people today

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.100
who I think have never worn
a pair of leather shoes

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.680
because they've
only worn sneakers.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.380
So that kind of thing becomes--

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.620
it's, again, an association
with a cool factor.

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.120
Who's wearing it?

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.290
They're younger.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:07.620
Maybe they're hipper.

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.130
They seem more
knowledgeable; more

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:13.110
cool than just sort of
sheltered, middle-class kids.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:16.040
And so you want
to look like that.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.140
Never underestimate
the desire to look

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.497
like somebody that's cooler than
you-- however that's defined.

00:42:21.497 --> 00:42:22.840
- OK.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.316
Final question.

00:42:24.316 --> 00:42:26.200
- So this kind of
follows on from that.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:29.050
One thing that struck me about
the two caricatures that you

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:33.640
showed us of the corset--
like the tight lacing--

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.880
was that in both of those
caricatures, we had--

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.710
one of the people
doing the lace thing

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:42.472
was a black man or a black boy.

00:42:42.472 --> 00:42:44.680
And so I was wondering
whether that was a coincidence

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.097
or whether there's
something going

00:42:46.097 --> 00:42:49.640
on there about either class--

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:50.940
the first one there is.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:51.940
Yeah, right at the back.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:52.580
And I thought--

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:53.260
- --yeah.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:54.956
Let me see if I can go back.

00:42:54.956 --> 00:42:55.710
Or go forward.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:58.210
- --so I was just wondering,
if that's something you've seen

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:01.227
before, what do you
think is going on there?

00:43:01.227 --> 00:43:02.560
Is it simply a coincidence, or--

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.352
- --can you help me
get back to the first--

00:43:04.352 --> 00:43:07.770
anyone can help me
get back to the--

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:09.490
this corset one.

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:12.670
Certainly, I noticed it with
the dandy one, the second one.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:16.213
And that has to do-- they're
both English caricatures.

00:43:16.213 --> 00:43:18.880
And I think they have to do very
much with the idea of servants.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.280
Those are servants
lacing you up.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:26.530
And so that, I think, is
sort of the main idea--

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:30.940
and having to do with the idea
that you were an elite person

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.370
because corsetry was
associated not only

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:37.060
with female sexual beauty,
but also with elite status

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:41.140
because upper-class people
wore stiffer clothes

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:43.840
and wore corsets for a
long time before they

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.570
spread to the middle
and working classes.

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:51.490
So in the Renaissance,
little boys and little girls

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:52.240
wore corsets--

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.700
because their bodies were
thought to be so weak.

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.860
But as girls grew
up and became women,

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:59.470
theirs were the bodies that
were marked as still being

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.300
weak and in need of support.

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:06.040
But this idea that the
supported, tightened body

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.290
was going to be an
elite person's body--

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:12.520
because a poor person's
body was going to be bent

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.320
and stretched out of shape.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.390
Not like today so much--
that would be fat,

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:18.460
although you see that
by the 19th century--

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:22.990
but that it wouldn't be an
erect, graceful, aristocratic

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.710
body.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:26.590
And the corset was supposed
to maintain that for you.

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:30.073
So I think both of these images
are showing someone who's

00:44:30.073 --> 00:44:31.615
a member of the
elite, and then there

00:44:31.615 --> 00:44:34.780
are servants as well as
colleagues lacing them up.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.390
This one here-- those
are both servants.

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:38.730
The one there is black.

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:40.360
The other one is
probably intended

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.495
to be French or Italian.

00:44:42.495 --> 00:44:45.400
With the comb in his hair,
he's like a [SPEAKING FRENCH]..

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.220
So you've got all these
sort of foreign people

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:51.740
helping him look more stylish.

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:55.130
But to be stylish is already
in the British caricature

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:58.020
being seen as being a
little bit effeminate.

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:02.260
This is a really
fascinating thing

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.420
because if you
look at literature

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.790
from the early
19th century, there

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:09.850
are quite a few references
to men wearing corsets.

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:12.010
In Thackeray-- Vanity Fair--

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:16.240
that Joseph Sedley,
the fat guy that she's

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.650
flirting with at first--

00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:19.270
he wears a corset at the table.

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:23.110
And he gets agitated and starts
having difficulty breathing.

00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:26.370
And his father's like,
cut his corset strings.

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:29.440
Or in Cousin Bette when Baron
Hulot starts having the affair

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.970
with Valérie Marneffe.

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:33.040
He starts wearing a
corset to look younger

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.600
and thinner and more military.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:38.650
So I think that the use
of having people of color

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:41.830
is to imply I'm the one
who's the employer of all

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:42.550
of these people.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:44.350
I am of a higher social status.

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:45.316
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:45.316 --> 00:45:46.765
- Thanks.

00:45:46.765 --> 00:45:47.731
- Thank you.

00:45:47.731 --> 00:45:48.990
- One more?

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:49.490
OK.

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:50.570
Thank you so much.
