00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:02.440
- [Instructor] As we saw
in the last several videos,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.400
the Roman Republic that
was established in 509 BCE,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.790
it finally met its end with
the rule of Julius Caesar.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.461
We talk about Julius Caesar
crossing the Rubicon,

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:16.150
becoming dictator for life,
and then he's assassinated

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.438
because of the power he
was able to accumulate

00:00:18.438 --> 00:00:22.370
in 44 BCE, on March
15th, the Ides of March.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.339
That throws Rome into a civil war.

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.198
Eventually it becomes a
battle between Augustus,

00:00:28.198 --> 00:00:32.459
or at the time, Octavian, versus
Mark Antony and Cleopatra.

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:35.089
Octavian is able to be victorious.

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:39.256
And, on 27 BCE, he is
declared, or this is the date

00:00:40.478 --> 00:00:43.057
that historians often use as the beginning

00:00:43.057 --> 00:00:46.080
of him officially being emperor.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.247
This period from 27 BCE,
with Augustus being emperor,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.337
all the way to 180 CE, so
this roughly 200-year period,

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:01.697
this is a relatively good
time for the Roman Empire.

00:01:01.697 --> 00:01:03.649
As we will see, there is
still a lot of conflict,

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.620
there is still a lot of bloodshed,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.360
but it is a relatively stable period.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.119
It is also referred to as Pax Romana,

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.702
or the Roman Peace.

00:01:14.948 --> 00:01:19.169
What we see pictured here,
these are most of the Emperors

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:21.836
of that roughly 200-year period.

00:01:22.778 --> 00:01:27.029
Augustus proves to be a
relatively good administrator.

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:31.746
He lays a good foundation for
the next several hundred years

00:01:31.746 --> 00:01:33.299
of the Empire.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.256
The Roman Empire officially
being ruled by an Emperor.

00:01:38.256 --> 00:01:40.137
It's eventually going to meet its demise,

00:01:40.137 --> 00:01:43.648
the Western Empire, at least, in 476 CE,

00:01:43.648 --> 00:01:46.980
so, it's gonna go for roughly 500 years,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.440
and Augustus lays a
strong foundation for it.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.456
He's viewed as a strong administrator.

00:01:53.456 --> 00:01:56.448
He really builds a lot of institutions.

00:01:56.448 --> 00:01:59.728
From a historical
perspective, it's worth noting

00:01:59.728 --> 00:02:03.228
that Jesus was born under Augustus's rule.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.529
Most historical views are Jesus was born

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:11.696
in some place between 4 BCE and 6 BCE.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.380
Now, Augustus was followed by Tiberius.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.180
Tiberius, here, was both
Augustus's step-son,

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.470
and he married Augustus's daughter,

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.681
so he was a step-son, and son-in-law.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:32.541
He also proved to be a
relatively capable emperor.

00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:35.010
You can see Augustus
had a fairly long rule.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.820
He took power in his 30s, and
his power ended in his 70s.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.360
Tiberius, too, had a fairly long rule.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.331
From a historical point of view,

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:48.019
or even a Biblical point
of view, it's worth noting

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.639
that Jesus would have been
crucified under Tiberius's rule.

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.980
The Roman Emperor referred to

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.740
in the New Testament is Tiberius.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.790
It would have been his
governor, Pontius Pilate,

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.971
who orders the crucifixion of Jesus.

00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:04.036
Now, after Tiberius, you
have his great-nephews,

00:03:04.036 --> 00:03:06.499
or his great, great-nephew,
and you can see they're all

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:10.217
not directly related, but
they're all kind of family.

00:03:10.217 --> 00:03:12.888
His great, great-nephew is Caligula.

00:03:12.888 --> 00:03:14.540
Caligula, that's his nickname,

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.405
is a bit of an infamous figure,
one of the infamous figures,

00:03:17.405 --> 00:03:20.456
in history amongst the Roman Emperors

00:03:20.456 --> 00:03:23.250
'cause he's really viewed
as a sadist, as a pervert.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.820
He's known for killing
people just for fun,

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.608
and he is quickly assassinated.

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:32.959
His term only, or his power,
only lasted for several years.

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.689
Then, in his place is
put his uncle, Claudius.

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.455
After Claudius comes another
infamous figure of history,

00:03:40.455 --> 00:03:42.416
and that is Nero.

00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:46.583
Nero, he's known for, Rome had
a significant fire in 64 AD.

00:03:49.657 --> 00:03:52.409
Many of the Roman citizens
believed that Nero did it

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.677
intentionally to clear
out space for a palace.

00:03:55.677 --> 00:03:58.608
Significant number of
Romans died in that fire.

00:03:58.608 --> 00:04:02.048
He killed a ton of people,
including his mother.

00:04:02.048 --> 00:04:05.708
He's maybe most famous for
persecuting Christians.

00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:08.317
There's some accounts that
he would dip them in oil

00:04:08.317 --> 00:04:10.059
and set them on fire in his garden

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:12.198
just as a source of light.

00:04:12.198 --> 00:04:16.688
These people, to say that
they were insane, or demented,

00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:20.798
or sick, normally I try to
avoid making any judgement

00:04:20.798 --> 00:04:23.448
on some of these historical
figures, but both Caligula,

00:04:23.448 --> 00:04:27.239
and Nero, if we believe the accounts

00:04:27.239 --> 00:04:30.518
that we get from that period,
and shortly after that period,

00:04:30.518 --> 00:04:33.958
were not, by any stretch of
the imagination, good people.

00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:38.255
Nero eventually does commit
suicide, and, with Nero's end,

00:04:38.255 --> 00:04:43.111
you actually have the end of
the Julio-Claudian dynasty.

00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:44.517
Let me write that down,

00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:47.934
Julio, Julio, Claudian, Claudian dynasty.

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:55.540
The reason why it's called
the Julio-Claudian dynasty

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.520
is that all of these
characters, let me circle them,

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.937
or underline 'em.

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:10.156
All of these characters right over here

00:05:11.384 --> 00:05:13.625
are essentially from the same family.

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:17.746
They're descended from both
the Julian line, Julius Caesar,

00:05:17.746 --> 00:05:19.775
and the Claudian family.

00:05:19.775 --> 00:05:23.554
That's why it's called the
Julio-Claudian dynasty.

00:05:23.554 --> 00:05:25.456
Now, at the end of the
Julio-Claudian dynasty,

00:05:25.456 --> 00:05:27.676
you have a new dynasty, Vespasian.

00:05:27.676 --> 00:05:29.864
There's a short civil
war, so the Pax Romana

00:05:29.864 --> 00:05:32.244
is not without some war and bloodshed.

00:05:32.244 --> 00:05:33.356
In fact, this whole time,

00:05:33.356 --> 00:05:35.626
there's a lot of relatives being killed,

00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:37.646
people who might threaten
the Emperor being killed,

00:05:37.646 --> 00:05:39.744
and that's just talking
about the Romans, themselves.

00:05:39.744 --> 00:05:42.876
They're constantly fighting
the Germanic tribes,

00:05:42.876 --> 00:05:44.643
and groups in the Middle East,

00:05:44.643 --> 00:05:46.643
and taking more, and
more, and more territory,

00:05:46.643 --> 00:05:48.004
and these are extremely bloody thing.

00:05:48.004 --> 00:05:49.415
They're constantly enslaving people.

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:52.364
The Roman Empire sometimes it
looks like this neat, clean,

00:05:52.364 --> 00:05:55.255
idealistic thing, but there was a lot of

00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:58.944
enslaving of people, destroying of towns.

00:05:58.944 --> 00:06:01.191
Killing people out of paranoia, or really

00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:03.315
just out of the joy of killing,

00:06:03.315 --> 00:06:06.982
if you take the case of Caligula, or Nero.

00:06:06.982 --> 00:06:08.503
Then, you have the Flavian dynasty.

00:06:08.503 --> 00:06:10.313
I don't have the three Flavian Emperors

00:06:10.313 --> 00:06:11.753
depicted right over here.

00:06:11.753 --> 00:06:15.920
You have Vespasian, you have
Titus, and you have Domitian.

00:06:17.473 --> 00:06:19.752
Of note, the Colosseum.

00:06:19.752 --> 00:06:23.781
The famous Colosseum in Rome
was built during their time.

00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:26.093
They're also known for the destruction of

00:06:26.093 --> 00:06:28.932
the second temple in Jerusalem.

00:06:28.932 --> 00:06:31.403
Then, after that, you
have what historians,

00:06:31.403 --> 00:06:34.031
and especially Niccolo Machiavelli,

00:06:34.031 --> 00:06:37.274
so this is many centuries
later, called the Good Emperors.

00:06:37.274 --> 00:06:41.255
The Good Emperors are these characters,

00:06:41.255 --> 00:06:44.616
let me square them off right over here.

00:06:44.616 --> 00:06:46.557
And these are really
the last five emperors

00:06:46.557 --> 00:06:47.947
of the Pax Romana.

00:06:47.947 --> 00:06:51.357
We should even use the term,
Good, maybe in quotation marks,

00:06:51.357 --> 00:06:55.848
because for Rome's enemies,
for the slaves of Rome,

00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:59.627
for the people who were
thrown into the Colosseum

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:03.629
just because they were a prisoner
of war, or they committed

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:08.427
some simple crime, the Roman
Empire didn't seem good.

00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:09.536
The reason why they were viewed good

00:07:09.536 --> 00:07:11.567
is they were viewed as
able administrators.

00:07:11.567 --> 00:07:14.297
They continued to expand the Roman Empire.

00:07:14.297 --> 00:07:17.039
Trajan in particular, the
peak of the Roman Empire

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:21.149
comes, in terms of Geography,
comes under Trajan's rule.

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:23.017
That's this map right over here.

00:07:23.017 --> 00:07:25.247
This is the largest geographic extent

00:07:25.247 --> 00:07:27.798
that the Roman Empire takes on.

00:07:27.798 --> 00:07:29.667
Trajan is succeeded by Hadrian,

00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:31.817
most known for Hadrian's Wall.

00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:35.237
He had the upper-bound
of the Roman Empire.

00:07:35.237 --> 00:07:38.639
Then, the Pax Romana ends
with Marcus Aurelius,

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:41.608
who is viewed as a, he's
actually wrote meditations.

00:07:41.608 --> 00:07:43.808
He's a philosopher-emperor.

00:07:43.808 --> 00:07:47.975
He's viewed as one of the
last great stoic philosophers.

00:07:49.829 --> 00:07:53.996
With that, you have the end
of this period of Pax Romana.

00:07:55.187 --> 00:07:57.868
As we'll see in the next few videos,

00:07:57.868 --> 00:08:01.389
we then start really
getting into the decline of

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:03.280
at least the Western Roman Empire,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.401
as we'll see the Eastern
Roman Empire outlives the West

00:08:06.401 --> 00:08:08.484
by a good thousand years.
