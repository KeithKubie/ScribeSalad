00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:05.890
The City of London is a unique place -- it's
the city in a city (in a country in a country)

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.760
that runs its government with perhaps the
most complicated elections in the world involving

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.900
medieval guilds, modern corporations, mandatory
titles and fancy hats, all of which are connected

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.420
in this horrifying org chart.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.500
Why so complicated?

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.690
Though the new Skyscrapers might make you
think the City of London is relatively young,

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.530
it's actually the oldest continuous government
on the Island of Great Britain.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.240
The City of London predates the Empire that
Victoria ruled, the Kingdoms Anne united and

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.159
the Magna Carta that John, reluctantly, signed.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:38.480
While the London which surrounds the city
only got to electing its first Mayor in 2000,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.460
the list of Mayors who've governed the City
of London is almost 700 people long going

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.739
back more than a thousand years.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.640
The City of London's government is so old
there's no surviving record of when it was

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.899
born -- there are only documents, like the
Magna Carta, which mention the pre-existing

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.059
powers the City of London already had at that
time.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.890
While a government like the United States's
officially gets its power from the people,

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.970
and Parliament gets its power from the Crown,
(which in turn gets it from God), the City

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.060
of London gets its power from 'time immemorial'
meaning that the City is so old, it just is.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.100
And that age brings with it unusual and complicated
traditions, the most notable of these, perhaps,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.969
is that in city of London elections, companies
get votes.

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.600
Quite a lot actually, about 3/4th of the votes
cast in City elections are from companies

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.950
with the remaining 1/4th from residents.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.450
The way it works is that the bigger a company
is the more votes it gets from the City of

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.450
London.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.150
The companies then give their votes to select
employees who work, but do not live, within

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.810
the city and it's these employees who do the
actual voting at election time.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.570
The result is that the Common Council, the
bureaucratic beating heart of the City of

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.070
London, has about 20 common councilors elected
by residents of the city and about 80 elected

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.640
by companies of the city.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.189
The reasoning behind this unusual tradition
is that for every 1 person who lives in the

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.719
City of London, 43 people commute in every
day.

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.710
In total that's 300,000 commuters using City
services and whose employment depends on the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.220
City of London being business friendly.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.550
The man in charge of the common council and
who heads The City's government is The Right

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.890
Honorable, the Lord Mayor of London.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.360
Now, suppose *you* want to be Lord Mayor,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.750
Surely, just as in that other London all you'll
need do is

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.890
a) Be a British, Commonwealth, or EU citizen,
who has

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.111
b) lived in the city for a year, and who

00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:28.640
c) wins the election

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.640
Right?

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.310
No, in The City of London, that's not nearly
enough.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.250
Ready for the qualifications list?

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.720
Before you even run for Lord Mayor you need
have been a Sheriff of The City of London.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.970
But before you can be Sheriff, you need to
be an Aldermen.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.970
What's an Aldermen?

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.490
Well, the City of London is divided into 25
wards, and each Ward elects one Aldermen to

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.200
represent it on the Court of Aldermen -- a
sub-section of the common council.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.200
Before you can run for Alderman, you need
to gain Freeman Status... and who gives out

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.300
freeman status?

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.910
Why none other than the very Court of Aldermen
you're trying to get elected to.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.880
Which might just seem like a conflict of interest.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.120
Luckily there is another way to get the freeman
status -- join one of the City's Guilds -- sadly,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.700
they aren't called guilds, they're called
Livery Companies (a name which is both more

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.450
boring and less descriptive), but the remnants
of medieval guilds many of them are and within

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.820
the City there are 108 of them to choose from
including, but not limited to,

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.820
The Apothecaries

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.820
The Fishmongers

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.820
The Masons

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.820
The Mercers

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.820
The Scientific Instrument Makers

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.820
The Bankers

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.820
The Shipwrights

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:32.820
The Wheelwrights

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.820
The Butchers,

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.820
The bakers,

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.820
*Two* different candlestick makers,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.820
and the most exciting of all: The Chartered
Accountants!

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.400
Many of these guilds, like the Fletchers,
have become charities, but some are still

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.480
active, such as the Goldsmiths who test the
quality of British coinage and the Hackney

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.120
carriage drivers who license taxi drivers.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.210
To join one of these guilds you'll either
need to meet the professional requirements,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.940
or for the charities like the Haberdashers
you'll need the approval of two existing members,

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.940
others won't tell you how to become a members.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.290
If, you meet none of the Livery Companies
membership requirements, but you think you'll

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.730
be a clever clogs and start your *own* Livery
Company and grant *yourself* freeman status,

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.040
tough luck because new Livery Companies need
to be approved by, you guessed it, the Court

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.040
of Aldermen.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.150
But let's assume one way or another you get
the official freeman status certificate, now

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.670
you can finally run for Aldermen of a Ward
-- after the Lord Chancellorâ€™s Advisory

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.400
Committee also approves of you.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.190
But, that small barrier passed, you can win
election as Aldermen in either one of the

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.430
4 wards where people live or the 21 wards
where companies live.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.210
Once on the court of aldermen to continue
your path to the Mayor's Office in Guildhall,

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.220
you must now be elected as sheriff, but this
time it's the members of the Livery Companies

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.500
who pick the sheriffs.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.290
So *if* the Livery Company members elect you
as Sheriff, *after* you have successfully

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.590
completed your term *then* you can finally
run for Mayor.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.560
But, surprisingly the, residents of the City
of London don't vote for the Mayor, our old

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.840
friends on the Court of Aldermen do.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.010
So in summary, once you get freeman status
from either the court of aldermen or the livery

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.760
companies and after your ward elected you
as alderman and then the livery companies

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.840
elect you as sheriff and after your term as
sheriff ends but while you're still on the

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.750
court of aldermen then you can run for Mayor.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.250
And -- assuming the other aldermen select
you, finally take your place as **The Right

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:13.070
Honorable, The Lord Mayor of London** -- for
one year, with no salary.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.040
And you have to cover your own expenses, which
will be quite considerable as your new job

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.180
consists mostly of making hundreds of speeches
a year around the world promoting city business.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.960
But you do get that fancy hat, which just
might make it all worth while.
