00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.870
- [Instructor] The table below shows

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.090
solar panel installations by state

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.400
during the last fiscal year.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.050
How many total solar panels

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.670
were installed last year in Wyoming?

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.140
So we look at the state, so
this right over here is Wyoming

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.250
and this whole table is
about solar installations

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.230
by states during the last year,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.200
so this is the Wyoming
during the last year.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.410
This is the first quarter,
so the first three months,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.690
the second three months,
the third quarter,

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.300
the fourth quarter and
this right over here

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.180
is the total number of solar panels

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.280
that were installed in Wyoming last year,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.810
which is what I think
they're asking us for,

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.120
so let's just type that in, 104.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.953
We got it right.

00:00:39.953 --> 00:00:41.290
Let's do another one.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.530
The table below indicates
the points scored

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.540
by four players in a
charity basketball game.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.960
How many points did Ben have in total?

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.970
So here is Ben right over here.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.310
It's broken down by quarter,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.610
but we care about his total
number of points, which is 31.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.243
So Ben had a total of 31 points.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.760
So this indicates the points
scored by four players

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.560
in a charity basketball game again.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.650
How many points did Vanessa
score in the fourth quarter?

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.690
So let's look at, this is Vanessa,

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.500
and we care about the fourth quarter,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.910
so she scored four points
in the fourth quarter.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.380
Put four right over there.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.320
Alright.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.450
So once again, we're talking
about solar panel installations

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.850
by state during the last fiscal year.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.580
How many solar panels were installed

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.970
in Alabama in the second quarter, in Q2?

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.190
So Alabama in the second quarter,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.344
so that's this right over here,

00:01:35.344 --> 00:01:38.690
28 solar panels were installed.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.223
So 28.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.630
So this is once again in a charity game.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.000
How many points did Kevin
score in the third quarter?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.967
So Kevin in the third quarter,
he scored nine, nine points.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.730
And one more just for fun.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.310
So how many points did Gabriela
score in the third quarter.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.140
Well, same idea, Gabriela, third quarter,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.433
she scored five points.
