00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.444
The solutions were negative 3 halves, and 1 6th. Nice work if you found both of

00:00:04.444 --> 00:00:09.130
these. You've really mastered factoring if you got these correct. If this gave

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.968
you some trouble, you definitely want to review your factoring techniques, and

00:00:11.968 --> 00:00:16.740
try solving some quadratic equations on your own. We start factoring by finding

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.796
the factor pair of negative 36 that sums to positive 16. Those two factors are

00:00:22.796 --> 00:00:27.142
negative 2 and 18. We use these as the coefficients of x to rewrite this middle

00:00:27.142 --> 00:00:32.960
term. Then we use factoring by grouping to get 2 x plus 3 times 6 x minus 1.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.580
Next, we set each of these factors equal to 0. We solve each equation for x to

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.401
get x is equal to negative 3 halves, and x is equal to 1 6th. This is our

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:43.490
solution set.
