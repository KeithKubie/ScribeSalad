00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:09.670
PRASAD SETTY: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.670
Welcome to today's Talks
at Google with Sri M.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:14.850
I'm Prasad Setty.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.550
I'm a Vice President in our
People Operations organization

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.260
here at Google.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.700
I lead our People
Analytics, Compensation,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.320
and Benefits teams.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.870
We are here today to
talk with Sri M, who

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.182
is no stranger to Google and
perhaps not to many of you.

00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:29.890
But since this is
going to be on YouTube,

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.480
I want to read out a short
introduction as well.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.570
Sri M is a spiritual guide,
author, a social reformer,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.040
and educationist.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.480
His transformational
journey from a young boy

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.830
born in a Muslim family
to being a living yogi

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.630
is a fascinating
story symbolized

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.750
by single-minded
discipline and dedication.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.080
At 19, he embarked on a
journey to the Himalayas,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.650
seeking a true master he found
in the form of Maheshwarnath

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.970
Babaji.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.370
After traveling extensively
through the Himalayas

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.290
with his teacher
for a few years,

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.200
his teacher encouraged him
to return to the plains

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.330
to start a family
life and to prepared

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.070
for his life's mission.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.710
Over the years, his efforts
as a social reformer

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.960
and educationalist
have given rise

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.890
to many initiatives that include
Satsang Vidyalaya, Satsang

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.290
Rural School, Peepal Grove
School, Satsang Swasthya

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.190
Kendra, and Manav Ekta Mission.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.570
He completed a walk
of hope in 2015-2016,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.420
a 15-month-long journey
from Kanyakumari

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.930
to Kashmir, spanning
7,500 kilometers

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.730
across 11 states in India, for
peace, harmony, and tolerance.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.370
He also did another
walk of hope in Europe

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.590
earlier this year in 2017.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.410
Conversant with the teachings
of most major religions,

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.360
Sri M says, go to the core.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.660
Theories are of no use.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.120
His method seeks to
transcend the outer shell

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.710
of all religions by
exploring their mystical core

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.660
to nurture the innate
goodness in every human being.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.540
He has authored several
books, including

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.710
his memoir, "Apprenticed To
A Himalayan Master, A Yogi's

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.940
Autobiography."

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.889
And the journey continues.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.614
Please join me in giving a
very warm welcome to Sri M.

00:02:13.614 --> 00:02:19.319
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.360
Thank you for being here.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.390
SRI M: Thank you, sir.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.348
PRASAD SETTY: I thought
I'd start off initially

00:02:23.348 --> 00:02:27.710
with a question about just your
early years and your journey

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.060
to the Himalayas.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.730
Most of us are
brought up thinking

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.760
about what a standard model
of success looks like.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.830
We all need to study
and go to college

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.941
and go get a job,
perhaps at a Google.

00:02:39.941 --> 00:02:40.440
Right?

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.370
That is what we are
all taught to do.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.860
But you took a very
different path.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.300
You decided that
you would go off

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.390
to the Himalayas,
which is not something

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.230
that most people think of.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.050
Tell us about that.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.258
You know, what was that
thought process like for you,

00:02:54.258 --> 00:02:57.514
and what made you
embark on that journey?

00:02:57.514 --> 00:03:02.670
SRI M: [INAUDIBLE] like this,
when something is so serious,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.920
and you want to do it, then
you do it no matter what

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.916
the consequences.

00:03:09.916 --> 00:03:13.310
And in my case you can
imagine-- even in India--

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.370
if you are born
in a Hindu family,

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.820
and then you decide at the age
of 19 to leave your college

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.950
and go to the
Himalayas, it's a shock.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.450
Even if you are born in there.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.260
And in my case, being
born in a Muslim family,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.530
to say that at the age of
19 you stop your college

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.490
and go to the
Himalayas of all places

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.340
is quite a tough
thing to take up.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.140
So I did the short cut
in this matter, which

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.190
is I didn't inform anybody.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.440
I quietly disappeared.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.380
So I went to the Himalayas.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.250
Now this is not just
a sudden thought

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.100
that came when I was 19.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.890
It had been working on
my mind for many years.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.610
Because at the age of nine--

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.960
how much time do we have?

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.460
PRASAD SETTY: We
have an hour today.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.529
And so I have a few questions,
and then shortly after that,

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:10.320
we'll turn it over to
the audience as well.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.069
SRI M: Sure, yeah.

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.310
So I'll try to keep it short.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.450
At the age of nine, I met
an extraordinary individual

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.340
in the backyard of our
house in Trivandrum.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.770
I was born in Kerala,
in the southern part.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.880
The capital of Kerala is
Trivandrum, the coastal side.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:36.050
So I met this wonderful
person and he touched me once

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.520
on my head.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.060
We can say he laid
his hands on my head.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.490
And after that, he disappeared--

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.800
I mean he went away.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.080
I'm not saying disappeared
like he came and went poof.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.680
And then that, I think, did
a lot of things to my mind.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.140
I started thinking differently.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.250
When others would be playing,
I would be sitting quietly

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.030
and looking at the sky.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.130
In fact, my parents started
wondering if there was

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.390
something going wrong with me.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.750
I did have to go
to a psychiatrist.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.139
I was taken there.

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:18.930
So don't believe a word
of what I'm saying.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.040
I might have gone bananas.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.570
I was taken to a psychiatrist.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.410
And after five minutes,
the psychiatrist

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.060
said to my people who
had brought me there,

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.620
my uncle and so on.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.320
Can you go out, step
out for a while?

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.020
I need to have a private chat.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.070
This was when I was 14 or 13.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.390
And they stepped out.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.566
And then the psychiatrist said,
I know this is all nonsense.

00:05:47.566 --> 00:05:48.940
But can we discuss
the Upanishad?

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.350
PRASAD SETTY: So you
know, it was interesting.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.900
I had a long relationship
with him later on.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:08.360
Anyway, then it was things
were changing in my mind.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.430
I was wondering if, as you
said, there's only one world--

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.350
where you study, you get
your job, you get married,

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.450
you have children, you
die, and you go off?

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.780
Or is there something
other than that?

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.676
Is there something
that is offbeat?

00:06:22.676 --> 00:06:27.940
You know how the flower
people and the hippies

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.190
respond in the United States?

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.520
They were looking for
something alternate.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.380
PRASAD SETTY: Right.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.200
SRI M: But it ended up
in drugs, of course.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.490
But there is, of course,
the human mind seeking

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.930
for something different.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.220
I think all minds
sometimes seek.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.650
They're so bogged down
by day-to-day life

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.340
and the practicalities of
living that there is no time,

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.460
there is no energy to do this.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.720
In my case, I
decided, if there is

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.170
something like that,
which is alternate,

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.470
I need to go at it whole hog.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.936
Let's put it that.

00:07:03.936 --> 00:07:05.810
PRASAD SETTY: And once
you made the decision,

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.300
how did you know what to do?

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.979
How did you know how to
get to the Himalayas?

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:10.520
SRI M: Right.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.990
So then, from that age
of, let's say, 12, 13,

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:20.730
I started reading books on the
yogis and philosophy and things

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:21.710
like that.

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.670
I met several people who were in
that locality who were supposed

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.850
to be spiritually evolved.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.010
And then in most
books I encountered

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.520
one thing, which is that high,
high up in the Himalayas,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.280
there are these great yogis.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.210
OK?

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:43.670
And also, I had this fascination
for the snow-capped mountains.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.040
In the south of India, there are
no snow-capped mountains there.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.920
So when I saw clouds,
I used to imagine

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.800
that they were like mountains.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.660
If you ask me why,
it's something

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.930
to do with what was already
in my consciousness, maybe

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.090
from the past.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.260
PRASAD SETTY: Sure.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.340
SRI M: So I decided I
will go to the Himalayas.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:09.500
There is no Google
then, no maps,

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.070
nothing you could do,
no search engines.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:18.230
So I had to relay on
the old railway guides

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.730
to check how to get there.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:25.380
So we was in a pretty
affluent family.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.530
So there was-- my
pocket money was

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.750
enough to take me out there.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.419
In fact, that was
my father's regret,

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.880
that instead of taking
over the family business,

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.679
I chose to run away somewhere.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:42.760
Anyways, so I-- finally, after
a great deal of traveling,

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.490
I reached Badrinath
in the Himalayas.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:52.640
And there I met and I can't--
we can't explain the entire

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.980
circumstances here.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.980
It's there in my book
and autobiography,

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.150
which is "Apprenticed
To A Himalayan Master."

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.910
It's already there on Amazon.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.930
Anybody can go in and take it.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:10.130
So I met the same
person who I had met

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.070
when I was a nine-year-old boy.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.940
And the way he greeted
me was interesting.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.170
As soon as he saw me,
and I saw him, I said,

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:20.960
oh, this is the person.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.650
He said, oh, you wandered
around and come back to me.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.090
He learned Hindi.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.410
He said [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:36.290
So I told him, look, Babaji,
I'm not going to leave you.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.090
I want to be with you forever.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:40.040
He smiled, and he said,
we'll think about it.

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.170
SRI M: So this is
how my life started.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:49.110
And I spent 2 and 1/2
full years with him,

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.640
wandering, going
wherever he went,

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.050
like a dog following its master.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.300
Not the modern dogs,
masters follow the dogs.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.510
You see?

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.330
Why, yeah.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:04.270
So I spent-- and
whatever I have here,

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.190
whatever has been understood
here as well as here,

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.670
I think both are important,
the heart and the brain--

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.990
is from those 2 and
1/2 to three years

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:21.080
of being with this great person,
studying, more than actually

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.460
studying, the feeling of it.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.650
PRASAD SETTY: Yeah.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.050
Your book describes
many wonderful stories

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.260
in your journeys
with your master.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.720
How would you synthesize
and capture the learnings

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.930
from those 2 and 1/2 years?

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.400
Like, you know, what
stands out for you?

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.090
SRI M: It's difficult to
put it all in a nutshell,

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:46.430
but if you try hard, there are
a few important things that

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.000
emerge from all the
data that I have

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.450
and all the
experiences that I had.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.980
And that is, first,
a human being

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:04.040
should think of himself as
part of this entire universe

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.970
and not a separate,
isolated thing.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.020
This is a vast network.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.760
And from our point of
view, the consciousness

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.060
is not confined to one center.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.610
It's an all-pervading
consciousness.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:23.110
It acts from different centers,
from you, from me, from--

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:26.750
but these are only different
points from where it manifests.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:32.036
It's actually one-- let's
say, global consciousness.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.860
Global does not mean
global business.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.960
Global means like every
living being in this universe

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.680
has a place.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.970
PRASAD SETTY: Sure.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.220
SRI M: And it's as
important as anything else.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.420
A human being has the
advantage of having

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.110
the capacity to reflect
and understand this, which

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:55.917
some animals may not have.

00:11:55.917 --> 00:11:57.500
But that doesn't
mean that they're not

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.520
part of the structure.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.750
So this is the first
thing that I learned.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:08.210
The second is that there
are different points of view

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.660
and different ways people
think, due to the differences

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:16.320
in their mental makeup, the
way they live, and so on.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:22.400
Therefore, it's dangerous
to say that I'm always right

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:27.470
and somebody else is wrong, even
when you've studied the truth.

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:35.330
Let's say even if you studied
the concept which many people

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.890
call God, or the truth,
whatever you want to say.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.070
If it is infinite,
if, we think it is--

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.200
if it is infinite--

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.350
then there must be infinite
ways of reaching it.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.090
It can't be one.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.660
See all the problems,
even in this world,

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.060
start when we say
there is only one way.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.020
PRASAD SETTY: Sure.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.680
SRI M: Even in a small
setup like your own home,

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.030
I have a wife.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.940
I'm a married man.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.560
I am not a monk.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.660
If I insist that I'm always
right and my wife is wrong,

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.740
how do you live this way?

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.890
Because it's a fact that
she may be right many times.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.570
So I also learned that
the second point--

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.690
to look at things
from different angles.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.760
And say, hey, wait a minute.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.520
There are different
ways of looking at it.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.010
You don't become so caught up
in what you are saying is right.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.970
There may be different ways.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:47.105
And the third is a healthy
concern for all living beings.

00:13:47.105 --> 00:13:48.010
PRASAD SETTY: Hm.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:52.130
SRI M: Now living beings also
includes trees and plants,

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.250
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.390
In some way, they
are all living.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.350
And we like to think that
only those things are

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.090
living which can move.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.940
The tree doesn't
move, but it lives.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.660
So this is like the
first point which I said,

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.340
that we are part of this whole.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.290
W, actually whole,
not H-O-L-E hole.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.940
We are part of this whole.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:22.260
And we have a place in
the system, of course.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.070
And the less selfish
we become, the better

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:29.980
we merge with the system.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.089
And fourth, since you
asked for points--

00:14:32.089 --> 00:14:32.880
PRASAD SETTY: Sure.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.490
SRI M: --you can put
them into points.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.281
PRASAD SETTY: Sure.

00:14:35.281 --> 00:14:38.500
SRI M: The fourth be
that there are ways

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:43.630
and means to get in touch with
the essence of your being.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:48.350
It's beyond all religions and
doctrines and philosophies.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:49.850
There is a way.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:52.390
There are ways of getting
in touch with the core

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.310
of your consciousness.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.800
Once you get in touch with the
core of your consciousness,

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.120
or even begin to see
this possibility,

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.650
then you can no longer
be the same person.

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:06.350
You may dress the same, but
you can't be the same person.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.960
You see everything
reflected as one.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.600
PRASAD SETTY: Sure.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.825
So talking about
those practices then,

00:15:13.825 --> 00:15:16.600
is that where things like
meditation and mindfulness,

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.370
et cetera, come into play?

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.405
And how would you distinguish--
are they the same things when

00:15:21.405 --> 00:15:22.780
you think about
mindfulness, when

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:23.840
you think about meditation?

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.590
Are they the same?

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.080
Are they different concepts?

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.698
Can you share a little more
about the practices themselves?

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.050
SRI M: When I say practice,
it need not necessarily

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.960
mean a technique.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.210
Techniques are there, of
course, very important.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.110
However, when I say practice it
means it starts with a mindset

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.280
first.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:51.130
When we say we want
to find out, then

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.040
it begins with a
mindset which says,

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.510
let me explore this with
no prejudice whatsoever.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.343
PRASAD SETTY: Right.

00:15:58.343 --> 00:15:59.360
Right.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.270
Keep an open mind.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.960
SRI M: Keep an open mind.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.940
So that is the first step.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.409
There are two kinds
of people, generally.

00:16:09.409 --> 00:16:10.700
There are many kinds of people.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.030
But you can divide them
into those who say,

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.680
well, I am very scientific.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.930
I'm very materialistic.

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:18.380
I don't believe.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.890
Now what I'm saying is that
if you start with an inquiry

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.117
saying I don't believe,
then you cannot inquire.

00:16:27.117 --> 00:16:27.950
PRASAD SETTY: Right.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.533
SRI M: For that's a
distracting point.

00:16:29.533 --> 00:16:30.520
PRASAD SETTY: Right.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.230
SRI M: At least
suspend your judgment,

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.200
and say, let me find out.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.264
There's the other set which
is so deeply religious,

00:16:37.264 --> 00:16:38.680
and it doesn't
believe in anything

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.430
that is material and
physical and scientific.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:42.620
This is another extreme.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.750
PRASAD SETTY: Sure.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:48.430
SRI M: So we have to find
a middle point somewhere.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:52.840
If you do that, then it's
possible to slowly explore.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.310
This mindset has
to develop first.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:01.210
Then, if you do this,
you'll discover also

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.950
that the entire journey starts--

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:07.310
the first starting point
of this spiritual journey

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.760
is a quiet mind.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.526
You know our mind is
always distracted.

00:17:11.526 --> 00:17:12.359
PRASAD SETTY: Right.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:14.231
Right.

00:17:14.231 --> 00:17:15.730
And we keeping
inventing new things.

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.890
SRI M: We keep
inventing new things.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.470
It's OK to invent
physically new things.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:24.099
But we keep inventing new
ideas, which sometimes

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:27.819
may be quite not conducive
to human welfare also,

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:28.510
many a time.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.100
PRASAD SETTY: Sure.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.770
SRI M: So also you will
notice that you can't sit--

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:36.550
we can't sit with our mind
calm even for a minute.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:37.915
It's jumping around.

00:17:37.915 --> 00:17:39.100
PRASAD SETTY: Yeah.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.560
SRI M: So the
starting point, if you

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:46.030
need to really explore the
core of your consciousness,

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.800
is a quiet mind.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.440
So therefore when it
comes to technique,

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:57.920
we need to figure out some
method by which you can still

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.650
your mind and make it quiet.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.340
The mind can never
become thoughtless.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.310
It's quite a
contradiction to say

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:10.022
that I have a thoughtless mind.

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:11.480
If you have a
thoughtless mind, you

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.330
won't even know who
you are, where you are.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.760
I can say calm mind, quiet mind.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.630
Mind which is positive.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.380
Mind which is not
agitated all the time.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.760
Mind that is not always in
conflict and contradictions,

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.890
such a mind.

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.630
Now for that-- that
is a starting point.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.900
Without that, you can't
explore this vast thing

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.077
called consciousness.

00:18:34.077 --> 00:18:35.390
PRASAD SETTY: Right.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:39.850
SRI M: So first, we
understand this theoretically,

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:40.599
as we discussed.

00:18:40.599 --> 00:18:41.390
PRASAD SETTY: Sure.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.120
SRI M: Then we see other
ways by which, at least,

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.790
you can start
quietening your mind.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:50.420
Ultimate quietness
of mind comes when

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.590
you've touched this,
whatever we're aiming at.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.970
But you have to start somewhere.

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:02.000
So you should have some method
by which every day, at least

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.080
for 10 or 15 minutes, you can
quieten your mind, sit quietly.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.900
There are a couple
of techniques,

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.250
many techniques, actually,
depends on the person.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.527
Some people get very quiet
when they just sit and pray.

00:19:17.527 --> 00:19:18.840
That's fine.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.140
There are those who
don't believe in that,

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.160
so they have to find other
ways of quietening your mind.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.320
If you have none
of these, like yoga

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.230
is one way of quietening your
mind, which is pranayama,

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.140
watching the breath.

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.260
Working with the breath
is a beautiful way

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:35.540
of quietening your mind.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.590
OK, if you don't want
any of these things,

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:42.190
are you interested in something
like music, for instance?

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.920
So can we sit for
10, 15 minutes,

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.550
just listen to beautiful music,
music which calms you down.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.080
There are all kinds of music.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.710
There is some music, the moment
you listen you start moving.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:58.290
That's OK for a certain
circumstance, but not here.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:03.110
So here you need like
good classical music.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:12.050
I love, myself, I like
Beethoven symphonies or Brahms.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:13.780
There are many,
even in the West.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.049
It is not as if
there's only in India.

00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:16.840
PRASAD SETTY: Sure.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.860
SRI M: So if you get interested
in, for instance, music,

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:26.470
and spend half an hour, one hour
completely absorbed in it, when

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.830
you are fully absorbed in
it, if you quietly reflect,

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.700
you will see that your
mind has become calm.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.750
There is no
distraction out there.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.200
Distraction happens when
I am not interested,

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.710
and I'm forcing my
mind to get into.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.140
This is when distraction comes.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.840
When I am really absorbed,
there is no distraction,

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.020
which means every human
being has the potential

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.630
to remain undistracted.

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:50.670
PRASAD SETTY: Right.

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:55.038
SRI M: It is not
properly tapped.

00:20:55.038 --> 00:20:57.857
PRASAD SETTY: How do you
develop that practice?

00:20:57.857 --> 00:21:00.190
Many people in the audience
and those who are listening,

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:01.990
perhaps, have young kids.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.740
And kids nowadays are growing
up with a lot of technology that

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.530
just keeps them occupied,
right, but it also

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.090
leads to distractions.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.910
Any thoughts on how
do you cultivate

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:16.540
this practice and this kind of
thinking, even at a young age?

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:23.400
SRI M: OK, now children,
especially little kids,

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.620
more than teaching them, we
have to set an example to them,

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.290
you know?

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.815
If I live a kind of life, and
I teach them, hey, be calm,

00:21:31.815 --> 00:21:32.960
it doesn't work.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.810
Because they are
very intelligent.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.230
They know exactly
where you stand.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.150
So when you have
children, if you

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.210
lead a life which is
conducive to quietness,

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:45.050
then they will start imitating.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:45.660
OK.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.910
The other thing is children
are full of energy.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:50.820
They want to do many things.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.760
I will give an example.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.680
There are some kids who
love to paint and draw.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:03.750
For them, the wall in the
bedroom or the sitting room

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.406
is a canvas.

00:22:05.406 --> 00:22:09.060
They start drawing on
it, scribbling on it.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.890
And what is the first
reaction we have?

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.736
Hey, don't do it on the wall.

00:22:12.736 --> 00:22:18.490
You're actually killing
the genius out of there.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:19.890
So what is the solution?

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.980
We can't get canvases
and hang them everywhere.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.670
So the other day there was
this problem, actually.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:35.630
And I advised the parents, can
you leave one wall for the kid?

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:39.030
Any time you want to
draw, use this wall.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.450
Don't say don't draw.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.280
Don't stop.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.580
So we need to understand
the child first.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.900
And very often we should
know that children are

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.800
sometimes wiser than grownups.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.410
We like to think because we
have a lot of experience we

00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:59.610
know everything.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:04.770
But sometimes child can
teach us many things.

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:06.360
So if there is
this understanding

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.230
between this child
and the parents,

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:12.990
then the child also is
very happy with this.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.510
Because he sees the
parents as not somebody

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.760
who is trying to
impose things on them.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.510
People want interacting.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:22.960
PRASAD SETTY: Sure.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.860
SRI M: So these are some of
the things that we can follow.

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.860
PRASAD SETTY: Yeah.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.680
SRI M: So if they find you
getting up in the morning,

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.860
brushing your teeth, and
sitting down quietly,

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.570
they will ask curiously,
what's happening?

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.514
Don't tell them, you sit down.

00:23:37.514 --> 00:23:39.850
PRASAD SETTY: Yeah.

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:41.349
Provide a role model for them.

00:23:41.349 --> 00:23:42.140
SRI M: You need to.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.700
PRASAD SETTY: A
role model for them.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.740
Going back to the Himalayas,
you spent 2 and 1/2 years.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:48.850
As you mentioned, when
you met your master,

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.680
your initial thought was,
I'm going to stay with you.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.150
But then after 2 and
1/2 years, you know,

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:59.210
you came back down south.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.970
Tell us about the decision
and how you made that.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.160
SRI M: There is a
very nice description

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.035
in the autobiography.

00:24:08.035 --> 00:24:11.000
But I'll tell you.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.180
After 2 and 1/2
years or three years,

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.670
roughly almost three
years, when I was mostly

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:23.960
with my master,
Maheshwarnath Babaji,

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.720
walking everywhere
in the Himalayas

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.280
because he was a
man who wouldn't

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.930
use any kind of transport.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.330
He always walked.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:39.500
Maybe later on, the walk of hope
originated there from my mind.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:43.310
So one day, he
dropped a bombshell.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:47.770
I had forgotten everything about
my home and everything about--

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:53.270
and I was quite happy,
actually, really, really happy.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:56.630
Suddenly, one day
he said to me, now

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:59.310
it's time for you to go back.

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:02.960
This was something
I did not expect.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.640
It's time for you to go back.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.730
I said, oh, Babaji,
where would I go back?

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:12.380
Because there's no
place to go back.

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.770
I have burned my bridges.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:17.210
There's nothing left.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:18.980
And here, I'm happy.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.400
So he said to me,
I thought I was

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:27.300
working on you all these
years to make your mind,

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.540
to expand your mind.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.605
Looks like your mind
is narrowed down.

00:25:31.605 --> 00:25:34.310
It's thinking only about
yourself and the Himalayas.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:37.110
What about the wide world?

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:39.636
So I said, but still,
I can work from here.

00:25:39.636 --> 00:25:41.260
He said, no, you
cannot work from here.

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.520
You go back and bless.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.460
You have a special role to play.

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.830
I trained you not for--

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.050
I didn't want to waste
my time with you.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.210
And you have a
special role to play.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.790
Go back, be normal.

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:57.330
I mean, you can't be normal.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:57.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:01.180
SRI M: Pretend to
be normal, and be--

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:05.390
you know, wear ordinary
clothes and just stay.

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:08.150
And then later on,
when you feel like it,

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:12.560
you might probably find
somebody and lead a married life

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.550
and have kids.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:18.970
He said, most of the people
who come to you are not monks.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:22.860
They are people who lead
a life in this world.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.060
So you are in no position
to give them any advice

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.382
if you don't know
what it is all about.

00:26:29.382 --> 00:26:33.730
So go back, lead a normal life.

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:36.440
Work for your living.

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.250
We'll see as, if
you find somebody,

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:40.510
we'll see how it works.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.280
PRASAD SETTY: Mhm.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.510
SRI M: So very
reluctantly, I left.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:47.860
And not only that,
after leaving home,

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.980
I had not informed my mother.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.570
So nobody knew where I was.

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:57.550
In fact, my parents
thought that I'd died.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:02.140
And I was the only
son in the family.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.720
In India, it's very
important, son--

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.140
only son and eldest,
oldest of the family.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.990
So they were completely--

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:14.480
their hearts were
broken in a way.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:20.350
So Babaji told me, you are
not going back like this,

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:21.840
as you are now.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.850
Because those days, you
know, I never used to cut--

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:27.320
I had very thick growth of--

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.400
in my head, the hair.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:34.340
So like Babaji, I always used
to tie it up to about this high.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:39.550
And I used to have a
[INAUDIBLE] bead on my neck.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:45.130
I used to wear just a white
piece of cloth and sleeveless.

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:49.990
And since Babaji belonged
to the Nath tradition,

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:53.020
we are all supposed
to wear rings.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.210
So I had rings in my ears.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:58.480
So Babaji said, you
are not going like this

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.870
in front of your mother.

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:02.350
Already she has a problem,
and she might probably

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.090
get a heart attack straight.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.840
So he sent me to Delhi.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:11.710
And he had a disciple who
lived there, was a businessman.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:14.830
And he had instructed him
to go take me to the tailor,

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.220
get me a pair of pants,
and he was so kind.

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.180
So when people talk
of mindfulness,

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.200
I always say mindfulness is not
just sitting down and looking

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.310
at your mind.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:27.390
Mindfulness is minding
other people, how they feel.

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:35.780
So he said, then he also
said go to the barber

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.480
and get a decent haircut.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.455
I was about to ask
him, what about you?

00:28:40.455 --> 00:28:43.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:47.090
SRI M: Get a decent haircut
and go back, like, you know.

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.520
Then he said, remove
your earrings.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.650
I was really unhappy, because
I was so fond of them.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:54.180
Anyway, they were copper.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.880
So I got them out.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.410
Now what?

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:59.222
He said, put it into
the Ganga, there you go.

00:28:59.222 --> 00:29:00.680
PRASAD SETTY: What
was it like when

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.890
you came back and met your
family after all those years?

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.920
SRI M: You know, they
thought that I had died.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.590
In fact, somebody told me that
they saw an ad in the paper,

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:14.180
in the "Indian Express,"
saying, please let

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:17.330
us know if you find this guy.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:21.669
So my mother was
shaken when she saw me.

00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:23.210
I don't think she
could say anything.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:25.370
She just hugged me and cried.

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:28.020
There was nothing she could say.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:32.130
And my father was a little
more controlled kind of person.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:34.200
So he just said, so how are you?

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.202
Was everything OK?

00:29:35.202 --> 00:29:36.160
I said everything's OK.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:36.900
Are you going back?

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.941
Will you be staying here?

00:29:37.941 --> 00:29:40.070
I said I am staying here.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:42.740
OK, that's fine.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.350
So it was like that.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.990
I don't know later, what
they talked among themselves.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.250
I have no idea.

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:51.250
So this is how it happened.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:54.630
So I went back, and just
as Babaji instructed,

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.700
I started finding work
here and there, doing--

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.650
I worked as a journalist
for some time.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:00.960
I did many things.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.360
I worked for NGOs.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.790
I did quite a lot.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:06.020
Because I was sure I
couldn't do the business,

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:06.820
which he was doing.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.920
He was into construction.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.790
And construction is one of
the most corrupt businesses

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:14.450
possible and I just
couldn't fit into it.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.700
So I didn't do that.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.000
He was unhappy, but it's OK.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.580
I mean?

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.930
So this is how it was.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:28.420
Then I met this girl
who I got married to.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.780
We have a nine-year difference.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:36.164
And we started our life.

00:30:36.164 --> 00:30:37.511
And I'm here now.

00:30:37.511 --> 00:30:38.010
Yeah.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.106
PRASAD SETTY: Very nice.

00:30:39.106 --> 00:30:40.660
I have a couple
of more questions,

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.970
and then we'll turn it
over to the audience.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:45.790
I wanted to shift our attention
to the Walk of Hope itself,

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:48.390
and how did you get that idea?

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:50.530
What exactly were you
trying to accomplish,

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.090
and how do you characterize it?

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:54.640
You have done a couple of them,
one in India, one in Europe.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.765
So tell us about that.

00:30:56.765 --> 00:31:00.510
SRI M: The Walk of Hope
in India is basically,

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:03.130
you know, there is always--

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:06.780
in India, there's always this
difference of religion, God,

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.910
create going on.

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:12.310
Difficult to say at one
time it's less or more,

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.930
but it's there.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:21.960
So I was in a unique position
to go and tell people

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.610
that this is not required.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:28.000
You don't have to fight
in the name of religion,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.450
in the name of--

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:31.420
you know?

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:37.300
My idea was, if you want,
you can stay in peace

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.680
and still accomplish
what you have to do.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.350
In fact, you can
accomplish things

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.650
better if you can
bring about some peace.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.380
You may have
differences of opinion,

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:53.740
but everybody has
different ways of thought.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.820
You can still live together.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.530
You can't become the same.

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:01.960
But you can be different
and yet be one.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.140
We are humanity, after all.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.860
So I thought the best
way to talk about this

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.200
would be to take a walk.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.420
You know, from ancient
times, many people

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:17.630
have walked whenever they wanted
to do something important.

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:21.820
Many people asked me, in this
jet age, why are you walking?

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.950
I said, in this jet
age, I wish everybody

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:27.220
walked at least for
20 minutes every day.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.890
I was walking for over
one year and four months.

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:32.170
And there were many
people walking with me.

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:34.990
There are some people
here who walked with me.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:39.780
So it was a unique experience.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:44.400
One, I was sending the message
that we are human beings.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:49.010
Let's drop the differences
and live together.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:54.200
Two, I was trying
to convey this--

00:32:54.200 --> 00:33:01.530
that there is no high or low.

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:06.440
You might be economically poor,
somebody may be very rich.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.980
But when it comes to grief
and difficulties and problems,

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.320
it's common to all,
and the same-- the joys

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.930
are common to all.

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:16.114
Everybody has some kind of joy.

00:33:16.114 --> 00:33:17.780
These are things which
are not different

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.595
just because you are
Thomas, or you are

00:33:19.595 --> 00:33:22.630
[INAUDIBLE], or a Ranganath.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:25.400
You still have your sorrows,
you still have your joys.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.380
You are no different.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.640
So this was one of the
reasons why I walked.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.610
And walking makes a
lot of difference.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:36.910
You actually are
with the people.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:41.920
It's like literally when
you say down to earth.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.380
When you walk, you're
down to earth, really,

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.150
touching your feet to the earth.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:48.970
You're not flying.

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:53.170
So I think it did make a good
impact, because we walked

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:58.560
from village to village, city to
city, met all kinds of people.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:02.860
Not only could we sow
some seeds of harmony,

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.300
we also learned a lot.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:10.360
Not only did we learn from the
villages and people we met,

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.920
we also learned among
ourselves in the group

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:18.400
that we were how minds worked.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.440
It's easy to stare away
and pretend to be nice.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:25.510
But when you are together
you're not always nice, see?

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:28.940
So all these things had
great lessons to be learned.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:33.400
So I think-- well, we
have sowed the seeds.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.420
But I don't think you can
expect a big tree to grow

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.580
after five days or two years.

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.170
It takes time.

00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:44.020
Now we need to work on this.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:47.110
So having seen
this, some friends

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.580
from abroad had come
and walked with us.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.999
Like, somebody
came from Germany.

00:34:51.999 --> 00:34:55.330
So they organized
a talk in Berlin.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:58.780
So we had to walk in
Berlin city for a day.

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:02.265
Then in Netherlands,
in Hague, which

00:35:02.265 --> 00:35:04.690
is the International
Court of Justice,

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:07.930
so they organized
a very big walk.

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:09.800
It was only for a day.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.930
But there were over
1,500 people walking.

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:17.752
And they are saying, every year
we need to repeat this walk.

00:35:17.752 --> 00:35:19.210
And there were all
kinds of people.

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:20.200
There were immigrants.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.650
There were people from
there, the Dutch, and so on.

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:27.660
So I think the movement
is slowly catching up.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:33.480
People are beginning to see
me as the man who walks.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.690
You know, when I was young,
I used to read comic books.

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:39.010
Phantom was called
a ghost who walks.

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:41.184
It's like the man who walks.

00:35:41.184 --> 00:35:44.307
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:44.307 --> 00:35:46.765
PRASAD SETTY: One last question
and then we'll turn it over

00:35:46.765 --> 00:35:47.464
to the audience.

00:35:47.464 --> 00:35:49.380
I'm curious, like, whether
it's the Himalayas,

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.700
whether it's the Walk of
Hope itself, like just what

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.360
even the mundane things--

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:55.090
how did you prepare
for something

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:57.280
that is so elaborate,
so strenuous

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.280
on the body, and things
like food, right?

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.240
Like, we can't go 50
feet anywhere at Google

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.080
without running into food.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.925
When you were taking
on journeys like this,

00:36:04.925 --> 00:36:05.800
like, what was your--

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.216
SRI M: I'm sorry
I'm not looking--

00:36:07.216 --> 00:36:10.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:15.310
SRI M: You see, if you ask
me, I really don't know.

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:18.310
I don't know how it--
the whole thing happened.

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:19.660
I really don't know.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:21.820
It just happened.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.790
I think we were very
sincere about it.

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:26.860
There were no vested
interests anywhere.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:30.485
So it just-- from day one,
we did face some problems

00:36:30.485 --> 00:36:31.110
here and there.

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:34.720
But it worked out.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.920
And we very carefully kept
out big corporate institutions

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.250
from funding us, especially
the liquor lobby.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:43.954
PRASAD SETTY: Mhm.

00:36:43.954 --> 00:36:45.370
SRI M: Because
that means we would

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:47.740
have to take their banners.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.249
We didn't want any banners
except A Walk of Hope.

00:36:50.249 --> 00:36:51.040
PRASAD SETTY: Yeah.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.140
Yeah, yeah.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.660
SRI M: But I think it's--

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:59.060
there were about a handful
of people who organized it.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:01.895
They did commit
mistakes, no question.

00:37:01.895 --> 00:37:05.830
But they were, deep down, quite
sincere about these things.

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:07.760
So it worked out quite well.

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:12.100
And I used to have review
meetings every now and then,

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.200
and see how things were going.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.790
And if there was something
wrong, we tried to correct it.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:21.910
Because we knew that you
can't solve all the problems

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:22.950
before we start.

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:23.860
PRASAD SETTY: Sure.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:25.670
SRI M: It's a completely
unique experience.

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:28.720
In fact, many political
leaders came and asked me,

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.100
how did you manage this?

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:34.640
Even with our party in tow,
we are not able to do this.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:35.770
How do you do this?

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:38.580
I said, I don't know.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.360
Why not?

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.330
If you don't know, you
should be sincere enough

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:44.276
to say you don't know.

00:37:44.276 --> 00:37:45.400
PRASAD SETTY: Right, right.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.899
SRI M: And the
problems in the world

00:37:46.899 --> 00:37:49.010
are because everybody knows.

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:50.620
And nobody doesn't know.

00:37:54.377 --> 00:37:56.210
PRASAD SETTY: A question
from the audience--

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:57.880
we have a mic out here.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.940
So we do have a roving
mic, and we are now

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:04.450
ready for any
audience questions.

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:05.160
Anyone?

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:06.756
Yes, so there.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:11.990
AUDIENCE: I think
you had a live master

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:14.780
to guide you in your path.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.195
And we are very lucky
this day and age,

00:38:17.195 --> 00:38:19.070
you know, like YouTube
brings us-- like, once

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:21.320
you get interested in a
topic, all that you have to do

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.260
is, like, deciding which, one
or two, gifts coming and coming.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.910
So that way we are
very, very fortunate

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:28.420
in getting the information,
whether it is open issues

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.610
or what, as you said,
infinite paths are there.

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:33.140
So whatever path appeals
to the individual,

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:37.370
we are able to get more
information on learning

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:39.380
the techniques, to
seek the truth however

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:43.040
we think aligns with us.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.600
My main question is--

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.560
because I consider my--

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.880
it's again another label,
but a seeker or whatever--

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.520
my question is, is it possible
to realize the true nature

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.950
of consciousness without
having experience like you

00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:00.910
had with the live master?

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:05.230
And assuming it's possible,
then I have a second question.

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:07.210
That even assume you did
have direct experience

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:09.050
of your true
nature, how does one

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:12.644
integrate it in everyday
life in this modern times?

00:39:12.644 --> 00:39:15.130
SRI M: Yep.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:19.650
You might read about some
extraordinary experiences,

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:20.700
what's your name?

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:21.632
[INAUDIBLE]--

00:39:21.632 --> 00:39:22.576
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:22.576 --> 00:39:26.110
SRI M: --experiences in my book.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.470
However, I think
in my case, there

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:36.280
was a special kind
of training required.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.340
So that when I go out
into the wide world,

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:44.270
I can deal with people
in different ways.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:47.130
I don't think everybody
needs to go through all that.

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.490
If you don't go
through all that,

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:54.820
it doesn't mean you're any less
spiritually evolved or anything

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:55.930
of that kind.

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:59.170
Because there are
many ways of doing it.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:04.180
I did have a live master,
yes, I agree with you.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.610
Many people may not have.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:10.480
Actually, it's good to
have a wrong live master

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:15.290
than no master at all,
when you might end up

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:17.280
for many years in a mess.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:22.470
So it's better that you do
it yourself in many ways.

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:30.510
So my suggestion in this
matter is that there is

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:34.230
literature available, go to it.

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:39.020
And then see what is
your kind of approach.

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.460
Suppose somebody says, oh,
you should leave everything,

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.620
and then all these things.

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.160
But it's not your cup of tea.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.250
You can't do that,
somebody else, maybe.

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:46.810
OK?

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:48.150
It's not wrong or right.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.310
I'm just saying it's
not your approach.

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:53.940
So take time to
look and figure out

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:59.310
what would be your
approach to this.

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:02.700
Especially if you're a
thinking human being,

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.820
you'd be more
interested in a part

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:07.200
where there is thought
process involved

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.700
and when you're
trying to figure out

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.800
where are we going,
where have we started,

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.040
why are we here, and so on.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:19.760
If the journey starts,
then when required--

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.090
this is my experience--

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:25.310
the help on this path
would come from somewhere.

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:26.880
It may not be one person.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.330
It may be many people.

00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:30.900
But it will come
somehow, because that

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.370
is the law of this
particular journey.

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:39.880
That when you need, you will
get help from somewhere,

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:44.440
provided you are sincere about
it, if we are sincere about it.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:49.240
So that's one part of the
question you asked me.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.790
In fact, without going
to the Himalayas,

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:53.560
you can do it at your home.

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.250
You don't have to
go to the Himalayas,

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.080
but you can go to the
Himalayas sometimes.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.460
You don't have to live
there for two years.

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:03.010
It's not required.

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:08.830
Your own little bedroom can be
converted into the Himalayas,

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:09.400
if you want.

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:18.114
The second part
of your question--

00:42:18.114 --> 00:42:20.940
if I got it right--

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:24.840
were the challenges of
day-to-day existence, yeah?

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:28.560
How can we do this?

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:32.190
I think in the
beginning, it's not easy.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:36.900
But you learn to come
to terms with it,

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.540
because you know that you
can't discard it altogether.

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.750
So you've tried
to do things which

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:48.180
are more conducive to your
spiritual progress also

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:51.750
and drop things which
you think not required,

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:54.180
not drop everything.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:59.250
And then, as you
go along in life,

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:04.140
you will need to meet your
challenges individually,

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.850
and try to sort them out.

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:08.520
Now, in this process,
what would help,

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:15.330
probably, is to read the
biographical touches,

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:20.070
descriptions, auto-
or non-autobiographies

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.260
and see how these
people handled it.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.200
You don't have to
imitate anybody.

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.570
But you can get
information and see

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:29.610
how it's possible to tackle it.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:38.780
And if you need
some kind of advice,

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:42.920
you wonder how to get
it, search around.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:46.440
You'll find-- if you want my
email, you can write to me.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.270
There's no problem.

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:49.380
I can do my best.

00:43:52.579 --> 00:43:54.410
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:55.640
PRASAD SETTY: Next question?

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:56.140
Yes?

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:07.460
AUDIENCE: Sir, I have a question
about meditation and mantras.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:11.840
With Maheshwarnath Babaji,
you have gone through with us

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:14.120
and of the meanings
of [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.770
and the other stuff.

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:18.580
I was, like, every
Hindu, and also I

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:19.990
know Muslims and
Christians, they

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:23.270
pray to God by chanting
mantras every day,

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:26.250
like a 15 minutes prayer.

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:31.160
My question is how useful it is
in a person's spiritual journey

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.170
compared to meditation,
sitting there,

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:38.060
you know, sitting in meditation
for hours or an hour?

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.340
So how does this
help, like chanting

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:43.316
prayers versus meditation?

00:44:43.316 --> 00:44:46.110
SRI M: You know this, again,
is a very big question.

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:53.270
But let me tell you that
chanting of a mantra

00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:57.110
can [INAUDIBLE] you
to calming the mind.

00:44:57.110 --> 00:45:02.480
And meditation is calming the
mind, at least to start with.

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:07.080
Therefore, the mantras maybe
useful in whichever language

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.360
they are.

00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:11.666
You can even have
an English mantra.

00:45:11.666 --> 00:45:13.860
It doesn't matter.

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:18.710
However, some of these
ancient mantras have a sound.

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:20.420
Not only-- they
are not only words,

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.850
but there are some
sounds relating to them

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:27.080
that when you chant them, it
brings about a certain change

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:30.390
in consciousness.

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:32.920
So therefore, it's important.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.490
Let me give you an example.

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:38.990
From 1,000 years or
so, the Gayatri mantra

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:43.040
has been chanted in India.

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.930
When a child is small, they
are given the Gayatri mantra.

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:50.650
Unfortunately, I think
this was an aberration that

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:51.820
came in later.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.120
Only a certain section got it.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.710
But I think it
was an aberration.

00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:59.236
I think any one who
needs to lead a good life

00:45:59.236 --> 00:46:00.360
should be chanting in that.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.660
It's good.

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.820
Now the meaning of the
mantra is one thing.

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:08.290
It simply says, if you
lived at beginning,

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:12.730
and come to the last part,
which is to pit the meaning

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:18.880
of the mantra [NON-ENGLISH]
means may my understanding be

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.110
stimulated.

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.690
That's what you're asking for.

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:24.250
You're not asking
for anything else.

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:28.700
May my understanding
be stimulated.

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:29.350
See?

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:34.500
So the meaning is very
profound and deep.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.690
Plus, the sound of
the mantra itself

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:41.390
has a certain vibration,
which is effective

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:43.640
because it's started om.

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.340
Om is another sound.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:48.352
Now please don't classify om
as belonging to this religion

00:46:48.352 --> 00:46:49.060
or that religion.

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.975
It's a sound.

00:46:50.975 --> 00:46:54.530
It so happened that it
was written in Sanskrit

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:55.850
in ancient times.

00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:59.820
Because in India,
a lot of people

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:04.190
were seriously interested in
exploring the other realms

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:06.630
and the spirit.

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:08.450
So it developed well there.

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:10.700
That's the only reason
why it's in Sanskrit.

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.400
Om is a sound.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:17.960
So you can chant just om
and listen to it carefully.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.870
That itself brings
about a certain change.

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:24.470
And do not draw a dividing
line between meditation

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:27.980
and chanting, because
they're kind of-- they

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.910
overlap each other.

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:33.151
However, that doesn't mean that
you cannot meditate without

00:47:33.151 --> 00:47:33.650
chanting.

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:37.650
This is also possible.

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:43.390
Now to give you a typical
case, Ramana Maharshi

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:45.780
did not chant any mantra.

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:46.980
He only meditated.

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:54.190
So it depends on the person
and what kind of path

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:55.250
you are following.

00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:59.745
However, generally I would say
it's nice to listen to hymns,

00:47:59.745 --> 00:48:06.242
to sing songs, to
chant mantras, OK?

00:48:06.242 --> 00:48:10.530
AUDIENCE: And another part
of this, is it om or owm?

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:16.280
SRI M: Now here some people
exaggerate too much on this.

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.050
And if you ask them
to chant om, they'll

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:20.770
go on for half a minute, ahh.

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:24.310
It's om.

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:26.930
Because om is made
of ah ooh and muh.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:30.590
OK, agreed, but you don't
have to keep on chanting ah

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:31.870
as if somebody is hurting you.

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:34.685
You just say-- you
start with ah and then

00:48:34.685 --> 00:48:37.490
you immediately shirt on to
ooh and then come to muh.

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:40.700
So it's om.

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:47.180
And since you asked
this question,

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:51.600
the most important
part of the mantra,

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:55.050
which can bring about
internal change,

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:57.670
especially in your
energy centers

00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:02.630
is the last part of
om, which is muh--

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:04.100
not muh, but mm.

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:05.640
Mm is muh, right?

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:09.320
The letter is m,
muh, not the same.

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:13.520
So when you chant om, you see?

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:20.220
Om-- [HOLDING THE M, HUMMING IT]
that is a very effective

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:26.240
vibration to bring about change
in your energy systems inside

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:26.740
you.

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:34.530
In fact, it's the
most natural sound.

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:35.920
We all know that.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:39.840
You go to any hospital where
people are convalescing,

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:48.202
the most common sound you hear
is mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm?

00:49:48.202 --> 00:49:52.216
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:52.216 --> 00:49:55.630
SRI M: Even when you
say as s, there's a mm.

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:58.600
It doesn't have a
language, right?

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:02.620
So this sound is a
very important part

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:07.610
of our inner soothing of
the mind and the body.

00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:11.120
So why I'm saying this is,
some people refuse to chant.

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:13.290
Oh, this is from
the Hindu script.

00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:16.170
It's a sound.

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:18.720
This is like I had a big
argument recently-- not

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.830
argument.

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:21.280
I don't have arguments.

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.270
I heard a discussion
of a person who

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:29.240
decided that those who are
in India, who are Muslims,

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.200
should not do Surya Namaskara.

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.320
Now Surya Namaskara
is a yogi practice.

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.570
His theory was--
quite of an old man,

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:38.940
he comes and keeps talking.

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:42.450
His theory was that you are not
supposed to bow down to anyone

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:46.120
other than the supreme
god, what you call him,

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.760
whatever you want to call him.

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.370
So therefore when you go
down Surya Namaskara mean--

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:53.130
implies you are bowing
down to Surya, the sun.

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:54.119
So we can't do this.

00:50:54.119 --> 00:50:55.410
You're not supposed to do this.

00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:57.420
I said, listen.

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:00.210
Actually, after he had talked,
the TV people came to me

00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:02.790
and said, please have
dialogue with this guy.

00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:04.500
So I said OK.

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:10.380
So I said, OK, how many people
do Surya Namaskara in the open?

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:11.520
Most people do inside.

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:12.450
Where is the sun here?

00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:15.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.580
SRI M: They are exercises,
yogic exercises.

00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:20.530
You don't have to bow down
to the sun if you don't want.

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:22.117
It'll be nice to
bow down to the sun,

00:51:22.117 --> 00:51:24.200
because without sun the
whole Earth will collapse.

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.790
There would be no life.

00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:31.050
Sun is a visible
representation of the divine.

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:32.940
Because there would
be no photosynthesis,

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:36.690
you won't even get vegetables
to eat without the sun.

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:37.920
So that's OK.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.900
I said, if you don't want
to, do it in a closed room.

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:43.800
Then I told him, if
you go to a doctor,

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.000
and he says you have
a heart problem.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.670
And one of the
things you should do

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:50.514
is perform Surya Namaskara
half an hour every day,

00:51:50.514 --> 00:51:51.930
would you do it,
or would you die?

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:54.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.820
SRI M: So please, get
out of this mindset.

00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:59.040
It has nothing to do with it.

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.000
So that's why I am telling you.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.070
Please chant om.

00:52:02.070 --> 00:52:03.870
Don't think this
is not Christian

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:05.830
or Jewish or Hindu or Muslim.

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:06.900
It's a sound.

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.760
Understand what
I'm trying to say.

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.970
And when you say om, don't
keep choking ah like that.

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:17.760
Sounds like somebody's hurt.

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.710
Just accept it somewhere
and then go to ooh and muh.

00:52:23.724 --> 00:52:25.390
AUDIENCE: So I'm from
Trivandrum myself.

00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:28.510
And reading your book, it
made me very, very nostalgic

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:30.240
at the description
of the streets.

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.470
And I've been through
many of those myself,

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:34.780
so it is very nostalgic.

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:36.760
My question to
you is you briefly

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:42.150
mentioned that at some point
you were able to connect

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:43.150
with your consciousness.

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:46.300
And after that, things
dramatically changed.

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:49.060
And it was-- it could
never be the same again.

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:52.630
Could you explain what that is?

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:55.180
Or in a way we
can understand it?

00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:00.432
SRI M: First of all,
since you said you

00:53:00.432 --> 00:53:01.640
are from where in Trivandrum?

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.651
Where are you from?

00:53:03.651 --> 00:53:04.650
AUDIENCE: From Karamana.

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:05.316
SRI M: Karamana.

00:53:05.316 --> 00:53:06.800
What's your name?

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:07.716
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:07.716 --> 00:53:10.960
SRI M: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:13.208
Somebody who lives
close to Karamana here.

00:53:13.208 --> 00:53:15.120
Ah.

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:22.150
Anyway, when I said
in my book that I

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:25.390
had a certain spiritual
experience after which life

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:27.910
is not the same anymore,
that's something

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:30.220
like that, what I said.

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:35.620
It's a deep
experience I had when

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:39.160
I was with my master
in the Himalayas

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:44.620
when I suddenly discovered
that the consciousness is not

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:50.730
confined to just one little
point, but it's all-pervading.

00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:52.680
It works through
different centers.

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:56.615
But it's not really
belonging to you or to me,

00:53:56.615 --> 00:53:58.960
it's for everyone.

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.720
Not as a theory, but
as an experience.

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:04.630
If you think of
this as possible,

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:07.360
I would like to refer you
to a [INAUDIBLE] case, which

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:09.550
is not of a meditator,
but of someone

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:13.720
who had a brain hemorrhage.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.880
I'm just saying, how
can this be possible

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:18.530
that we feel that you are there
and here at the same time.

00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:21.130
It is not possible,
but it is possible.

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:23.656
And here, I'll
refer you to a book

00:54:23.656 --> 00:54:28.690
by Jill Bolte called
"My Stroke of Insight."

00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:29.670
She was a--

00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:31.630
I think she was a
doctor or a pathologist

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:33.340
or something of that kind.

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:34.920
And she had a stroke.

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:36.550
And with the stroke,
what happened

00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:39.520
was the left side of her
brain was totally paralyzed,

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:41.432
and only the right
side was working.

00:54:41.432 --> 00:54:43.390
You know, we have a left
brain and right brain.

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:49.960
See the left brain is the
one that calculates and says,

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:53.770
oh, when you say you are
[? m, ?] your consciousness

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:58.530
is confined to this
limit only, not here.

00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:03.700
It'd be mad if I said,
this is [? m, ?] normally.

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.835
In this lady's case,
the calculating brain,

00:55:06.835 --> 00:55:08.770
which decides your
space and time

00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:13.630
dimensions, which is the
left, was kind of completely

00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:14.340
paralyzed.

00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:17.920
She recovered enough to write
about it, of course, later.

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:22.510
And her right brain was
fully awake, still working.

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:26.440
That's when, according
to her, she figured out

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:30.100
that when she was in the room
and there were these birds

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:35.300
outside and the breeze blowing
and the leaves shaking,

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:39.670
it was not as if the leaves
were moving, she was moving.

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:43.240
It was not as if the birds
were singing, she was singing.

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:47.100
She was not singing,
but she was singing!

00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:49.430
You get what I'm trying to say?

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:53.260
So I'm not saying we
should all have a brain

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:55.630
hemorrhage to experience this.

00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:59.080
I'm saying that there are ways
and means in yoga by which this

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:03.160
can be brought about
without a hemorrhage.

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.940
So after that,
once you feel that,

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:07.810
then you cannot be the same.

00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:09.940
Your life changes.

00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:12.390
You can't be the same.

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:13.940
I think that's self-evident.

00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:21.243
PRASAD SETTY: Maybe
one more question.

00:56:21.243 --> 00:56:22.209
Yes?

00:56:22.209 --> 00:56:23.658
SRI M: Ah, only one.

00:56:23.658 --> 00:56:27.040
[CLAPS]

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.590
AUDIENCE: My name is Vic--

00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:29.430
Vivek.

00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:30.790
Thank you for coming.

00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:31.794
SRI M: What's your name?

00:56:31.794 --> 00:56:32.460
AUDIENCE: Vivek.

00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:33.450
Vivek Rao.

00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:34.680
SRI M: Vivek.

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.600
AUDIENCE: My sister was
on the walk with you.

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:37.562
Her name is Sunita.

00:56:37.562 --> 00:56:39.250
SRI M: Oh, Sunita!

00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:41.430
We have a big joke, you know.

00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:45.270
That when we entered Nashik,
from somewhere a monkey

00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:47.352
came down, and bit her.

00:56:47.352 --> 00:56:48.060
PRASAD SETTY: Oh.

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:49.844
SRI M: Yeah, so
nothing happened.

00:56:49.844 --> 00:56:51.010
We gave her some injections.

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:52.315
She was fine.

00:56:52.315 --> 00:56:53.190
But I have this joke.

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:54.910
Every time I see her,
it's to watch out.

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:03.400
AUDIENCE: So I have a question
about advaita and non-duality,

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.370
which I've been thinking
about for a long time.

00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:08.820
So if we are really
not separate,

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:11.340
if there is only
one thing, then how

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:14.610
do we reconcile that with
karma and reincarnation?

00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:16.590
What is the entity
that is reborn?

00:57:16.590 --> 00:57:18.900
What is the entity to
which karma attaches

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:20.970
if there is no separation?

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:24.870
SRI M: As long as there is an
ignorance of this understanding

00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:30.870
and experience, then all
these things are really real.

00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:32.490
Where does an entity separate?

00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:34.050
Where is the reincarnation?

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:35.760
Everything is going on.

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.910
The moment it is actually
understood and experienced

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:42.090
that there is only one, then
there is no reincarnation,

00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:44.880
there is no nothing!

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:49.290
It's the mind that
decide on this.

00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:53.040
You-- right now we are
living in this dream.

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:57.690
And if anybody says this is
a dream, we won't believe it.

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:01.830
Because in the
dream, all my dream,

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:06.810
when we are chased by a tiger,
do we say this is a dream

00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:10.380
or do we run for our lives?

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:12.360
I'm just giving you an example.

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.790
Examples are not perfect.

00:58:14.790 --> 00:58:16.920
And when I come
out of the dream,

00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:20.130
I say, ah, this
was a great dream.

00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:22.440
I may still be sweating
and palpitating,

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:25.330
but I say, oh, this was a dream.

00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:28.380
So according to the
theory of advaita,

00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:31.350
when the truth is understood,
then all these things

00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:33.400
do not exist.

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:37.020
I mean they exist, but
they are not part of it.

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:38.730
As long as that
is not understood

00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:41.910
you're still in the
circuit, coming,

00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:46.260
going, separate feeling.

00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:47.030
I'm different.

00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:48.266
You're different.

00:58:52.896 --> 00:58:55.100
Look, Shankara is the right--

00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:59.440
is the well-known
interpreter of [INAUDIBLE],,

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:02.030
advaita philosophy.

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:06.140
And even after that,
I think he fully

00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:09.980
believed that the mind can be
reborn, come, go, everything,

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:12.660
even after having
that experience.

00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:18.170
So which means that at
one stage, it is real.

00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:20.900
In another state, it is not.

00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:24.210
From the ultimate point,
there is no such thing.

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:29.000
OK one more.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.400
AUDIENCE: Then why do
we have this separation?

00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.156
Why are we not born--

00:59:33.156 --> 00:59:35.280
SRI M: I thought he was
going to ask that question.

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I thought he
was going to ask that question.

00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:41.210
Why are we not born with like--

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:43.530
SRI M: We don't know.

00:59:43.530 --> 00:59:45.170
But it is so.

00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:47.420
There are many things
which we don't know.

00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:50.810
But it happens to be so.

00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:53.814
And now, since it happens to
be so, how do we get out of it?

00:59:53.814 --> 00:59:54.980
That should be the question.

00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:00.170
Why in the first place
it became like that?

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:02.630
We have no explanation
for many things

01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:04.430
in the universe that way.

01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:08.070
Perhaps we may
discover at some point.

01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:11.970
If I may say so, all
people who have discovered

01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:15.560
the way, if anybody
has, have not

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.450
been able to explain
it to somebody

01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:18.910
who has not touched it.

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:24.310
We understand what
I am trying to say?

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:26.380
You cannot explain it.

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.440
It's not possible.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:30.080
It doesn't mean that
you have not found it.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.190
There are many things which
language and our thought

01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:37.320
process cannot define and catch.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.780
Those things it is better
leave it like that.

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:44.280
But the actual fact is
that we are suffering.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.800
We need to get
out of it somehow.

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.870
Perhaps when we get
out, we find the source

01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:50.130
and why it does happen.

01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:53.520
I'll give you a small
story before we wind up.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.500
This was Buddha's
very popular story.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:59.290
And somebody asked him about the
same thing in a different way.

01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:00.720
Where did the first karma start?

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.460
Why are we going on and on?

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:03.960
He said, listen.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:08.280
You have gone into a
garden to eat fruits.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.465
Somebody shoots an arrow at you.

01:01:10.465 --> 01:01:14.430
The arrow is stuck in
your chest, there is pain,

01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:16.530
and you might die soon
if you don't pull it

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:18.290
out and do something about it.

01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:21.060
So the Buddha's question
was, lying down there in pain

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:24.600
with the arrow in your chest,
what would you do first?

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:29.130
Would you try to pull it out
and free yourself, and then

01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:31.170
figure out where it came from?

01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:34.320
Or would you lie down there
and say, who sends this arrow,

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.270
where has it come from?

01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:37.590
How do I find the source?

01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:38.760
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:39.480
SRI M: You see?

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:44.220
So in this urgency of
pain, you need to get out.

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:47.250
Perhaps when you
get out, you might

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:50.070
be able to go out and see
who has sent this arrow.

01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:52.710
And it may be so
that you may not

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:54.630
be able to explain it
to the other guy who's

01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:57.880
still laying down with
the arrow in his heart.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.310
But I'm just trying to give
a theoretical question--

01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:03.930
an answer to a
theoretical question.

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:06.740
But it comes from
my understanding.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.787
What's your name?

01:02:08.787 --> 01:02:09.370
AUDIENCE: Raj.

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:11.290
SRI M: Raj.

01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:12.580
Thank you very much.

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:13.510
I think now--

01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:15.956
AUDIENCE: Can I-- can I
have one last question?

01:02:15.956 --> 01:02:16.456
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:16.456 --> 01:02:19.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:19.410 --> 01:02:24.430
SRI M: First, are we aware
that the arrow is there?

01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:30.730
Yes, first step is that,
that I feel there pain.

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:32.620
There is an arrow's [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:35.170
Understand this fully first.

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:37.160
If you understand
this fully, then you

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.700
will find ways to take it out.

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:42.070
Many people have the arrow,
but they eat lollipops

01:02:42.070 --> 01:02:44.920
and think that it's OK.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:47.770
The seriousness of
trying to get out of it

01:02:47.770 --> 01:02:51.850
comes when you really
understand that it is so first.

01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:54.730
Self-realization
does not mean to say

01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:56.410
that I am the Supreme Brahman.

01:02:56.410 --> 01:02:57.370
I'm not this body.

01:02:57.370 --> 01:02:58.570
That's not [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:58.570 --> 01:03:00.610
Self-realization
means to find out

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:04.610
where I stand at the moment.

01:03:04.610 --> 01:03:07.580
What is life to me?

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:11.750
Who am I in this context,
not that context?

01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:14.090
When these things
are clear, you'll

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:19.870
suddenly see a small little
part going to separate it.

01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:22.040
But it must be urgent.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.620
I really have to get out.

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:27.830
Till that thing comes,
whatever if I tell you

01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:31.170
the path is not going to work?

01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:33.110
Hm?

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:36.310
I hope you understood
what I am trying.

01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:37.377
Thank you very much.

01:03:37.377 --> 01:03:38.210
Thank you very much.

01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:40.043
PRASAD SETTY: Thanks
to Sri M, [INAUDIBLE]..

01:03:40.043 --> 01:03:41.640
[APPLAUSE]
