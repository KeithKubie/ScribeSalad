Pilot: How's it going?
Denis: Good

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.960
Pilot: Just fill in from the back foward if you would please.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.220
Denis: No problem

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.580
Hello

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.880
oof

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:53.260
So here this is DSL (Dark Sector Lab)
current home of BICEP3

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.780
and this is the SPT 10-meter South Pole telescope
actually observing.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.380
So today is actually really beautiful day

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.040
we're walking back towards the station
here's the tour of the horizon over

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.940
there

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.870
the ceremonial South Pole little bit
further of their the actual South Pole

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:26.250
the station, kirat a very famous
South Pole marker, a satellite dish over

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.420
there

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:38.759
the skiway over here going towards the
Dark Sector, the ice cube laboratory, SPT

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.340
South Pole telescope 10-meter telescope
BICEP, DSL there, maypo

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.120
and nothingness.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.460
Pretty cool

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.149
Go take a look at the window on the lee
side of the station you'll see how windy

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.430
it is

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.179
pretty low visibility there's snow being
blown in the air has turned into a

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.440
little bit worse than it was yesterday
and the day before and it turns out

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.280
South Pole has a running scroll of a
bunch of useful information including

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.870
the weather the South pole so you can
just log onto the local intranet which

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.120
you can actually access and take a look
at page like this although it's pretty

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.040
cold minus 30 it is quite windy 23 knots

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.940
that's a little over 40 kilometers an
hour that's quite windy for the South

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.290
Pole so it's a little bit like blizzard
conditions in addition to the weather

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.570
you have a list of the flights

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.720
these are the flights that actually
should have arrived today, but because of

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.700
weather they were cancelled as well as
the satellite passes this is the time

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.080
and the three satellites that we
communicate with right now we should be

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.739
able to use goes but because it's an
orange it actually just means that it's,

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.360
useless,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.360
we actually can't get to the internet
from the outside world.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.360
[Inaudible sounds]

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.460
If you're like me and fascinated by Antarctica and all things scientific you

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.670
might want to learn even more at the
great courses plus who supported this

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.590
video they have a whole course filled
with films about pole exploration from

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.360
the science of Antarctica, photography at
the poles, and even life among penguins.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.379
You could watch about ten and a half
hours of amazing videos about Antarctica

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.069
right now or thousands of hours on
pretty much anything else you can think

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.250
of all presented by real experts in the
field.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:06.170
"No more warm tropical climates with
jungles and swamps the last 35 million years have been all about ice"

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.569
No matter what you're into the great
courses plus is gonna have you covered
