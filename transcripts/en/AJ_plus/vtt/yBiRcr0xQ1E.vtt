00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.620
When I was growing up, I loved wrestling,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:03.790
I loved everything about it.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.080
One character that reached
out through the screen

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.600
and spoke to me was
Brett "The Hitman" Hart.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.630
He was that classic
good guy and despite his

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.030
foes using underhanded tactics,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.783
he never compromised who he was.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.260
I was born in Chicago
with two older brothers.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.720
I would make these
makeshift wrestling costumes

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.740
and we'd pretend we're at Wrestlemania.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.220
But, when I tuned in, anyone
of Middle Eastern heritage

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.450
was always portrayed as the bad guy,

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.489
the evil foreigner,

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.322
[Clip]: (yelling in foreign language)

00:00:36.322 --> 00:00:37.750
the terrorist.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.550
And I knew I didn't want to do that.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.010
The initial stages of my career,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.370
I was actually hiding behind
a mask to hide who I was.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.980
But, I was getting frustrated

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.600
and I wasn't getting better bookings,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.610
I wasn't competing at bigger events.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.127
Several of my friends in
the industry kept saying,

00:00:53.127 --> 00:00:54.360
"You know, now is the time,"

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.210
"you should try out
doing an evil character."

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.057
And so was born Prince Mustafa Ali.

00:01:00.057 --> 00:01:03.022
[Clip]: "Prince Mustafa Ali!"

00:01:03.022 --> 00:01:04.880
You just add the whole head garb thing,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.743
yelling in a foreign language,

00:01:06.743 --> 00:01:08.030
[Clip]: (yelling in foreign language)

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.280
My bookings went up.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.660
I was getting flown all
over the U.S. to compete.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.900
But something inside of me,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.691
there was always an uneasy feeling.

00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:17.060
[Clip]: "What?"
[Clip]: "USA! USA!"

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.320
I remember seeing a young boy,
maybe six, seven years old,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.650
and as I approached the guard rail,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.130
he jumped out of his chair
and he put his hands up.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.570
And I remember looking
into this kid's eyes,

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.390
and I remember seeing hate,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.127
and right then and there
it hit me, I was like,

00:01:30.127 --> 00:01:32.520
"Did I just teach this kid"

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.227
"to hate people that look like me?"

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.140
And from that point forward,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.914
I created a new character: Mustafa Ali.

00:01:39.914 --> 00:01:42.640
[Clip]: "Mustafa Ali!"

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.610
Mustafa Ali is who I wanted
to see when I was growing up.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.210
I'm not wearing anything on my head,

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.980
I'm not saying anything in Arabic,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.657
I'm just gonna come out as Mustafa Ali.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.340
A lot of promoters were not
happy with the new direction.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.690
It took me almost a year,

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.920
really working hard for my
actual in-ring performance,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.493
night in and night out.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.510
I have to prove myself all over again.

00:02:07.555 --> 00:02:09.296
I remember performing in Paris.

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:11.287
[Clip]: (booing and negative yelling)

00:02:11.287 --> 00:02:14.010
And I'd never heard that many
"boos" for me in my life,

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.144
and then I performed.

00:02:15.144 --> 00:02:17.530
[Clip]: (crowd cheering)

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.153
Despite loosing the match,
they still chanted my name.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.097
And I remember just taking
a moment to realize,

00:02:24.097 --> 00:02:26.670
"This is what you're doing,
you're changing peoples' minds."

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.620
That's what the character's all about,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.235
being the light in the dark.

00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:32.370
[Clip]: "Mustafa Ali!"

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.340
I turned this public opinion
about me all the way around

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.872
and become one of the top
good guys in the industry.

00:02:37.872 --> 00:02:41.077
[Clip]: "Mustafa Ali is
headed to Wrestlemania!"

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:44.263
And I got to compete at Wrestlemania 34.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.670
For 20 minutes, the entire world,

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.390
millions of people, were watching me.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.831
It's a dream come true.

00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:53.472
[Clip]: "Oh no! Oh!"

00:02:53.472 --> 00:02:55.066
[Clip]: "John Cena, standing up."

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:55.899
[John Cena]: "Well done!"

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.870
I represent the kids
that sit in the third row

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.680
that look like me, and they
got a funny name like mine,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.150
and they get go, "Hey, Mustafa
Ali, he wrestles for WWE!"

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.140
There are no limitations,
there are no barriers.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.461
Nothing can stop you and
nothing can define you but you.

00:03:11.461 --> 00:03:16.461
[Clip]: "Here is your
winner, Mustafa Ali!"
