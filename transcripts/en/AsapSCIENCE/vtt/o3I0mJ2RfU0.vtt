00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.429
with over 7,000 chemicals released each

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.319
time you light a cigarette it's no

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:05.970
surprise that smoking is one of the

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.799
leading causes of preventable deaths

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.920
worldwide but with 1.3 billion people

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.170
actively smoking what actually happens

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.570
when you stop smoking within the first

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.190
20 minutes of quitting your blood

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.109
pressure and heart rate return to normal

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.760
this is because the nicotine in

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.470
cigarettes released epinephrine and

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.210
norepinephrine which increased your

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.859
heart rate and narrowed blood vessels

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.810
these effects also caused smokers

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.090
extremities to feel colder but by now

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.529
your hands and feet have returned to

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.780
their normal temperature 2 hours in and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.850
the nicotine cravings begin causing

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.129
moodiness drowsiness tense feelings and

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.050
even difficulty sleeping because

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.940
nicotine also releases more dopamine

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.710
than normal these are expected

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.600
physiological responses to the decrease

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.219
in its release eight hours after

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.379
quitting and the inhaled carbon monoxide

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.210
clears allowing oxygen levels in the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.370
bloodstream to return to normal carbon

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.440
monoxide and oxygen compete to bind to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.270
hemoglobin in your blood which stretches

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.489
the circulatory system so as it clears

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.920
there's more room for oxygen however for

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.989
long-term smokers this carbon monoxide

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.820
exposure causes red blood cells to

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.560
increase in size making the blood

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.180
thicker and causing higher blood

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.799
pressure and increased chances of

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.290
developing blood clot surprisingly 24

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.880
hours after quitting coughing will

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.979
actually increase which is your body's

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.750
way of clearing out all the toxins from

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.970
the lungs additionally at this point the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.740
risk of developing various coronary

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.799
artery diseases decreases all within 24

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.770
hours after 48 hours when nicotine and

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.090
its metabolites are completely

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.130
eliminated from your body damaged nerve

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.650
endings begin to regrow the tar and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.030
other chemicals and cigarettes leave

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.950
fewer taste buds that are flatter with

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.170
less blood vessels they now begin to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.180
regain their sensitivity making food

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.909
tastes better although chronic smokers

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.009
may often have irreversibly damaged

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.100
taste blood at the 72-hour mark nicotine

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.020
withdrawal peaks with headaches nausea

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.360
and cramps as well as emotional symptoms

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.700
like anxiety and depression these

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.619
symptoms can be seen by most addictive

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.650
substances

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.690
cluding caffeine but after this period

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.480
the worst is officially over after one

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.160
month the risk of developing type 2

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.530
diabetes cancer and cardiovascular

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.290
diseases has already decreased in three

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.090
to nine months the damage Celia and the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.160
lungs are almost fully repaired which

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.930
are hairlike structures that help sweep

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.030
away dust and debris and as a result

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.860
symptoms such as coughing and shortness

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.360
of breath are almost completely

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.940
eliminated and around one year the risk

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.710
of developing heart disease as a direct

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.660
result of at the Roma formation which

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.880
are deposits of fatty material or scar

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.950
tissue from deteriorating arterial walls

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.280
decreases by almost one-half in 10 years

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.110
the chance of developing lung cancer

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.180
decreases to half of someone who did not

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.880
quit smoking and in 15 years time the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.740
risk of heart attack decreases to the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.840
same as someone who has never smoked

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.910
their entire life of course this

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.830
guideline is not definitive and the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.870
average amount you smoke per day or year

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.580
will play a role in how well your body

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.100
recovers unfortunately there will always

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.200
be some irreversible damage to the lungs

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.090
and increased susceptibility to

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.890
developing various lung diseases and

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.870
while quitting may be difficult the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.850
benefits greatly outweigh the initial

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.920
withdrawal ultimately the best way to

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.720
prevent this from happening is to not

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.880
begin smoking at all need some extra
