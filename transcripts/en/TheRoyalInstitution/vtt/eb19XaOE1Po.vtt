00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:05.569
Look into a mirror and wave your hand, and
your reflection will wave back at you.

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.759
In everyday life it's easy to take the effect
of symmetry for granted.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.260
But symmetry is vital to understanding and
predicting how our universe works.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.539
This relationship between symmetry and the
mechanics of the universe

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.220
were something Emmy Noether proved in 1915
with her remarkable theorem,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.780
linking maths and physics in one harmonious
statement:

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.280
"Wherever there is a symmetry of nature, there's
a corresponding conservation law."

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.739
So what exactly do we mean by symmetry in
physics?

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.149
Well it can be described as a transformation
that leaves a system fundamentally unchanged

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.469
after the transformation has been performed.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:54.149
It's a change that makes no change.
Take for example spatial translation.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.379
If we have a system and move it to a different
point in space,

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.610
that system would continue to work in the
same way,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.300
provided all of the relevant conditions of
that system were moved along with it.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.220
In other words, the laws of physics are not
affected by translation in space.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.270
And similarly with time translation, the system
can be shifted at any point in time

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.500
and its physics would remain unchanged too.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.380
Even the most fundamental laws of physics
are themselves symmetrical.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.580
They remain the same wherever or whenever
you are in the universe.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.150
The symmetry of time translation confirms
to us

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.640
that energy cannot be created or destroyed

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.040
as the total amount of energy in the universe
always remains the same,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.190
no matter what point in time you are at.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.550
Likewise, the symmetry of spatial translation
leads directly

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.870
to the conservation of momentum.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.250
And this is the beauty of symmetry.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.410
It gives definition to the world by revealing
nature's parameters.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.160
If nature wasn't governed by symmetry, we'd
be living in a world of chaos

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.460
where nothing is predictable or repeatable.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.340
But if the universe follows the principles
of symmetry,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.040
why is there so much asymmetry in nature?

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.680
The state of a system might exhibit a hidden
symmetry because of some external factors

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.300
that affect it, but its underlying laws of
physics are still symmetrical.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.879
So while the sun's gravitational field has
a spherical symmetry, a planet like Mercury

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:30.299
can follow an elliptical orbit that changes
shape due to gravitational perturbations from

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.780
neighbouring planets.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.220
It also turns out that not all symmetries
are equal.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.189
As physicists peered further into the infinitesimal
world of particle interaction,

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.800
they started discovering some puzzling violations
of symmetry

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.069
that would add to an increasingly rich and
complex set of rules

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.120
through which we view the universe.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.260
We now understand these violations to be an
entirely different group of symmetries -

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.480
local symmetries, that affect certain interactions.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.300
Unlike the symmetries that hold true at any
point in spacetime.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.100
These local symmetries are the cornerstone
of the leading theory in modern physics

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.650
- the standard model,
which looks at the fundamental forces governing

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.560
the universe.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.280
As we delve deeper and deeper into particle
physics,

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.189
we discover more and more symmetries.

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:31.999
Each one revealing new clues about the forces
behind nature's most fundamental interactions.

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:38.629
Eventually we may be able to find a theory
that unifies all of the fundamental forces.

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:44.439
Whether one exists or not, the search for
new symmetries continues to have a profound

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.890
role in explaining the structure of our universe.
