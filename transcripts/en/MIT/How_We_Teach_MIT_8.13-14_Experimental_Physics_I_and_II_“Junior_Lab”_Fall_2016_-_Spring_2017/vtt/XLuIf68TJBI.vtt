GUNTHER ROLAND: OK.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.365
What is really unique in Junior
Lab compared to any other class

00:00:08.365 --> 00:00:10.150
that you could
think about teaching

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.280
is the breadth, both in terms
of the material, the techniques,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.910
and the concepts that
you try to get across,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.640
from the specific physics
of the experiments

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.850
to sort of general tools
of experimentalists,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.090
both in terms of apparatus,
in terms of computing,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.130
in terms of the
mathematical tools,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.480
understanding systematic
uncertainties.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.560
Then the communication
elements, from how

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.900
to write a paper, how to give a
talk, how to prepare a poster,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.490
to sort of the very
general life skills,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.310
like time management,
which really is critical

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.190
as you do this sequence
of experiments,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.870
the collaboration
with their partners,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.420
which is something that many
of them haven't experienced.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.590
So Junior Lab really covers
many different aspects.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.110
And one has to really think
about which are the ones

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.070
that one wants to emphasize
as a lecturer in the lab.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.170
And I think it also is important
to really keep things fresh

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.910
and try to innovate
something every year--

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.610
a new experiment, new
elements-- just to really keep

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.530
the experience up to date.
