00:00:01.934 --> 00:00:03.236
Ladies and gentlemen,
my guy, Mr. Ray Grady.

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:04.537
Here we are.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.306
Otherwise known as Grady.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:08.341
Yeah, yeah, Grady.

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:09.375
KEVIN HART: Grady right now.

00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:10.777
How long, man?

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.711
How long you at-- how long
you been at comedy now?

00:00:11.744 --> 00:00:12.278
15 years.

00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:13.780
15 years, man.

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:14.714
Where you from, Grady?
Tell the people where you from.

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:16.049
Chicago, born and raised.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:17.517
KEVIN HART: Cha town.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.551
You feel like right now you
putting on for you city?

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:20.119
Yeah, why not?

00:00:20.152 --> 00:00:22.789
Because it's a lot of negativity
around with the term Chiraq.

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:25.992
Most people from Chicago,
we don't claim that.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.393
That's the media.

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:30.496
So we like, nah, we just regular
blue collar people like Philly,

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.732
Baltimore, Detroit, Oakland.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:36.536
Definitely just named four
of the most murdering cities

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.004
in the-- in the United States.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:38.704
That was a segue!

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:39.972
That was right there.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:41.474
See, comics, you can
alley-oops one another.

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:42.608
That was a dime.

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:44.210
That was like,
yeah, we don't go

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:48.714
by that name, four of the most
murdering cities in the US.

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:50.950
Was it love at first sight
when you first got on stage?

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:51.784
[bleep] No.

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:52.585
No, no.

00:00:57.656 --> 00:00:58.958
That's a genuine
laugh right there.

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:01.160
That's all I wanted
to see, I was waiting.

00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:02.028
Why-- why not?

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:02.762
Tell me why not.

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:04.697
Well I mean, because you--

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.000
you can be funny around
your friends, your family,

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:09.202
but they all liars.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.736
KEVIN HART: OK.

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:12.271
They gonna tell you
what you wanna hear.

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:13.639
I don't know none
of these people

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:16.309
here except for the six
dudes in here, right?

00:01:16.342 --> 00:01:17.610
They laughing.

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:19.011
That's when know you
can-- know what I mean?

00:01:19.044 --> 00:01:22.281
So it took me a while, you
know, I kept going back,

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:23.649
kept bombing, kept bombing.

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:25.084
Bombing, wow.

00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:26.752
Staying persistent to it,
never doubted yourself.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:28.988
Well, I can fight, so that
cut a lot of [bleep] out.

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:31.457
Boo me, I'm
gonna wait for you.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.859
That's great.

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:35.094
No, no, but it was just,
I wasn't afraid to lose.

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:36.062
You know what I mean?

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.196
So if you going
to be successful--

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.798
That's big!

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:40.800
That's a big-- that's actually
a very powerful statement, man.

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:42.535
Because I think in
stand up comedy,

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:43.903
you have to have that mindset.

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:45.671
A lot of people step on
the stage and, you know,

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:49.075
are afraid to fail, or afraid
to not hear those laughs.

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:50.943
RAY GRADY: Yeah, because
they not-- it's not personal.

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:52.345
They don't know me.
- Yeah.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.346
But I got the power.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:54.547
KEVIN HART: OK

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.681
Because my voice
is a man's voice.

00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:56.883
When I speak--

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.251
I think there's
another shot at me.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.386
I think that's another--

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:01.587
that's another shot.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.022
No, Kev, I'm just--
know what I mean?

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:05.958
I will definitely say
Grady does have probably one

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:08.661
of the best voices in comedy.

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:09.929
Alpha male, baby.

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:11.397
Gotta be a alpha male
if you hang with me.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.532
You know when you
keep saying that, I feel

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:15.168
like you saying that I'm not--

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:19.705
that I'm not where I'm
supposed to be as a male.

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:21.073
Hey, y'all make some
noise for my guy,

00:02:21.106 --> 00:02:23.176
Grady, it's time to walk
into the next level, baby.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.143
Gotta go to work.

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:25.178
Gotta go to work.
