00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.729
thankfully today with the help of like a
DB extension and chrome dev tools we

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739
DB extension and chrome dev tools we
 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.080
DB extension and chrome dev tools we
actually have the ability to load a

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090
actually have the ability to load a
 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.509
actually have the ability to load a
website on a mobile device and actually

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519
website on a mobile device and actually
 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.729
website on a mobile device and actually
get the information back into chrome dev

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739
get the information back into chrome dev
 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.440
get the information back into chrome dev
tools so you can get the same power of

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450
tools so you can get the same power of
 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.490
tools so you can get the same power of
your debugging on your desktop and

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500
your debugging on your desktop and
 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.319
your debugging on your desktop and
actually see the performance

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329
actually see the performance
 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.210
actually see the performance
characteristics now this is good and bad

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220
characteristics now this is good and bad
 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.160
characteristics now this is good and bad
it's good because you have this power

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170
it's good because you have this power
 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.900
it's good because you have this power
it's bad that everyone's starting to

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910
it's bad that everyone's starting to
 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.300
it's bad that everyone's starting to
know about this so if your website is

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310
know about this so if your website is
 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.830
know about this so if your website is
slow there's kind of no more excuses

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840
slow there's kind of no more excuses
 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.680
slow there's kind of no more excuses
sorry actually if someone come to my

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690
sorry actually if someone come to my
 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.729
sorry actually if someone come to my
desk one day they're like wait a minute

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739
desk one day they're like wait a minute
 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.830
desk one day they're like wait a minute
wait a minute like we have this power so

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840
wait a minute like we have this power so
 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.319
wait a minute like we have this power so
why are websites still slow yeah it's

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329
why are websites still slow yeah it's
 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.050
why are websites still slow yeah it's

with Network load time right again this
is where we've been unfortunately the

is where we've been unfortunately the
 

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.370
is where we've been unfortunately the
load times are really bad bad term right

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:09.380
load times are really bad bad term right
 

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.330
load times are really bad bad term right

it doesn't even talk about rendering or

00:08:28.999 --> 00:08:29.009
it doesn't even talk about rendering or
 

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:30.469
it doesn't even talk about rendering or
anything else so we actually have to

00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479
anything else so we actually have to
 

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:31.909
anything else so we actually have to
change your vocabulary a little bit here

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919
change your vocabulary a little bit here
 

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:32.990
change your vocabulary a little bit here
and we can actually probably use a

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.000
and we can actually probably use a
 

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.600
and we can actually probably use a
better term which is critical path right

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:35.610
better term which is critical path right
 

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.069
better term which is critical path right
so it's not just about loading it's

00:08:37.069 --> 00:08:37.079
so it's not just about loading it's
 

00:08:37.079 --> 00:08:39.350
so it's not just about loading it's
about what pixels are needed to get to

about what pixels are needed to get to
the screen so basically you have a

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:01.760
this stuff so that I can start painting
 

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.890
this stuff so that I can start painting
unfortunately the web isn't that way

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:03.900
unfortunately the web isn't that way
 

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.570
unfortunately the web isn't that way
anymore all the content isn't just

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:05.580
anymore all the content isn't just
 

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.440
anymore all the content isn't just
contained in your HTML it's actually a

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:08.450
contained in your HTML it's actually a
 

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.600
contained in your HTML it's actually a
complex dance of other resources and so

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:11.610
complex dance of other resources and so
 

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.910
complex dance of other resources and so
we can't actually build our HTML to

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920
we can't actually build our HTML to
 

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.470
we can't actually build our HTML to
start rendering yet instead we have to

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480
start rendering yet instead we have to
 

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.900
start rendering yet instead we have to
wait for all of these other dependencies

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:17.910
wait for all of these other dependencies
 

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.970
wait for all of these other dependencies
to get resolved this is the critical

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:19.980
to get resolved this is the critical
 

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.740
to get resolved this is the critical
path if you haven't heard this term

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:21.750
path if you haven't heard this term
 

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.260
path if you haven't heard this term
before this is the critical path it's

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:24.270
before this is the critical path it's
 

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.810
before this is the critical path it's
the resolution of the dependencies of

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:26.820
the resolution of the dependencies of
 

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.480
the resolution of the dependencies of
your assets to get the first pixel on

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:29.490
your assets to get the first pixel on
 

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.670
your assets to get the first pixel on
your screen right because if you have

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680
your screen right because if you have
 

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.020
your screen right because if you have
JavaScript that you're loading that's

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:33.030
JavaScript that you're loading that's
 

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.730
JavaScript that you're loading that's
going to affect how the Dom exists or

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.740
going to affect how the Dom exists or
 

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.650
going to affect how the Dom exists or
the CSS classes that's got to be present

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:36.660
the CSS classes that's got to be present
 

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.780
the CSS classes that's got to be present
if you've got 50 CSS classes that's got

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:38.790
if you've got 50 CSS classes that's got
 

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.400
if you've got 50 CSS classes that's got
to be present right so this is what you

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:40.410
to be present right so this is what you
 

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.870
to be present right so this is what you
need to optimize is the number of

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880
need to optimize is the number of
 

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.400
need to optimize is the number of
dependencies in your critical path and

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:43.410
dependencies in your critical path and
 

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.580
dependencies in your critical path and
this really comes from 2 to 3 places the

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:46.590
this really comes from 2 to 3 places the
 

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:47.780
this really comes from 2 to 3 places the
first one is that once we put out a

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:47.790
first one is that once we put out a
 

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.250
first one is that once we put out a
request like this you've got a lot of

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:49.260
request like this you've got a lot of
 

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.020
request like this you've got a lot of
dependencies to other resources the

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:51.030
dependencies to other resources the
 

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.030
dependencies to other resources the
number of requests that you send out

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040
number of requests that you send out
 

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.100
number of requests that you send out
there actually has an implicit overhead

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.110
there actually has an implicit overhead
 

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.810
there actually has an implicit overhead
for each one of them which even gets

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.820
for each one of them which even gets
 

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.030
for each one of them which even gets
worst on mobile devices right when

00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040
worst on mobile devices right when
 

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.100
worst on mobile devices right when
you've got a 3G network radio that's

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:01.110
you've got a 3G network radio that's
 

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.320
you've got a 3G network radio that's
spinning up and going through cell

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:03.330
spinning up and going through cell
 

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.120
spinning up and going through cell
towers and all sort of other arcane

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.130
towers and all sort of other arcane
 

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.430
towers and all sort of other arcane
magical technologies that existed back

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440
magical technologies that existed back
 

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.440
magical technologies that existed back
in the caveman days you know that we

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:09.450
in the caveman days you know that we
 

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.870
in the caveman days you know that we
still have in our pocket oddly enough

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880
still have in our pocket oddly enough
 

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.040
still have in our pocket oddly enough
you know that has overhead associated

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.050
you know that has overhead associated
 

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.600
you know that has overhead associated
with it so the more requests you're

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:14.610
with it so the more requests you're
 

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:16.820
with it so the more requests you're
doing the additional fat you're adding

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:16.830
doing the additional fat you're adding
 

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.470
doing the additional fat you're adding
to your time for each one of those

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480
to your time for each one of those
 

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.020
to your time for each one of those
requests so if you're looking at this

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:21.030
requests so if you're looking at this
 

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.730
requests so if you're looking at this
you need to say okay one of our first

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:22.740
you need to say okay one of our first
 

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.990
you need to say okay one of our first
things we need to do is reduce the

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000
things we need to do is reduce the
 

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.430
things we need to do is reduce the
number of requests we're doing to get

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440
number of requests we're doing to get
 

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.020
number of requests we're doing to get
assets which kind of comes back to the

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:27.030
assets which kind of comes back to the
 

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.400
assets which kind of comes back to the
fact that you have to reduce the

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:28.410
fact that you have to reduce the
 

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:30.320
fact that you have to reduce the
complexity of asset dependency on your

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:30.330
complexity of asset dependency on your
 

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.180
complexity of asset dependency on your
page I see some people sleeping do I

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:32.190
page I see some people sleeping do I
 

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.430
page I see some people sleeping do I
need to clap kidding

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440
need to clap kidding
 

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.020
need to clap kidding
I like that who did that you get a

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:36.030
I like that who did that you get a
 

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.750
I like that who did that you get a
t-shirt afterwards I will everyone else

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760
t-shirt afterwards I will everyone else
 

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.960
t-shirt afterwards I will everyone else
is like I'm clapping now free stuff

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:40.970
is like I'm clapping now free stuff
 

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.130
is like I'm clapping now free stuff
let's go to the second one here right so

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.140
let's go to the second one here right so
 

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.390
let's go to the second one here right so
once you've actually got those requests

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:44.400
once you've actually got those requests
 

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.610
once you've actually got those requests
out on the wire the next problem is sort

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:46.620
out on the wire the next problem is sort
 

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.500
out on the wire the next problem is sort
of page weight how fat are your assets

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:48.510
of page weight how fat are your assets
 

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.180
of page weight how fat are your assets
and so I've kind of done a lot of study

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:50.190
and so I've kind of done a lot of study
 

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.380
and so I've kind of done a lot of study
in this over the past couple of months

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:51.390
in this over the past couple of months
 

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.210
in this over the past couple of months
about compression on the web anyone read

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.220
about compression on the web anyone read
 

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.060
about compression on the web anyone read
my series compression on the web more

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:56.070
my series compression on the web more
 

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.640
my series compression on the web more
yes I saw one dude like throw up the

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:58.650
yes I saw one dude like throw up the
 

00:10:58.650 --> 00:10:59.720
yes I saw one dude like throw up the
tens in the background

00:10:59.720 --> 00:10:59.730

you dude to t-shirts so the problem here

00:11:03.439 --> 00:11:03.449
you dude to t-shirts so the problem here
 

00:11:03.449 --> 00:11:05.569
you dude to t-shirts so the problem here
the problem here is that a lot of us are

00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:05.579
the problem here is that a lot of us are
 

00:11:05.579 --> 00:11:07.579
the problem here is that a lot of us are
still making content for our website as

kind of sucks line is stood on the stage

00:11:13.129 --> 00:11:13.139
kind of sucks line is stood on the stage
 

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:15.829
kind of sucks line is stood on the stage
and said that earlier today right we

00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839
and said that earlier today right we
 

00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:18.379
and said that earlier today right we
have assets that are too large if your

00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:18.389
have assets that are too large if your
 

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:19.850
have assets that are too large if your
assets are too large and the number of

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:19.860
assets are too large and the number of
 

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.199
assets are too large and the number of
dependencies you have are too large of

00:11:21.199 --> 00:11:21.209
dependencies you have are too large of
 

00:11:21.209 --> 00:11:22.160
dependencies you have are too large of
course that's going to keep your

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:22.170
course that's going to keep your
 

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:23.870
course that's going to keep your
critical path from being resolved right

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880
critical path from being resolved right
 

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.759
critical path from being resolved right
so look at it from a perf matter side of

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:25.769
so look at it from a perf matter side of
 

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:26.990
so look at it from a perf matter side of
it reduce the number of requests and

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000
it reduce the number of requests and
 

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.030
it reduce the number of requests and
reduce the size of the total number of

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040
reduce the size of the total number of
 

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.650
reduce the size of the total number of
requests so what happens here is this is

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:30.660
requests so what happens here is this is
 

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.480
requests so what happens here is this is
that once we get all of this done we can

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:32.490
that once we get all of this done we can
 

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.860
that once we get all of this done we can
finally get to a point that we can build

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:33.870
finally get to a point that we can build
 

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.230
finally get to a point that we can build
our DOM and our cssom or our render tree

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240
our DOM and our cssom or our render tree
 

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.850
our DOM and our cssom or our render tree
and then we can resolve this chaos and

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:37.860
and then we can resolve this chaos and
 

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.410
and then we can resolve this chaos and
actually finally start painting the page

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420
actually finally start painting the page
 

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.720
actually finally start painting the page
so the question for you then is if all

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:41.730
so the question for you then is if all
 

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.250
so the question for you then is if all
of this chaos is going onto the hood

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.260
of this chaos is going onto the hood
 

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.350
of this chaos is going onto the hood
that I have no idea about how do I use

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360
that I have no idea about how do I use
 

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.759
that I have no idea about how do I use
my tooling to find it so let's take a

00:11:46.759 --> 00:11:46.769
my tooling to find it so let's take a
 

00:11:46.769 --> 00:11:49.910
my tooling to find it so let's take a
look at that really quick so this is the

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920
look at that really quick so this is the
 

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.730
look at that really quick so this is the
verge it's a website it does some things

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:52.740
verge it's a website it does some things
 

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.170
verge it's a website it does some things
I'm not going to go too deep into that

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:54.180
I'm not going to go too deep into that
 

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.509
I'm not going to go too deep into that
but most of you already in the in the

00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519
but most of you already in the in the
 

00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:58.699

picture world that we live in and we
 

00:14:55.589 --> 00:14:57.740
picture world that we live in and we
have to paint it so the cool thing is

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:57.750
have to paint it so the cool thing is

earlier this year that painting on a

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320
earlier this year that painting on a
 

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.670
earlier this year that painting on a
webpage was not free right so this is

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680
webpage was not free right so this is
 

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.990
webpage was not free right so this is
actually a software resource something

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000
actually a software resource something
 

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.550
actually a software resource something
has to happen so the user actually puts

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.560
has to happen so the user actually puts
 

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.720
has to happen so the user actually puts
his finger on your site and starts

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:08.730
his finger on your site and starts
 

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.220
his finger on your site and starts
scrolling around and what happens is we

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:10.230
scrolling around and what happens is we
 

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:11.449
scrolling around and what happens is we
have to translate the page and then

00:15:11.449 --> 00:15:11.459
have to translate the page and then
 

00:15:11.459 --> 00:15:13.130
have to translate the page and then
what's not visible to the page we have

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:13.140
what's not visible to the page we have
 

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.380
what's not visible to the page we have
to actually spin up the CPU and spend

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:15.390
to actually spin up the CPU and spend
 

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:19.310

there's a good talk you can see the link
 

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.699
there's a good talk you can see the link
on the bottom here we talk about the the

00:15:25.699 --> 00:15:25.709
on the bottom here we talk about the the
 

00:15:25.709 --> 00:15:27.290
on the bottom here we talk about the the
interdependency between the CPU and the

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:27.300
interdependency between the CPU and the

won't get in that today but the point

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:29.070
won't get in that today but the point
 

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.260
won't get in that today but the point
that you need to take away is that

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:30.270
that you need to take away is that
 

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.480
that you need to take away is that
scrolling isn't the only place that

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:32.490
scrolling isn't the only place that
 

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:34.850
scrolling isn't the only place that
painting occurs there's other things

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:34.860
painting occurs there's other things
 

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.260
painting occurs there's other things
that the user does that causes paints as

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:36.270
that the user does that causes paints as
 

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.880
that the user does that causes paints as
well for example let's say you have your

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:37.890
well for example let's say you have your
 

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.770
well for example let's say you have your
DOM and the Dom is doing awesome on its

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:39.780
DOM and the Dom is doing awesome on its
 

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.020
DOM and the Dom is doing awesome on its
Adame Dom day and the user clicks on

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:42.030
Adame Dom day and the user clicks on
 

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.280
Adame Dom day and the user clicks on
something you're like dude free stuff

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:43.290
something you're like dude free stuff
 

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.290
something you're like dude free stuff
and you have to actually pop up a dialog

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:45.300
and you have to actually pop up a dialog
 

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.630
and you have to actually pop up a dialog
to say dude free stuff right and in

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:47.640
to say dude free stuff right and in
 

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.600
to say dude free stuff right and in
doing so you modify the Dom well when

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:50.610
doing so you modify the Dom well when
 

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.640
doing so you modify the Dom well when
you modify the Dom all of the properties

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:52.650
you modify the Dom all of the properties
 

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:53.750
you modify the Dom all of the properties
of the Dom have to be recalculated

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.760
of the Dom have to be recalculated
 

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.040
of the Dom have to be recalculated
because we have to figure out did you

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.050
because we have to figure out did you
 

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.930
because we have to figure out did you
change something that was visible when

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:56.940
change something that was visible when
 

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.070
change something that was visible when
you do this we have to rebuild

00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:58.080
you do this we have to rebuild
 

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.050
you do this we have to rebuild
everything which means things on the

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:00.060
everything which means things on the
 

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.490
everything which means things on the
screen of change which means we need to

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:01.500
screen of change which means we need to
 

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.560
screen of change which means we need to
actually repaint things so when you

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:03.570
actually repaint things so when you
 

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.270
actually repaint things so when you
change the Dom you update properties of

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:05.280
change the Dom you update properties of
 

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.400
change the Dom you update properties of
the Dom repaints have to occur another

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:07.410
the Dom repaints have to occur another
 

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:08.900
the Dom repaints have to occur another
great example right so let's say we've

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:08.910
great example right so let's say we've
 

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.180
great example right so let's say we've
got a user who's scrolling your site and

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:11.190
got a user who's scrolling your site and
 

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.430
got a user who's scrolling your site and
a lot of mobile web sites I see nowaday

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440
a lot of mobile web sites I see nowaday
 

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.450
a lot of mobile web sites I see nowaday

class list the CSS object model has to
 

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.580
class list the CSS object model has to
be rebuilt and of course this causes a

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:46.590
be rebuilt and of course this causes a
 

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.350
be rebuilt and of course this causes a
repaint so you touch the Dom you touch

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360
repaint so you touch the Dom you touch
 

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.450

this the paint storming if you get into
 

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.360
this the paint storming if you get into
a weird cycle of this right so let's

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:53.370
a weird cycle of this right so let's
 

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.970
a weird cycle of this right so let's
take a look at the demo here single demo

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:55.980
take a look at the demo here single demo

this is a scrolling a site okay and I'm
 

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:07.250
this is a scrolling a site okay and I'm
just kind of scrolling slowly here but

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:07.260
just kind of scrolling slowly here but
 

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.449
just kind of scrolling slowly here but
you can see it's actually just a little

jittery I'm not sure how well this is
coming on the stream but you can see

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:11.430
coming on the stream but you can see
 

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:13.160
coming on the stream but you can see
some of these white boxes here just

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:13.170
some of these white boxes here just
 

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.439
some of these white boxes here just
start moving - well and so when we hold

00:17:15.439 --> 00:17:15.449
start moving - well and so when we hold
 

00:17:15.449 --> 00:17:16.309

right and what we're effectively looking
 

00:17:30.419 --> 00:17:31.519
right and what we're effectively looking
at here is when you see green and

but bear with me now so the question is

00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799
but bear with me now so the question is
 

00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:10.100
but bear with me now so the question is
what caused that JavaScript to get slow

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:10.110
what caused that JavaScript to get slow
 

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.989
what caused that JavaScript to get slow
right we need to make sure that we keep
