1
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.870
Three. Two, one. Here we go. How are you sir? I'm doing good. Um,

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.820
I'm super happy to have you here. If there is a mount Rushmore of video games,

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.180
you are George Washington, you're up there. So this is great.

4
00:00:13.181 --> 00:00:16.660
People have been kind of nudging us from years and years to get this done.

5
00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:19.780
So it's great that we're finally able to make it happen. Yeah. Um,

6
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.180
I have been from day one a gigantic quake junkie and a doom junkie.

7
00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:28.660
So for me to have you in here is a giant treat and everybody,

8
00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:32.500
you know I've talked about your video games and your creations so many times on

9
00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:33.510
this podcast. So it's,

10
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.150
it's very cool to have you here and thank you very much for showing me before

11
00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:38.170
the podcast got started.

12
00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:42.100
I should tell her buddy you showed me the latest and greatest version of Oculus

13
00:00:42.101 --> 00:00:45.670
rift, which is amazing. It's so small for people watching the youtube.

14
00:00:45.671 --> 00:00:49.630
This is the entire unit. This, this thing that sits on your head.

15
00:00:49.631 --> 00:00:53.350
It's very light and it's not attached to a computer.

16
00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:55.930
Like you don't have to carry anything around and there's no extra,

17
00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.130
everything is in here. Yeah. So this is the oculus quest, the standalone device,

18
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.730
and it's been kind of the culmination of a bunch of different products that

19
00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:07.060
we've been working on and it's the vision that we had even six years ago.

20
00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:09.430
Just the idea of not connected to anything.

21
00:01:09.431 --> 00:01:14.020
You put this magic hat on and you're transported to these different worlds and

22
00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:16.770
this is available right now. Anyone can buy this. Right? Okay.

23
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.420
So it's available. Jamie just actually pulled up the website. Um,

24
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.860
can I push this up to you? Pull it? Yeah. There you go. Um, how,

25
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.160
what is the battery life on these things? So it depends on what you're doing.

26
00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:30.460
Where I, if you just sit there and watch Netflix, I, you know,

27
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.050
it'll last a little more than three hours.

28
00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:34.060
If you play some of the really hardcore games,

29
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.010
it might only last two hours or so.

30
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.130
Do you have numbers on how many people are watching Netflix on this thing?

31
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.470
So our previous one right before this,

32
00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:44.320
the oculus go was a little bit more media focused.

33
00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:48.550
And that's one of our more popular applications. I mean, surprisingly things,

34
00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:52.060
everybody thought that VR was going to be all about these just amazing gaming

35
00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:52.960
experiences,

36
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.470
but some of the most popular experiences are doing reasonably conventional

37
00:01:56.471 --> 00:01:59.830
things. Watching Netflix, watching youtube, Amazon prime,

38
00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:03.280
stuff like that where if you're like, if you're you,

39
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.410
when you've got a great home theater and everything,

40
00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:08.770
there's not this much benefit to having a theater like that in VR.

41
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.390
But if you're in a situation like you're in a tiny room in Tokyo or something,

42
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.100
the idea of being able to put on the VR headset and have this like lovely ski

43
00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:22.570
lodge atmosphere with a giant screen TV, it has some real benefits.

44
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.710
So in the end,

45
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.820
VR should be a replacement for anything you do on screens today,

46
00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:32.230
whether it's your phone, your tablet, your TV, your laptop, your PC,

47
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.370
all of these should eventually be superseded by just having more flexible

48
00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:37.860
screens in VR. I mean,

49
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.830
we have lots of challenges now with resolution and comfort for longterm use,

50
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.050
but this is the direction that everything's going.

51
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.500
Not only do you have things in VR that you couldn't do anywhere else,

52
00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:50.500
just experiences that you can't have with that level of immersion,

53
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.220
but it should pull along every other thing that people do with screens,

54
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:58.660
devices today. Uh, that's, I didn't consider the television shows,

55
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.040
but of course people

56
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.200
<v 1>would be watching Netflix on this if it's possible.</v>

57
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.410
Have you done the Disney world ride the Avatar ride flights of passage now?

58
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:11.170
I haven't done that yet. It's amazing you sit on this,

59
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.390
it's like a motorcycle looking thing.

60
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.050
It straps you in place and it's supposed to represent one of those flying dragon

61
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.170
things and Avatar. And then you have the headset. You put that on.

62
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.280
And the VR virtual reality experience is second to none. I mean,

63
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:29.080
it's incredible. Super high resolution and the, the motorcycles moving around,

64
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:32.260
you get wind and smells and all these, uh, sensories.

65
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.760
So that's one of the really interesting things.

66
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.210
I think about that whenever I am at amusement parks for things like the Harry

67
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.720
Potter rides and stuff like that where they're doing lots with screens and

68
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:44.740
motion platforms where I think about it from the VR perspective and anything

69
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:46.720
we're doing visually and audibly,

70
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.000
we could go ahead and do a great job in the headset.

71
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.690
So it's cutting it down to these few physical things that you can't do.

72
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:56.620
So you've got things with motion platforms that actually jostle you around that

73
00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:57.820
you can't do in VR.

74
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.410
You've got things like smell and like the void I'm where they had the star wars,

75
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.310
uh, experienced there. We have a fantastic star wars experience on quest,

76
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.310
which in many ways has a lot of that magic,

77
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:12.370
but in the void where they set it up and they blow hot air over,

78
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:14.740
what's the virtual lava I towards you?

79
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.750
That's something that you still don't get,

80
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.710
but it's kind of like the the age old battle of what can you do differently in

81
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:23.350
an arcade that you can't do as good in your eye,

82
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:26.110
your home system and VR now takes,

83
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.360
lets you do all of these amazing things there.

84
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.390
But if you're willing to spend millions of dollars and build a theme park

85
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:34.840
attraction essentially, you can still throw some of these extra things.

86
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.140
And people joke about when is smellovision coming to VR.

87
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:42.010
And there have actually been real companies that have spun up to say it's like,

88
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.510
oh we want to do scent, augment mentation. But it's not a great thing.

89
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:50.800
And those are still the last vestiges of things where you have to go someplace.

90
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:54.040
But the promise of VR is to, you know, the world as you want it.

91
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.800
Not Having to go to someplace to do something magical.

92
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.150
And if you can get to 90 something percent of that experience staying in your

93
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:04.330
own room, then that's great. What would they be able to do with smell vision?

94
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:09.160
Would you have like a standalone unit that like has access to the program?

95
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.840
So like if you were flying over orange fields, it would spray citrus in the air.

96
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.590
So sort of like soaring over the world. Have you ever done that Disneyland ride.

97
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.130
So they let somebody who literally did make this where they made a little box

98
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:25.090
that put I that glute or attached to the underside of the head mounted display.

99
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.410
And one of the interesting things about scent as opposed to I like audio or

100
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:33.490
video with video, everybody knows that you just make red, green and blue colors.

101
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:36.490
You can mix them in any way and make all the colors that we can see.

102
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.660
Smell isn't like that I,

103
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.570
our nose is actually a receptor for a whole lot of discrete different molecules.

104
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:47.140
There's no way to mix up smell like the way we do with light to make red,

105
00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:50.470
green and blue primaries with that. So they really had to pick,

106
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.950
okay here's the dozen or so smells that we're going to have with this.

107
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.190
And it would just sort of Spritz it out on a little blast of air. I very close

108
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.380
<v 0>to your nose so it doesn't need much of it to get in.</v>

109
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.840
So if you really wanted to do some sort of a jungle experience with, you know,

110
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:09.230
thousands of different smells of plants and dirt and all the,

111
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.700
you would have to have like some enormous unit that spraying these various

112
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:14.330
things.

113
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.010
Although I suspect that at least modern people in modern society do not really

114
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:20.960
have that discerning of a level of scent.

115
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:25.400
Like if you took some Peruvian indigeneity or something that they probably would

116
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:27.560
complain, it's like, oh, the fidelity on this is garbage.

117
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:32.150
I should have 500 different smells here and I only detect five. But you take,

118
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.610
you know, a normal city person and you just,

119
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.060
3 cents of jungle is probably going to be more than enough to sell the

120
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:42.010
experience. The guy in the jungle be like, this is sterile urine. Yeah,

121
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.290
they're not real. So what does this Jamie Homer's,

122
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.870
oh my goodness. So this is something she's holding. She's pulled it off.

123
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.790
It attaches to the headset right here.

124
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:56.330
It says feel real sensory mask.

125
00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.070
So it's a sensory mask that smell virtual reality. Oh yeah.

126
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.410
It's so it stimulates,

127
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.870
simulates hundreds of smells to immerse you in the virtual world.

128
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.740
Wow. Of course it's coming. But why am I shocked? Look at this guy,

129
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:11.930
he's gotta look a little cartridge.

130
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.220
He's popping in there with all that'll refilling your toner cartridge and you're

131
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.030
out reliable sent generator. How hilarious.

132
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.460
But if you have to rank your senses, it's not in the top two. You know,

133
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.020
and it's probably gonna be clunky,

134
00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:32.021
like the earlier versions of VR where you got that low resolution sort of thing.

135
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.390
I remember my friend Dunkin, uh, he's,

136
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.480
he's a huge technology freak and he had a really early version of the consumer,

137
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.870
uh, virtual reality headsets, uh, the early, early oculus.

138
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.730
And I remember putting it on going, oh my God,

139
00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:49.340
even though it was really pixelated, I'm like, this is a game changer.

140
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.240
Like that sense that you've seen the future. Yeah. You put it on, it's like,

141
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.270
it's not here yet, but that's the,

142
00:07:55.271 --> 00:07:58.760
the ability to just project a little bit past the flaws there and say, okay,

143
00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:01.130
well we're going to sort this out over the next several years.

144
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.930
We'll get higher resolution.

145
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:07.190
We'll get the response better and you can imagine what it's going to be. Yeah,

146
00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:09.990
it's pretty stunning. And what you just showed me today, the,

147
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.730
the Star Wars one is actually higher resolution than the void,

148
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.150
which is the one that you pay to go see or you go into the warehouse and

149
00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:18.410
everything. I've done that several times.

150
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.430
The void with star wars and in the void with a record Ralph,

151
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.170
which is pretty cool too. It's really fun.

152
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.800
But the physicality of having the actual props there is the magic of being in

153
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:28.041
there.

154
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:31.400
It's like you pull out your storm trooper blaster and you have to get around and

155
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.030
that's really something versus a lot of times when you're just using the

156
00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:37.100
controllers to pretend you're doing things,

157
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:38.840
you feel like you're a mind someplace,

158
00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:42.560
some French mime kind of pretending to do things and that doesn't sell the

159
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:44.920
experience. And that's why I, you know,

160
00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.220
my favorites are the things like beat Saber where in the game you are swinging,

161
00:08:49.221 --> 00:08:51.680
this lightsaber is sort of thing through things.

162
00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:55.800
So your actions in reality are exactly what your actions in the virtual world

163
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:56.280
are.

164
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.200
<v 1>You swing through it, there's a little bit of a,</v>

165
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:02.550
of a buzz as you cross through it and it just feels like you are,

166
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.200
you're projecting yourself there.

167
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.790
Now what about the possibility of a haptic feedback vest or a suit or something

168
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:09.840
that you can put on your body?

169
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.560
So there's the interesting things all the way back into that.

170
00:09:12.561 --> 00:09:15.480
The doom and quake days. I remember one of the really early,

171
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.180
I kind of entrepreneur guys that came by,

172
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:23.190
he had made this leather jacket with all of these impact pucks on it and it had,

173
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:27.240
I had like eight or nine different things that were the solenoids that could

174
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.510
deliver a pretty sharp thud and he wanted to in, you know, get uh,

175
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.450
support added to the Games for that.

176
00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:36.240
The idea you play that and what you're getting when you're getting shot,

177
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:39.450
it actually feels like you're getting hit in the back. And you know,

178
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.160
I didn't think that was a very likely I am mass market consumer thing. I mean,

179
00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:48.120
not too many people want that level of fidelity where it actually starts making

180
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:48.954
you sore.

181
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.680
But that's one of the wonderful things about being able to open source the

182
00:09:52.681 --> 00:09:56.760
various codes after the games are a little bit older where anybody that wants to

183
00:09:56.761 --> 00:10:01.761
can nowadays go and take doom or quake or those earlier titles and program in

184
00:10:01.951 --> 00:10:04.620
for whatever crazy thing. They don't have to convince someone.

185
00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:08.220
They don't have to go convince skeptical John Carmack that this device is going

186
00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:11.400
to be a worthwhile thing to add support to the mainline code.

187
00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:13.740
They can just go do it, which is a wonderful thing.

188
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.310
That is very cool that you guys do that I think is really cool and yeah,

189
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.400
that was one of those things where early on as you can imagine,

190
00:10:20.401 --> 00:10:24.480
that was a tough sell in the company where the people that weren't coming from

191
00:10:24.481 --> 00:10:27.780
the sort of hacker ethic background on the programming side,

192
00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:31.620
you get the business people and the artists and the designers and they're like,

193
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.630
we want to just give away our source code.

194
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.840
Won't that be a leg up to the competitors? Why do you want to do this?

195
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.220
And it was one of my, it made me really happy when many years later,

196
00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:44.570
Kevin Cloud, one of my early partners, uh, told me that yeah,

197
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:49.260
in retrospect that was really the right thing to do and it's great with doom and

198
00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:52.920
quake now especially doing where anything that has a processor runs doom.

199
00:10:52.921 --> 00:10:57.330
If it's got a 32 bit processor and it can conceivably display an image,

200
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.210
people have poured a doom to it and that code will live forever.

201
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.510
A hundred years from now people will be able to dig up and run the doom source

202
00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:07.870
code and some ambulator. That is very cool. Now what was the conversation like?

203
00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.490
Like when you guys, when you were saying, hey, this is good for the community,

204
00:11:11.491 --> 00:11:14.750
this is good for games overall, it's going to get people excited about it.

205
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.890
It's just going to generate more business. Like what did you,

206
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.820
how did you sell it?

207
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.600
So it's an interesting path there where in our earliest games,

208
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.500
I can remember that some of the very first things that happened with wolf and

209
00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:30.501
Stein 3d before doom where that was not set up to be easy to be modified.

210
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.690
Uh, we were still back in those days of fitting on floppy disks.

211
00:11:33.691 --> 00:11:37.320
So I had all the data compressed in this nonstandard thing that I just made up

212
00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:41.670
at the time. But people dug through all of that, disassembled the code,

213
00:11:41.671 --> 00:11:45.720
figured out how it worked and started making some level editors and doing the

214
00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:50.010
things like, you know, replacing Hitler with Barney and all of these early mods.

215
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:52.290
And we're all like, well this is fantastic. You know,

216
00:11:52.291 --> 00:11:55.000
this is people taking the game. They played through the game,

217
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:58.420
they loved it and they loved it so much that they want to keep doing things on

218
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:02.830
it and they wind up breaking into the game at that time essentially to figure

219
00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:05.530
out how to make new things. So by the time we were working on doom,

220
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:09.400
it was an explicit top line technical goal for me that, okay,

221
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:12.340
I had these graphics things I wanted to do, I want to do networking.

222
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.720
But I also wanted to really make game modding a first top level feature.

223
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.030
So we added all of this ability to do the,

224
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.020
the wads and p Wads and we documented all of it and we released a lot of the

225
00:12:23.021 --> 00:12:24.880
tools, the early source code.

226
00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:28.270
So here's how you go ahead and as much harder at that point with the more

227
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:31.420
sophisticated stuff going on, but here's how you build a level in doom.

228
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:33.730
And we even released the code for our level editor,

229
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.850
although that didn't help the community that much because we were using these

230
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.690
crazy expensive next workstations, uh,

231
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:43.000
and other people had to take the steps to go ahead and make them run on pcs.

232
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.630
But the step beyond that, when we were looking at quake,

233
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.640
I am so I knew that I wanted to enable actual changes of the game play because

234
00:12:51.641 --> 00:12:55.060
in doing, you could swap out all the different models you could swap out. I,

235
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.740
I the way things look,

236
00:12:56.741 --> 00:13:00.580
the way things sounded and some people would go in and actually patch the

237
00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:03.880
executable to do a few minor changes in game play.

238
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.780
But the next step clearly was allowing people to really make whole new game play

239
00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:08.530
modes.

240
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.880
So that was how I quite got this quake c extension language and we wrote a lot

241
00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:17.230
of the game in that and that led to all the things like capture the flag and

242
00:13:17.231 --> 00:13:21.100
team fortress and all those, which was yeah, all these really,

243
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:22.300
really great things.

244
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.510
But there were still things that you couldn't do or couldn't do effectively

245
00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:29.140
there. And that's where there was still this desire to be able to say,

246
00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:30.700
well what if we just gave them everything?

247
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:34.360
What if we gave them the full source code and let them sort of hack to their

248
00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:38.050
heart's content port other platforms. And again,

249
00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:41.830
it wasn't a super popular decision, but the way I was pitching it was,

250
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:44.740
well it still helps our titles. It still gives them life.

251
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:48.400
It gives them life after they would have been off the shelf falling off of

252
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:51.880
people's radar, just falling into some game of nostalgia.

253
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:57.150
But being able to let people make real new versions of it would be,

254
00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.380
it would keep them current, it would keep them relevant.

255
00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:04.240
And so the pitch that I ran for years there was after our new game came out with

256
00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:05.530
brand new technology,

257
00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:09.490
then we should be able to open source release the previous generation.

258
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.330
So first when doom was out, we released Wolf Einstein. When quake was out,

259
00:14:13.331 --> 00:14:16.060
we released doom and when the later quakes were out,

260
00:14:16.061 --> 00:14:20.830
we released the quake one code. And that worked out really remarkably well.

261
00:14:20.831 --> 00:14:23.650
I know at the time there were some people in the company that are just like,

262
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.940
this is just John's thing. And they were not really happy about it,

263
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:31.840
but I was in a position where I could kind of throw my weight around a little

264
00:14:31.841 --> 00:14:33.970
bit, that and I was happy that I did it.

265
00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:37.210
And in the end everybody agrees it was a good win. Um,

266
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.440
I'm a little sad that more companies weren't able to take that final step.

267
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.290
Modding was embraced broadly by a lot of game companies,

268
00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.670
but only a handful of companies were able to really go the entire way and

269
00:14:48.671 --> 00:14:52.100
release full source code in the years. That's

270
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.690
<v 2>too bad because that is one of the core aspects of the quake community is that,</v>

271
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.021
you know,

272
00:14:57.021 --> 00:15:01.440
you guys did release that stuff and there were all these cool extras and things

273
00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.990
that you could download and maps.

274
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.870
So many different maps that people had created that were really interesting.

275
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:08.690
Like I remember one was a guy's apartment. Like you could,

276
00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:11.900
you could play quake in an apartment. Like you could shoot,

277
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.350
you could get to the top of the toilet and shoot it things off the toilet.

278
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:16.400
It was really amazing.

279
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.770
How did you feel about when people would play the game competitively in the turn

280
00:15:21.771 --> 00:15:22.790
all the textures off?

281
00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.460
<v 1>So I, yeah, that's a,</v>

282
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:30.040
that especially as a sore point with the artists that have labored for years to

283
00:15:30.041 --> 00:15:34.060
build these glorious textures and then you get the people that just turn them

284
00:15:34.061 --> 00:15:35.950
down. And there's two reasons to turn them down.

285
00:15:35.951 --> 00:15:39.640
You turn them down to help performance. In some cases in the early days,

286
00:15:39.641 --> 00:15:41.410
and especially the early graphics cards,

287
00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.810
you would get higher frame rate if you turned him down,

288
00:15:43.811 --> 00:15:46.180
so you'd have less latency in your response times.

289
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.870
But there's also the even more to Pfarius thing about turning them all down to

290
00:15:49.871 --> 00:15:52.300
improve the contrast on your enemy acquisition.

291
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:57.820
So people want this almost flat shaded world so that any moving set of pixels,

292
00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:02.170
they're just turn and fire at that. And that's, I'm,

293
00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:07.210
I never came to really great terms with that where I always thought on end the

294
00:16:07.211 --> 00:16:09.070
early days of e-sports and gaming,

295
00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.520
we did always insist that people have to play with at least plausible

296
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.770
resolutions there because we want our game to look good.

297
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.200
We want people that are looking at it for the first time,

298
00:16:17.201 --> 00:16:19.960
seeing these professionals play it. I am, you know,

299
00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:22.840
we don't want them to look at that and say, well, this game looks like garbage.

300
00:16:22.841 --> 00:16:25.330
It's all flat shaded or blurry. I am.

301
00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:28.750
And luckily computers got fast enough that people could start playing at the

302
00:16:28.751 --> 00:16:33.100
frame rates that they wanted. Even with the full textures running in it. I am,

303
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.280
but the whole pace of doing diet, I kind of,

304
00:16:36.281 --> 00:16:39.430
the East sports and the competitive gaming was very interesting.

305
00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:43.300
We saw the dawn of that with doom, but it's been pretty surprised.

306
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.160
It's been amazing the state that it's taken,

307
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.720
it's gotten to today where I remember when we did the quake read annihilation

308
00:16:49.721 --> 00:16:50.141
tournament,

309
00:16:50.141 --> 00:16:54.130
I gave away my first Ferrari is grand prize and I was thinking this is just the

310
00:16:54.131 --> 00:16:55.360
most over the top thing.

311
00:16:55.361 --> 00:16:59.170
This is going to be unmatched for years and it was only a year later that there

312
00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.580
was some other tournament with $100,000 prize coming out. So that went on,

313
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.680
went much quicker than I expected.

314
00:17:05.681 --> 00:17:10.150
And then today you have just the amazing celebrity of the top pro players.

315
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.880
It's a, it's again, it's great to see the path that it's taken. It really isn't.

316
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:13.950
Yeah,

317
00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.460
<v 2>it's very interesting to see that they're now like legitimate sports stars and</v>

318
00:17:17.461 --> 00:17:19.470
they make a ton of money.

319
00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:24.090
Whereas if you were a kid 10 15 years ago, your parents would tell you,

320
00:17:24.091 --> 00:17:27.630
you're wasting your time. This is nonsense. Why you playing these games?

321
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.770
But now you have a legitimate opportunity to be a professional game player.

322
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:35.850
<v 1>Although I do, I get, I hate, there's a hazard there. Where,</v>

323
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.581
<v 2>what's this Jamie?</v>

324
00:17:36.581 --> 00:17:41.030
What are you pulling up top earners this year compared to the top of tiger

325
00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:44.340
woods? How much do you want in the masters in the top Indy 500 earner?

326
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.790
So Tiger Woods won 2 million in the masters.

327
00:17:46.791 --> 00:17:50.040
The top quake players won 3 million. 121

328
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.380
<v 0>eight under 72. Well, it's not quick. What game is that? Dota. What does that,</v>

329
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:58.170
what does that, let's Dodo. It's a different name than quake, but it's a,

330
00:17:58.171 --> 00:18:01.170
it's very popular right now. What's the stand for? I've never even heard of it.

331
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.410
It's a valve game. It's a, it's a Moba,

332
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.130
massively online battle arena game directing all the different little characters

333
00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:11.820
down there. And that along with, especially league of legends, even beyond that,

334
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.880
I not as popular in the United States but is just amazing overseas where,

335
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.640
uh, they, like if you look at the numbers for things, people think, oh,

336
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:24.170
the super bowl, like the height of all competitive sports, whatever. And they,

337
00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:28.290
a lot of these e-sports games, especially in South Korea are,

338
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:33.000
they dwarf those numbers really. And some people are just very, yeah,

339
00:18:33.001 --> 00:18:37.500
I'm not aware of this where you just get millions of people tuning in and

340
00:18:37.501 --> 00:18:41.550
enormous arenas too. Right? They play in these gigantic places with,

341
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:43.710
you look at this, oh my God,

342
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.450
look at this arena that looks like 30,000 people that looks like a UFC event.

343
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.460
Yeah. Yeah. Actually a lot bigger than UFC events. Is that one? Oh,

344
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.000
I'm sure I know about that one in particular,

345
00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.110
but they have some really enormous biggest UFC event we ever had was 55,000

346
00:18:58.111 --> 00:19:01.770
people. Yeah, they've been well over that. That's crazy. That's amazing.

347
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.850
It's really cool to see. And it's these games, um,

348
00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:10.290
particularly quake, they are unbelievably difficult to master.

349
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:15.310
It's one of the more fascinating aspects of like video game play and addiction

350
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:19.560
is the complexity. Like when you would watch like re like I remember,

351
00:19:19.561 --> 00:19:23.950
do you remember thresh? Oh yeah. Fresh is the one that won my Ferrari first.

352
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.613
Red Annihilation turn to cool.

353
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:30.770
That guy was the hero back in the day of a early quick play. He was just this,

354
00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.650
uh, what does Kenneth Fond, cause I was named Dennis Fong. Dennis fung,

355
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:37.850
Dennis Fung. Um, there is, there's thresh,

356
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.830
and I remember I would watch demos.

357
00:19:40.831 --> 00:19:43.200
One of the cool things about quake was that you could,

358
00:19:43.201 --> 00:19:45.630
is that as far as one of the fruit, let me see that. Yeah.

359
00:19:45.631 --> 00:19:48.000
So that was my old turbo three Oh eight.

360
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.360
Now you've returned turbocharged your Ferrari's to which I want to get to as

361
00:19:51.361 --> 00:19:52.620
well, which is pretty crazy.

362
00:19:52.621 --> 00:19:57.621
But so this guy was like the first real killer in Dennis fung.

363
00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:58.380
There you go.

364
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:03.380
First real killer in the quite playing games and you would be able to watch him

365
00:20:03.541 --> 00:20:06.990
play on demos. You play through his eyes.

366
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.710
So you would be able to see like how he does things and move around.

367
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:12.300
It was really cool.

368
00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:15.840
Some of the interesting things about quake where it wasn't really so clear when

369
00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:18.960
we were designing it, but it is a brutal game,

370
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:23.730
especially in one-on-one where a lot of modern games are much more approachable.

371
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.470
Where if you followed a lot of the quake games,

372
00:20:25.471 --> 00:20:28.620
a lot of them were just blow outs where you would get somebody that would take

373
00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:30.900
control of the level and they would be running their pattern,

374
00:20:30.901 --> 00:20:34.830
denying anyone any foot in the door and you'd wind up with these 20 to one

375
00:20:34.831 --> 00:20:38.850
blowout games where there are things that you can do in game design to make it

376
00:20:38.851 --> 00:20:42.540
more approachable. Where like if you don't have health packs where you can keep,

377
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.350
because in a game like quake you'd go in as long as you come out on top and the

378
00:20:46.351 --> 00:20:49.030
fight, you've got this little window to run around and bring yourself,

379
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.450
bring your health back up. So even if you're only 5% better,

380
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.320
you might win every engagement because you have enough time to go back,

381
00:20:56.321 --> 00:20:59.080
get yourself back up before you wind up re-engaging.

382
00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:03.070
Where in another game if you didn't have health that I that would continuous,

383
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:06.730
you had the ability to bring it back up. Then even if somebody didn't win,

384
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.640
if they knocked you down a whole lot then they might get you the next time

385
00:21:09.641 --> 00:21:14.641
around and scores can be much more even quaint gameplay winds up brutal tending

386
00:21:15.101 --> 00:21:18.440
towards blowouts and very frustrating for a,

387
00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:22.210
it did not have the approachability for new players where a lot of more modern

388
00:21:22.211 --> 00:21:24.220
games, things like Overwatch,

389
00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:28.150
I can be jumped into a lot more easily because team play is another aspect of

390
00:21:28.151 --> 00:21:30.340
that where if you've got a team,

391
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.580
you could be on the winning team even if you suck because you might have really

392
00:21:33.581 --> 00:21:36.130
great players that are kind of covering for you there.

393
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:40.570
You can jump in and have the chance to say, Yay, I won. I am.

394
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.720
Even if you didn't contribute at all and you might wind up, I am, you know,

395
00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.461
doing something.

396
00:21:45.461 --> 00:21:48.790
You start off being completely useless and then you slowly work your way up to

397
00:21:48.791 --> 00:21:50.890
being able to contribute effectively for your team.

398
00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.490
So I can recognize some of these things now about ways to make games more

399
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:58.570
approachable, but the kind of brutality of quake,

400
00:21:58.571 --> 00:22:02.350
like there was a a, it was a taste that a lot of people really did.

401
00:22:02.351 --> 00:22:07.300
Like it wasn't so much explicitly designed for that, but it worked out that way.

402
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.960
And that's one of the interesting things as we look at game design today versus

403
00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:14.500
the old days, a lot of people fall into a sort of nostalgia trap about saying,

404
00:22:14.501 --> 00:22:17.380
well, the games I grew up with were the greatest games ever.

405
00:22:17.381 --> 00:22:19.960
And you see it with music and movies and everything.

406
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:24.310
And I tend to be much more optimistic about the state of things today where the

407
00:22:24.311 --> 00:22:28.180
amount of effort that goes into the modern games is extraordinary.

408
00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:31.720
Just the detail and all the quality on all the different levels.

409
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:35.890
But there is a little sense of, games are so expensive to make now. You know,

410
00:22:35.891 --> 00:22:39.190
sometimes in the hundreds of millions of dollars that they do have to be

411
00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:39.971
conservative.

412
00:22:39.971 --> 00:22:43.750
So they have to be careful to make sure that they've got something that has a

413
00:22:43.751 --> 00:22:47.110
broad mass appeal. And I think that is the, uh,

414
00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.680
the upside of some of the older games where they might have a little bit more of

415
00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:51.670
a distinct flavor.

416
00:22:51.671 --> 00:22:54.850
They weren't sort of focus group to death in the way that some of the more

417
00:22:54.851 --> 00:22:57.590
modern games can be. That's an interesting, you know,

418
00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:02.560
focus group to death I'm sure is a problem. Um, the, the, the quick blowouts,

419
00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.240
although that is a thing, um,

420
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.780
it's so fun when you're the person blowing the,

421
00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:12.830
the person out that it's worth learning the maps and that that's the will sort

422
00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.620
of people don't understand what we're talking about. Quake would have, um,

423
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:19.670
well it has maps and on those maps, like this is where the rocket mantra is,

424
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.490
is where the rail gun is, is where the health is.

425
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:22.890
This is where the mega farmers,

426
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.220
and you had to know where these things were and that they would regenerate every

427
00:23:27.221 --> 00:23:31.690
x amount of seconds. And so you're managing not just you're fighting,

428
00:23:31.691 --> 00:23:33.310
but you're also managing the resources.

429
00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:37.210
So you're running around and trying to control the map and trying to control the

430
00:23:37.211 --> 00:23:39.910
mega health and trying to control where the armor is.

431
00:23:39.911 --> 00:23:41.230
And don't let the guy get the rail gun.

432
00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:44.170
Don't let the guy get the rocket launcher. And in doing that,

433
00:23:44.171 --> 00:23:49.171
it's just incredible of strategy as well as like fast twitch aiming and there's

434
00:23:50.571 --> 00:23:52.040
so many factors going on.

435
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:55.280
The masters would have at times such that they're just running to where it's

436
00:23:55.281 --> 00:23:58.970
going to spawn and a half second before they get their, it responds,

437
00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:00.950
they run over it, it's there and it's gone.

438
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.790
And the difference between the top level players is something you see in

439
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:09.200
competitive games a lot even today is you get the sense of the big fish in the

440
00:24:09.201 --> 00:24:11.120
small pond. You know, it's like I am the,

441
00:24:11.121 --> 00:24:14.030
I totally beat all of my friends asses and we're the best.

442
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.030
I'm the best player anybody's ever seen in my tiny little area.

443
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.430
And then you put them in the big pond.

444
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:23.390
I with some of the professional players and they just, they get nothing.

445
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.940
You know, they wind up not being able to land a shot.

446
00:24:25.941 --> 00:24:27.530
There is that much difference.

447
00:24:27.531 --> 00:24:31.130
Of course you see that in everything martial arts where you get the the Dojo

448
00:24:31.131 --> 00:24:35.000
hero in one place that then goes in and actually rolls with a professional and

449
00:24:35.001 --> 00:24:37.520
just finds out that they weren't all they thought they were.

450
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:39.890
And there's even more layers of that in games abuse.

451
00:24:39.891 --> 00:24:43.400
You're not so confined to some of the physical limits of the human body. Yeah.

452
00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:47.750
And the amount of time you can do it is not confined to the physical limits of

453
00:24:47.751 --> 00:24:48.260
the human body.

454
00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.770
So there's people out there playing 10 12 hours a day with their thinking and

455
00:24:51.771 --> 00:24:54.080
sleeping and dreaming and you know,

456
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.840
catching people with real shots in the middle of the air. Yeah.

457
00:24:56.841 --> 00:24:58.820
That sense when you're obsessive about something,

458
00:24:58.821 --> 00:25:00.590
how it does invade your dreams.

459
00:25:00.591 --> 00:25:04.750
And there've been a number of times in my career when I'm learning new things,

460
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.940
when I'm just immersed in, whether it's a new programming paradigm,

461
00:25:07.941 --> 00:25:09.350
a new piece of technology,

462
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.450
and I'm working 13 something hours in a day and I go to sleep and I have dreams

463
00:25:14.451 --> 00:25:15.470
about what I'm working on.

464
00:25:15.471 --> 00:25:18.650
That's when I know I'm really deep in the groove of soaking in this new

465
00:25:18.651 --> 00:25:22.970
information and the dreaming is my mind helping synthesize this into a useful

466
00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:26.300
form so I can apply this in the future. And those are some things that I,

467
00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:27.410
I look back on very,

468
00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:31.490
very fondly when I've been that obsessive about something that it's soaked into

469
00:25:31.491 --> 00:25:35.060
my dreams. Yeah. I used to get though with martial arts when I was competing,

470
00:25:35.061 --> 00:25:37.190
I would, I would throw kicks in the middle of the night.

471
00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.810
I would have like dreams like moving and I'd wake up like, you know,

472
00:25:41.811 --> 00:25:45.680
and like thinking that I was in the middle of the fight and I had a real problem

473
00:25:45.681 --> 00:25:49.700
when we, you know, we have this a land room set up here with quake on it.

474
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.650
And when we got into it where my addiction got re sparked again,

475
00:25:54.651 --> 00:25:56.870
we were playing two, three, four hours a day.

476
00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.080
I was starting to have quick dreams. It was really weird.

477
00:26:00.081 --> 00:26:03.830
Like I don't have dreams that I was going down corners and a dodge and rockets

478
00:26:03.831 --> 00:26:08.030
and assist. That game is so immersive and it's so, um,

479
00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:13.250
you get done with it and your heart is pounding like me and Jamie and Jeff would

480
00:26:13.251 --> 00:26:14.380
play. And then when,

481
00:26:14.381 --> 00:26:18.590
when it was over we would all be out of breath with all our heart would be

482
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:18.921
raced.

483
00:26:18.921 --> 00:26:22.460
We'd have to get up and walk around would be like Jesus tried to shake it off.

484
00:26:22.461 --> 00:26:25.610
That's one of the real interesting things that gets amplified even more in

485
00:26:25.611 --> 00:26:27.890
virtual reality. Where I,

486
00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:31.430
when I was doing a bunch of the work on bringing Minecraft into the gear VR

487
00:26:31.431 --> 00:26:35.390
system, I am, I played a bunch and I would play with my family and it's,

488
00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:35.571
you know,

489
00:26:35.571 --> 00:26:39.020
it's great when you can have your kids playing with you and I would have the VR

490
00:26:39.021 --> 00:26:44.010
headset on that'd be plaguing my swivel chair turning around. I running and I

491
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.930
<v 1>had this really weird sense where there were times that I would remember that</v>

492
00:26:48.931 --> 00:26:51.720
not as I was playing a game, but I remembered being there.

493
00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:55.520
I remembered like being in that cavern and breaking through into [inaudible]

494
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.790
into a raining sky or I have, you know, having the creeper run up behind me.

495
00:26:59.791 --> 00:27:02.490
And it was not the sense that I remembered playing a video game.

496
00:27:02.491 --> 00:27:06.450
I remembered being there. And that's, that's the power of VR.

497
00:27:06.451 --> 00:27:11.451
And in many ways we don't have as intense of action games like quake in VR,

498
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:16.440
partially because there's a movement control problem where in VR you're fine as

499
00:27:16.441 --> 00:27:19.590
long as you're moving in the virtual world the same way your body is in the real

500
00:27:19.591 --> 00:27:20.424
world. Uh,

501
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.430
but if you would go ahead and play the traditional game like quake and you were

502
00:27:23.431 --> 00:27:25.230
moving your mouse to spin you around,

503
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:28.610
you would get really sick to your stomach quickly because, uh,

504
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.090
parts of your inner ear,

505
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:35.150
I detect motion of your physical body and your brain correlates what your eyes

506
00:27:35.431 --> 00:27:39.240
are seeing with what your inner ear is telling you. And when they disagree,

507
00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.160
that's what causes simulator sickness.

508
00:27:41.161 --> 00:27:44.670
Now some of the theories are that that's your brain saying you ate something

509
00:27:44.671 --> 00:27:47.940
that's really bad for you and you should get sick and throw it up.

510
00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:53.700
But this idea that you can't play traditionally like that in VR unless you've

511
00:27:53.701 --> 00:27:57.300
just got an absolute iron stomach. So a things like that,

512
00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.540
that they're dashing down corridors flipping around. I am corners,

513
00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:02.580
you don't do very well in VR,

514
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:07.230
but things where you can either stand still or move sort of in a straight line,

515
00:28:07.231 --> 00:28:11.090
as long as there's no acceleration, the worst things are sort of parabolic arcs.

516
00:28:11.091 --> 00:28:15.300
So rocket jumping and stuff in quake is bad news in VR.

517
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:19.200
It's still pretty amazing when you go do it, but you do it too many times.

518
00:28:19.201 --> 00:28:19.591
No Way.

519
00:28:19.591 --> 00:28:23.100
You're doing that for a three hour stretch there without having some problems

520
00:28:23.101 --> 00:28:27.930
with it. So what you're saying in terms of the inner ear and the visual,

521
00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.730
uh, w w what you're taking individually is that when those things are off,

522
00:28:32.731 --> 00:28:36.720
your brain thinks maybe you consume poison and that's why they're off. Yeah,

523
00:28:36.721 --> 00:28:40.710
that's one of the theories because it makes your stomach upset and people do

524
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.600
throw up sometimes if you've been,

525
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:46.230
if you've people used to do that even just with traditional video games where I

526
00:28:46.231 --> 00:28:49.710
remember in the early days I, in the early days of quake and doom,

527
00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:53.640
some people would be staring intently enough at the screen and they would get

528
00:28:53.641 --> 00:28:58.380
that sense where on a small monitor it's usually not a problem because I am

529
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.670
usually you see the rest of the stable world around you and the field of view

530
00:29:02.671 --> 00:29:03.241
that you pick.

531
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:06.750
Like traditionally we used about a 90 degree field of view in the old days and

532
00:29:06.751 --> 00:29:08.010
if you have a little monitor here,

533
00:29:08.011 --> 00:29:11.760
it's really only taking maybe 25 degrees or so of your field of view,

534
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.530
so your brain doesn't really buy it.

535
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:16.230
As I'm looking into a window in this other world,

536
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.320
you're still kind of controlling something and driving it around.

537
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:22.740
But when you get a giant screen and you get the field of view about right,

538
00:29:22.741 --> 00:29:24.870
then your brain starts picking up and saying, oh,

539
00:29:24.871 --> 00:29:27.120
maybe I should be paying attention to this visuals.

540
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.100
And that could cause some people to have,

541
00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:31.800
I get simulator sickness even on a screen.

542
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.520
But in VR where it's covering your entire field of view and you don't have a

543
00:29:35.521 --> 00:29:38.260
stable reference, it can be a much bigger problem.

544
00:29:38.261 --> 00:29:42.370
So we have some of these bandaids where people start would put cages of things

545
00:29:42.371 --> 00:29:45.520
in virtual reality, so you've at least got something stable to look at.

546
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:46.840
And that helps a little bit.

547
00:29:46.841 --> 00:29:50.650
Like there's a game called Omega agent where you're flying around in a jet pack

548
00:29:50.651 --> 00:29:54.190
and on the one hand this is the worst thing to do in VR, parabolic flight.

549
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.040
It checks all the, don't do this in VR buttons,

550
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:00.850
but it's still really amazingly cool to just jet pack up and kind of coast

551
00:30:00.851 --> 00:30:04.450
around down things. So sometimes you're making these trade offs with your body.

552
00:30:04.451 --> 00:30:09.400
On the VR experiences. I, we try to push people towards the no tradeoff games.

553
00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:10.540
Okay. You can sit here,

554
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:13.570
you can do this amazing thing and there's no downside to it.

555
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.360
But for the adventurous, there are these other things you can do,

556
00:30:16.361 --> 00:30:20.360
which might be exactly what hits the right buttons for you. But, uh,

557
00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.940
you may suffer some for it.

558
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:25.750
Do you guys take into account the possibility of people getting sick and suing?

559
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:29.320
Cause I think you kind of have to, right? So there's a lot of,

560
00:30:29.321 --> 00:30:34.180
I what we were more concerned about health and safety wise is on the new system

561
00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.930
where you can walk around is, you know, people banging into walls,

562
00:30:37.931 --> 00:30:41.980
falling down steps and so on. So we spent a lot of effort building this.

563
00:30:41.981 --> 00:30:44.650
We call it the Guardian system. When you start up,

564
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.640
you basically trace out what you say, the safe areas, and that's on you.

565
00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:53.200
If you trace out the safe area over your staircase, I am, you know,

566
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:57.820
bad things can happen. But the ideas that I am, it has a known good area.

567
00:30:57.821 --> 00:31:01.090
It knows where you are. So it will tell you I,

568
00:31:01.091 --> 00:31:03.580
it'll bring up this little overlay to show you that hey,

569
00:31:03.581 --> 00:31:06.100
you're approaching a wall. Do not be charging headlong.

570
00:31:06.101 --> 00:31:09.790
Now people should not be sprinting in VR under almost any circumstances,

571
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:13.780
but you do wind up getting into the action on things and something jumps sits

572
00:31:13.781 --> 00:31:15.970
behind you, startles you, and you jump around.

573
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.610
So you need a reasonable amount of space to do these.

574
00:31:18.611 --> 00:31:21.610
We call them room-scale games where you're actually walking around.

575
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.520
There's a lot of them that are stationary that you're expected to pretty much

576
00:31:24.521 --> 00:31:25.354
stand still.

577
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:28.930
But there's some amazing experiences about being able to clear out a room,

578
00:31:28.931 --> 00:31:33.790
walk around and just not be on task as far as hyper aware,

579
00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:37.180
but just being able to soak in a space and kind of crouch down and look at

580
00:31:37.181 --> 00:31:37.830
things.

581
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:42.040
And I always like to say that modern games have so much artistry put into them

582
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:46.540
that is largely wasted or lost on the players where you have the fire

583
00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:50.650
extinguisher sitting in the corner that some artists lovingly crafted for a week

584
00:31:50.651 --> 00:31:53.410
and you just glance at it, see the pixels and move on.

585
00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:57.100
But in VR you wind up saying, it's like, oh, I'm in this room,

586
00:31:57.101 --> 00:31:59.320
I'm looking at this. You read, you know, lean down.

587
00:31:59.321 --> 00:32:03.010
Or even pick something up and turn it around and look at it. And you know,

588
00:32:03.011 --> 00:32:03.910
and that's really great,

589
00:32:03.911 --> 00:32:08.911
but the larger spaces have these hazards and it turns out that it's hard to

590
00:32:09.041 --> 00:32:13.420
protect people from themselves in some cases because we started saying, well,

591
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.810
what if somebody's swinging their hand really hard? I am. You know, we don't,

592
00:32:16.811 --> 00:32:19.780
we want them to be able to stop their hand and even if we show when the hand is

593
00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:21.640
really close to it, they're not going to have time.

594
00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.920
So we put in this predictive filter to say,

595
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:26.440
based on the velocity of how fast you're moving your hand,

596
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:30.520
maybe we'll start showing up the boundary a second earlier if we think you're

597
00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:33.100
going to hit it in a second, we'll show the boundary now.

598
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:35.500
But then everybody says, oh, I don't want that flashing up.

599
00:32:35.501 --> 00:32:39.040
It's distracting me and we need to put in parameters to turn it down.

600
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.640
It's a real balancing act.

601
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.660
There were a lot of developers just kind of go in and say, turn off Guardian,

602
00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.930
I'll accept the risks for this. But I yes,

603
00:32:47.931 --> 00:32:50.840
of course the lawyers are very concerned for this. We have a,

604
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.960
we have some duty of care to the people that are our customers. I,

605
00:32:53.961 --> 00:32:57.950
there are some interesting youtube videos of people playing VR,

606
00:32:57.951 --> 00:33:01.340
not setting things up right. In like running into walls and so on.

607
00:33:01.341 --> 00:33:05.840
And even internally it's, I am, if you don't set it up right, if you,

608
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.510
uh, if you extend it further than you should,

609
00:33:08.511 --> 00:33:11.930
there are people that have smacked their knuckles into a table or something and

610
00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.210
kind of post the bloody knuckles picture from that.

611
00:33:14.211 --> 00:33:16.970
But it's on you on how conservative you want to be with it.

612
00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.000
It was interesting when I stepped outside of the, what is it called?

613
00:33:20.001 --> 00:33:23.680
The Guardian. Yeah. Whatever it is a, the, the, the,

614
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:27.320
the matrix that shows up and you, you walk through,

615
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:29.300
then you see the regular world.

616
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.330
Like you step out of the virtual world and you're into the regular world,

617
00:33:32.331 --> 00:33:36.070
but you're seeing it through this weird lens. Yeah. So it's I am,

618
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:38.570
it's black and white because it's using the same cameras.

619
00:33:38.571 --> 00:33:42.230
Like on the quest there are four cameras that I am are pointed off in different

620
00:33:42.231 --> 00:33:44.930
directions and they have two jobs to do. They,

621
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:48.290
they track where the headset is by looking at the world around it.

622
00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:52.520
They find stable little pieces of the world and based on where they are as you

623
00:33:52.521 --> 00:33:53.270
move around,

624
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:56.390
it can figure out where the headset is and then they also look at the

625
00:33:56.391 --> 00:34:00.710
controllers and the controllers have little invisible ear LEDs on it. I am,

626
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:03.740
but it takes this black and white image of the world from the four different

627
00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:08.270
views and it can pass through the real world. It's pretty low. Rez,

628
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.830
I doesn't have color,

629
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:12.740
but it's good enough for important things like finding where you put your

630
00:34:12.741 --> 00:34:17.150
controllers and letting you Orient Yourself because depending on what you do in

631
00:34:17.151 --> 00:34:17.481
VR,

632
00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:21.440
if you spend a couple hours in an environment where you're turning around and

633
00:34:21.441 --> 00:34:24.290
moving, it can be very shocking to people when they,

634
00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:28.190
I sort of come out of it and they, they're in the opposite corner of the room.

635
00:34:28.191 --> 00:34:31.430
They thought they should be either pointed in a different direction.

636
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.300
I having the ability to kind of bring the world into place,

637
00:34:35.301 --> 00:34:38.450
especially in those cases where you're approaching the boundaries is a,

638
00:34:38.451 --> 00:34:39.284
it's nice.

639
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:44.510
Is there anything that you guys have that can or maybe in the future can map out

640
00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.560
uneven terrain?

641
00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:49.310
Like say if you were at a park and there was a hill or in your backyard or

642
00:34:49.311 --> 00:34:53.480
something like that. We have various sort of surfaces.

643
00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:57.760
You have a sidewalk and then grass than a hill. Is there ever go, there's,

644
00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:01.760
there's a few aspects to that you can set up really large.

645
00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:05.480
I am guardian boundaries. We do have an upper limit on it. I,

646
00:35:05.481 --> 00:35:09.410
but again some developers have disabled that to do even larger areas and one of

647
00:35:09.411 --> 00:35:14.360
the coolest experiences that I had was at a convention last year and artists had

648
00:35:14.361 --> 00:35:18.050
made a basically a VR sculpture that was really big.

649
00:35:18.051 --> 00:35:20.190
It was like 50 feet long. I am,

650
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:25.070
you are inside this kind of aquarium looking thing in a workshop and we sketched

651
00:35:25.071 --> 00:35:29.600
out this giant boundary and I walked around like I walked literally from room to

652
00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:31.340
room in virtual reality. Again,

653
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:35.000
very few people have the space to set something like this up in their house,

654
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:39.360
but we were at a convention center and the ability to walk through a door in

655
00:35:39.361 --> 00:35:40.380
virtual reality,

656
00:35:40.381 --> 00:35:43.770
get down on my hands and knees and crawl through a crawl space into another

657
00:35:43.771 --> 00:35:46.770
magical little area. That was really something,

658
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.010
I mean it's not clear how we can carry that over to other people,

659
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.190
but the idea of doing it outside I am.

660
00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:57.960
There's a few technical issues with it where bright sunlight overpowers the

661
00:35:57.961 --> 00:35:59.940
little tiny LEDs on the controllers.

662
00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:04.260
So while it's possible to sort of stop down the exposure on the cameras for

663
00:36:04.261 --> 00:36:06.840
tracking the headset, if it's reasonably bright,

664
00:36:06.841 --> 00:36:08.700
you're not going to be able to resolve the controllers,

665
00:36:08.701 --> 00:36:09.840
which breaks some things.

666
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:14.220
But people have found that if you get the right overcast day I am and you've got

667
00:36:14.221 --> 00:36:15.090
the right environment,

668
00:36:15.091 --> 00:36:19.170
you can go out to a like a tennis court or a or a big field or something,

669
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.680
stretch out a large boundary and explore some fairly sizable things now really

670
00:36:24.691 --> 00:36:27.660
accurate determination of the world.

671
00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:32.700
Facebook reality labs has done a lot of research for almost what is the absolute

672
00:36:32.701 --> 00:36:36.390
limit of what we could possibly do with the sensors for building the most

673
00:36:36.391 --> 00:36:40.740
accurate representation of the world and it's pretty damn good when you get to

674
00:36:40.741 --> 00:36:43.440
the point where they could take off in a really cluttered room like this,

675
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:48.480
scan the world for all of this and they could make a real 3d representation so

676
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:51.900
you could then be good enough that I can go ahead and pick up individual things

677
00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:54.140
here, but it's still a,

678
00:36:54.141 --> 00:36:56.610
it's pretty expensive to do that both in terms of the needs,

679
00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.880
some slightly different sensors they have to project more structured light out

680
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.370
into the world. It takes a lot more calculation to do it.

681
00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:05.010
It's too much for this generation of products here,

682
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:07.950
but certainly that's something that we're looking at in the future where

683
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:11.370
eventually we want to not have that one step of drawing out the Guardian.

684
00:37:11.371 --> 00:37:12.690
You just want it to be both.

685
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:16.380
I am sensible enough that it can tell what's going on in the environment and

686
00:37:16.381 --> 00:37:19.890
sort of smart enough to tell what's a hazard because you want that magic of you

687
00:37:19.891 --> 00:37:23.760
just put it on, it does everything and it just works. We're not there yet,

688
00:37:23.761 --> 00:37:26.940
but that is sort of on the roadmap for where we want to go.

689
00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:32.120
So you think there will be a time where the technology will allow you to maybe

690
00:37:32.911 --> 00:37:35.640
possibly have several filter layers,

691
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.750
like you can see the whole world and it would be more of an augmented reality

692
00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:44.550
toward sort of a situation or the whole world disappears and then it could be

693
00:37:44.551 --> 00:37:47.760
virtual. Yeah. So there's, we have a lot of debates about,

694
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:51.630
I am both the useful things that you might do there and then some real technical

695
00:37:51.631 --> 00:37:54.360
aspects where in terms of augmented reality,

696
00:37:54.361 --> 00:37:57.870
this idea that we all buy into this future vision of a world where you've got

697
00:37:57.871 --> 00:38:01.680
something that's the s you know the fields like sunglasses that you put on and

698
00:38:01.681 --> 00:38:04.920
you can pull up all your information and maybe it clouds over into a virtual

699
00:38:04.921 --> 00:38:06.870
experience. There are still,

700
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:11.970
I'm fundamentally unsolved problems in display technology to do the magic thing

701
00:38:11.971 --> 00:38:15.450
that we would really like from all of that. So you step back to saying that,

702
00:38:15.451 --> 00:38:18.450
well what you saw in quest when you saw the world through that,

703
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.540
obviously it's low Rez, it's low frame rate, it's not good,

704
00:38:21.541 --> 00:38:24.420
but we could fix all of that. You could say let's go higher rez color,

705
00:38:24.421 --> 00:38:26.730
high refresh rate and you could make a,

706
00:38:26.731 --> 00:38:30.540
we'd call that a pass through rather than a see-through augmented reality system

707
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:34.050
and we could absolutely build that technology and we could make that pretty

708
00:38:34.051 --> 00:38:38.110
good. But it comes down to what do we expect sort of the user story to be.

709
00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:41.840
If you had something like that I would you be wearing this boxy thing out,

710
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.740
you know, out into the world, riding the bus with it, doing different things.

711
00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:49.540
We have a little bit of a hard time seeing the kind of socially acceptable way

712
00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:53.230
that you're running around going about your life with sort of the shoe box size

713
00:38:53.231 --> 00:38:56.950
thing on your head. It's an open question where everybody agrees.

714
00:38:56.951 --> 00:38:58.420
If it came down to sunglasses,

715
00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.730
everybody in the world is going to want something like that.

716
00:39:00.731 --> 00:39:04.120
If it gives them these magical abilities and it can turn into virtual reality or

717
00:39:04.121 --> 00:39:08.200
augmented reality. It's an open question whether there's an in between layer.

718
00:39:08.201 --> 00:39:12.460
If we get down to the point where it's something like swim goggles or very thin,

719
00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:14.590
I'm sort of ski goggles,

720
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:18.250
something that's half or a quarter of the volume of what we've got here.

721
00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:22.720
Would that be something that people would want to wear for long periods of the

722
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:27.550
day? I lean towards no, but we haven't built it so we don't know yet. I am.

723
00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.180
And then the question of what you want to do with that in the augmented reality

724
00:39:31.181 --> 00:39:34.800
world where people make these interesting little demos where, all right,

725
00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:37.840
we've mapped the world in this incredible detail and now we can flood it with

726
00:39:37.841 --> 00:39:40.840
water. We can do a simulation of all of this. Isn't this cool?

727
00:39:40.841 --> 00:39:42.930
Or we can turn it into a,

728
00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.660
we can reskin your world as Bilbo Baggins hobbit hole or something.

729
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:51.990
And I am skeptical of the broad utility of a lot of these things where like

730
00:39:52.991 --> 00:39:56.110
today there's a ton of Ar apps that you can get on your cell phone.

731
00:39:56.111 --> 00:39:59.140
You can hold your phone up and kind of look at things and interesting little

732
00:39:59.141 --> 00:40:00.310
things happen. Well,

733
00:40:00.311 --> 00:40:03.940
Pokemon go is an interesting thing where that actually has more of a point for

734
00:40:03.941 --> 00:40:06.970
it. And the augmented reality side of it is very small,

735
00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:09.760
but the things that actually augment onto the world,

736
00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.450
I haven't seen anything that I, that I've found really compelling.

737
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.110
They're interesting technologies, but I think that the, I'm,

738
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.730
I'm still betting more on the fully immersive experiences where you take over

739
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:24.820
and this idea of bringing part of it into the world.

740
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:29.020
I'm a little more skeptical on, but I don't know how it's gonna play out.

741
00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:33.910
Well that's the concept behind magic leap, right? Yeah. And magic leap was very,

742
00:40:33.911 --> 00:40:35.560
very hyped up a couple of years ago,

743
00:40:35.561 --> 00:40:39.700
but it hasn't really come to fruition yet in terms of like a consumer product

744
00:40:39.701 --> 00:40:40.840
that people could, I mean,

745
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:44.170
remember the little girl and there was a ballerina that was dancing on her hand

746
00:40:44.171 --> 00:40:45.640
and it was like, is this going to happen?

747
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:50.290
So the problem with magic leap was they had a lot of the augmented reality

748
00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.580
videos. I,

749
00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.670
you wind up with things that are synthetically created and they're not really

750
00:40:54.671 --> 00:40:59.170
what the product does. And they oversell what they, the actual capabilities are.

751
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.100
And that's a slippery slope there where you want to sell your vision in some way

752
00:41:03.101 --> 00:41:04.420
and you know, you're really,

753
00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.390
you're very rarely showing exactly what the product does,

754
00:41:07.391 --> 00:41:11.200
but they showed something that led people to believe it was much more than it

755
00:41:11.201 --> 00:41:13.390
actually was. But even before magically,

756
00:41:13.391 --> 00:41:17.410
Microsoft had been selling the Holo Lens for a few years and it's turned out

757
00:41:17.411 --> 00:41:19.330
that they have some real wins in,

758
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:24.400
I've in some enterprise applications for training and for people like working on

759
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:28.900
jet engines and stuff where it's an expensive product and costs thousands of

760
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.170
dollars for these things, you're not going to spend that to get a,

761
00:41:32.171 --> 00:41:35.510
it's got a fairly narrow field of view. It's not a great gaming experience.

762
00:41:35.511 --> 00:41:37.370
They have a few things that you can do with that.

763
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.370
But if it's something that helps you do your job and you're a high paid

764
00:41:40.371 --> 00:41:44.030
specialist for something, it's a tool. You know, it's something that, uh,

765
00:41:44.031 --> 00:41:45.290
that has value there.

766
00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:49.370
But that's the state that we are in with ar today where there are some devices

767
00:41:49.371 --> 00:41:52.640
that are providing some legitimate value, but they are essentially,

768
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:54.380
they're like socket wrenches.

769
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:57.680
There are tool you get when you need to do a specific job where the world that

770
00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:59.060
we want to be in is,

771
00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:02.690
it's something you put on and it's essentially a part of you where I want

772
00:42:02.691 --> 00:42:06.770
something where I roll out of bed instead of grabbing my normal see-through

773
00:42:06.771 --> 00:42:07.431
glasses,

774
00:42:07.431 --> 00:42:10.970
I grabbed my augmented reality glasses and then they do something useful for me

775
00:42:10.971 --> 00:42:15.320
for 16 hours and that's where, you know, two hours is not enough.

776
00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.340
We have a few of, uh,

777
00:42:16.341 --> 00:42:19.730
there's a few companies that have made things that are sunglasses form factor

778
00:42:19.731 --> 00:42:23.660
that can do some little things with a display but they run out of battery very

779
00:42:23.661 --> 00:42:24.494
quickly.

780
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:28.220
But you want something that you can use all day long and if it becomes something

781
00:42:28.221 --> 00:42:32.210
that is so automatic, like cell phones or augmentations of our power right now,

782
00:42:32.211 --> 00:42:36.290
the fact that we can go look anything up a super quickly if you have that

783
00:42:36.291 --> 00:42:39.800
ability and it doesn't even mean pulling your phone out of your pocket if you

784
00:42:39.801 --> 00:42:44.630
can access information, I adjust by potentially even just thinking about it.

785
00:42:44.631 --> 00:42:49.520
I mean there is work serious work going on about brain computer interfaces where

786
00:42:49.521 --> 00:42:54.521
you could imagine having these glasses and even if it was all it did was say

787
00:42:54.681 --> 00:42:56.930
zooming in, say it was just supervision.

788
00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:02.080
If you had the ability to just think zoom and it would zoom in for something

789
00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:03.950
that would be a product right there.

790
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:07.670
It could grow into this augment to the world and annotate everything and do all

791
00:43:07.671 --> 00:43:08.810
of that other stuff later.

792
00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.860
But I'm a believer that this a sense of giving you a new power,

793
00:43:12.861 --> 00:43:17.450
giving you a new physical ability and either it needs to be ultra intuitive.

794
00:43:17.451 --> 00:43:21.440
I mean maybe there is something where I'm just tapping your wrist or some super,

795
00:43:21.441 --> 00:43:25.450
super fast low latency interaction. But ideal would be something like I,

796
00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.900
you know, brain computer interface.

797
00:43:26.901 --> 00:43:30.410
Maybe it's some eye tracking or even teeth clicking or something that you could

798
00:43:30.411 --> 00:43:30.591
do.

799
00:43:30.591 --> 00:43:34.640
But if it just became so natural that just like you think you turn your head to

800
00:43:34.641 --> 00:43:35.510
go look at something,

801
00:43:35.511 --> 00:43:39.470
if you just do this thing and you zoom in on it and you get more information,

802
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:43.280
that would be pretty magical. That sense of augmenting human capability.

803
00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.430
Have you paid attention to the Ceylon Mosque neurolink thing?

804
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:48.320
So I actually went out to visit the neuron,

805
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:51.890
the link company I was like the week before they did their big public

806
00:43:51.891 --> 00:43:55.250
announcement and I spent a whole day there kind of deep diving with a bunch of

807
00:43:55.251 --> 00:43:59.540
their technical people and it is exciting stuff because it is,

808
00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:00.723
you know, I,

809
00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:04.310
I like to use the word bold for things like that where it's not just this

810
00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.830
incremental advance where it's just taking something,

811
00:44:06.831 --> 00:44:08.690
fixing a few of the flaws and going out.

812
00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:13.960
It is visionary looking to the future where the potential upside of this,

813
00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:18.950
about being able to make the whole automated electronic world,

814
00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:24.160
something that is directly accessible on both input and output to your brain is

815
00:44:24.861 --> 00:44:29.060
really remarkable. And I what they've done,

816
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:31.040
I mean there's a lot of people where you can say it's like,

817
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:33.660
well other companies might have these capabilities. I,

818
00:44:33.661 --> 00:44:36.370
but clearly they are at the cutting edge. I've,

819
00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:39.780
you could argue how far above or or behind other companies they might be,

820
00:44:39.781 --> 00:44:44.580
but I think it's going to largely work to some degree here and they're going to

821
00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:46.590
be working with people that are like seizure patients,

822
00:44:46.591 --> 00:44:51.591
people that are in many cases profoundly disabled and they don't expect it's

823
00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.720
going to work forever when they put it in there.

824
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.320
All these problems with the brain,

825
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:59.160
I kind of rejecting implants eventually and there are people who've done

826
00:44:59.161 --> 00:45:02.820
experiments like this for quite a while. It starts off with just one neuron.

827
00:45:02.821 --> 00:45:07.350
You stick in one sensor or one actuator and in the neurolink case,

828
00:45:07.351 --> 00:45:10.560
now they've got tens of thousands that they can put in so much,

829
00:45:10.561 --> 00:45:15.390
much higher fidelity even if it doesn't work forever and they're still working

830
00:45:15.391 --> 00:45:20.220
out the different, uh, the coatings tactics, different installation procedures.

831
00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:21.443
I,

832
00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:25.950
somebody is going to go in there and be go from being profoundly disabled to

833
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.200
probably being able to play a video game. You know,

834
00:45:28.201 --> 00:45:32.760
being able to sort of directly control things with your mind where you start off

835
00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.050
being able to do maybe just very slowly driving a cursor and people have done

836
00:45:37.051 --> 00:45:40.710
this again for years where you can slowly move a mouse cursor or something and

837
00:45:40.711 --> 00:45:41.850
figure out a click thing.

838
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.910
But here when you have tens of thousands of neurons going in,

839
00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:50.180
you could go from this very slow moving something to doing this deep analog

840
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:51.301
multi-dimensional,

841
00:45:51.301 --> 00:45:55.260
like playing a symphony with your brain output potentially and then potentially

842
00:45:55.261 --> 00:45:59.550
feeding information in in a way that we can't right now that you could have this

843
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:03.750
sort of tactile feel to it. Do you remember lawnmower man? Yeah.

844
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:07.340
Vaguely goes, yeah. I've talked to myself sometime.

845
00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:10.170
I should go back and watch that because I literally have not watched that since

846
00:46:10.171 --> 00:46:14.190
it came out when I was a teenager and the VR is laughable at this point and

847
00:46:14.191 --> 00:46:17.430
everything, but it should be good for a chuckle. Well, it was a con,

848
00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:18.720
I think it was a clunky movie,

849
00:46:18.721 --> 00:46:23.280
but the idea was based on a Stephen King Book and the Stephen King Book where

850
00:46:23.281 --> 00:46:28.281
there was a guy who was sort of slow and they did something to him and all of a

851
00:46:29.221 --> 00:46:32.490
sudden he became some super genius, almost godlike character.

852
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:37.970
Like if this neurolink stuff does work and you can take a person with profound

853
00:46:38.551 --> 00:46:41.820
disabilities and all of a sudden they become the smartest human beings on the

854
00:46:41.821 --> 00:46:43.920
planet. That would be really weird.

855
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:49.200
So I know that was one of the pitches that Ellen was making early on that Elon

856
00:46:49.201 --> 00:46:53.820
is very concerned about artificial intelligence and part of neurolink was this

857
00:46:53.821 --> 00:46:54.930
pitch that, well,

858
00:46:54.931 --> 00:46:59.931
maybe we can supercharge humans in a way that the AI won't run away so far or we

859
00:47:00.181 --> 00:47:03.960
can at least interact with them on a more level playing field.

860
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:09.210
I am less, I am sanguine about that. I am, I am.

861
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:13.920
That seems a little bit more of a reach to me because I suspect that, okay,

862
00:47:13.921 --> 00:47:18.480
even if you do put a million neurons in when we're making artificial general

863
00:47:18.481 --> 00:47:22.170
intelligence is they're going to have billions and billions of these different

864
00:47:22.171 --> 00:47:23.004
connections.

865
00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:27.960
And I think that it might be many steps above what a human could be.

866
00:47:27.961 --> 00:47:31.240
But if AI becomes possible and takes off,

867
00:47:31.241 --> 00:47:34.000
and I am a believer in artificial general intelligence,

868
00:47:34.001 --> 00:47:36.250
I think it's probably not as far off as many,

869
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:41.550
many people believe that it is likely to be able to accelerate and advanced

870
00:47:42.131 --> 00:47:44.740
faster than even a neuro linked human would be able to.

871
00:47:44.741 --> 00:47:47.980
And how far would you think we are from artificial general intelligence?

872
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:52.090
So by nature I'm an optimist. I am, you know, I tend to,

873
00:47:52.091 --> 00:47:56.680
I do underestimate how long things take, but on the other hand, as a programmer,

874
00:47:56.681 --> 00:47:58.420
I've usually been able to say, well,

875
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:02.590
maybe I missed my estimate by 50% while everybody else blew it by 100% or

876
00:48:02.591 --> 00:48:05.650
something. I think that we will have,

877
00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:11.610
we will potentially have unclear signs of AGI maybe as soon as a decade from

878
00:48:11.711 --> 00:48:14.950
now. Wow. Now, lots of people disagree.

879
00:48:14.951 --> 00:48:18.070
The majority of scientists working on it think it's like, oh,

880
00:48:18.071 --> 00:48:19.840
it's going to be at least a few decades.

881
00:48:19.841 --> 00:48:22.840
And you still have a few holdouts that say, oh, it can't happen at all.

882
00:48:22.841 --> 00:48:25.360
But I'm a strict materialist. I think that, you know,

883
00:48:25.361 --> 00:48:29.770
our minds are just our body and action and there's no reason why we can't wind

884
00:48:29.771 --> 00:48:32.320
up simulating that in some way. I am.

885
00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.710
So I don't think the question of how far out,

886
00:48:35.711 --> 00:48:37.180
there's a lot of numbers that you can play.

887
00:48:37.181 --> 00:48:41.740
Like the brain has something like 85 billion neurons in it and the room,

888
00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:45.550
they have something like 10,000 connections between it and you can multiply

889
00:48:45.551 --> 00:48:49.810
those out and compare them to what we have in computer memory and processing

890
00:48:49.811 --> 00:48:52.720
time. And you can say that, yeah,

891
00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:54.970
within 10 years those curves should have crossed.

892
00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:59.500
But I would even go so far as to say most of those are probably not completely

893
00:48:59.501 --> 00:49:00.131
necessary.

894
00:49:00.131 --> 00:49:03.910
We know lots of biological systems like we understand the processing that goes

895
00:49:03.911 --> 00:49:07.900
on a lot in the visual side and we don't need nearly as many computer

896
00:49:07.901 --> 00:49:12.430
transistors as neurons that are used for processing some of those early layers.

897
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:17.790
So I suspect that even today some of the government supercomputers that the

898
00:49:17.981 --> 00:49:20.170
biggest, the top 500 lists that they have,

899
00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:23.530
those are remarkably,

900
00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:28.590
I probably useful for doing intel artificial intelligence work where for a long

901
00:49:28.601 --> 00:49:29.470
time, for decades,

902
00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:33.700
I thought that was sort of just I am national chess thumping the top 500

903
00:49:33.701 --> 00:49:37.810
computers because so many of them they relied on replacing what used to be the

904
00:49:37.811 --> 00:49:41.650
old big iron cray vector super computers and they really weren't very easy to

905
00:49:41.651 --> 00:49:43.510
program. Most programs people want to use,

906
00:49:43.511 --> 00:49:46.360
you can't run it on a supercomputer and just be a lot faster.

907
00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:50.650
One of the shocking things most people don't really appreciate is the fastest

908
00:49:50.651 --> 00:49:55.090
way to do most single threaded applications is an overclocked gaming computer.

909
00:49:55.091 --> 00:49:55.361
Today,

910
00:49:55.361 --> 00:50:00.100
you can't go spend $1 million and buy a computer that will do many tasks faster

911
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.700
than what you can just run on a gaming computer and this is not at all the way

912
00:50:03.701 --> 00:50:07.930
things were for decades where for a long time you would go spend your millions

913
00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:10.870
of dollars on a cray supercomputer and all of your code would run faster than

914
00:50:10.871 --> 00:50:14.330
anything you can get. But it turned out that the a,

915
00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:19.240
the processors that you wind up using in high end gaming systems are in many

916
00:50:19.241 --> 00:50:23.800
cases the fastest or in all cases at least close to us fast were certain serial

917
00:50:23.801 --> 00:50:26.980
applications. So the only thing else you can do is pile lots more of them.

918
00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:32.180
And these big computers are football field sized systems that are just racks and

919
00:50:32.181 --> 00:50:37.181
racks of GPU and CPU [inaudible] and nowadays for a long time I'd be like,

920
00:50:37.761 --> 00:50:38.930
well what would you, I would think,

921
00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:42.860
how could I make a faster quakemap build or something on one of those because we

922
00:50:42.861 --> 00:50:46.340
would sometimes have hours and hours spent processing this and I am,

923
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:51.370
at one point we had a computer that was almost in the top 500 I added software

924
00:50:51.771 --> 00:50:55.640
just for making our maps. I, but I looked at a lot of these supercomputers.

925
00:50:55.641 --> 00:50:58.940
I'm like, oh, these are terrible. Not very useful for what we want. I am.

926
00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:01.880
But now as I look at AI work, and I think that,

927
00:51:01.881 --> 00:51:04.130
well if you're just doing a whole bunch of these,

928
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.490
I kind of general matrix multiplies that computer right there.

929
00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:08.690
There's probably pretty good.

930
00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:13.720
So I would suspect that you could do something if we had the right algorithms,

931
00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.880
the right training schedule, and the right time to run through it,

932
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:22.150
that it's probably possible on some systems today and it'll just still take many

933
00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:25.580
years for the right algorithms to wind up being developed.

934
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:30.310
The right training regimens to be run and faster, cheaper hardware to wind it,

935
00:51:30.311 --> 00:51:34.340
making it more economical to run all the experiments because in so many cases

936
00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:37.340
the trick is not that the minimum requirements exist,

937
00:51:37.341 --> 00:51:40.880
but that a thousand people have thrown themselves at the wall of a problem.

938
00:51:40.881 --> 00:51:44.420
Most of them have bounced off and failed, but eventually somebody gets through.

939
00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:46.640
Now what about quantum computing?

940
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:50.840
Is that something that could potentially break the bottleneck that we have with

941
00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:52.580
Moore's law? So I don't,

942
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:56.090
I am not an expert on quantum computing and I think that I,

943
00:51:56.091 --> 00:51:59.390
as many times I beat myself up about it where there's some simulators online

944
00:51:59.391 --> 00:52:02.720
where you can go and work on it and I should work through the exercises of doing

945
00:52:02.721 --> 00:52:05.270
the basic factoring algorithms on quantum computing.

946
00:52:05.271 --> 00:52:10.271
But I know my read on it right now is that it's probably not directly useful for

947
00:52:10.701 --> 00:52:12.710
most of the artificial intelligence tasks.

948
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:16.790
The big things that people worry about that are for things like breaking

949
00:52:16.791 --> 00:52:17.690
cryptography,

950
00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:22.400
breaking the different hashing and encryption methods that it's possible that in

951
00:52:22.401 --> 00:52:26.000
many ways that's almost a terrible technology because it's a technology that

952
00:52:26.001 --> 00:52:28.850
doesn't solve so many of the problems that you'd like it to solve.

953
00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:32.600
And it does solve one of the problems you kind of wish nobody was able to solve.

954
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:36.640
I am so by breaking all of the encryption, you know,

955
00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:41.360
like if somebody winds up I with a quantum computer that they achieve quantum

956
00:52:41.361 --> 00:52:45.620
supremacy and it runs past all of our traditional computers and all of a sudden

957
00:52:45.621 --> 00:52:49.580
they can break all of the, all of the secure socket layer stuff,

958
00:52:49.581 --> 00:52:53.060
break everybody's signatures, impersonate any public key sign stuff.

959
00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:54.650
There's no upside to this.

960
00:52:54.651 --> 00:52:58.160
That's all downside and all bad things that are going to come from that while

961
00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:01.730
it's not going to make your video and coding go any faster and it's probably not

962
00:53:01.731 --> 00:53:04.040
going to help artificial intelligence in many ways.

963
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:09.410
So I haven't found a whole lot to get me really excited about quantum computing.

964
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:10.910
It may just be that.

965
00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:15.830
And with all of these cases why I beat myself up about not learning more about

966
00:53:15.831 --> 00:53:19.430
it because in most cases when presented with some capability,

967
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:22.640
there's some way to figure out how to apply it usefully to the things that you

968
00:53:22.641 --> 00:53:23.570
really want. In fact,

969
00:53:23.571 --> 00:53:26.520
I consider that almost the essence of engineering engineering

970
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:30.120
<v 0>is figuring out how to do what you want with what you've actually got and if</v>

971
00:53:30.121 --> 00:53:32.340
somebody gives, anytime somebody gives me new hardware,

972
00:53:32.341 --> 00:53:36.000
usually I can figure out some useful way to do things that I want with it,

973
00:53:36.001 --> 00:53:39.870
even if it's not immediately obvious and maybe quantum computing plays out that

974
00:53:39.871 --> 00:53:41.180
way, but I'm,

975
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:45.270
it is still definitely the domain of big labs with cryogenic cooling and all

976
00:53:45.271 --> 00:53:48.430
that stuff, so it just hasn't been at the top of my radar.

977
00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:53.690
Now when we talk about technology and you talk about the exponential increase in

978
00:53:55.381 --> 00:53:57.630
the powers of technology,

979
00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:03.050
is it possible that we could come to a point in time somewhere in the future

980
00:54:03.061 --> 00:54:08.061
where there's no way to encrypt anything where it's not possible to hide things

981
00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:11.580
where we won't be able to do banking online?

982
00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:16.110
We won't be able to have digital currency because virtually everyone will have

983
00:54:16.111 --> 00:54:21.111
access to all the information cause essentially digital currency or anything

984
00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:24.930
that's encrypted. It's just information, right? It's just ones and zeroes.

985
00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:29.850
Is it possible that technology will reach a point in time where borders and

986
00:54:29.851 --> 00:54:32.640
boundaries are impossible? So I,

987
00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:36.780
one thing that a lot of people don't appreciate about cryptography is there's a

988
00:54:36.781 --> 00:54:40.440
really straightforward way to make completely unbreakable cryptography and

989
00:54:40.441 --> 00:54:44.430
that's what's called a one time pad where if you essentially have, I'm,

990
00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:49.050
you know, a long, you know, a very long set of data and it's private,

991
00:54:49.051 --> 00:54:51.840
as long as nobody else has it, you can encrypt anything with it.

992
00:54:51.841 --> 00:54:54.750
And if it was generated randomly, properly, uh,

993
00:54:54.751 --> 00:54:57.810
you always have to worry about flaws in your random number generation or your

994
00:54:57.811 --> 00:55:02.520
random number source. But a properly generated one time pad is unbreakable.

995
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:03.810
Now the problem is it's finite.

996
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.920
So you have a fixed amount of it and all of the really serious spy craft would

997
00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:10.320
use something like that where you've got a onetime pad,

998
00:55:10.321 --> 00:55:11.580
you can send a message through it.

999
00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:13.620
In the old days when you were manually doing it,

1000
00:55:13.621 --> 00:55:17.220
you might only have a book with a certain number of pages and once it's over

1001
00:55:17.221 --> 00:55:20.100
it's gone and you can't get more without returning to base.

1002
00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:24.060
But this is always a possibility. And as we've seen,

1003
00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:25.740
storage density's increased so much.

1004
00:55:25.741 --> 00:55:29.370
The fact that you can get a little micro sim card that's holding hundreds of

1005
00:55:29.371 --> 00:55:32.100
gigabytes now, which is pretty remarkable.

1006
00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:36.690
You could imagine a world like if we did have this quantum apocalypse where all

1007
00:55:36.691 --> 00:55:40.200
of these short 512, 1024 bit keys, whatever,

1008
00:55:40.201 --> 00:55:44.790
all of those just get smashed irrevocably eye. You could imagine a world where,

1009
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.420
I mean heck, maybe people start implanting the one time pad inside people.

1010
00:55:48.421 --> 00:55:51.570
So whatever, you know, whatever you need to encrypt that's coming from you.

1011
00:55:51.571 --> 00:55:56.130
Has this, uh, you know, this clear unbreakable key that you're working with.

1012
00:55:56.490 --> 00:56:00.330
Do you think that we're going to have things implanted in our bodies soon that

1013
00:56:00.331 --> 00:56:03.930
allow you to interface with computers or technology or wireless Internet?

1014
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:07.860
I think that it's possible that it will. I am. It would,

1015
00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:11.340
we have people that want to do that right now. In fact, that wasn't,

1016
00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:16.140
she planted a Tesla chip in her arm so that she could just get close to her car

1017
00:56:16.141 --> 00:56:18.990
and the door would open. So in fact, one of the things that,

1018
00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:20.670
talking with the neuro link people,

1019
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.220
the idea that of course right now you start off, you say you take somebody

1020
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:27.640
<v 1>profoundly disabled and you put them in a laboratory and you try to train them</v>

1021
00:56:27.641 --> 00:56:29.920
how to use this. But we were all saying like, well,

1022
00:56:29.921 --> 00:56:32.500
what you really need is a programmer to get this interface,

1023
00:56:32.501 --> 00:56:36.460
you need to be able to let a programmer actually program themselves on their

1024
00:56:36.461 --> 00:56:40.600
interface and you will make a hundred times more progress than this, you know,

1025
00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:44.290
previously disabled person coming into the lab for a couple hours a day.

1026
00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:48.520
And it was funny the conversation there where one of their guys was like, yeah,

1027
00:56:48.521 --> 00:56:51.400
we'll give them the basic rule so they don't stroke themselves out. I'm like,

1028
00:56:51.401 --> 00:56:54.760
okay, yeah, that's kind of important. Talk about health and safety rules there.

1029
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:56.170
But I, yeah,

1030
00:56:56.171 --> 00:56:59.210
if you start getting a programmer in there that starts running this like,

1031
00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:02.320
all right, instead of just going through these basic exercises,

1032
00:57:02.321 --> 00:57:03.670
they run everybody through,

1033
00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:07.450
you really understand exactly what you're doing and you change it.

1034
00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:11.800
You write the code as you're experiencing it and there are probably people

1035
00:57:11.801 --> 00:57:15.220
volunteering that are ready to go do that. To have something like that.

1036
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:18.760
I read an article sometime after that about one of the early uh,

1037
00:57:18.761 --> 00:57:22.210
neurosurgeons that did implant himself with some electrodes.

1038
00:57:22.211 --> 00:57:27.211
He had to go to one of these eye fringe countries that didn't have any ethical

1039
00:57:27.521 --> 00:57:29.830
guidelines around the medical practices or whatever.

1040
00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:32.650
What everybody paid a neurosurgeon in one of those countries to implant an

1041
00:57:32.651 --> 00:57:36.310
electrode into his head and even had some complications afterwards and was like,

1042
00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:39.020
no, there's a dedicated researcher. Although interestingly there,

1043
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:42.670
there's the whole history of a lot of medical science where you would get people

1044
00:57:42.671 --> 00:57:46.720
that would wind up having the conviction to do the experiments on themselves and

1045
00:57:46.721 --> 00:57:50.150
you know, you've got to respect that where it's one thing to, you know,

1046
00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:53.710
make a grant proposal to set up a study to do all of this and it's another one

1047
00:57:53.711 --> 00:57:55.840
to say, damn it, I am so confident in this.

1048
00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:59.140
I'm going to have someone cut a hole in my skull and implant this in me so we

1049
00:57:59.141 --> 00:58:02.940
can learn the lessons. What was his complications? Do you remember? He had some,

1050
00:58:02.941 --> 00:58:06.010
I have some problems with speech afterwards. He had to learn how to do that.

1051
00:58:06.011 --> 00:58:09.700
Like half of his face had a little bit of a sag to it from the going get in

1052
00:58:09.701 --> 00:58:10.750
there. So yes,

1053
00:58:10.751 --> 00:58:15.670
it was life affecting changes as a result of going with that. And this wasn't,

1054
00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:18.580
I don't off hand I but it w this was,

1055
00:58:18.581 --> 00:58:21.280
it was a wired article I think from a number of years back,

1056
00:58:21.281 --> 00:58:22.890
but this was like a single electrode.

1057
00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:27.940
It was just doing very one bit or one analog value computation and he had a

1058
00:58:28.811 --> 00:58:31.630
little transponder kind of put in under the skin of his skull,

1059
00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:35.290
had a big lump on his head with that while interesting. Again,

1060
00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:36.310
the the neural link stuff,

1061
00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:40.450
all modern high tech where you kind of power it with RF through the skull and

1062
00:58:40.451 --> 00:58:41.950
it's got a little plug and I,

1063
00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:45.550
one of the first one you on first kind of approached me about,

1064
00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:48.940
I kind of talking with them about that. The idea and the thinking,

1065
00:58:48.941 --> 00:58:50.140
which was kind of insightful,

1066
00:58:50.141 --> 00:58:54.250
was this idea that the io levels that they were doing on the neuro link or they

1067
00:58:54.251 --> 00:58:57.610
were planning on doing with that was fairly close to what we do on virtual

1068
00:58:57.611 --> 00:58:59.350
reality where, okay,

1069
00:58:59.351 --> 00:59:04.030
we've got theoretically maybe up to a million inputs here and a million outputs

1070
00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:06.640
and I can run those numbers and say,

1071
00:59:06.641 --> 00:59:09.910
well that's kind of like the cameras that we're taking in and the display that

1072
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:12.760
we're, we're putting out. And I made the point that, well,

1073
00:59:12.761 --> 00:59:16.570
you probably could run that off of like a Qualcomm chip that we've got in here.

1074
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:20.080
You'd set it all up as like turn them into what are called MIPI lanes for the

1075
00:59:20.081 --> 00:59:22.980
input and output. Make the inputs look like a camera on,

1076
00:59:22.981 --> 00:59:24.950
make the outputs look like a display screen,

1077
00:59:24.951 --> 00:59:29.360
and you could then run software on something like what we use here to drive your

1078
00:59:29.361 --> 00:59:29.810
brain.

1079
00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:32.990
Like the programmer could then kind of start running some of those experiments

1080
00:59:32.991 --> 00:59:34.040
with it. Well,

1081
00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:38.060
it's so fascinating being on the outside watching all this stuff come to

1082
00:59:38.061 --> 00:59:42.350
fruition because I remember when virtual reality was sort of,

1083
00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:46.880
it was something that was tossed around in the 80s and we talked about the

1084
00:59:46.881 --> 00:59:50.750
future and that was one of the things that people were really concerned about or

1085
00:59:50.751 --> 00:59:53.300
looking forward to in the future was virtual reality,

1086
00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:56.630
but the technology really wasn't there. Yeah, so I have stories from,

1087
00:59:56.631 --> 01:00:01.130
in the early days I did software every game from Wolfen Stein, doom and quake.

1088
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:05.240
We had at least one VR entrepreneur that wanted to work with us.

1089
01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:08.180
I because finally here was content because they were like,

1090
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:09.920
everybody had this vision of VR.

1091
01:00:09.921 --> 01:00:13.790
Like it's this hazy vision of the future where cool stuff happens when you put

1092
01:00:13.791 --> 01:00:18.350
the helmet on. But they didn't have this concrete eye instantiation of like,

1093
01:00:18.351 --> 01:00:21.620
well what do you actually do? And then people saw the three d games is like, oh,

1094
01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:24.350
that's what you want to do inside the virtual reality helmet.

1095
01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:28.370
So they would come up and they'd want to basically work with us licensed the

1096
01:00:28.371 --> 01:00:31.400
technology and every time I looked at these and like, oh,

1097
01:00:31.401 --> 01:00:33.080
this is just isn't going to work out.

1098
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:36.980
I in many cases they were people that were very,

1099
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:41.450
they were high on enthusiasm but a little low on the raw technical necessities

1100
01:00:41.451 --> 01:00:44.390
to make something like this happen. Because really it was too early.

1101
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:47.750
I mean there were systems that if you had unlimited money,

1102
01:00:47.751 --> 01:00:52.460
you could get a big SGI, refrigerator sized infinite reality system, uh,

1103
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:54.680
that could render images. That could be interesting.

1104
01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:58.760
But people talk about the current resolution limits here are like the original,

1105
01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:01.220
the original dkone kind of the views for their,

1106
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.640
those headsets back then they were the resolution of,

1107
01:01:04.641 --> 01:01:06.110
remember the original Pixel doom.

1108
01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:08.960
I like three 20 by two 40 sort of resolutions there,

1109
01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:12.800
but wrapped around your head, somebody called them football sized pixels,

1110
01:01:12.801 --> 01:01:15.560
you know, like you've got this big blurry blob off to the side.

1111
01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:18.680
So it was never going to happen in those early days.

1112
01:01:18.681 --> 01:01:21.320
So we always made the point of saying, well, okay,

1113
01:01:21.321 --> 01:01:23.900
we'll license this stuff to you. But uh, you know,

1114
01:01:23.901 --> 01:01:27.140
I wouldn't put a dime of my investment money into something like that because I

1115
01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:28.490
just thought it was too early.

1116
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:32.540
And then here we are a couple of decades later and the future has arrived.

1117
01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:36.380
It seems like it was about a decade ago that people started really taking it

1118
01:01:36.381 --> 01:01:40.580
seriously again, we, where the technology had caught up to the vision. So it's,

1119
01:01:40.581 --> 01:01:42.110
I, I think that,

1120
01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:46.340
I think we can date all of it to the demo that I gave at [inaudible] I am,

1121
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:50.780
which had the doom three as the kind of running there because it was amazing

1122
01:01:50.781 --> 01:01:51.740
talking to people.

1123
01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:56.330
I got into it several months before that and I had this thought, okay,

1124
01:01:56.331 --> 01:01:58.460
I had just finished finished rage. Uh,

1125
01:01:58.490 --> 01:02:01.400
the last game that I had worked on there and I was like, all right,

1126
01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.590
between each project I would do research,

1127
01:02:03.591 --> 01:02:06.890
I would take a time to go ahead and explore some new technology,

1128
01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:10.940
whether it was in the game rendering or something related to it. And I thought,

1129
01:02:10.941 --> 01:02:14.570
well, virtual reality back in, I remember dealing with that in the 90s,

1130
01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:18.260
it's been 20 years surely they've sorted this out by now, you know,

1131
01:02:18.261 --> 01:02:20.820
it was a matter of the technology was terrible back then,

1132
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.810
but here we are closing in on a million times faster processors.

1133
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:28.950
Surely somebody just sorted this out and I was shocked when I went and I looked

1134
01:02:28.951 --> 01:02:31.800
through, I surveyed everything and it really wasn't,

1135
01:02:31.801 --> 01:02:35.040
there was a cottage industry of people that would serve basically department of

1136
01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:39.690
defense contracts that would make these very expensive systems that were,

1137
01:02:39.970 --> 01:02:44.220
you know, tens to in some cases like $150,000 for some of these big things.

1138
01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:46.890
And they weren't even very good. It was,

1139
01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:51.690
it was offensive to me as an engineer where I look at the capabilities of what's

1140
01:02:51.691 --> 01:02:55.620
possible. You know, I, I say this is our display, this is our processing,

1141
01:02:55.621 --> 01:02:57.930
these are our sensors. What is the limit?

1142
01:02:57.931 --> 01:03:00.390
I always talk about the speed of light calculations.

1143
01:03:00.391 --> 01:03:03.390
Like if everything was perfect, how good could it be?

1144
01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.220
And I could look at what we had and say,

1145
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:08.670
it could be a whole hell of a lot better than what we have here,

1146
01:03:08.671 --> 01:03:12.360
what people are shipping and that are charging these very high prices for it.

1147
01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:16.410
And so that was when I started cobbling things together myself. Uh, you know,

1148
01:03:16.411 --> 01:03:18.660
and that's what led to working with, uh, you know,

1149
01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:23.160
Palmer at the start of Oculus and led to where we are today. What year was that?

1150
01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.530
So 2011 in the first work. Think so recent. Yeah, that's crazy.

1151
01:03:28.531 --> 01:03:31.000
So, you know, less than a decade. And um,

1152
01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:36.080
now we have it down to a one wearable headset that sits on your head.

1153
01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:37.830
My,

1154
01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:42.830
my friend Dunkin's first unit was connected to a computer and you had cables

1155
01:03:42.841 --> 01:03:46.620
that you would trip over. And I think there was a backpack involved as well.

1156
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:49.890
So there is still some reason to want to use the computer where one of the

1157
01:03:49.891 --> 01:03:53.700
points that I like to make is that I, while cell phone technology,

1158
01:03:53.701 --> 01:03:57.900
which is definitely what these stand-alones run on is astounding and how much

1159
01:03:57.901 --> 01:04:02.160
power we've gotten out of these. But your high end gaming PC rig I,

1160
01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:06.150
it's a difference of it's 50 times more powerful. It is just way, way,

1161
01:04:06.151 --> 01:04:07.380
way more powerful.

1162
01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:10.590
And if you just want to make something happen quickly and easily,

1163
01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:14.520
it's easy on the PC where you have to sweat pretty hard to make some intense

1164
01:04:14.521 --> 01:04:17.760
things happen on the cellular systems. I am.

1165
01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:21.660
And one of the interesting things is I make the point to people that we are so

1166
01:04:21.661 --> 01:04:25.320
used to computers just getting faster and faster and they have for, you know,

1167
01:04:25.321 --> 01:04:28.320
for decades and decades our entire life basically.

1168
01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.270
But we are approaching the end of that.

1169
01:04:30.271 --> 01:04:32.670
People talk about the end of Moore's law like you mentioned.

1170
01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:37.700
And I've had to tell people that while we've still got a lot more power to come,

1171
01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:39.900
the next decade still going to be good.

1172
01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:43.710
It is very likely barring some magical new technology,

1173
01:04:43.711 --> 01:04:45.510
which fingers crossed maybe we get,

1174
01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:49.290
but you will probably never get the cell phone technology.

1175
01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:52.440
I to the point that a modern gaming PC is,

1176
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:56.460
which on the one hand sounds like obviously that's a different thing,

1177
01:04:56.461 --> 01:04:57.271
but on the other hand,

1178
01:04:57.271 --> 01:05:00.300
if you've been here through this million x increase in performance,

1179
01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:02.220
it's a little bit of a Downer to think that no,

1180
01:05:02.221 --> 01:05:06.180
we just can't wait another 10 years and we'll have everything we could do there

1181
01:05:06.181 --> 01:05:07.470
available in the systems.

1182
01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:11.730
So it does mean a little bit of a cultural change to to start thinking more

1183
01:05:11.731 --> 01:05:15.210
about performance rather than just say throw everything at it. And then,

1184
01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:17.470
and that used to be what I did in the early days. It did.

1185
01:05:17.471 --> 01:05:20.950
We would make these bleeding edge things where only a few people at the start

1186
01:05:20.951 --> 01:05:23.950
had good enough computers or people would get it and they were running it.

1187
01:05:23.951 --> 01:05:24.671
A low frame rate.

1188
01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:27.880
It made them want to go upgrade their computer and wanted to go get the latest

1189
01:05:27.881 --> 01:05:32.020
thing or buy a GPU. I, you know, do the thing to make the game better.

1190
01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.400
But we are,

1191
01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:37.210
we are approaching the limits of what's going to be happening with that.

1192
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:39.220
I am so you have to be better. You know,

1193
01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:42.240
you have to be a more conscientious developer. You have to,

1194
01:05:42.241 --> 01:05:45.820
I start paying attention to all of the different aspects of performance that on

1195
01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:49.570
the PC you can still largely gloss over. Uh, and I like that. I mean,

1196
01:05:49.571 --> 01:05:53.170
as an old school optimizer where I always appreciated the challenge.

1197
01:05:53.171 --> 01:05:57.100
That's why my entire time at Oculus I've been focused on these mobile systems

1198
01:05:57.101 --> 01:06:01.390
where in many ways it's easier to do spectacular things on the PC.

1199
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:04.890
But mobile is super important and it's more of a challenge. You know,

1200
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:06.670
it winds up fitting a little bit better for me,

1201
01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:11.170
but there are generations of game developers, especially now that have been,

1202
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:15.640
I have grown up making PC titles where it's easy and they have to educate

1203
01:06:15.641 --> 01:06:18.820
themselves quite a bit now to go ahead and make the step down to something with

1204
01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:23.080
less than a 10th or you know, less than a 50th in some cases of the raw power.

1205
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.200
When you're talking about the end of Moore's law,

1206
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:29.260
what is the limitation that we're facing technologically?

1207
01:06:29.261 --> 01:06:31.910
Like why is it going to, why are there,

1208
01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:35.260
why is there going to be a point where they can't get any more powerful?

1209
01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.830
So the way the chips work is you have these, I am, you know,

1210
01:06:38.831 --> 01:06:43.831
they wind up sketching out basically wires onto the silicon chips and they have

1211
01:06:44.111 --> 01:06:49.111
gotten so small that the wire that the current is flowing through is a handful

1212
01:06:50.051 --> 01:06:53.710
of atoms wide, which is just astounding if you think about it, you know,

1213
01:06:53.711 --> 01:06:58.711
these are these fundamental elements of matter and the wire is this small

1214
01:06:59.081 --> 01:07:02.950
integer number of atoms wide. Now in theory, you can keep going down and say,

1215
01:07:02.951 --> 01:07:06.370
well, maybe we can make a one atom wide electrical path,

1216
01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:10.810
but you wind up running into eventually all of these quantum effects where if

1217
01:07:10.811 --> 01:07:13.840
you make a very narrow wire and you pack them very close together,

1218
01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:18.970
you have two wires there and electron won't necessarily stay on that one wire of

1219
01:07:18.971 --> 01:07:20.560
conductor that you want it to be on.

1220
01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:25.600
Because of the way I quantum mechanics work, it is going to wind up jumping.

1221
01:07:25.601 --> 01:07:27.010
They call it quantum tunneling.

1222
01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:31.150
There is a percentage chance and quantum is all about randomness like that,

1223
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:33.160
but an electron flowing here,

1224
01:07:33.161 --> 01:07:37.540
there's going to be this chance that it just teleports essentially to a nearby

1225
01:07:37.541 --> 01:07:38.170
wire.

1226
01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:42.610
It takes this discrete quantum jump to another wire and this is reality.

1227
01:07:42.611 --> 01:07:44.620
It's shocking. It's not intuitive.

1228
01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:47.650
People have a hard time kind of grasping a lot of this,

1229
01:07:47.651 --> 01:07:52.420
but quantum tunneling is a real thing and we are bumping into quantum limits.

1230
01:07:52.421 --> 01:07:55.930
They can still shrink more than we are right now where we're down at seven

1231
01:07:55.931 --> 01:07:58.030
nanometers in the latest us stuff.

1232
01:07:58.031 --> 01:08:00.040
Although there's all sorts of issues with marketing,

1233
01:08:00.041 --> 01:08:01.690
speak about exactly how they measure it,

1234
01:08:01.691 --> 01:08:05.230
but they're still getting smaller and there's still room to get smaller still.

1235
01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.440
But the end is in sight. It can't go too much.

1236
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:12.670
And one of the things that becomes an issue is just the economics of it.

1237
01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:16.430
Each generation has gotten more and more expensive. If you went back,

1238
01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:21.560
I am 30 years, there were a whole bunch of semiconductor places that could fab.

1239
01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.060
I'm, you know, different chips.

1240
01:08:23.061 --> 01:08:26.180
You could go ahead and have a design and you could shop it out to a whole bunch

1241
01:08:26.181 --> 01:08:28.790
of different places. Find the one that worked best for you.

1242
01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.110
But it's come down to the point now where it costs billions of dollars to make a

1243
01:08:33.111 --> 01:08:33.944
new fab.

1244
01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:39.100
And at the high end process is you're left with just DSMC Samsung and Intel.

1245
01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:41.150
I'm very few companies, you know,

1246
01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:46.151
AMD held on for a while until they spun theirs out and it's IX.

1247
01:08:46.171 --> 01:08:47.810
It's so expensive and it,

1248
01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:51.500
that's one of the challenges where they will have full confidence that we'll see

1249
01:08:51.501 --> 01:08:56.050
a couple more node shrinks. I am still, it'll still make chips cheaper. Uh,

1250
01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:58.790
somewhat faster, more cores on them,

1251
01:08:59.030 --> 01:09:01.850
but it is going to be at an end of the line.

1252
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:04.370
But I hold out hope for potential other things,

1253
01:09:04.371 --> 01:09:06.470
you know there are directions that, you know,

1254
01:09:06.471 --> 01:09:09.980
maybe you have your carbon nanotube wires or you're starting able to be able to

1255
01:09:09.981 --> 01:09:12.830
do some things with photonic processing in different ways.

1256
01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:15.020
There are possible outs for it,

1257
01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:19.730
but I don't know that any of them are assure enough thing to really be counting

1258
01:09:19.731 --> 01:09:20.570
on at this point.

1259
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:25.280
It's so hard for a dummy like me to wrap my head around that.

1260
01:09:25.281 --> 01:09:28.430
But when you're talking about these wires, so if these wires,

1261
01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:31.100
it's size dependent, when they get too small,

1262
01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:33.770
then this quantum tunneling becomes completely unpredictable.

1263
01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:35.330
Is that what it is? So I,

1264
01:09:35.331 --> 01:09:39.920
if you draw out like a probability density function of like you've got a

1265
01:09:39.921 --> 01:09:42.920
particle and you like to think about particles as being like this hard little

1266
01:09:42.921 --> 01:09:46.580
billiard ball that's sitting here in this specific place, that's sort of the,

1267
01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:46.971
you know,

1268
01:09:46.971 --> 01:09:50.720
the vision that you used to see in grade school textbooks about here's an Adam,

1269
01:09:50.721 --> 01:09:53.810
you've got these billiard balls in the middle of surrounded by the electrons

1270
01:09:53.811 --> 01:09:57.560
moving around. But in actuality they're really these eye,

1271
01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.920
these distribution functions, they, it sounds so weird,

1272
01:10:00.921 --> 01:10:04.610
but they have a chance at being in all of these different places and this is not

1273
01:10:04.611 --> 01:10:06.140
a curve that goes to zero.

1274
01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:09.980
There is a non zero chance that a given Adam, you know,

1275
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:12.890
could wind up being a macroscopic distance away,

1276
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:17.750
but there is a real chance that it could wind up being a few atoms away. So the,

1277
01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:21.440
uh, you know, the electron moving around at the edge of this wire,

1278
01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:22.790
if it just says, well,

1279
01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:27.010
I've got some chance of being over here and if you've got billions of these are

1280
01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:30.050
quadrillions probably of electrons moving around in this,

1281
01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:31.610
even if it's a small chance.

1282
01:10:31.670 --> 01:10:34.700
Eventually it's going to jump over there and enough of them jump over and all of

1283
01:10:34.701 --> 01:10:36.800
a sudden you've got a wrong bit and you've got a mistake.

1284
01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:41.510
So we start fighting all of that by doing error correcting codes and doing ways

1285
01:10:41.511 --> 01:10:44.870
that there's this whole set of technology about how you work with unreliable

1286
01:10:44.871 --> 01:10:47.270
systems, which starts getting starts.

1287
01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:50.480
It should start making you feel a little bit uneasy that, okay,

1288
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:54.470
we're going to have this error rate, but we're going to buy this carefully.

1289
01:10:54.471 --> 01:10:57.860
Crafted codes allow ourselves to constantly be failing,

1290
01:10:57.861 --> 01:11:02.060
constantly having errors and still getting the right answer in a statistical

1291
01:11:02.061 --> 01:11:02.894
enough case.

1292
01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:05.690
Now there's a lot of things like the way your cell phone works with the way the

1293
01:11:05.691 --> 01:11:07.430
radio signal is interpreted.

1294
01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:10.610
There's a lot of things that do work in this sort of probabilistic way,

1295
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:14.220
but when people are used to computers as being accurate thing

1296
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:16.260
<v 0>where you always get the right answer,</v>

1297
01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.860
that sense of moving to something that has a larger chance or is a more

1298
01:11:19.861 --> 01:11:24.240
probabilistic computation still feels a little bit sketchy in some ways.

1299
01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:29.430
Now, do you keep tabs on latest cellular technology as well? I mean,

1300
01:11:29.431 --> 01:11:33.270
I know you're a coder and you code for games,

1301
01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:38.300
but do you keep tabs on all the various incremental increases in cellular

1302
01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:39.750
technology?

1303
01:11:39.751 --> 01:11:44.751
And so it's interesting right now where we have a lot of 5g companies that I am,

1304
01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:49.800
that's what they've sort of got a problem of how to sell 5g where fundamentally

1305
01:11:49.801 --> 01:11:51.210
it's just a bigger pipe to,

1306
01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:54.270
to everyone's computers and it should be this relatively boring thing,

1307
01:11:54.271 --> 01:11:57.300
but they need to await to kind of make it sexy in some way.

1308
01:11:57.301 --> 01:12:00.750
And several of them want VR to be that way where, you know,

1309
01:12:00.751 --> 01:12:03.300
how can we use VR in a way that I,

1310
01:12:03.301 --> 01:12:08.301
that leverages the 5g I experience and it's not a spectacular fit because I have

1311
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:15.210
many of the things like, you know, say beat Saber that uses no data transfer.

1312
01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:18.360
It's like all it does is check you're spot on the leaderboard after you're done.

1313
01:12:18.361 --> 01:12:20.100
5G does nothing at all for that.

1314
01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:23.670
But there are some things that you can look at with the immersive media like

1315
01:12:23.671 --> 01:12:27.690
playing three 60 3d videos where it's like, okay,

1316
01:12:27.691 --> 01:12:29.970
it would be nice to have more bandwidth here,

1317
01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:32.970
but it's not that it's made possible by 5g.

1318
01:12:32.971 --> 01:12:37.680
It's just 5g will give more people a reliable 20 megabit bandwidth or something

1319
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:39.600
than they have on the current systems.

1320
01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:43.320
It's a tough marketing problem for them where changing your cellular

1321
01:12:43.321 --> 01:12:44.160
infrastructure,

1322
01:12:44.190 --> 01:12:48.330
each one where you have to go into tens of thousands of specific dollar base

1323
01:12:48.331 --> 01:12:51.120
stations and pull out the racks and replace them. It's very,

1324
01:12:51.121 --> 01:12:55.410
very capital intensive and they would like to be able to have some cool

1325
01:12:55.411 --> 01:12:57.680
marketing ploy to make people, you know,

1326
01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:01.920
think this is great switch carriers over to this where the bottom line is it

1327
01:13:01.921 --> 01:13:06.360
gives you more bandwidth and perhaps more importantly it does cut the latency

1328
01:13:06.361 --> 01:13:06.990
more.

1329
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:11.520
It's possible that things like cloud gaming over five g networks may be more of

1330
01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:12.630
a thing. Uh,

1331
01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:15.750
the idea of actually playing games instead of installing them locally,

1332
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:19.800
they run in data centers and they can just go ahead and wirelessly get to you

1333
01:13:19.801 --> 01:13:23.850
with low enough latency to so that in many cases you wouldn't be able to notice.

1334
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:28.170
When you're watching this from the outside and you're seeing all this technology

1335
01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:29.004
develop,

1336
01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:34.700
are you concerned at all when you see how addicted people are to their phones?

1337
01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:38.940
Because this, like your games are very addictive in the best ways, right?

1338
01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:41.640
Quick is super addictive. It's really fun.

1339
01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:44.700
It's great to play and that's why it's addictive because you just won't get that

1340
01:13:45.130 --> 01:13:46.350
charge, that rush to get back in there.

1341
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:51.830
But the odd thing to me about cell phone addiction is there's not much thrill.

1342
01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:58.550
It's a weird addiction where you're just constantly checking and nothing's

1343
01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:02.550
coming back. Like people are just constantly checking their email and their,

1344
01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:06.600
their Twitter messages, their dms and youtube videos.

1345
01:14:06.601 --> 01:14:09.930
But there's not a lot coming back at you. I'm,

1346
01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:11.980
I'm concerned.

1347
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.280
<v 1>I see this thing where you'll go to a place and you'll see 80% of the people</v>

1348
01:14:17.561 --> 01:14:19.900
just looking at their phones and not interacting with people.

1349
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:24.640
Do you ever like look at that and go, where's this going?

1350
01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.790
So I do think about this in a way that,

1351
01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:32.080
because this is one of these things where I recognize it in some other people

1352
01:14:32.081 --> 01:14:36.760
where I think I probably do interact with things a little bit differently and I

1353
01:14:36.761 --> 01:14:40.870
am sometimes conscious of the fact that most people don't think about things the

1354
01:14:40.871 --> 01:14:43.390
way I do. And it's clear that yes,

1355
01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:48.010
a lot of people just ay they get rage out of Twitter. And I that I can see it.

1356
01:14:48.011 --> 01:14:51.430
Some people, it's probably bad for them doing some of these social media things.

1357
01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:55.210
But I mean I, I get inspiration out of Twitter. I mean my feet,

1358
01:14:55.211 --> 01:14:59.350
I'm going through, I'm seeing brilliant scientists, new research developments,

1359
01:14:59.351 --> 01:15:02.830
wonderful art from people, hard workers, developing products.

1360
01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:04.150
And I just look at this as like,

1361
01:15:04.151 --> 01:15:08.140
this is this amazing set of human beings that are building the future and I've

1362
01:15:08.141 --> 01:15:11.800
got this window into their mind and it winds up being a very positive thing for

1363
01:15:11.801 --> 01:15:16.300
me. But I do see the people that just wind up having eye that it is a negative

1364
01:15:16.301 --> 01:15:20.170
aspect for them. And I don't know what to do about that because I mean,

1365
01:15:20.171 --> 01:15:23.350
talking about people issues are obviously not my strong suit.

1366
01:15:23.351 --> 01:15:28.300
I'm the nuts and bolts or bits and bites technology person and social

1367
01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.110
challenges. I mean, that's one of the things that probably over, you know,

1368
01:15:32.111 --> 01:15:33.010
over decades.

1369
01:15:33.011 --> 01:15:37.510
I've just come to be more at peace with the fact that I probably do think a bit

1370
01:15:37.511 --> 01:15:41.380
differently than most people. I don't expect them to, you know,

1371
01:15:41.381 --> 01:15:43.450
to think necessarily like I do.

1372
01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:46.510
And in many ways that keeps me from being upset at a lot of people and just say,

1373
01:15:46.511 --> 01:15:47.590
well, people are different.

1374
01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:52.000
They're not going to process these things the same way that I do. Uh, but yeah,

1375
01:15:52.001 --> 01:15:54.730
I can see it as potentially a problem.

1376
01:15:54.731 --> 01:15:58.040
But I do think also there's this ability for people to,

1377
01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:01.530
people always want to say it's okay, put down your phone.

1378
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:03.340
Why aren't you living in the real world?

1379
01:16:03.610 --> 01:16:07.000
And there's another aspect of that where for many people,

1380
01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.460
the world that you get in the virtual worlds,

1381
01:16:09.461 --> 01:16:11.590
whether it's on your phone or all the way to VR,

1382
01:16:11.770 --> 01:16:15.550
the whole reason you do that should be because it's better than the world that

1383
01:16:15.551 --> 01:16:19.360
you're choosing to step away from. And again,

1384
01:16:19.361 --> 01:16:23.230
it's harder for many people that are in an elite thought leader position.

1385
01:16:23.231 --> 01:16:25.990
If your life is awesome in every way that yeah,

1386
01:16:25.991 --> 01:16:28.270
you don't need that much from the virtual world,

1387
01:16:28.271 --> 01:16:31.390
whether it's on a cell phone or virtual reality. I mean if you've been,

1388
01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:34.300
you know, court side, backstage pit lane, whatever,

1389
01:16:34.301 --> 01:16:36.160
if you've done all of these things in real life,

1390
01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.740
the VR version of it is not going to be that compelling.

1391
01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:41.380
And if you saw people you know, fixated on all of that,

1392
01:16:41.381 --> 01:16:44.170
you'd probably think those people are not living in reality.

1393
01:16:44.171 --> 01:16:47.410
They should just be living in reality. But for so many people,

1394
01:16:48.030 --> 01:16:50.770
you know what they get the people on the other side of the phone that they're

1395
01:16:50.771 --> 01:16:53.860
interacting with that's red. That's where they'd rather be. You know,

1396
01:16:53.861 --> 01:16:57.610
the fact that people can find their tribe out of the billions of people in the

1397
01:16:57.611 --> 01:17:01.180
world, even if they live in some podunk town in the Midwest.

1398
01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:05.020
I think that's a really wonderful thing. And so while yes,

1399
01:17:05.021 --> 01:17:09.100
there is a negative tail on one side from it, I am,

1400
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:14.060
I think that this connecting everyone is largely a good thing on net.

1401
01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:15.290
There are downsides.

1402
01:17:15.291 --> 01:17:18.260
Maybe there should be things we should be doing to mitigate the downsides,

1403
01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:22.310
but I think this connection of humanity is on that a positive thing

1404
01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:27.110
<v 2>tend to agree with you that it is a positive thing. I think philosophically,</v>

1405
01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:31.850
I think the way we understand each other, the way we communicate,

1406
01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:36.320
it's very radically different than our grandparents and all of it seems to be

1407
01:17:36.321 --> 01:17:39.440
moving in a place where we understand each other better.

1408
01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:41.750
And you're going to have your side effects like Twitter rage and,

1409
01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:45.050
and social media bias. And you know, these, uh,

1410
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:50.120
confirmation bias groups where people just do sit in these echo chambers and

1411
01:17:50.121 --> 01:17:52.370
reiterate the same ideas over and over again in each other.

1412
01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:56.420
And you're also going to get people that are understanding cultures,

1413
01:17:56.690 --> 01:17:59.930
understanding each other, understanding psychology,

1414
01:17:59.931 --> 01:18:04.850
understanding the way the mind works and getting access to information at a rate

1415
01:18:04.851 --> 01:18:08.370
that's unprecedented in terms of the knowledge that you can get. Like just,

1416
01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.070
just being able to Google things.

1417
01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:12.880
<v 1>Yeah. And it's, you know, and nobody, you know,</v>

1418
01:18:12.881 --> 01:18:14.740
nobody can actually give them credit for it.

1419
01:18:14.741 --> 01:18:16.840
And like Mark Zuckerberg and the Facebook leadership,

1420
01:18:16.841 --> 01:18:20.110
they talk about the mission is to connect the world. And you know,

1421
01:18:20.111 --> 01:18:21.310
of course it's like, oh, okay,

1422
01:18:21.490 --> 01:18:24.670
of course the Facebook CEO is going to be mounting these things. But like,

1423
01:18:24.671 --> 01:18:29.080
I really legitimately do think that the Facebook leadership is doing this

1424
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:32.050
because they think that's a positive thing. And I agree with them now.

1425
01:18:32.051 --> 01:18:34.750
I'm not a very social person. I'm an introvert.

1426
01:18:34.751 --> 01:18:37.540
I'm a hermit mode sort of person. So much of the time.

1427
01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:42.160
But I think that this is again a good thing that connecting more people,

1428
01:18:42.161 --> 01:18:45.310
giving them the opportunity to find people that they wouldn't otherwise be

1429
01:18:45.311 --> 01:18:48.940
interacting with people they wouldn't even have known existed in many cases.

1430
01:18:49.210 --> 01:18:50.920
I think we'll come out of this, you know,

1431
01:18:50.921 --> 01:18:54.400
looking back decades in the future there will have been all the tragic things

1432
01:18:54.401 --> 01:18:57.970
that happened with social media, but on net it's going to be good.

1433
01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:00.850
<v 2>Now when you say you're a hermit, I mean th does that,</v>

1434
01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.220
that sort of really lends itself to coding, right?

1435
01:19:03.221 --> 01:19:06.610
Because coding is an exorbitant amount of time just staring at a screen.

1436
01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:10.930
How much time do you think per day, like when you're in full code mode,

1437
01:19:10.931 --> 01:19:13.570
you spend, like if you're developing something,

1438
01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:16.980
how much time do you spend just staring at a screen? So

1439
01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:20.400
<v 1>this is an interesting thing where at least once a year I get pulled into some</v>

1440
01:19:20.401 --> 01:19:25.110
debate about overwork and bad working conditions and things where some people,

1441
01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.760
you know, the way I am,

1442
01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:30.540
people always wind up extrapolating sort of unacceptably where people think,

1443
01:19:30.541 --> 01:19:33.510
oh I worked 18 hour days or something. And I have to say, no,

1444
01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:37.710
I never worked 18 hour days because I know my productivity falls off a cliff

1445
01:19:37.711 --> 01:19:39.780
after 13 hours. I'm, you know,

1446
01:19:39.781 --> 01:19:43.440
that's about the longest that I can do any effective kind of computer work.

1447
01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:47.010
And the key to even being able to get an effective 13 hours is having multiple

1448
01:19:47.011 --> 01:19:50.640
tasks that you can switch between rather than just kind of sitting heads down,

1449
01:19:50.641 --> 01:19:55.440
grinding, beating your head against one specific topic. But I'm, you know,

1450
01:19:55.441 --> 01:19:57.900
I've been for most of my career now,

1451
01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:03.180
I like working a 60 hour work week. I like being productive. I, you know,

1452
01:20:03.181 --> 01:20:06.270
nowadays I have a, I have family and kids and I don't,

1453
01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:09.450
I usually that target by a bit now, but I,

1454
01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:13.470
if I ever don't hit 50 hours a week, I feel I'm being a slacker. I am.

1455
01:20:13.690 --> 01:20:18.210
I like building things. I like creating things and making forward progress.

1456
01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:22.650
This sense of in some small way I'm helping build the future. Um, you know,

1457
01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:27.420
I'm proud of the work that I do now in a big company like Oculus or in Facebook

1458
01:20:27.421 --> 01:20:28.500
is now I'm,

1459
01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:32.790
I probably only get to spend about 50% of my time actually programming.

1460
01:20:32.791 --> 01:20:36.690
The other half is being in meetings, trying to convince people about things,

1461
01:20:36.691 --> 01:20:39.810
pushing on strategy, doing all that type of stuff.

1462
01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:43.250
I don't actually manage anyone. I'd be a poor manager, uh,

1463
01:20:43.251 --> 01:20:47.370
at best I can lead by example and provide some kind of inspiration to follow

1464
01:20:47.371 --> 01:20:47.880
behind.

1465
01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:51.150
But I've never been good at trying to figure out how to get the best out of

1466
01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:55.360
individual people I am. But I do love, I, you know,

1467
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:58.320
I love taking a retreat where I'll work out with a,

1468
01:20:58.321 --> 01:20:59.940
with my wife and family and say, okay,

1469
01:20:59.941 --> 01:21:03.390
I'm going to spend a week or something and I'm just going to be by myself and

1470
01:21:03.391 --> 01:21:05.280
I'm going to do nothing but programming. I'm,

1471
01:21:05.370 --> 01:21:08.940
I've got to largely cut myself off from the Internet. I am,

1472
01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:12.250
I used to do this by literally flying to another state. Uh, I,

1473
01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:13.800
my wife would set up some,

1474
01:21:13.801 --> 01:21:17.820
I like fly me to Florida or something and just get off and go to a hotel near

1475
01:21:17.821 --> 01:21:18.451
the airport.

1476
01:21:18.451 --> 01:21:23.010
So I'm not around anybody or anything that I would distract myself with. Uh,

1477
01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:26.190
you know, lately I w you know, I would wind up doing it more locally,

1478
01:21:26.191 --> 01:21:30.540
but that's still something that I've like, I would worry as I got older I,

1479
01:21:30.541 --> 01:21:34.930
or am doing more of this, I'm involved with strategy and management. Well am I,

1480
01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:37.710
I can I not do that as well as I used to.

1481
01:21:37.711 --> 01:21:41.280
But in the last couple of years I would go and take off and it's like I quickly

1482
01:21:41.281 --> 01:21:45.350
slip back into that where after a day of adjustment, then I'm back in.

1483
01:21:45.351 --> 01:21:45.841
It's like, all right,

1484
01:21:45.841 --> 01:21:50.250
here's my 13 hours in the day and here I am plowing through a bunch of things.

1485
01:21:50.670 --> 01:21:53.730
So you would just go by yourself and you wouldn't get weirded out by that.

1486
01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:56.970
You don't get lonely. Like, I like to think that I, you know,

1487
01:21:56.971 --> 01:22:00.120
sometimes I want to pull on that thread a little bit and say, well,

1488
01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:03.600
how would I do in a Snowden cabin someplace? I, you know,

1489
01:22:03.601 --> 01:22:08.010
would I get cabin fever or something? I have, and I'm pretty confident that,

1490
01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:11.430
I mean, a week's just not that big of, not that long of a time. I mean,

1491
01:22:11.431 --> 01:22:14.760
who knows if it was a month or longer than that. I'm not sure.

1492
01:22:14.761 --> 01:22:18.090
I've never run that experiment, but I, you know,

1493
01:22:18.091 --> 01:22:21.690
a week of doing that and then coming back and seeing my, uh, my family,

1494
01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:24.240
that's pretty great. I did that just,

1495
01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:27.040
I'm a little over a month ago for a,

1496
01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:31.180
for this year and I got to really kind of deep dive doing a bunch of, um,

1497
01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:35.130
artificial intelligence related work stuff that I was poking at. I am,

1498
01:22:35.490 --> 01:22:39.870
and that's, it really makes me smile. That sense of like, okay, I can dive in.

1499
01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:44.070
And the sense of learning new things, not just necessarily grinding on projects.

1500
01:22:44.071 --> 01:22:46.260
I mean, it's great to just be productive and say, wow,

1501
01:22:46.261 --> 01:22:49.080
I just crossed off these 10 things off the to do list.

1502
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:54.300
But diving into newer fields that I'm not an expert on and learning what all the

1503
01:22:54.301 --> 01:22:57.810
other brilliant people in the world have been kind of caught a and getting the

1504
01:22:57.811 --> 01:23:01.500
Aha moments of going through that. Uh, yeah. It's amazing.

1505
01:23:01.501 --> 01:23:04.890
There's so many things to work on. Well, it's interesting because you're,

1506
01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:08.450
you're so pragmatic about your time and you have a,

1507
01:23:08.451 --> 01:23:13.451
a realistic understanding of your own physical limitations as well as what you

1508
01:23:13.841 --> 01:23:15.930
actually enjoy doing. You know, you,

1509
01:23:16.150 --> 01:23:20.860
that you actually enjoy diving into this work and getting this done. I mean,

1510
01:23:20.861 --> 01:23:23.350
so many people are tortured by their work. They do it,

1511
01:23:23.351 --> 01:23:26.200
but they don't like it that it's just something they have to do.

1512
01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:28.900
So it's very refreshing seeing someone who,

1513
01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:33.460
even though you have this really unusual job and you have this really unusual

1514
01:23:33.850 --> 01:23:35.590
task that you're trying to,

1515
01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:40.450
it's essentially designed for you or you're designed for it. Yeah.

1516
01:23:40.451 --> 01:23:44.590
And there are clear decisions that you make where the majority of technical

1517
01:23:44.591 --> 01:23:49.591
people at some point decide to make the pivot into some kind of management

1518
01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:50.531
level,

1519
01:23:50.531 --> 01:23:55.531
whether it's being a startup CEO or I just taking a VP position somewhere and,

1520
01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:58.720
and managing other people. And there's good reasons for that.

1521
01:23:58.721 --> 01:24:03.040
I mean now and argument that I would have with myself about how I had seen kind

1522
01:24:03.041 --> 01:24:05.740
of the transition from these very low level programming tools,

1523
01:24:05.741 --> 01:24:09.670
writing and assembly language to writing in higher level languages to using

1524
01:24:09.671 --> 01:24:12.160
application frameworks. And at some level you say,

1525
01:24:12.161 --> 01:24:16.240
well the next level of productivity enhancing program development is to work

1526
01:24:16.241 --> 01:24:19.240
with people. You know, you instead of writing the code yourself,

1527
01:24:19.241 --> 01:24:21.610
you find the team and you tell them what to work on.

1528
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:24.310
I and that's the way most of the world runs.

1529
01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:27.400
That type of kind of groups and teams and hierarchies,

1530
01:24:27.401 --> 01:24:31.210
the work that makes the world go round, but it's not what I want to do,

1531
01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:33.100
you know? I don't want to be the one doing that.

1532
01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:36.280
And in many ways that's selfish where at some point if I said,

1533
01:24:36.281 --> 01:24:38.110
if I'm all about the project,

1534
01:24:38.111 --> 01:24:42.550
if I'm all about saying that I want to change the world in this way by bringing,

1535
01:24:42.551 --> 01:24:44.290
bringing this product into existence,

1536
01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:48.400
I should just suck it up and learn how to manage people and make that happen.

1537
01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:51.880
But it is selfishness that keeps me saying, it's like, no,

1538
01:24:51.881 --> 01:24:56.320
I dearly loved building the things myself. I don't want to step away from that,

1539
01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:00.340
even if it would be more effective. And I know that even if you go and do that,

1540
01:25:00.341 --> 01:25:03.850
so you, I could be maybe super effective for a couple of years at that,

1541
01:25:03.851 --> 01:25:04.780
but then my skills,

1542
01:25:04.781 --> 01:25:08.410
atrophy and the world moves on and I'm no longer at the cutting edge of those

1543
01:25:08.411 --> 01:25:09.131
different things.

1544
01:25:09.131 --> 01:25:12.400
And eventually I'm giving bad advice to the people that I'm managing or at least

1545
01:25:12.401 --> 01:25:16.750
not current and optimal advice. So I, I'm at peace with that.

1546
01:25:16.751 --> 01:25:21.610
I do sometimes look at, you know, other people were like, I think,

1547
01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:21.850
uh,

1548
01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:25.060
I think mark Zuckerberg made a very conscious decision that he's going to learn

1549
01:25:25.061 --> 01:25:28.750
to be a top notch CEO. I know he was a programmer,

1550
01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:32.230
but he decided to largely step away from that and says he's going to learn how

1551
01:25:32.231 --> 01:25:36.610
to manage a company. Well. I, you know, in many ways while Ilan still keeps his,

1552
01:25:36.810 --> 01:25:39.040
uh, his hands dirty and engineering to some degree,

1553
01:25:39.190 --> 01:25:43.780
most of what he does is make his way empire of companies, you know, run.

1554
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:46.870
And that's a lot of work. And I think that, I mean,

1555
01:25:47.050 --> 01:25:50.860
I think he misses it to some degree. I, I had one time, I'm talking with him,

1556
01:25:50.861 --> 01:25:54.370
he had a little bit of a kind of a wistful thought about I talking about the

1557
01:25:54.370 --> 01:25:58.890
early days of programming things and I am willing to, I'm willing to,

1558
01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:03.040
to make that trade where I would rather continue to do the things that I dearly

1559
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:04.220
love. And

1560
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:07.450
<v 0>maybe that keeps me from going to the next level. Maybe, you know,</v>

1561
01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:11.480
maybe it prevents me from becoming a billionaire and I'm okay with that. I am,

1562
01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:13.730
but you know, maybe I do come across then, you know,

1563
01:26:13.731 --> 01:26:17.360
some next great thing that can productize in some way like that. Well,

1564
01:26:17.361 --> 01:26:21.860
it seems like you have to have a very specific personality to do that and you

1565
01:26:21.861 --> 01:26:24.920
have that personality. For me on the outside,

1566
01:26:24.921 --> 01:26:27.590
when I looked at people making games, like I've looked at,

1567
01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:31.160
I've been a fan of games for a long time and one of the things that's fascinated

1568
01:26:31.161 --> 01:26:35.090
me is this, this when a game starts building,

1569
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:39.320
when it starts, when the process of creating a game starts,

1570
01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:44.380
there's this insane amount of work that has to get done in a relatively short

1571
01:26:44.691 --> 01:26:49.691
period of time and I get anxiety thinking about other people making games and I

1572
01:26:49.731 --> 01:26:54.470
don't even make games like there's been a few like Duke Nukem right for like it

1573
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:57.050
was vaporware for the longest time. People are like,

1574
01:26:57.051 --> 01:27:00.500
when is this going to come out? Or Dika Tana was one of them.

1575
01:27:00.501 --> 01:27:04.610
I mean there was an, it was a very hyped up game. Everybody was super excited.

1576
01:27:04.611 --> 01:27:08.240
It took a long time for it to actually come to development is actually a pretty

1577
01:27:08.241 --> 01:27:09.500
fun game when it came out.

1578
01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:13.370
But I would get anxiety thinking about this like my God,

1579
01:27:13.371 --> 01:27:16.790
how much work is involved in these things? They can games is really,

1580
01:27:16.791 --> 01:27:18.080
really hard.

1581
01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:21.980
And this is kind of an interesting thing seeing the kind of the culture at

1582
01:27:21.981 --> 01:27:26.270
Facebook where you've got the, the big tech titans with the Facebook, Google,

1583
01:27:26.271 --> 01:27:29.030
apple, Microsoft, all that. And I,

1584
01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:32.000
you get a lot of people that roll right into that out of college.

1585
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:35.360
And some of the people that have been in some of the other industries,

1586
01:27:35.630 --> 01:27:37.940
they do look at it and it's like, oh everybody is,

1587
01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:42.500
they have it so good at these big tech companies where they really are.

1588
01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:44.960
Everybody is taken care of incredibly well.

1589
01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:49.280
I they get all the different perks and I am, you know,

1590
01:27:49.281 --> 01:27:52.520
and then you look at that, the game industry where it doesn't pay as well.

1591
01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:53.870
I am they,

1592
01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:57.710
there's less job security and they work a lot harder.

1593
01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:00.770
But they have, and it's kind of a,

1594
01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.470
there is the problem of the fact that when you have an industry,

1595
01:28:03.471 --> 01:28:07.010
and this has been the way for artists forever and artists and musicians where if

1596
01:28:07.011 --> 01:28:10.640
you've got something that people are passionate about and want to be involved at

1597
01:28:11.230 --> 01:28:16.190
and I am supply and demand works there works its way and you wind up in a

1598
01:28:16.191 --> 01:28:18.890
situation where yeah, they don't have to be paid as much.

1599
01:28:19.190 --> 01:28:22.640
But the other side of that is it allows products that otherwise couldn't exist

1600
01:28:22.641 --> 01:28:25.850
to exist by people working at that level.

1601
01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:28.910
I in a way that maybe couldn't be sustained in other industries.

1602
01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:32.660
There are probably many of the greatest things that were ever made in gaming

1603
01:28:32.661 --> 01:28:36.710
were only possible by people throwing themselves at that level at it.

1604
01:28:37.130 --> 01:28:39.320
And there's some serious debate about it.

1605
01:28:39.321 --> 01:28:42.380
Some people despise that about the industry that you know,

1606
01:28:42.381 --> 01:28:45.560
nobody should work that hard. And there are people that you know,

1607
01:28:45.561 --> 01:28:48.590
that think there literally should be laws against that should prevent people

1608
01:28:48.591 --> 01:28:49.760
from working that hard.

1609
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:53.840
And I always have to argue against that where there is a,

1610
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:58.040
you know there is a power to obsession and like being able to absolutely obsess

1611
01:28:58.041 --> 01:29:00.730
over something and throw your, your life's work, you know,

1612
01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:02.280
instead of work life balance,

1613
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:05.640
<v 1>it's your life's work and everybody will point back. It's like,</v>

1614
01:29:05.641 --> 01:29:09.330
well yeah that worked great for you. You, oh you were a founder of a company.

1615
01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:11.970
You are in a position where you got to make your own decisions.

1616
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:17.270
But is that okay to say for the 19 year olds out of a game Dev program that's

1617
01:29:17.371 --> 01:29:22.260
being overworked for it and I have to always be aware that my view into the

1618
01:29:22.261 --> 01:29:25.440
industry is very colored by obviously my experiences.

1619
01:29:25.441 --> 01:29:29.880
I never actually worked inside of one of the big ea or Activision.

1620
01:29:30.150 --> 01:29:35.150
I am studios and it's possible that they have some valid criticisms,

1621
01:29:36.541 --> 01:29:39.780
but I still come down on I, I think it's,

1622
01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:43.170
I think it's great when people throw themselves at it beyond the point of what

1623
01:29:43.171 --> 01:29:46.020
even other people think is reasonable. They have free will.

1624
01:29:46.021 --> 01:29:47.310
They've chosen to do that.

1625
01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:51.210
And if that's what they think is going to help them get close to their goals,

1626
01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:54.990
I am, you know, I'm not going to try to make that impossible for them.

1627
01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:59.610
I think what people are concerned about those a accompany forcing an employer or

1628
01:29:59.611 --> 01:30:03.720
employee rather to work massive hours and that well, hey,

1629
01:30:03.721 --> 01:30:06.780
I want to work in video games and I'm very passionate about working video games

1630
01:30:06.781 --> 01:30:09.840
but I want to live, I want to be able to work eight hours a day,

1631
01:30:10.210 --> 01:30:14.400
which just seems to be a reasonable amount and then go on about with my life.

1632
01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:19.010
But you can't really do that if you're in a game development Kenya.

1633
01:30:19.290 --> 01:30:23.730
So again, I, my experience isn't the experience of everyone else, but we had,

1634
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:27.990
I am so like Michael Abrash who is my right hand in the quake days. I am,

1635
01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:30.960
you know, he came from, he came from Microsoft,

1636
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.330
I and he had a family.

1637
01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:38.360
I had a wife and daughter and he would work a reasonably normal schedule most of

1638
01:30:38.791 --> 01:30:41.700
the time. But he was awesome. So of course we were happy to have him.

1639
01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:44.880
It's not like anybody was brow beating Michael. It's like, Oh, you know,

1640
01:30:44.881 --> 01:30:47.220
why aren't you staying past midnight with us here?

1641
01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:52.170
Everybody was aware of his contribution and value. Now it,

1642
01:30:52.171 --> 01:30:54.720
that may not be the case in some other companies today,

1643
01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:56.790
but I suspect that if somebody,

1644
01:30:56.940 --> 01:31:01.260
if all of a sudden a person's peers know that they're doing spectacular work and

1645
01:31:01.261 --> 01:31:06.180
they say, I'm out of here at 5:00 AM, if they're actually doing valuable work,

1646
01:31:06.330 --> 01:31:07.830
I don't find the companies,

1647
01:31:08.130 --> 01:31:11.370
I don't find it that credible that the companies are going to get rid of people

1648
01:31:11.371 --> 01:31:16.200
doing great work. Uh, just because they're not spending 60 hours a week there.

1649
01:31:16.230 --> 01:31:18.000
But do they give you a requirement?

1650
01:31:18.001 --> 01:31:21.780
Like you are required to work 12 hours a day? Is that, is that reasonable?

1651
01:31:21.870 --> 01:31:25.880
Does that happen? So, no, I've never, again, I'm not involved in the, you know,

1652
01:31:25.890 --> 01:31:27.570
the HR departments of all of these companies,

1653
01:31:27.571 --> 01:31:31.890
but the ones that I have been familiar with or that I've known people doing that

1654
01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:35.760
largely, they come back and say, these people are choosing to do this.

1655
01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:37.170
And the rejoinder is it's like, oh,

1656
01:31:37.171 --> 01:31:40.440
it's a toxic culture that makes people want to choose to do that.

1657
01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:45.300
But I definitely don't buy into that sort of social engineering level of things.

1658
01:31:45.450 --> 01:31:48.870
It's like if they're doing it, they agree that they'll wave the flag and say,

1659
01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:53.580
I am doing this because I care so much about this. I am. Yeah,

1660
01:31:53.581 --> 01:31:55.890
I don't, I don't think that's a problem. Now,

1661
01:31:55.891 --> 01:31:58.290
when you look at the future of games, and you know,

1662
01:31:58.291 --> 01:32:00.220
we were talking about a first person

1663
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:02.860
<v 2>shooters and we're talking about oculus.</v>

1664
01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:08.400
Do you envision a time where there'll be something where you maybe have a

1665
01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:13.390
unidirectional treadmill or something along those lines and you'll have a

1666
01:32:13.391 --> 01:32:17.290
standalone unit in your home with some sort of a gun? Well,

1667
01:32:17.291 --> 01:32:18.550
that's very accurate,

1668
01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:23.470
where you can actually reload it and you can get physical exercise while you're

1669
01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:27.160
running around in this virtual quake type environment.

1670
01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.440
<v 1>So yeah, the ready player one vision,</v>

1671
01:32:29.770 --> 01:32:32.170
that's a real thing that omnidirectional treadmill.

1672
01:32:32.171 --> 01:32:34.710
But you come into all of these used one, you know,

1673
01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:36.400
I actually haven't played on one of those.

1674
01:32:36.401 --> 01:32:40.210
I've played at somebody who's early prototype of I have one but I haven't seen

1675
01:32:40.211 --> 01:32:43.480
the very latest stages of things, but that's another one of those things.

1676
01:32:43.481 --> 01:32:47.650
I wouldn't put money into that because the joy of VR is the fact that it's like

1677
01:32:47.651 --> 01:32:48.311
this little thing.

1678
01:32:48.311 --> 01:32:52.420
You just pick it up and carry it around as soon as you're building material

1679
01:32:52.421 --> 01:32:53.650
things around it.

1680
01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:58.660
You've kind of defeated some of the purpose of VR and I think there's this niche

1681
01:32:58.661 --> 01:33:02.320
for things like location based entertainment where you go and do things like the

1682
01:33:02.321 --> 01:33:04.600
void where you have the physical gun.

1683
01:33:04.601 --> 01:33:08.410
You know you pick up the storm trooper gun, you go through a physical door,

1684
01:33:08.650 --> 01:33:12.250
but I don't think that's mass market. I am, but it is a real problem.

1685
01:33:12.251 --> 01:33:16.810
The idea of locomotion and how you move around in VR without getting sick and

1686
01:33:16.811 --> 01:33:20.290
the omnidirectional treadmill does sort of allow you to run in the different

1687
01:33:20.291 --> 01:33:24.340
directions. But in terms of getting, I am getting exercise from it again,

1688
01:33:24.341 --> 01:33:25.150
I play,

1689
01:33:25.150 --> 01:33:30.150
I play beat Saber pretty regularly and I wind up drenched in sweat afterwards.

1690
01:33:30.461 --> 01:33:31.960
I after a long session with that,

1691
01:33:31.961 --> 01:33:35.980
it is legitimate exercise and that's how I tell myself I'm multitasking,

1692
01:33:35.981 --> 01:33:39.280
I'm doing my game playing while I'm doing some of my exercise. Right.

1693
01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:42.610
Amanda and I, and it works out great. And while boxing,

1694
01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:46.190
<v 2>boxing, virtual reality games are really incredible, um,</v>

1695
01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:48.220
and you really do get a great workout.

1696
01:33:48.221 --> 01:33:51.400
The only problem is that the knuckles in the wrong position,

1697
01:33:51.730 --> 01:33:54.580
like when you're holding the handles and you're throwing punches,

1698
01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:59.770
even if you turn your knuckles over, the gloves kinda come out like this.

1699
01:34:00.450 --> 01:34:02.970
<v 1>Yeah. Might have to twist your hand sideways. Yeah.</v>

1700
01:34:02.971 --> 01:34:06.540
My problem with the boxing games is they also are a tremendous exercise.

1701
01:34:06.541 --> 01:34:06.691
You know,

1702
01:34:06.691 --> 01:34:09.450
you get in there and you run through the drills and get in there and you're

1703
01:34:09.451 --> 01:34:12.930
feeling really, I really kind of worked over at the end of it,

1704
01:34:12.931 --> 01:34:17.670
but from a purely interaction tactical level, I am, you know,

1705
01:34:17.671 --> 01:34:21.330
you don't hit anything for real you unless you're too close to your guardian

1706
01:34:21.331 --> 01:34:24.450
boundary and you punch the wall. I, so it fuels,

1707
01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:28.440
I lose some of the immersion on a lot of the VR experiences where you're sort of

1708
01:34:28.441 --> 01:34:32.940
miming and interaction, whether it's flipping switches that don't exist or no,

1709
01:34:32.941 --> 01:34:34.710
or throwing punches in boxing,

1710
01:34:35.130 --> 01:34:39.180
we might have some room for improving that with improved haptics in the future

1711
01:34:39.181 --> 01:34:43.230
where right now the controllers can make a little buzz in your palm and that

1712
01:34:43.231 --> 01:34:45.570
seems to work pretty well. When you slice through something,

1713
01:34:45.571 --> 01:34:47.970
you get a little sense of like, oh, I've kind of cut through it,

1714
01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:51.030
but it doesn't give you, you know, that kind of impact sense.

1715
01:34:51.330 --> 01:34:55.230
And I've suggested that we only have small motors, small batteries,

1716
01:34:55.231 --> 01:34:58.370
so you can't put really hefty things, a forced feedbacks.

1717
01:34:58.670 --> 01:35:02.000
<v 0>But I've suggested that there might be something if you are winding up a spring</v>

1718
01:35:02.001 --> 01:35:06.950
in some way there that a very sharp pop of feedback could give you that sense

1719
01:35:06.951 --> 01:35:07.784
where uh,

1720
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:12.020
there's a lot of sort of a kinesiology things where a little hit in some way

1721
01:35:12.170 --> 01:35:13.850
will almost make you retract your hand.

1722
01:35:13.851 --> 01:35:18.020
And I kind of hand wavy suggest that boxing games might really benefit from

1723
01:35:18.021 --> 01:35:18.890
something like that.

1724
01:35:18.891 --> 01:35:23.270
So you throw the punch and you feel a pop in the palm of your hand and that

1725
01:35:23.271 --> 01:35:26.600
gives a much better sense of, you've actually connected for something. Well,

1726
01:35:26.601 --> 01:35:31.340
I think a great solution would actually be real boxing glove with more internals

1727
01:35:31.670 --> 01:35:35.690
because first of all it would aid in your exercise because it would be heavy.

1728
01:35:35.691 --> 01:35:39.890
Like if you could get an 18 ounce boxing glove and as you're moving here,

1729
01:35:39.891 --> 01:35:43.730
you're pushing that weight in the air, you really get a great workout that way.

1730
01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:47.570
Sometimes my son and I will take out strap on weights on our shoulders or in our

1731
01:35:47.571 --> 01:35:49.110
arms for a beat Saber. And yeah,

1732
01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:51.860
that really does make you think if you've got five pound weights there,

1733
01:35:51.861 --> 01:35:55.130
you're really thinking about not flicking but finding the optimal looping

1734
01:35:55.131 --> 01:35:58.700
pattern that goes through everything. That's kind of Andrei for good shoulders.

1735
01:35:58.701 --> 01:36:01.910
Yeah. Shoulders especially, you know, keeping him up like that. You know,

1736
01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:06.020
the boxing thing would be great and you have plenty of room inside that glove to

1737
01:36:06.021 --> 01:36:09.510
put some sort of a haptic feedback system so that you know,

1738
01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:14.060
as you did make contact with the thing, it gave you a sense of it in your hand.

1739
01:36:14.490 --> 01:36:14.840
Um,

1740
01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:18.470
the other thing I was thinking of in terms of martial arts is that I know you

1741
01:36:18.471 --> 01:36:22.960
have a background in martial arts grappling martial arts, right? Yeah. Yeah. Um,

1742
01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:28.540
that wouldn't be so good for that unless you had some sort of a working dummy

1743
01:36:29.210 --> 01:36:32.480
that was programmed that I think could be possible. Yeah.

1744
01:36:32.481 --> 01:36:35.630
I actually made a pitch that what I would like to see from a martial arts

1745
01:36:35.631 --> 01:36:40.631
standpoint there is immersive instructionals where the I am when you set up the

1746
01:36:41.031 --> 01:36:45.050
modern camera's right for the one 80 stereo I am VR.

1747
01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:48.470
It does give you this extra sense of depth that for a lot of things like if

1748
01:36:48.471 --> 01:36:49.760
you're looking at instructional,

1749
01:36:49.761 --> 01:36:52.970
sometimes it's a little hard to see exactly where the hands are in the different

1750
01:36:52.971 --> 01:36:53.481
areas.

1751
01:36:53.481 --> 01:36:57.890
And I think that there's some value for a lot of training aspects for virtual

1752
01:36:57.891 --> 01:36:59.480
reality. And in fact that's like Walmarts,

1753
01:36:59.481 --> 01:37:02.900
you doing a ton of work with that and there are a lot of companies that I am,

1754
01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:07.370
one of the side effects of that of putting a VR headset on is you are forced to

1755
01:37:07.371 --> 01:37:10.880
pay attention where if you're a company like Walmart training people,

1756
01:37:10.881 --> 01:37:13.040
you expect, most people wind up having their phone out.

1757
01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.250
They're not paying attention but put them inside the headset they have,

1758
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:19.100
it's almost the clockwork orange stretching in the eyes out.

1759
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:20.900
They have no choice but to pay attention.

1760
01:37:20.901 --> 01:37:23.840
But if it's important and you're training them for something that matters,

1761
01:37:24.050 --> 01:37:25.760
this is a, you know what you want.

1762
01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.720
But when I was thinking about things like I am, I am,

1763
01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:34.490
you know like I remember watching some judo instructionals for things and like

1764
01:37:34.491 --> 01:37:38.480
male Olympian level stuff. It just goes by so fast you just blink and it's gone.

1765
01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:42.530
I but a lot of things that I did in VR for some of the video stuff was giving

1766
01:37:42.531 --> 01:37:47.060
you this almost super power sense of time where you freeze frame and then being

1767
01:37:47.061 --> 01:37:50.510
able to like slowly frame forward, frame back, jog forward.

1768
01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:53.480
And when you've got an immersive sense here that really feels like an

1769
01:37:53.481 --> 01:37:58.020
interesting godlike power, you're sitting here just like stop time, step, step,

1770
01:37:58.021 --> 01:38:00.990
step, roll back, look closely at it, you know,

1771
01:38:00.991 --> 01:38:05.340
run forward and almost anything physical that you want to train people to do is

1772
01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:07.440
going to have some benefits for things like that.

1773
01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:08.670
And that's something that we're,

1774
01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:12.450
we're still just really at the early days of exploring that for making a

1775
01:38:12.451 --> 01:38:15.960
difference where people's training. Yeah. I think sparring, um,

1776
01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:21.020
you could have something that would throw strikes at you and you could move away

1777
01:38:21.841 --> 01:38:25.830
from those strikes and hit it leg kick it, do things along those lines.

1778
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:29.430
The problem would be that you're not hitting anything because the only problem,

1779
01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:31.980
yeah. But there's certainly some valuable things you could do there.

1780
01:38:31.981 --> 01:38:34.640
And I have a friend that has a stick fighting background.

1781
01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:36.420
When I showed him beat Saber, he was like, oh,

1782
01:38:36.421 --> 01:38:39.990
immediately you have to do some stick training thing for this. And yeah,

1783
01:38:40.050 --> 01:38:42.270
clearly we are, even if you're not hitting things there,

1784
01:38:42.450 --> 01:38:44.130
but that sense of getting the motion,

1785
01:38:44.131 --> 01:38:46.890
figuring out how to move around the situational awareness.

1786
01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:48.900
And there's probably some things to do there.

1787
01:38:49.050 --> 01:38:52.350
It is a stretch to imagine some kind of a head mounted display involved in

1788
01:38:52.351 --> 01:38:56.230
actual grappling in any way, but I that's the big story. Yeah,

1789
01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:58.440
because also you would have the thing,

1790
01:38:59.010 --> 01:39:01.470
the only thing that I was thinking is you could have like a dummy,

1791
01:39:01.530 --> 01:39:06.530
like a robot mechanized dummy that has crude movement like butt but does

1792
01:39:07.981 --> 01:39:12.000
understand it can throw punches and kicks and it's programmed and you could kind

1793
01:39:12.001 --> 01:39:17.001
of spar with this thing in a virtual world and that thing also connects to the

1794
01:39:18.271 --> 01:39:21.690
system so it understands where you are and understands what you're doing with

1795
01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:26.400
the alerts. Robots, punching people, that could go poorly very poorly. Yeah,

1796
01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:28.380
it could go very poorly, but it could also be awesome.

1797
01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:30.330
But you could imagine perhaps again,

1798
01:39:30.331 --> 01:39:33.990
the augmented reality systems that we have today are finding most of their value

1799
01:39:33.991 --> 01:39:36.810
in training and it's for people like jet engine mechanics,

1800
01:39:36.811 --> 01:39:40.710
but you could imagine scenarios like that where you're training something like

1801
01:39:40.711 --> 01:39:44.130
martial arts where it's looking through and it's not making you a fully

1802
01:39:44.131 --> 01:39:47.250
simulated thing, but even if you're working through a drill with someone,

1803
01:39:47.251 --> 01:39:50.970
if it's basically drawing the outline of your arm goes here, your leg goes over.

1804
01:39:50.970 --> 01:39:55.350
Here I am. Again, training is one of the value areas that is working out.

1805
01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:58.050
A visualization is very important in martial arts.

1806
01:39:58.051 --> 01:40:01.380
I mean shadow boxing is already a huge part of a,

1807
01:40:01.381 --> 01:40:06.381
of a strikers learning like learning how to visualize and that's what they're

1808
01:40:07.081 --> 01:40:07.914
doing.

1809
01:40:08.110 --> 01:40:10.440
That's where they're supposed to do and when you see a good fighter shadow

1810
01:40:10.441 --> 01:40:12.960
boxing, they're sort of recreating these movements.

1811
01:40:13.410 --> 01:40:16.800
If you had a virtual reality headset and you had an actual opponent in front of

1812
01:40:16.801 --> 01:40:21.240
you, I think it would be way more lifelike and actually way more beneficial.

1813
01:40:21.570 --> 01:40:25.020
In fact, there are a bunch of football teams that are using VR for some of their

1814
01:40:25.021 --> 01:40:28.710
training, which largely is kind of visualizing the way plays are going to go.

1815
01:40:28.711 --> 01:40:31.830
It's not like they have virtual versions of everything,

1816
01:40:31.831 --> 01:40:36.420
but that sense of being able to get in to see what it would look like when it's

1817
01:40:36.421 --> 01:40:39.870
going right to kind of lock it into your mind has some value.

1818
01:40:40.050 --> 01:40:43.500
It seems to me that something like the void, which is really fun to do,

1819
01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:48.560
you could see in the future as technology improves having quite like

1820
01:40:49.771 --> 01:40:53.190
competitions in some sort of enormous warehouse

1821
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:57.350
<v 1>with other players. That's been one of the real visions from uh,</v>

1822
01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:00.400
from early days. And in fact last year we,

1823
01:41:00.730 --> 01:41:04.960
we cobbled together a demo at oculus connect, our big I kind of convention,

1824
01:41:04.961 --> 01:41:07.180
which is next to the new ones next month here. Uh,

1825
01:41:07.181 --> 01:41:11.080
but we had a large area set up and you had this game called dead and buried,

1826
01:41:11.081 --> 01:41:13.810
which is kind of a cowboys Zombie shooting thing. Uh,

1827
01:41:13.811 --> 01:41:16.780
but we had a bunch of people that could play in one common,

1828
01:41:16.781 --> 01:41:20.830
enormous shared area. And it was amazingly cool. And everybody's like, well,

1829
01:41:20.831 --> 01:41:21.910
when do we get to play with this?

1830
01:41:21.911 --> 01:41:24.700
And this was all held together with duct tape sort of experience.

1831
01:41:24.910 --> 01:41:28.960
That's a lot of hard work to turn it real. But this warehouse scale stuff,

1832
01:41:28.961 --> 01:41:31.990
there are a number of companies that are trying to do this with various bits of

1833
01:41:31.991 --> 01:41:36.580
technology. I actually pulled something that idea of I, that was,

1834
01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:38.201
you know, where you could set up,

1835
01:41:38.201 --> 01:41:41.140
people are crouching behind real things in their virtual headset.

1836
01:41:41.140 --> 01:41:43.630
This is all kind of Zombie Western themed stuff.

1837
01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:47.080
And they can put their hand on real things there. They can move around,

1838
01:41:47.081 --> 01:41:51.070
draw a beat on people. And then you've got another person there with a tablet,

1839
01:41:51.071 --> 01:41:53.020
which is a window into the virtual world.

1840
01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.560
So they could look at that and see the whole, uh,

1841
01:41:55.630 --> 01:41:59.170
the way it's all drawn in style, the way that people are rendered inside it.

1842
01:41:59.590 --> 01:42:00.790
So there is, yeah,

1843
01:42:00.791 --> 01:42:05.050
this is again the amazing stuff you can do outside of your home where you get

1844
01:42:05.051 --> 01:42:08.200
the VR stuff that you wind up doing inside your home and then you figure out

1845
01:42:08.201 --> 01:42:11.710
what things can you do if you're willing to set up a dedicated place space.

1846
01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:14.500
And Yeah, this is people not moving around too much.

1847
01:42:14.501 --> 01:42:16.330
It's mostly kind of a cover based thing.

1848
01:42:16.630 --> 01:42:21.580
But there are companies that have people kind of charging around in pads and you

1849
01:42:21.581 --> 01:42:25.030
know, with a virtual world that they can skin and all sorts of different ways.

1850
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:27.550
And that's, it's all exciting and as, oh,

1851
01:42:27.551 --> 01:42:30.700
so here's what we're getting an image of what it looks like to the people that

1852
01:42:30.701 --> 01:42:31.420
are playing it.

1853
01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:36.420
So and as things get more and more accurate in terms of what you're seeing and

1854
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:37.900
more realistic,

1855
01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:42.760
you could conceivably be jumping up and down on boxes and running off ladders

1856
01:42:42.761 --> 01:42:46.300
and things along those lines and actually doing it in the virtual world as well

1857
01:42:46.301 --> 01:42:48.880
as in the real world. Yeah. So right now, like if you've done the void,

1858
01:42:48.881 --> 01:42:51.770
you can tell there's like a little gap between reality and you know,

1859
01:42:51.771 --> 01:42:55.630
you wouldn't want to do like a diving grab at a ladder rung, but it's,

1860
01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:59.230
you can see that there are things that we need to fix to get there,

1861
01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:02.740
but that's all possible. There's no can't be done sort of thing there.

1862
01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:05.500
And eventually you won't even need to be holding a controller.

1863
01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:08.680
It'll be able to track your whole body just from cameras and work,

1864
01:43:08.681 --> 01:43:11.290
all the kind of computer vision magic out from that.

1865
01:43:11.530 --> 01:43:16.060
And you will then be able to set up these wonderful skin virtual environments.

1866
01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:16.451
Yeah,

1867
01:43:16.451 --> 01:43:21.451
that's why I was thinking like East sports in terms of like an actual sports

1868
01:43:21.511 --> 01:43:22.000
sport,

1869
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:27.000
like e-sports in terms of like doing something on a soccer field with a bunch of

1870
01:43:27.191 --> 01:43:29.840
people with virtual reality and they're playing some sort of heart,

1871
01:43:29.890 --> 01:43:34.660
horrific nightmare dystopian environment, Zombie game,

1872
01:43:34.661 --> 01:43:37.960
like whatever, you know, fill in the blank with your imagination. Yeah,

1873
01:43:37.961 --> 01:43:42.400
that's totally going to be here. Wow. That's how far away are we from that?

1874
01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:48.370
So a lot of it depends on kind of company plans where we don't have people

1875
01:43:48.371 --> 01:43:50.920
pester us about the, the technical hooks for things like,

1876
01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:53.060
and the people that are doing it themselves, like the void,

1877
01:43:53.061 --> 01:43:56.600
they put their own tracking technology on top of it because I,

1878
01:43:56.601 --> 01:43:59.900
ours isn't set up publicly in a way that they can do that.

1879
01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:02.240
So it's a lot of work for people to do it.

1880
01:44:02.241 --> 01:44:06.170
We will eventually commercialize it so that you can set things up more easily

1881
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:08.180
out of the box I am.

1882
01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:11.630
But a lot of these then become entrepreneurial business plans of like, okay,

1883
01:44:11.631 --> 01:44:15.620
who's going to go raise the the tens of millions of dollars to set up and do it?

1884
01:44:15.621 --> 01:44:17.870
Right. But it's on the cusp of being,

1885
01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:22.250
it's not a technical problem now. It's not a technical impossibility.

1886
01:44:22.251 --> 01:44:24.080
No new research really needs to be done,

1887
01:44:24.081 --> 01:44:26.090
but there's still lots of challenges to work out.

1888
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:29.960
So it's more about figuring out if you can get the business plan to close,

1889
01:44:29.961 --> 01:44:31.490
you can make the technology work.

1890
01:44:32.330 --> 01:44:34.970
How do you have time to do other things?

1891
01:44:34.971 --> 01:44:37.160
Like how did you get involved in grappling?

1892
01:44:37.161 --> 01:44:40.360
How do you have time to turbocharge Ferrari's? Like where,

1893
01:44:40.361 --> 01:44:43.070
where do you come up with the extra time to do all those other things?

1894
01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:45.380
So you know, I like to tell people that I,

1895
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:48.670
one of my pitches is like you should always get enough sleep like I am,

1896
01:44:48.770 --> 01:44:52.310
I do not work well. Like I said, I can't work more than 13 hours if I,

1897
01:44:52.311 --> 01:44:55.040
if I don't get eight hours of sleep, I also start falling down.

1898
01:44:55.250 --> 01:44:59.120
But there's a lot of hours left in the week after your eight hours of sleep

1899
01:44:59.121 --> 01:45:03.380
there. I like on the martial arts side, it's, it is kind of interesting where I,

1900
01:45:03.570 --> 01:45:08.210
I wrestled in junior high and I did sort of Midwest YNC a judo back then.

1901
01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:10.550
I wasn't any kind of a phenom. I was, you know,

1902
01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:12.530
sort of a second place finisher for most of it.

1903
01:45:12.531 --> 01:45:14.900
But it was still weird enough that the co kind of,

1904
01:45:14.901 --> 01:45:18.110
the school geek was pretty good at that type of stuff. I am,

1905
01:45:18.410 --> 01:45:20.330
I messed up my knees a little bit doing that.

1906
01:45:20.330 --> 01:45:24.260
And in retrospect I wish I had pushed on a little bit more with that.

1907
01:45:24.650 --> 01:45:28.430
Where in recent years I sorta tried to challenge the wrestler ethos,

1908
01:45:28.431 --> 01:45:32.510
the embrace the grind to people where it's just like discipline is something.

1909
01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:35.840
I was always obsessed, but I could've done with a little more discipline.

1910
01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:39.470
I am when I was younger and I probably would've been better off if I had,

1911
01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:43.700
I kind of stuck through some of the, the wrestling side of things I am,

1912
01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:47.780
but I got back into it in my thirties where it was kind of something,

1913
01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:50.060
I'm just again, one of the between projects. Well,

1914
01:45:50.061 --> 01:45:52.070
what interesting thing do I want to take a look at?

1915
01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:57.050
And I looked up some of the local judo places and it was interesting where the

1916
01:45:57.051 --> 01:45:59.240
place that I wound out, it was called Besera judo.

1917
01:45:59.420 --> 01:46:03.170
And I had come again from Midwest y MCA judo, which is just kind of, you know,

1918
01:46:03.171 --> 01:46:07.190
you go and you learn your moves and it's, I, it's not that serious,

1919
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:11.780
but this was a tie, you know, he was a Cuban Olympia and that, and it's still,

1920
01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:15.500
Judah's mostly kids you get mostly I kind of teenage kids coming in,

1921
01:46:15.501 --> 01:46:18.770
but I go in there and he's just yelling at the kids and berating them.

1922
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:23.090
It's like, get up, grab the g and all this stuff. I'm much more serious,

1923
01:46:23.150 --> 01:46:26.090
a training environment. But I got in there and it's like, hey,

1924
01:46:26.091 --> 01:46:28.950
I did wrestling and judo back when I was a teenager, you know,

1925
01:46:28.970 --> 01:46:31.070
20 years ago at that point. Uh,

1926
01:46:31.071 --> 01:46:34.940
but I got on the mat and rolled and I had enough kind of wrestler instinct

1927
01:46:34.941 --> 01:46:36.740
memories that I, you know, I'd go down,

1928
01:46:36.741 --> 01:46:40.340
I'd base out and then the guy would roll me over and Armbar me like three times

1929
01:46:40.341 --> 01:46:42.500
in a row. Cause you know, early teens,

1930
01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:46.970
I YMC they didn't teach you the arm bars or anything. I am, but that was enough.

1931
01:46:46.971 --> 01:46:48.800
It's like, Hey, I was having a good time with that.

1932
01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:51.630
And so I did what I always do on something. I studied, you know,

1933
01:46:51.631 --> 01:46:56.250
I went and said, well, okay, I, you know, let's learn these armbars and things.

1934
01:46:56.250 --> 01:46:57.600
And I got the, you know,

1935
01:46:57.630 --> 01:47:01.680
the instructionals and the tapes and started working my way back through that

1936
01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:03.420
and got pretty good at that.

1937
01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:08.450
And then my wife for Christmas one year got me a year of private lessons with

1938
01:47:08.881 --> 01:47:11.110
Carlos Machado. Yeah.

1939
01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:15.540
And that was where I certainly took me up several levels.

1940
01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:19.380
I was in a situation where I had, uh, Armadillo Aerospace,

1941
01:47:19.381 --> 01:47:21.720
my rocketry company at the time, we had enough space.

1942
01:47:21.721 --> 01:47:26.721
So I had a whole bunch of mats set out there and I would work with Carlos and

1943
01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:29.430
one of the other guys there on Saturdays.

1944
01:47:29.490 --> 01:47:32.520
And he really tuned me up where I had, uh,

1945
01:47:32.670 --> 01:47:36.390
I had a really good straight arm bar that was my goto move for everything and

1946
01:47:36.510 --> 01:47:39.750
against most of the judo people that I, it was just,

1947
01:47:39.930 --> 01:47:41.790
most of them wouldn't know what hit them on that.

1948
01:47:41.791 --> 01:47:44.070
I would just be able to get that over and over again.

1949
01:47:44.370 --> 01:47:47.940
And there was a period there where I had I am, you know,

1950
01:47:47.941 --> 01:47:50.370
I'd go mix it up at the club on one day.

1951
01:47:50.371 --> 01:47:54.780
And then I had judo with one of my coaches and other day and then Carlos on

1952
01:47:54.781 --> 01:47:57.780
Saturday. And there was a period there where I was pretty dangerous.

1953
01:47:57.810 --> 01:48:00.390
Although I was, I was always one of the,

1954
01:48:00.391 --> 01:48:02.950
I never did work out proper flow kind of,

1955
01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:06.900
but just the way to just kind of roll effortlessly. I was always a very tense,

1956
01:48:07.110 --> 01:48:10.730
aggressive. I kind of grappler and uh,

1957
01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:13.260
an interesting thing about that where you know, you know,

1958
01:48:13.261 --> 01:48:17.130
from rolling with any of the really good guys, I like rolling with Carlos,

1959
01:48:17.310 --> 01:48:18.720
it's always happy fun,

1960
01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:22.050
he's smiling and you always think you should be able to do something but just

1961
01:48:22.051 --> 01:48:26.550
actually can't. But in contrast with that, one time when I went to Japan,

1962
01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:28.020
I stopped in at the Coda cod,

1963
01:48:28.021 --> 01:48:32.400
you know the home of judo got at the ancestral land of judo and you know it's

1964
01:48:32.401 --> 01:48:33.180
funny.

1965
01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:37.230
Were talking with a friend about that I that also did some judo where you'd

1966
01:48:37.231 --> 01:48:39.660
think that that should be like going to the Jedi temple.

1967
01:48:39.661 --> 01:48:41.040
It should be this logistic thing,

1968
01:48:41.041 --> 01:48:43.950
but it looks like an old middle school when you go there until you actually get

1969
01:48:43.951 --> 01:48:48.870
out onto the mats there. But I remember I did some rolling with an old judo guy,

1970
01:48:48.871 --> 01:48:49.051
you know,

1971
01:48:49.051 --> 01:48:53.340
gray haired guy practicing his English with me and it was shocking how different

1972
01:48:53.341 --> 01:48:57.720
it was versus rolling with Carlos were still, he was way, way better than me,

1973
01:48:57.721 --> 01:49:00.270
but it was a sense where when I was rolling with him,

1974
01:49:00.271 --> 01:49:02.910
I just felt I had no options. Like for whatever reason,

1975
01:49:02.911 --> 01:49:06.840
I was just all with bound up and I couldn't do anything until eventually gets my

1976
01:49:06.841 --> 01:49:11.280
arm and I tap as opposed to the fluidness with Carlos where I'm like running

1977
01:49:11.281 --> 01:49:14.130
around thinking, oh if I just do this, maybe I'll be able to get, you know,

1978
01:49:14.131 --> 01:49:18.870
get around playing. Yeah, yeah. Just, he was very famous for playing.

1979
01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:23.340
Oh my instructors, his brother John, you said you messed your knees up.

1980
01:49:24.250 --> 01:49:25.600
So of course back then I,

1981
01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:29.250
I had tweaked my knees in some way where it wasn't bad enough that I had,

1982
01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:31.980
maybe at the time I should have had surgery, but I did.

1983
01:49:31.981 --> 01:49:33.830
And I had a little Jujitsu training. No,

1984
01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:37.230
this was actually back in one in wrestling and one in judo when I was a

1985
01:49:37.231 --> 01:49:37.831
teenager.

1986
01:49:37.831 --> 01:49:40.860
And so that's why I've still got these little stick legs cause I could never

1987
01:49:40.861 --> 01:49:44.190
lift what, you know, heavy weights because my knees gave me problems.

1988
01:49:44.191 --> 01:49:48.100
So I wound up with strong upper body and really nothing on the, on

1989
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:51.580
<v 0>the legs. Did you get your knees MRIs? I never did. You know, again,</v>

1990
01:49:51.581 --> 01:49:55.840
this was back in the [inaudible]. You not embrace MRIs? Well, so again,

1991
01:49:55.841 --> 01:49:59.350
this was the eighties [inaudible] yeah, they did. But it's like, you know,

1992
01:49:59.351 --> 01:50:03.370
I was not, you know, it was teenage me back then and it was like, OK,

1993
01:50:03.371 --> 01:50:05.860
my knees hurt and my knees hurt a little bit. No.

1994
01:50:05.861 --> 01:50:08.530
So by the time I was in my thirties, they generally felt okay.

1995
01:50:08.531 --> 01:50:11.860
So that was when I decided I'm going to go back into judo and I,

1996
01:50:11.861 --> 01:50:16.120
and it's been all right for quite a while and it's, you know, it's interesting.

1997
01:50:16.121 --> 01:50:18.910
There were a lot of people are surprised that I care about this.

1998
01:50:18.911 --> 01:50:21.820
Like I tweeted about going to the UFC in Dallas and there were a number of

1999
01:50:21.821 --> 01:50:25.370
people that are like, you know, this is shocking and disappointing that you,

2000
01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:30.110
you know, that you like, you know, seeing people harm each other. Hi, add.

2001
01:50:30.670 --> 01:50:34.690
There's one interesting thing at the club where there was a new kid that came in

2002
01:50:34.691 --> 01:50:38.710
and I could tell he was probably here because his dad thought he should toughen

2003
01:50:38.711 --> 01:50:42.910
up a little bit. Uh, you know, a very not forceful person. I am.

2004
01:50:43.300 --> 01:50:45.520
And when he found out who I was, he said,

2005
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:48.610
what is someone like you doing here?

2006
01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:53.740
And it just didn't compute for him that I somebody that was a technical I kind

2007
01:50:53.741 --> 01:50:58.240
of brainy sort of person would appreciate like kind of rolling at a judo club

2008
01:50:58.630 --> 01:51:02.690
and, and I probably agree with his, his father that there's a,

2009
01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:04.600
there is a value to getting, uh,

2010
01:51:04.690 --> 01:51:08.380
getting people into a sense where they felt the physicality of it.

2011
01:51:08.381 --> 01:51:12.370
They've had to push as hard as they can and maybe not get through and learn

2012
01:51:12.371 --> 01:51:12.730
that.

2013
01:51:12.730 --> 01:51:17.200
Find the extents of what you can and can't do and what the limits of your body

2014
01:51:17.201 --> 01:51:20.740
are. And I think that's good for almost everybody to get that at some level.

2015
01:51:20.741 --> 01:51:24.100
I mean, even if you don't care about the competition and the winning,

2016
01:51:24.370 --> 01:51:27.850
but kind of knowing what's possible and the different limits there I think is

2017
01:51:27.851 --> 01:51:28.630
valuable.

2018
01:51:28.630 --> 01:51:33.010
I agree wholeheartedly and I love the fact that you got into it because I would

2019
01:51:33.011 --> 01:51:37.360
like to encourage so many more people to experience that there are,

2020
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:40.450
there's many things going on simultaneously.

2021
01:51:40.451 --> 01:51:44.110
There's a technical aspects of the various moves that have to understand the

2022
01:51:44.111 --> 01:51:46.870
points of leverage and how to get to a superior position.

2023
01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:50.500
But there's also the physical exertion aspect where you're,

2024
01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:55.210
you're managing your body's resources and you have a finite amount of energy and

2025
01:51:55.211 --> 01:51:56.890
you can't burn it all out quickly.

2026
01:51:57.070 --> 01:52:01.600
So there's this sort of management game that you're playing and then on top of

2027
01:52:01.601 --> 01:52:06.430
it, it's like you, you have to be able to be uncomfortable. It's,

2028
01:52:06.490 --> 01:52:10.300
you have to be able to put yourself in a good state of mind while you're

2029
01:52:10.301 --> 01:52:11.134
uncomfortable.

2030
01:52:11.230 --> 01:52:16.230
And so many of those lessons learn from that are applicable to everyday life and

2031
01:52:17.471 --> 01:52:21.610
they, they give you a higher threshold for discomfort,

2032
01:52:21.611 --> 01:52:26.611
a higher threshold for pushing through obstacles and understanding boundaries

2033
01:52:26.981 --> 01:52:30.640
and how to overcome them and how to increase your physical engine,

2034
01:52:30.641 --> 01:52:34.930
how to strengthen your, your meet vehicle lesson about, you know,

2035
01:52:34.931 --> 01:52:37.300
sometimes you're the hammer and sometimes you're the nail.

2036
01:52:37.301 --> 01:52:41.020
And a lot of people do go through much of their life. I am, you know,

2037
01:52:41.021 --> 01:52:45.740
without ever really internalizing that where it's always a participation trophy

2038
01:52:45.741 --> 01:52:46.310
or whatever.

2039
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:49.940
<v 1>But it's like sometimes you get your ass kicked ad that can bring it.</v>

2040
01:52:49.941 --> 01:52:52.820
You can come back stronger after. Yes. It's good for you.

2041
01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:54.910
It's actually good for you. And it's a,

2042
01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:59.270
an amazing comraderies particularly in grappling. I've found that grappling,

2043
01:52:59.271 --> 01:53:02.180
the comradery is much nicer than striking.

2044
01:53:02.430 --> 01:53:05.720
I came from a striking background because the thing about striking all there is

2045
01:53:05.721 --> 01:53:06.441
a camaraderie,

2046
01:53:06.441 --> 01:53:09.200
a deep camaraderie with people that you would go and compete with.

2047
01:53:09.650 --> 01:53:11.300
You're hurting each other. Yeah.

2048
01:53:11.450 --> 01:53:15.200
Whereas in grappling you're not really hurting each other the same way and you

2049
01:53:15.201 --> 01:53:19.250
can kind of do it full blast and you appreciate each other because iron truly

2050
01:53:19.251 --> 01:53:23.120
does sharpen iron in that there are so many times I remember just driving back

2051
01:53:23.121 --> 01:53:26.540
from the IMF, from judo where I just have the big smile on my face.

2052
01:53:26.541 --> 01:53:30.560
Just thinking that was really great. And it's like the judo club was in AI,

2053
01:53:30.710 --> 01:53:33.620
you know, a little bit of a sketchier area of town. So my wife was always like,

2054
01:53:33.621 --> 01:53:36.230
you can never drive your Ferrari's to judo practice.

2055
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.750
So how did you get involved with turbocharging Ferrari's? Like what?

2056
01:53:41.990 --> 01:53:44.480
Because that's a no, no. In the Ferrari world. Right.

2057
01:53:44.481 --> 01:53:46.310
And definitely the Porsche world,

2058
01:53:46.311 --> 01:53:49.850
they sort of have always encouraged modifications of the cars.

2059
01:53:49.851 --> 01:53:52.580
Even from the early days, people have hot rotted Porsches,

2060
01:53:52.581 --> 01:53:56.270
but when you fuck around with Ferrari, people get really upset at you.

2061
01:53:56.400 --> 01:54:00.770
So my path through the cars is interesting. Where I, as a younger kid,

2062
01:54:00.771 --> 01:54:02.270
I was not a car guy. You know,

2063
01:54:02.271 --> 01:54:04.910
I had a stepbrother with the Lamborghini posters and all of that,

2064
01:54:04.911 --> 01:54:07.880
and I just did not care. You know, I was all about computers.

2065
01:54:07.881 --> 01:54:12.140
I knew what I wanted. I would much rather have the, you know, a new apple.

2066
01:54:12.141 --> 01:54:14.930
Then I look at a Porsche or something like that.

2067
01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:19.280
And my first car was this very boring Joe Volkswagen Jetta. And it's like, Hey,

2068
01:54:19.281 --> 01:54:22.770
it drives me around. I was just fine. Somebody wrecked, you know,

2069
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:27.690
ran into it and looking around for the next car. I, my,

2070
01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:30.950
I like uncle in law or something. Had I,

2071
01:54:31.490 --> 01:54:35.360
I worked on cars and he had an old British MGB in his garage.

2072
01:54:35.361 --> 01:54:38.750
And you're familiar with British sports cars and you know,

2073
01:54:38.751 --> 01:54:41.930
in many ways they're just terrible, terrible cars. But I fell in love with it.

2074
01:54:41.931 --> 01:54:45.170
It was just beautiful. And I, and I started,

2075
01:54:45.171 --> 01:54:48.050
I had to learn all about cars at that point because you know,

2076
01:54:48.051 --> 01:54:51.050
the clutch master cylinder broke the very first day that I had it.

2077
01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:54.380
And just everything is breaking all the time and it's a pathetic weak little

2078
01:54:54.381 --> 01:54:55.510
engine. But you're like, oh wait,

2079
01:54:55.511 --> 01:54:58.940
can make it a little bit faster by doing some of these different things.

2080
01:54:59.210 --> 01:55:02.210
And I went through the, like many other things that I've had in my life.

2081
01:55:02.210 --> 01:55:05.360
I go through sort of this larval learning stage where I start reading the hot

2082
01:55:05.361 --> 01:55:08.570
rod magazines and graduate to circle track or something. And again,

2083
01:55:08.571 --> 01:55:11.980
this is Midwest Missouri where I grew up, I,

2084
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:14.570
so I learned all the basic ins and outs of the cars.

2085
01:55:14.571 --> 01:55:16.940
There I am and then I go on,

2086
01:55:16.941 --> 01:55:21.200
I started software and start getting successful and I do the sort of natural

2087
01:55:21.201 --> 01:55:25.400
upgrade from an MGB after it. I, after it gearbox eats itself,

2088
01:55:25.401 --> 01:55:26.240
I buy a Miata,

2089
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:29.630
which is sort of the modern slick version of a British sports car.

2090
01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:33.770
And that was going along, I, you know, okay. For me, I enjoyed it,

2091
01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:35.600
but almost on a whim,

2092
01:55:35.601 --> 01:55:40.040
one time I went into the Ferrari dealership in Dallas and here I am at,

2093
01:55:40.090 --> 01:55:42.470
I thought I was like Wolfen Stein days.

2094
01:55:42.471 --> 01:55:47.310
So I guess I was I 20 years or 20 years old or something and I'm in a tee shirt

2095
01:55:47.311 --> 01:55:50.100
and ripped jeans and I walk into the Ferrari dealership and say,

2096
01:55:50.101 --> 01:55:53.760
kind of sell me a Ferrari. I am. And they humored me and they,

2097
01:55:53.761 --> 01:55:55.560
I kind of walked around. I, you know,

2098
01:55:55.561 --> 01:55:57.290
we looked at the different things and a lot of the,

2099
01:55:57.570 --> 01:56:02.010
the Ferrari's at that time in the early nineties, I'm, I am, you know,

2100
01:56:02.011 --> 01:56:06.390
three 48 and Monte yells, I didn't really like all that much, but, uh,

2101
01:56:06.391 --> 01:56:09.570
one of the ones in the backer, Raj, they had a, for a three 28,

2102
01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:12.230
which is kind of, you know, the fancier version of the,

2103
01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:14.520
the magnum Pi car from the earlier days.

2104
01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:17.910
And I thought it was just the most beautiful car I am, you know, this is,

2105
01:56:18.180 --> 01:56:21.540
I really wanted to get it. And when I wound up buying it,

2106
01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:25.350
it was interesting because the salesman gave me a little bit of a talk where he

2107
01:56:25.351 --> 01:56:26.520
said, you know,

2108
01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:29.800
if someone in a corvette pulls up next to you and that kind of rubs their

2109
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:32.160
engine, just Kinda hang your hand out the window.

2110
01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:34.230
Like you got a thousand horsepower under the hood.

2111
01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:37.530
And that didn't sit well with me. That was like this idea of like,

2112
01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:42.150
he kind of knew that those cars weren't actually as fast as they looked or I,

2113
01:56:42.151 --> 01:56:42.421
you know,

2114
01:56:42.421 --> 01:56:47.070
or their reputation would have and that there's this play that you would do to

2115
01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:51.750
just kind of not get into a situation where it doesn't hold up to its looks.

2116
01:56:52.290 --> 01:56:54.600
And I was like, no, I don't like that.

2117
01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:59.490
And so I wound up kind of calling around to all the different shops in Dallas

2118
01:56:59.491 --> 01:57:00.660
where it's like, okay,

2119
01:57:00.661 --> 01:57:03.120
I've got a Ferrari three 28 I want to make it a little faster.

2120
01:57:03.121 --> 01:57:05.730
And I had done all this stuff on my MGB back in the day.

2121
01:57:05.731 --> 01:57:06.640
So I know the things they,

2122
01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:11.140
that you wind up doing with the intake and exhaust and Cam timings and uh,

2123
01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:14.430
the options there. But they were all basically horrified. Like,

2124
01:57:14.431 --> 01:57:16.440
you just don't do this to a Ferrari.

2125
01:57:16.441 --> 01:57:18.870
And like the only suggestion that came out was a,

2126
01:57:18.871 --> 01:57:21.780
we can put an Italian two B exhaust on it and that'll, you know,

2127
01:57:22.130 --> 01:57:24.690
don't make it sound better and maybe it's good for a couple of horsepower or

2128
01:57:24.691 --> 01:57:28.790
something. Those are things that people largely do for the aesthetics. I've,

2129
01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:32.970
you know, whether it's oral or visual with it. Uh, and that's not a big move.

2130
01:57:33.330 --> 01:57:38.130
And right at about that time, John Romero at the office had I picked up,

2131
01:57:38.131 --> 01:57:42.330
there was a copy of Turbo magazine back in the day and there was an article

2132
01:57:42.331 --> 01:57:47.331
about an old replica kind of race car and done by a local company in Dallas

2133
01:57:47.881 --> 01:57:52.230
called nor would auto sport or nor at auto craft. And I thought, well,

2134
01:57:52.231 --> 01:57:54.750
he's right here. I'll call him up. And so I call him up,

2135
01:57:54.810 --> 01:57:57.690
I get Bob Knorr rode on the phone and I start going through my pitch.

2136
01:57:57.690 --> 01:58:01.050
I've got a three 28 I'd like it to be a little fast or what do you think we can,

2137
01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:04.620
and before I could even finish he said we'll put a turbo on it. Like yeah,

2138
01:58:04.621 --> 01:58:08.430
now we're talking. And that was the beginning of,

2139
01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:11.220
I am kind of all the science project experiments.

2140
01:58:11.250 --> 01:58:13.830
What does a three 28 have standard horsepower?

2141
01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:17.220
I think in the the best probably the European trim,

2142
01:58:17.221 --> 01:58:19.440
it was probably around 300 horsepower.

2143
01:58:19.441 --> 01:58:21.150
And would you get it up to the turbocharger?

2144
01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:25.650
So we went through a number of steps of this and this is all swapping out all

2145
01:58:25.651 --> 01:58:28.680
the computer electronics. I'm different turbos.

2146
01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:33.860
And eventually I melted the engine in it when it was at like 500 or so.

2147
01:58:33.991 --> 01:58:37.380
And I went through a long history of melting many pistons in the different

2148
01:58:37.381 --> 01:58:39.630
devices in different cars.

2149
01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:44.500
But that wound up this decade long set of interesting experiments there.

2150
01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:48.280
That was my gateway drug into working on this. And we're like, okay,

2151
01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:51.070
we've made all this power in this system. I,

2152
01:58:51.370 --> 01:58:54.220
we know it's kind of at the limits of a lot of things in the chassis.

2153
01:58:54.221 --> 01:58:55.750
After we melted the engine there,

2154
01:58:55.751 --> 01:58:59.050
we tuned it back down a little bit and that's the way so many engineering things

2155
01:58:59.051 --> 01:59:01.030
wind up going. You go it until it breaks.

2156
01:59:01.031 --> 01:59:03.520
Then you dial it back a little bit and you stay there.

2157
01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:07.310
It must have been radically fast for three 28 it's very light, right? Yes.

2158
01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:10.540
The curb weight, ah, lately it's not super light.

2159
01:59:10.541 --> 01:59:13.720
I think it was like 3,200 pounds and uh, but yeah, it, it,

2160
01:59:13.721 --> 01:59:16.150
you could really feel it rear back when you went into it.

2161
01:59:16.210 --> 01:59:20.910
And I'm at high speed is a little bit Dardy if you start getting up in one 54

2162
01:59:21.370 --> 01:59:24.610
miles an hour for that. So we thought, well, what's the next level?

2163
01:59:24.611 --> 01:59:25.780
Where do we go from here?

2164
01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:30.160
So I had done a twin turbo job on a Testarossa before,

2165
01:59:30.161 --> 01:59:33.040
which is a much wider car. I, you know, stock,

2166
01:59:33.070 --> 01:59:38.070
they would go 180 190 miles an hour with the normal for our atrium and,

2167
01:59:38.810 --> 01:59:43.000
and it was a bigger five liter flat 12 so there's a lot more possibility for

2168
01:59:43.001 --> 01:59:47.620
doing things there. So I got, I got a Testarossa and we said, all right,

2169
01:59:47.621 --> 01:59:51.640
we're going to do the twin turbo job with inner coolers with the new, you know,

2170
01:59:51.641 --> 01:59:53.470
the new engine management systems.

2171
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:57.400
And we went through this long string of upgrades through this,

2172
01:59:57.401 --> 02:00:00.280
which generally was like, okay, we melted the Pistons,

2173
02:00:00.281 --> 02:00:04.930
we broke the input shaft all these times. But at its top form,

2174
02:00:04.931 --> 02:00:07.240
in peak, I still have the dyno sheet four,

2175
02:00:07.241 --> 02:00:10.150
it was like 1,009 horsepower at the rear wheels.

2176
02:00:10.330 --> 02:00:13.570
None of this crane chorus power talk. This was, I, you know,

2177
02:00:13.630 --> 02:00:16.900
over a thousand horsepower at the Rio reels. And it was amazing.

2178
02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:20.290
That sounds ridiculous. What does standard horsepower with those?

2179
02:00:20.530 --> 02:00:25.180
It was like three 80 or something like God. So it was a huge, huge difference.

2180
02:00:25.390 --> 02:00:27.020
And you had all these things like, you know,

2181
02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:30.600
he couldn't launch like a dragster for our aid gear shifts or you know,

2182
02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:33.790
really gears in a blender sorta thing and you've got a dog leg first.

2183
02:00:33.791 --> 02:00:37.060
So it would not do a really fast zero to 60.

2184
02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:41.710
But if you are on the highway I am and you could just downshift to fourth.

2185
02:00:41.711 --> 02:00:45.430
You could go from 50 to 150 faster than anybody's business.

2186
02:00:45.431 --> 02:00:48.340
It was with that much horsepower. I, you know,

2187
02:00:48.341 --> 02:00:52.420
I would run down superbikes it would, uh, it would just be faster than anybody.

2188
02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:56.470
It was shockingly fast. How did is handsome? Really pretty well,

2189
02:00:56.471 --> 02:00:59.230
so we had bigger tires, some stiffer suspension on it.

2190
02:00:59.231 --> 02:01:02.230
It was not designed to be a, a super track car.

2191
02:01:02.350 --> 02:01:04.930
I had taken all of my Ferrari's to the tracks, but I was no,

2192
02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:08.200
no pretentions about being any kind of an SCCA champion or anything.

2193
02:01:08.201 --> 02:01:11.650
But I could wing them. I could move them around the tracks reasonably well.

2194
02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:15.940
But the main thing about this was this just ungodly amount of power.

2195
02:01:15.941 --> 02:01:19.200
It was this, see Jesus' effect when somebody died,

2196
02:01:19.230 --> 02:01:21.220
takes a ride in and you're like, okay, we're going,

2197
02:01:21.370 --> 02:01:23.680
you ready for this and you have enough space.

2198
02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:26.620
And for all of those years that did software,

2199
02:01:27.130 --> 02:01:29.920
our building was positioned I off of this,

2200
02:01:29.921 --> 02:01:33.910
we had this long highway access road that led down to it and I mostly,

2201
02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:34.900
more often than not,

2202
02:01:34.901 --> 02:01:39.100
I was working kind of night owl hours and this car was so loud.

2203
02:01:39.170 --> 02:01:42.350
I am kind of obnoxious in retrospect, but I am,

2204
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:46.730
I had this personal dragstrip basically every day when I would go there and

2205
02:01:46.731 --> 02:01:48.770
everybody in the building could tell, it's like, oh, John's coming.

2206
02:01:48.771 --> 02:01:51.320
Which was sort of the signal better get to work and look busy by the time he

2207
02:01:51.321 --> 02:01:53.990
gets up here. I bet it was,

2208
02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:56.300
especially in the early days before we got some traction,

2209
02:01:56.301 --> 02:01:58.220
control dialed in it good,

2210
02:01:58.221 --> 02:02:02.270
get really squirrely just because when the boost would come up fast enough on

2211
02:02:02.271 --> 02:02:06.080
there, it would tend to throw the car a little bit sideways. And I'm, you know,

2212
02:02:06.081 --> 02:02:08.660
I'm happy that I can look back and say, I, you know,

2213
02:02:08.661 --> 02:02:12.110
I never spun a car on the ice, one of the big cars on the streets.

2214
02:02:12.111 --> 02:02:16.250
I did spend my little MGB I when I was learning how to drive as a teenager,

2215
02:02:16.251 --> 02:02:19.160
but I never did that with the big Ferrari's on public roads.

2216
02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:20.740
Although there was one time at the,

2217
02:02:20.741 --> 02:02:24.200
the motor sports ranch when I pitched my f 50, like through the Infield,

2218
02:02:24.201 --> 02:02:26.750
just spinning it around over and over. And we're like, well,

2219
02:02:26.751 --> 02:02:30.200
there's the world's most expensive lawn mower now.

2220
02:02:30.201 --> 02:02:33.070
What did you do with those cars? So, uh,

2221
02:02:33.110 --> 02:02:36.560
the first one I gave the three 28 I gave away for the red annihilation

2222
02:02:36.561 --> 02:02:39.970
tournament. So that was I, that fresh one that wasn't,

2223
02:02:40.870 --> 02:02:42.890
so now he wound up, uh, that was,

2224
02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:45.830
there were some pictures of that going around recently where it was a little bit

2225
02:02:45.831 --> 02:02:49.430
weird, sketchy because I, it was a turbocharge theirs,

2226
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:53.780
it really wasn't technically illegal in Dallas. Most of the time I, you know,

2227
02:02:53.781 --> 02:02:55.730
we would make it legal sometimes,

2228
02:02:55.731 --> 02:02:59.390
but much of the time it probably wouldn't have passed an emissions test and it

2229
02:02:59.391 --> 02:03:01.880
really wouldn't have passed a California emissions test.

2230
02:03:01.881 --> 02:03:06.840
So he wound up using it as he had it sort of in the lobby of his company for a

2231
02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:09.710
while is kind of a conversation piece. And he did,

2232
02:03:09.711 --> 02:03:11.180
I think eventually wound up selling it.

2233
02:03:11.181 --> 02:03:15.260
I think I got a message from someone last year that still had it.

2234
02:03:15.261 --> 02:03:17.060
So it's still functional at this point,

2235
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:19.730
which is saying something because it had an early,

2236
02:03:19.731 --> 02:03:24.260
almost one-off Paul tech engine control system that probably no one can do

2237
02:03:24.261 --> 02:03:25.430
anything too right now.

2238
02:03:25.470 --> 02:03:28.250
You'd probably have to completely replace it if something went wrong with it.

2239
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:30.470
The Testarossa. Uh,

2240
02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:35.480
we eventually detuned it a little bit down to a six or 700 horsepower or

2241
02:03:35.481 --> 02:03:40.481
something and somebody bought it from me and I felt he might've been buying more

2242
02:03:41.121 --> 02:03:45.830
car than he should have at that point. Well basically it's going to break again.

2243
02:03:45.831 --> 02:03:48.000
It's going to have problems, you know,

2244
02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:51.320
he wanted it and I think that he got some great satisfaction out of it,

2245
02:03:51.321 --> 02:03:54.450
but I know it broke again on him later and I,

2246
02:03:54.451 --> 02:03:58.290
and I think he had to get rid of it. I know after that then I had a,

2247
02:03:58.291 --> 02:04:01.610
I had a Ferrari f 40, which is beautiful, beautiful car.

2248
02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:05.120
And that was the only car that I didn't really modify. I am,

2249
02:04:05.630 --> 02:04:08.240
all we did was turn the waste gate and closed, lock that off.

2250
02:04:08.241 --> 02:04:11.030
So it was making all basically race trim at 40 there.

2251
02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:16.100
And the afford is an interesting car and that it has, in the, those early days,

2252
02:04:16.101 --> 02:04:19.430
the turbos weren't nearly what they are right now. It was a small engine,

2253
02:04:19.431 --> 02:04:23.240
2.8 liter because it was specked for racing. It really was sort of a race car.

2254
02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:26.720
And if you didn't ring its neck, it was a pretty slow car.

2255
02:04:26.721 --> 02:04:29.480
If you just like idled it off, it felt like a Honda civic.

2256
02:04:29.481 --> 02:04:34.481
It was terrible at the low end you had to really rev it up and slip the clutch

2257
02:04:34.701 --> 02:04:37.100
out, get it up on boost. But it was,

2258
02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:41.190
it was a great car because it was like this amazing race car that you're driving

2259
02:04:41.191 --> 02:04:42.120
around on the road.

2260
02:04:42.121 --> 02:04:44.580
And that was still where it didn't even have internal door handles.

2261
02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:46.890
They had the little pull cord inside there,

2262
02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:50.520
which led to the point where there was one time I was getting it valet parked

2263
02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:53.250
and you could tell the valet that had to go get the car.

2264
02:04:53.251 --> 02:04:55.680
For me it's like this is okay. Highlight of the week.

2265
02:04:55.681 --> 02:04:59.460
He gets to go drive a Ferrari at 40 and he pulls it up and he can't figure out

2266
02:04:59.461 --> 02:05:01.920
how to open the door. So all of his brand, you know,

2267
02:05:01.921 --> 02:05:04.590
everyone else working with him or just kind of looking at him and I had to come

2268
02:05:04.591 --> 02:05:06.480
over and tell them how to to get it out.

2269
02:05:06.481 --> 02:05:10.590
So that went from the highlight to like the worst day of his, his time there.

2270
02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:15.630
Do you still do that? You still have cars like that? So No.

2271
02:05:15.631 --> 02:05:18.680
Right now I am all about the Tesla where I have, I,

2272
02:05:18.770 --> 02:05:22.710
I have a p 100 d and I think it's the best car I've ever owned by far.

2273
02:05:22.711 --> 02:05:26.310
So I've gone through all of these hyper exotics and I love my Tesla.

2274
02:05:26.370 --> 02:05:29.220
I have the same and it's as fast as anything.

2275
02:05:29.250 --> 02:05:33.120
It's the fastest car I've ever driven in my life. So compared to my, you know,

2276
02:05:33.121 --> 02:05:36.330
my supercars there that the Tesla is much quicker off the start,

2277
02:05:36.510 --> 02:05:39.500
which most of the time that you're driving is, you know,

2278
02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:43.890
my point about the talk about how antisocial the old cars were aware I did.

2279
02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:47.820
You could not just go use this. You would have to plan ahead where okay,

2280
02:05:47.821 --> 02:05:49.830
you make sure that you've got enough room.

2281
02:05:49.831 --> 02:05:51.450
If you have a traction issue going here,

2282
02:05:51.451 --> 02:05:54.540
you're going to cover a huge amount of distance. It was so loud,

2283
02:05:54.541 --> 02:05:56.820
you really wouldn't want to do it in most places.

2284
02:05:57.060 --> 02:06:01.440
But the Tesla is so magical where I had one of the first roadsters and one of

2285
02:06:01.441 --> 02:06:05.040
the, when I was letting some other people take it out for drives, I said,

2286
02:06:05.340 --> 02:06:07.470
you're driving a rail gun, which essentially you are,

2287
02:06:07.471 --> 02:06:10.670
it's this electromagnetic pull on the car and you just push,

2288
02:06:11.130 --> 02:06:14.760
push the throttle down and it just goes and it's this amazing feeling and it's

2289
02:06:14.761 --> 02:06:18.570
not antisocial. Every stop sign you stop at, you've got traction control.

2290
02:06:18.571 --> 02:06:19.740
It's not burning rubber.

2291
02:06:20.010 --> 02:06:23.130
You could just floor it every time you stop and it's amazing.

2292
02:06:23.131 --> 02:06:26.400
It just brings a smile to your face. It is this happiness machine.

2293
02:06:26.970 --> 02:06:31.140
While the stunning acceleration is so confusing to people.

2294
02:06:31.470 --> 02:06:35.400
I've like, my wife hates it, my phone, I've had people in my car and I go,

2295
02:06:35.401 --> 02:06:39.270
you ready for this? And I stomped the gas and then just go, Jeez us.

2296
02:06:39.271 --> 02:06:43.690
Yeah cause it doesn't seem real. It doesn't seem like a car that looks like a,

2297
02:06:43.890 --> 02:06:47.430
you know, a nice four door sedan should be able to do that.

2298
02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:49.860
So that launch is definitely really something.

2299
02:06:49.861 --> 02:06:53.820
But I am compared to like if you're, if you're already moving the,

2300
02:06:53.821 --> 02:06:57.780
the old Testarossa with a thousand horsepower was a very different beast where

2301
02:06:58.050 --> 02:07:00.480
that Jesus' sense that you get at the very beginning.

2302
02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:04.980
It's that magnified extended for quite a while as you're running up through 150

2303
02:07:04.981 --> 02:07:09.870
miles an hour or so. And I am, but yeah, I'm signed up for the, uh,

2304
02:07:09.871 --> 02:07:13.530
the next to the 2020, the next roadster that's supposed to come out. So,

2305
02:07:14.250 --> 02:07:17.820
you know, I wouldn't put too much. I, you know, they'll probably slip, you know,

2306
02:07:17.821 --> 02:07:20.150
the Tesla is like, I, you know,

2307
02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:23.220
like game companies and so much of the other stuff I think they were saying it

2308
02:07:23.221 --> 02:07:26.100
might be, I don't want to mistake, we should probably look it up here,

2309
02:07:26.101 --> 02:07:28.530
but I'm on the list. It's going to get here as soon as it can.

2310
02:07:28.531 --> 02:07:32.700
And I want the rocket boost addition also with the extra compress gas tanks.

2311
02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:35.430
Yeah. What does that gonna do? What does that extra rocket boost?

2312
02:07:35.610 --> 02:07:37.120
And so the idea is that I,

2313
02:07:37.330 --> 02:07:40.090
cars with this much power are completely traction limited,

2314
02:07:40.091 --> 02:07:43.480
especially at launch era where you have no aerodynamic forces.

2315
02:07:43.481 --> 02:07:48.280
So you could have infinite horsepower and you're not going to get off the line

2316
02:07:48.281 --> 02:07:52.390
to 30 miles an hour any faster than what the p 100 will do given the same amount

2317
02:07:52.391 --> 02:07:56.260
of tires. So I, there's a few things that you could do with that.

2318
02:07:56.261 --> 02:07:59.110
You can be like a rocket, you can throw something out the back.

2319
02:07:59.111 --> 02:08:02.100
So you need no traction at all. Rockets don't use ions,

2320
02:08:02.120 --> 02:08:03.340
they don't require traction,

2321
02:08:03.341 --> 02:08:05.530
they don't even require air and they can work in space.

2322
02:08:05.890 --> 02:08:09.190
So most rockets of course have all sorts of propel ends.

2323
02:08:09.190 --> 02:08:12.940
You really don't generally want to be around a that are either cryogenic or

2324
02:08:12.941 --> 02:08:15.540
toxic or generally problematic. I,

2325
02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:18.250
but the idea here is that for space x,

2326
02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:21.340
they've developed a lot of these really cutting edge, state-of-the-art,

2327
02:08:21.341 --> 02:08:22.480
compressed gas tanks,

2328
02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:26.500
which are the same types of things you use for compressed gas vehicle tanks

2329
02:08:26.501 --> 02:08:29.350
except much higher. I much more mass efficient.

2330
02:08:29.650 --> 02:08:31.570
So the idea is you just fill him with air,

2331
02:08:31.571 --> 02:08:34.150
pump them up and it's like an enormous balloon. You know you,

2332
02:08:34.151 --> 02:08:37.420
oh you let go of the balloon, it flies around the room. I will.

2333
02:08:37.450 --> 02:08:41.590
When you've got 10,000 psi of air and you put a rocket nozzle on it and

2334
02:08:41.591 --> 02:08:45.370
essentially you just open the valve and it can push you forward with and almost

2335
02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:47.140
arbitrary amount of thrust.

2336
02:08:47.350 --> 02:08:50.920
The amount of thrust is only determined by how big the throat of the rocket

2337
02:08:50.921 --> 02:08:51.754
nozzle is,

2338
02:08:51.940 --> 02:08:55.150
which means that sometimes you see these industrial accidents where if like the

2339
02:08:55.151 --> 02:08:57.720
end of a compressed gas tank falls off. I,

2340
02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.570
so it's got a hole like this big and all of the gas is coming out of there.

2341
02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:05.200
It all blows out in a very short amount of time, but that can launch those,

2342
02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:08.350
you know those bottles like really high into the air through walls.

2343
02:09:08.650 --> 02:09:11.230
It's limited only by how big of an outlet you want to get it.

2344
02:09:11.231 --> 02:09:14.350
I don't know what they're specking this as for how much they can do.

2345
02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:18.220
But there's an interesting thing about that where you can have it just throw the

2346
02:09:18.221 --> 02:09:20.620
thrust. I completely horizontally,

2347
02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:24.250
but I suspect it would be slightly better if they angle it up a little bit.

2348
02:09:24.251 --> 02:09:27.430
So you get a little bit of downforce so you can both steer better.

2349
02:09:27.580 --> 02:09:29.830
But in the early things, especially on the roadster,

2350
02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:32.440
you've got more torque available from the electric motor,

2351
02:09:32.441 --> 02:09:33.550
then you have traction.

2352
02:09:33.730 --> 02:09:38.440
So we would wind up with net best acceleration by a little bit of downforce so

2353
02:09:38.650 --> 02:09:42.310
the engine can actually throw all of its power at it from the electric motor.

2354
02:09:42.430 --> 02:09:45.040
And then all the rest of it is horizontal thrust. Now ideally,

2355
02:09:45.041 --> 02:09:47.800
of course you would gimbal it and then you could start moving it around and vary

2356
02:09:47.801 --> 02:09:50.720
your downforce and thrust. And I, you know,

2357
02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:53.770
you could take this all the way where you put them on all four corners and you

2358
02:09:53.771 --> 02:09:58.180
could bunny hop your car. That's not spec for the current vehicle,

2359
02:09:58.181 --> 02:10:00.550
but you could take that exact same system,

2360
02:10:00.670 --> 02:10:03.070
put more of them on there and you could control that,

2361
02:10:03.071 --> 02:10:07.370
which is like all the work that I was doing in rocketry started out with these I

2362
02:10:07.690 --> 02:10:11.050
computer controlled rocket vehicles that would use the rockets and steer them

2363
02:10:11.051 --> 02:10:13.900
under control and they could sit up there and the hover kind of right in front

2364
02:10:13.901 --> 02:10:17.920
of you move around, translate and land and you could totally do that on a car.

2365
02:10:18.070 --> 02:10:19.720
You wouldn't be able to do it for very long.

2366
02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:23.710
But the idea of being able to make sort of a Batmobile leap or something to be

2367
02:10:23.711 --> 02:10:25.360
able to like get away,

2368
02:10:25.361 --> 02:10:29.530
get over something that is plausible and would be interesting to do. Wow. Look,

2369
02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:31.060
how far do you think you could travel?

2370
02:10:31.420 --> 02:10:34.340
So it totally depends on how much propel it. In this case,

2371
02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:38.060
cold gas doesn't give you very much. So no, it's not, would not be flying car,

2372
02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:40.790
but that's why I'm saying you could make a hopping car.

2373
02:10:40.791 --> 02:10:42.260
You could make something that takes a leap,

2374
02:10:42.410 --> 02:10:44.870
has enough propel it to be able to do a steady descent.

2375
02:10:45.050 --> 02:10:49.220
So it's an impulse up and then decelerate so you're not wrecking and lets the

2376
02:10:49.221 --> 02:10:52.790
suspension take the rest of it at the end. And somebody should do that.

2377
02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:55.670
That's something that the world should be able to see that happening.

2378
02:10:55.790 --> 02:10:59.600
So similar to what they're doing currently with jet packs where they have a very

2379
02:10:59.750 --> 02:11:02.990
short window of time where they can apply the thrusters.

2380
02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:04.590
So it's interesting to compare the,

2381
02:11:04.591 --> 02:11:08.330
the history of that where in the early days from back in the 60s there were

2382
02:11:08.331 --> 02:11:12.470
people that made these rocket packs that used concentrated hydrogen peroxide,

2383
02:11:12.471 --> 02:11:16.090
which is one of the easiest rocket propellant to work with. And it's what I,

2384
02:11:16.130 --> 02:11:19.640
you know, my company used for a number of years. I am,

2385
02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:23.360
the great thing about that is it's one liquid mano propellant as opposed to by

2386
02:11:23.361 --> 02:11:25.790
propellant where you need like liquid oxygen and kerosene.

2387
02:11:25.791 --> 02:11:30.260
So it's just one liquid and essentially you just spray it through this special

2388
02:11:30.261 --> 02:11:34.100
mesh of catalyst and it decomposes to really hot steam and lots of it.

2389
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:37.790
So the easiest rocket in the world to make maintaining the catalyst as a

2390
02:11:37.791 --> 02:11:38.211
problem.

2391
02:11:38.211 --> 02:11:42.320
But fundamentally you need a tank pressurized up and a valve that opens to kind

2392
02:11:42.321 --> 02:11:43.970
of go through that I am.

2393
02:11:43.971 --> 02:11:47.900
So they would make these things where they would have a couple of nozzles and

2394
02:11:47.901 --> 02:11:51.680
they could slowly open the throttle and let them up and you'd see the people

2395
02:11:51.681 --> 02:11:52.730
kind of hovering around.

2396
02:11:53.090 --> 02:11:56.540
And what's important about this is that is completely unstable.

2397
02:11:56.541 --> 02:12:00.620
There is no sense of kind of eye stability that you get even on a helicopter

2398
02:12:00.621 --> 02:12:02.240
which is very unstable.

2399
02:12:02.241 --> 02:12:05.570
You still have a big spinning mass and its got some directional stability.

2400
02:12:05.810 --> 02:12:10.430
If you're flying on rocket thrust alone, you can flip end over in trivially.

2401
02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:13.880
So the people that did these eye, they were like stunt men,

2402
02:12:13.881 --> 02:12:17.810
people that were used to doing this and still almost everybody wound up breaking

2403
02:12:17.811 --> 02:12:20.100
legs having problems like this. Uh,

2404
02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:22.790
because they could only last for about 30 seconds,

2405
02:12:22.791 --> 02:12:26.320
usually about 20 seconds you have this backpack full of I,

2406
02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:31.190
maybe you're carrying 50 60 pounds of propel it and all that gets you is 20

2407
02:12:31.191 --> 02:12:34.340
seconds of flight time. So they would plan out all of these things. It's like,

2408
02:12:34.341 --> 02:12:36.980
all right, we're going to fly into the Olympic stadium or whatever.

2409
02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:38.330
As this very short,

2410
02:12:38.630 --> 02:12:42.560
it's an arc from here coming down to here because you just do not have much time

2411
02:12:42.561 --> 02:12:44.510
to loiter around and try to fix things.

2412
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:48.950
What makes the modern jetpacks that people are working on so much better than

2413
02:12:48.951 --> 02:12:53.180
that is the way a jet works is instead of like a rocket where everything that

2414
02:12:53.300 --> 02:12:57.590
it's throwing out, the nozzle is stored in a tank. Jets work by using the air,

2415
02:12:57.920 --> 02:12:58.880
uh, as for oxygen,

2416
02:12:58.881 --> 02:13:03.230
which is the bulk of what you wind up consuming and then only carrying kerosene

2417
02:13:03.231 --> 02:13:06.170
or some kind of fuel jet fuel to burn with that.

2418
02:13:06.350 --> 02:13:09.260
So that lets them get several minutes of flight from things like this,

2419
02:13:09.261 --> 02:13:13.790
even from potentially smaller tanks. I am now, they're still, I have,

2420
02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:17.570
it looks like they're still largely doing it with highly skilled operators that

2421
02:13:17.571 --> 02:13:18.740
are working, that,

2422
02:13:18.741 --> 02:13:23.330
that are on the edge of wiping out at any given moment and you know, and wisely,

2423
02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:25.370
often flying over water and so on.

2424
02:13:25.670 --> 02:13:28.350
But there's no reason why that can't be computer control.

2425
02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:31.830
Then you see the amazing things that people are doing with. Now.

2426
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:35.100
This is something that I think about where, uh,

2427
02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:38.250
it was pretty exciting the early days of the rocket stuff that I was doing where

2428
02:13:38.251 --> 02:13:41.760
you had a rocket that could hover and slowly move over. I,

2429
02:13:41.940 --> 02:13:45.420
there was one time we were flying at an Oklahoma airfield and we had this,

2430
02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:45.931
you know,

2431
02:13:45.931 --> 02:13:50.040
kind of good old boy reporter coming out there and we flew this rocket through

2432
02:13:50.041 --> 02:13:54.120
this trajectory. It was for the, the lunar lander challenge and was like, well,

2433
02:13:54.450 --> 02:13:56.520
there's something you don't see every day.

2434
02:13:56.970 --> 02:14:01.970
And it was this very shocking thing about this giant 2000 pound rocket just kind

2435
02:14:02.491 --> 02:14:07.470
of picking up and moving over and landing, but the same all-girl them's like,

2436
02:14:07.471 --> 02:14:08.970
I was proud of myself doing those.

2437
02:14:08.971 --> 02:14:12.480
I had learned all the necessary control dynamics and embedded systems

2438
02:14:12.481 --> 02:14:15.400
programming and stuff to to do that code. I'm,

2439
02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:17.370
and it was doing what we needed it to do.

2440
02:14:17.490 --> 02:14:21.120
But you look at what people do with drones today and it's just magnificent.

2441
02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:25.020
These aerial ballets have synchronized hundreds of drones doing all these

2442
02:14:25.021 --> 02:14:29.310
gymnastics and you could do that with the rocket engines or the jet engines or

2443
02:14:29.311 --> 02:14:33.390
something like that and they could be doing movie style iron man stuff.

2444
02:14:33.450 --> 02:14:35.640
I as soon as you're willing to let the computer trust,

2445
02:14:35.641 --> 02:14:37.860
I know that it's going to do the right thing,

2446
02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:42.450
but that's the key difference where we were able to make amazing progress for

2447
02:14:42.451 --> 02:14:46.950
what we were doing because we were willing to build and destroy a couple of

2448
02:14:46.951 --> 02:14:50.130
vehicles a year and I was very proud of that for a long time,

2449
02:14:50.131 --> 02:14:52.500
for like at least eight or nine years. We built him,

2450
02:14:52.501 --> 02:14:55.530
destroyed two rocket vehicles. Each year we learned something,

2451
02:14:55.531 --> 02:14:58.950
built another one and you know, threw it away. And these were, you know,

2452
02:14:58.951 --> 02:15:02.580
fairly expensive. They would cost us, I am, you know, the later ones in

2453
02:15:04.410 --> 02:15:05.400
the a hundred something thousand dollars and you have to know that you're

2454
02:15:05.401 --> 02:15:08.430
building it, it's going to turn into a smoking pile of wreckage. I,

2455
02:15:08.431 --> 02:15:11.880
at some point, you know the vehicle will be expended in the learning process.

2456
02:15:12.330 --> 02:15:16.320
But what's made the drone so much better is all of these people that do these

2457
02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:18.780
university teams doing control dynamics.

2458
02:15:18.990 --> 02:15:23.250
They have a closet full of drone wreckage because the drones are so amazingly

2459
02:15:23.251 --> 02:15:26.460
cheap that you just have these commercial, these commoditized parts.

2460
02:15:26.461 --> 02:15:28.830
You put them together, they try something that's up, we blew them, you know,

2461
02:15:28.831 --> 02:15:31.710
we crashed another drone toss into the closet, grab another one out.

2462
02:15:32.070 --> 02:15:34.830
And that's a real lesson about pace of the, you know,

2463
02:15:34.831 --> 02:15:39.240
the acceleration that you can get by reducing the I at the time to experiment.

2464
02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:41.100
Are you done with the rocket world?

2465
02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:46.760
So I used to think about it a lot more even after I was kind of out of it where

2466
02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:49.170
I, you know, getting out of rockets.

2467
02:15:50.070 --> 02:15:54.900
My wife is wiser than I am in many ways where she had put a kind of a limit.

2468
02:15:54.901 --> 02:15:58.680
We had, this is John's crazy rocket money and I have, you know,

2469
02:15:58.681 --> 02:16:00.600
you are not going to bankrupt the family.

2470
02:16:00.601 --> 02:16:05.601
I've by pursuing rocket dreams and I was doing it part time and eventually we

2471
02:16:07.141 --> 02:16:09.390
got to the point where we had,

2472
02:16:09.420 --> 02:16:12.780
we had one year where we had an operating profit for a little aerospace company.

2473
02:16:12.781 --> 02:16:14.160
We were working for a, you know,

2474
02:16:14.161 --> 02:16:18.000
we were doing some NASA and air force and rocket racing league. That was great.

2475
02:16:18.001 --> 02:16:21.190
These man rocket planes we built that. They got to fly around and you know,

2476
02:16:21.210 --> 02:16:25.380
have some racing with some stuff that I was very proud of. But I am,

2477
02:16:25.950 --> 02:16:29.800
we reached a point where there's this trap that a lot of companies like that can

2478
02:16:29.801 --> 02:16:33.760
get into and I saw a number of them in it where you go into this thinking that

2479
02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:36.070
we're going to change the world, we're going to do this massive thing.

2480
02:16:36.071 --> 02:16:38.170
We want to colonize space, all of this.

2481
02:16:38.380 --> 02:16:42.910
But you get stuck in this area where all right, there are opportunities for us.

2482
02:16:42.911 --> 02:16:46.000
We can get government contracts to do various work.

2483
02:16:46.001 --> 02:16:49.990
You know there's work we can do for NASA and Department of Defense, but,

2484
02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:51.520
and you tell yourself that,

2485
02:16:51.521 --> 02:16:55.060
well we'll do this and we'll be using their money to fund the real dream of our,

2486
02:16:55.090 --> 02:16:56.740
the rocket ships that we want to build.

2487
02:16:57.130 --> 02:17:00.460
But I've never seen it work out like that. You know, you wind up,

2488
02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:04.960
I kind of stuck in this drip feed of you can get a few new contracts and you can

2489
02:17:04.961 --> 02:17:09.310
keep the lights on and the government does this really largely intentionally

2490
02:17:09.311 --> 02:17:13.930
where they say it's good for the United States to have some level of grassroots

2491
02:17:13.931 --> 02:17:16.480
aerospace companies, the small technology companies.

2492
02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:19.270
It actually covers a whole bunch of material science and lots of different

2493
02:17:19.271 --> 02:17:22.390
things. It's good to have these small companies exist.

2494
02:17:22.630 --> 02:17:26.920
So the government doles out this drip feed of contracts where you can keep your

2495
02:17:27.130 --> 02:17:31.340
researchers and engineers kind of working, putting some things together. I,

2496
02:17:31.510 --> 02:17:33.010
and it was a fork in the road there.

2497
02:17:33.011 --> 02:17:36.730
We could have gone down that path but decided that no,

2498
02:17:36.731 --> 02:17:40.600
we were going to try like one more year. I'll put the money into it.

2499
02:17:40.601 --> 02:17:43.940
We're going to go for it. We need to, it's like suborbital or bust. I'm,

2500
02:17:44.030 --> 02:17:44.200
you know,

2501
02:17:44.200 --> 02:17:48.970
getting the a hundred kilometer reusable vehicles and we didn't quite make it,

2502
02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:52.990
you know, we got to like 92 kilometers and I'm, you know,

2503
02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:55.460
out in space some lovely pictures of like the,

2504
02:17:55.461 --> 02:18:00.130
the flare of the sun and spinning around in the black sky and bloot coming out

2505
02:18:00.131 --> 02:18:03.460
for reentry and things that I, I was proud of. But you know,

2506
02:18:03.461 --> 02:18:07.030
we just didn't quite make it and I was at that point where I had to say,

2507
02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:09.850
and it's like, all right, this is the, you know, the end of the road.

2508
02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:13.510
I did wind up selling most of the, the assets to some of the, uh,

2509
02:18:13.511 --> 02:18:18.280
the team members that raised some other funding to continue on. I am, but the,

2510
02:18:18.430 --> 02:18:23.380
one of my biggest lessons from that is I don't think I can do a proper job

2511
02:18:23.410 --> 02:18:27.040
splitting my focus part time between different things because I was still full

2512
02:18:27.041 --> 02:18:30.660
on, on it software and doing the gaming. I was like 40 hours.

2513
02:18:30.661 --> 02:18:34.060
I did in 20 hours that Armadillo and I,

2514
02:18:34.061 --> 02:18:37.360
and I just wasn't able to give it the focus that it needed.

2515
02:18:37.361 --> 02:18:39.130
I don't know how Ilan can, you know,

2516
02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:42.070
have five companies that he's involved in to some degree.

2517
02:18:42.750 --> 02:18:46.270
I think that me personally, I need to have some level of focus.

2518
02:18:46.510 --> 02:18:51.130
So I was saying if I go back into it, I want to do it full time. I have my,

2519
02:18:51.790 --> 02:18:55.870
my crazy ideas, I for things that I had, I'd like to try and rocketry,

2520
02:18:56.140 --> 02:19:01.030
but largely I think space x is doing an amazing job. I it is, again,

2521
02:19:01.031 --> 02:19:04.480
things sneak up on people. They don't notice the world changing around them,

2522
02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:08.980
but this was the science fiction future that we wanted in the fifties and

2523
02:19:08.980 --> 02:19:09.550
sixties you know,

2524
02:19:09.550 --> 02:19:13.120
we have a billionaire that's gone out and built the world's best rocket ship

2525
02:19:13.150 --> 02:19:16.810
that wants to go to Mars and is building the rocket ship to do that. You know,

2526
02:19:16.811 --> 02:19:20.690
this is, you know, this is the movie scenario. It's almost a no,

2527
02:19:20.710 --> 02:19:21.730
the only thing is in movies,

2528
02:19:21.731 --> 02:19:24.730
it wouldn't have taken the decade plus time that it takes if it somehow would've

2529
02:19:24.731 --> 02:19:28.190
been compressed into three or four years. So it takes longer in reality.

2530
02:19:28.430 --> 02:19:31.850
But even the things you want to see in the movies are actually happening here.

2531
02:19:32.060 --> 02:19:35.840
So I think space x is doing a great job and I am, you know,

2532
02:19:35.870 --> 02:19:39.170
I was da Ilan invited me by and he actually had me sitting in one of their

2533
02:19:39.171 --> 02:19:42.830
engineering meetings and I'm just throwing out random ideas to the people there

2534
02:19:42.831 --> 02:19:45.950
and I, I know I could kind of, you know, they'd be,

2535
02:19:46.190 --> 02:19:48.260
they'd be happy to have me working with them in some way,

2536
02:19:48.261 --> 02:19:50.990
but I'd be just another principal engineer on some way.

2537
02:19:50.991 --> 02:19:55.250
I am much more interested in being the crazy plan c in some way.

2538
02:19:55.430 --> 02:19:58.400
And if I thought there really needed to be a crazy plan C,

2539
02:19:58.770 --> 02:20:03.770
I have my ideas for scary mixed moto propellant rockets that might be super

2540
02:20:04.431 --> 02:20:07.010
cheap in some ways, might blow up horribly.

2541
02:20:07.790 --> 02:20:10.790
But it turns out that there are now a number of companies like I,

2542
02:20:10.850 --> 02:20:13.850
it's shocking now that there's another company like rocket lab that's been

2543
02:20:13.970 --> 02:20:17.870
successfully launching things into orbit and we almost haven't noticed and

2544
02:20:17.871 --> 02:20:21.260
remarked around it about it, where this is something that again,

2545
02:20:21.350 --> 02:20:25.730
prior to space x space launch was the domain of a half dozen national

2546
02:20:25.731 --> 02:20:29.480
governments. And now we have a few small companies.

2547
02:20:29.760 --> 02:20:31.750
Space X isn't small anymore, but we have, you know,

2548
02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:35.930
a few companies that have just gone and done that and that's pretty great.

2549
02:20:35.931 --> 02:20:40.520
So I am tempted to go back in. I have ideas that I'd like to try,

2550
02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:44.720
but I think it's in good enough hands right now,

2551
02:20:45.220 --> 02:20:47.270
but it's always a possibility in the future.

2552
02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:50.260
What does Jeff Bezos company trying to do? They're,

2553
02:20:50.600 --> 02:20:53.350
they're emulating space x some sort of a way, right? So yeah,

2554
02:20:53.390 --> 02:20:56.390
blue origin was now all I like.

2555
02:20:56.391 --> 02:21:00.110
All three of these have have origins back in similar periods of time.

2556
02:21:00.111 --> 02:21:02.030
Like at the very start of Armadillo when we had our,

2557
02:21:02.031 --> 02:21:06.170
just our very crude as things Ilan and one of his first guys came down and

2558
02:21:06.171 --> 02:21:09.050
visited us in Dallas and we talked about rockets and everything.

2559
02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:13.160
I then baseless came in somewhat later, initially very, very secretive.

2560
02:21:13.550 --> 02:21:17.780
I am and also very conservative where, uh, you know,

2561
02:21:17.781 --> 02:21:20.270
in their logo they've got a tour, a turtle basically.

2562
02:21:20.271 --> 02:21:23.600
And it was more or less saying we're going to take our time and do this.

2563
02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:27.260
And I did always think that was the wrong direction where I am.

2564
02:21:27.710 --> 02:21:30.770
That's a real hazard where you have a billionaire backer that says,

2565
02:21:30.771 --> 02:21:32.750
take your time. I am, you know,

2566
02:21:32.751 --> 02:21:37.400
unlike space x where space x was burning through all of Elan's money. I am,

2567
02:21:37.610 --> 02:21:42.610
Ilan had a large fraction of his fortune invested in this and he was down to the

2568
02:21:42.771 --> 02:21:45.740
last point where they blew up three rockets and it's like,

2569
02:21:45.741 --> 02:21:49.610
this one's got to make it or they're just not going to be able to get by.

2570
02:21:49.790 --> 02:21:53.750
And that's a very, very different work environment than I, you know, hey,

2571
02:21:53.810 --> 02:21:57.680
we've got a blank check. You know, we can take our time, we can do all of this.

2572
02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:01.790
I, and I know every time something goes wrong for space x, every time you know,

2573
02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:04.330
they have an explosion or a landing failure,

2574
02:22:04.331 --> 02:22:06.200
so many people are ready to jump on them.

2575
02:22:06.470 --> 02:22:11.240
But that's what's allowed them to make these really truly remarkable advances.

2576
02:22:11.660 --> 02:22:14.870
So the turtle approach is just not conducive to raw.

2577
02:22:14.900 --> 02:22:17.210
They've cranked it up more recently.

2578
02:22:17.211 --> 02:22:19.640
They've gotten serious about building full scale stuff.

2579
02:22:19.641 --> 02:22:22.300
So they sort of built the suborbital vehicle that, uh,

2580
02:22:22.430 --> 02:22:25.710
that I was on track to build that uh, it goes up to a kilometers,

2581
02:22:25.711 --> 02:22:29.490
talk about space tourism, carry people up. I do the Little Rye, like,

2582
02:22:29.580 --> 02:22:32.670
have you ever taken one of the zero g airplane rides? No. You should.

2583
02:22:32.671 --> 02:22:35.930
It's interesting. I this, this would be the, I,

2584
02:22:35.970 --> 02:22:40.470
you go do that and you get these little kind of parabolas of 20 seconds or so of

2585
02:22:40.471 --> 02:22:44.010
weightlessness where you can float around or you can get simulated Martian or

2586
02:22:44.310 --> 02:22:45.270
lunar gravity.

2587
02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:50.510
The idea of the suborbital space tourism would be that you go up there to a

2588
02:22:51.330 --> 02:22:54.660
hundred kilometers and plum it down and you've got about five minutes of zero

2589
02:22:54.661 --> 02:22:57.000
gravity floating around with space outside.

2590
02:22:57.420 --> 02:23:01.920
And that's the idea that that would be, you know, this remarkable experience.

2591
02:23:01.921 --> 02:23:04.890
And we had a bunch of companies that were sort of targeting this as the

2592
02:23:04.891 --> 02:23:09.390
direction that I, there's not much market for small satellite and you know,

2593
02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:12.180
these tiny micro set payloads. How do you close the business?

2594
02:23:12.390 --> 02:23:17.340
The pitch was always that, well if we have this reliable people want to do this,

2595
02:23:17.370 --> 02:23:19.710
it would call them like self-loading carbon payloads.

2596
02:23:19.711 --> 02:23:24.711
People will want to go in the world's tallest roller coaster and you'd say

2597
02:23:25.141 --> 02:23:27.810
originally the thinking was that'd be $100,000 which is like,

2598
02:23:27.811 --> 02:23:30.060
of course everybody's like, Whoa, that's like way too much.

2599
02:23:30.090 --> 02:23:33.870
But there's a lot of wealthy people in the world. It seems reasonable.

2600
02:23:34.020 --> 02:23:37.020
But one of the interesting life lessons I got from this,

2601
02:23:37.021 --> 02:23:40.500
when virgin finally came into this and they decided, well,

2602
02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:45.590
we're going to enter this, I am all of these little scrappy companies I've,

2603
02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:49.320
that didn't necessarily have much business knowhow or things like $100,000

2604
02:23:49.321 --> 02:23:52.200
sounds about right for the price for several rural tourism.

2605
02:23:52.201 --> 02:23:55.710
It's a nice round number, but virgin came in, you know Richard Branson,

2606
02:23:55.711 --> 02:23:56.481
and I was like, oh,

2607
02:23:56.481 --> 02:23:59.850
the price is $200,000 and everybody's still signed up with him.

2608
02:23:59.880 --> 02:24:04.350
That was a notable thing where reading your market correctly for that,

2609
02:24:04.860 --> 02:24:08.460
where that was the difference between a hundred thousand dollars maybe eking by

2610
02:24:08.461 --> 02:24:11.760
and covering your bases and everything, and $200,000 it's like, Oh,

2611
02:24:11.761 --> 02:24:13.800
you've actually got some profit margin there,

2612
02:24:14.190 --> 02:24:18.270
but now a decade has passed since that's gone on and there's no way they're

2613
02:24:18.271 --> 02:24:21.420
going to earn back their, all the investment that they've piled into that,

2614
02:24:21.421 --> 02:24:24.960
you know, if things take too long, you know, that's tangenting off here again.

2615
02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:28.860
But that's another one of the life lessons where I used to be known about the

2616
02:24:28.861 --> 02:24:31.350
catch line. You know, it'll be done when it's done. You know, when,

2617
02:24:31.470 --> 02:24:34.710
when we'll do m ship, when it's done, when we'll quake ship, when it's done.

2618
02:24:35.130 --> 02:24:38.160
And it felt good saying that in terms of,

2619
02:24:38.820 --> 02:24:41.550
that was sort of the being rebellious about we don't have any publisher that's

2620
02:24:41.551 --> 02:24:44.700
going to force us to be out in time for their quarterly earnings.

2621
02:24:44.701 --> 02:24:48.300
We're going to make sure we, we ship the game when it's actually done.

2622
02:24:48.690 --> 02:24:52.890
But the aspects of seeing I with a little bit more perspective now,

2623
02:24:52.891 --> 02:24:55.710
it's like if you're talking slipping a quarter, slipping six months, yeah,

2624
02:24:55.740 --> 02:24:59.820
great. That's definitely fine. But when you're talking about slipping years,

2625
02:24:59.821 --> 02:25:01.260
you know, when years go by,

2626
02:25:01.470 --> 02:25:06.470
the world changes around you in a way that being a kind of totalitarian about

2627
02:25:06.871 --> 02:25:08.430
it, it'll only ship when it's done.

2628
02:25:08.610 --> 02:25:13.610
I largely recant from that now where with a little bit more perspective time has

2629
02:25:14.041 --> 02:25:18.720
a physicality that you may not appreciate. And I have the two big reads on that.

2630
02:25:18.780 --> 02:25:21.270
I am seeing some of like virgin galactic,

2631
02:25:21.271 --> 02:25:22.590
they're never gonna make that money back.

2632
02:25:22.670 --> 02:25:26.000
They're looking into satellite launch for things now. But even the,

2633
02:25:26.010 --> 02:25:29.440
the last big game that I worked on it he had, which was rage, I'm,

2634
02:25:29.890 --> 02:25:34.750
we spent six years on that game and we went into that.

2635
02:25:34.810 --> 02:25:38.170
I am, it was using flashy new technology,

2636
02:25:38.171 --> 02:25:42.100
which there's some other life lessons about that I, but we had like,

2637
02:25:42.101 --> 02:25:45.280
we had an [inaudible] where we were game of show at e three but you know,

2638
02:25:45.380 --> 02:25:49.900
we kept on it didn't quite ship and by the time it got out the world had changed

2639
02:25:49.901 --> 02:25:50.830
around us. You know,

2640
02:25:50.831 --> 02:25:54.790
the technology decisions that were made for some earlier systems weren't

2641
02:25:54.791 --> 02:25:57.550
necessarily the right thing for the, the very latest ones.

2642
02:25:57.700 --> 02:26:01.900
We now had call of duty and battlefield coming out as these juggernauts that we

2643
02:26:01.901 --> 02:26:06.340
were competing with. And I look back as one of those real decisions.

2644
02:26:06.341 --> 02:26:09.400
I think we should have done whatever it would have taken to ship that two years

2645
02:26:09.401 --> 02:26:14.020
earlier, be less ambitious with some of the technologies and get it out earlier.

2646
02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:18.190
And I can even make reasonable cases for going back to the earliest games like

2647
02:26:18.191 --> 02:26:23.191
quake where quake was the first really traumatic game to ship internally where

2648
02:26:23.770 --> 02:26:26.080
we're still only talking like two year developments.

2649
02:26:26.380 --> 02:26:31.060
But at the time it felt really long and we had all sorts of internal strife for

2650
02:26:31.061 --> 02:26:34.960
things because we were trying to do so many things. It was, you know,

2651
02:26:35.020 --> 02:26:40.000
six degree of freedom rendering, modding I internet based game servers, I,

2652
02:26:40.390 --> 02:26:44.110
you know, three, six off models and it was a lot of stuff.

2653
02:26:44.170 --> 02:26:46.150
And I later looked back and said, you know,

2654
02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:50.980
we could have done half of those things in a Superdome and shipped it earlier

2655
02:26:50.981 --> 02:26:54.460
and then done the other half even better on a game coming in later.

2656
02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:59.760
And I still roll that over in my mind sometimes where I love quake and I love

2657
02:26:59.801 --> 02:27:00.140
doing,

2658
02:27:00.140 --> 02:27:04.240
I think all of those were doing what I think was the optimal game to ship at the

2659
02:27:04.241 --> 02:27:05.110
optimal time.

2660
02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:09.790
Quake was challenging and painful enough that maybe we could've done some things

2661
02:27:09.820 --> 02:27:12.450
slightly better there. I, you know,

2662
02:27:12.550 --> 02:27:15.730
popping a couple off the stack there to back to blue origin.

2663
02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:20.800
I think they spent a lot more time than they needed to in that kind of turtle

2664
02:27:20.801 --> 02:27:24.700
mode. But now they're building big serious things and I think they've probably

2665
02:27:24.701 --> 02:27:27.460
abandoned the space tourism stuff. They flew their thing.

2666
02:27:27.461 --> 02:27:30.040
It's like it looks good enough that some people could get in,

2667
02:27:30.041 --> 02:27:35.041
but right now it's interesting when you go from the game of $200,000,

2668
02:27:35.470 --> 02:27:40.470
I sell floating carbon payloads to billion dollar NASA contracts and it drives

2669
02:27:40.691 --> 02:27:44.800
your engineering in different ways. So I think they're now saying,

2670
02:27:44.801 --> 02:27:48.070
we don't want space x to run off and take it all for themselves and they're

2671
02:27:48.071 --> 02:27:51.400
scrambling a little bit to build their, bring their architectures to bear their,

2672
02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:53.860
well, that's got to be beneficial to everybody, right.

2673
02:27:53.861 --> 02:27:56.210
To have all these billion dollar companies compete,

2674
02:27:56.680 --> 02:28:01.420
particularly Bayzos with his unlimited bank account competing and for all of us

2675
02:28:01.421 --> 02:28:06.250
to watch these commercial space ventures take place.

2676
02:28:06.251 --> 02:28:07.750
It's really, really interesting.

2677
02:28:07.930 --> 02:28:11.950
So I do think that space is one of those things that I am,

2678
02:28:12.280 --> 02:28:15.730
you can make all the hard analytic arguments about, okay,

2679
02:28:15.731 --> 02:28:19.390
we've got communication satellites and all this stuff that like yo is doing with

2680
02:28:19.420 --> 02:28:23.030
I the the low satellite communication networks.

2681
02:28:23.031 --> 02:28:26.450
These are big important things that may be incredibly valuable,

2682
02:28:26.780 --> 02:28:31.780
but all of us that have done this at that level do really believe deeply at some

2683
02:28:32.211 --> 02:28:36.290
level that we do want humanity to not be tied to the earth.

2684
02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:40.190
You know there we want to be a multi planet or at least space habitat.

2685
02:28:40.220 --> 02:28:45.220
I am species where there's this sense that the world is disc retired now when

2686
02:28:46.131 --> 02:28:48.520
you have gps and it's kind of a weird thing when you,

2687
02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:50.660
you can look at gps with the numbers,

2688
02:28:50.661 --> 02:28:55.250
read out to all of this and say you are exactly here within a meter all in the

2689
02:28:55.251 --> 02:28:58.340
world. You can map the whole world and lay a texture over it.

2690
02:28:58.520 --> 02:29:01.190
In some ways it's squeezed some of the magic out of the world.

2691
02:29:01.191 --> 02:29:04.370
You know you had the lost city of El Dorado is probably not hiding,

2692
02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:08.360
you know in some place that has just had canopy cover for all of this because we

2693
02:29:08.490 --> 02:29:12.560
can turn it into a grid and walk through all of it if we need to and it leads

2694
02:29:12.561 --> 02:29:16.880
some people to a more fatalistic attitude than they should have about that.

2695
02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:20.080
The limits of growth, the limits of resources that you know,

2696
02:29:20.110 --> 02:29:23.930
we need to dial back our ambitions because the world is only so big and there's

2697
02:29:23.931 --> 02:29:27.980
too many people in it and I think they're wrong even on the single earth case

2698
02:29:27.981 --> 02:29:31.280
that there are so many resources here that people do not even appreciate.

2699
02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:36.200
But I think once you step outside of the earth and once you do have people on

2700
02:29:36.201 --> 02:29:38.720
the moon and Mars and that are doing things there,

2701
02:29:39.030 --> 02:29:41.960
there's a lot of reasons about eggs in one basket, sort of things,

2702
02:29:41.961 --> 02:29:44.030
asteroid and meal killer asteroids and stuff.

2703
02:29:44.031 --> 02:29:48.980
But just having humanity spread out more like that and knowing that I want

2704
02:29:48.981 --> 02:29:50.900
people to be able to look up at the moon,

2705
02:29:50.901 --> 02:29:53.420
a full moon and say there are people working up there,

2706
02:29:53.450 --> 02:29:57.080
there's another city up there and that's some place you might go later on.

2707
02:29:57.110 --> 02:30:00.830
I am for some reason, you know that you get on the next transport there.

2708
02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:02.030
And this is the,

2709
02:30:02.270 --> 02:30:06.770
the good old fashioned future of sort of the fifties and sixties that the Robert

2710
02:30:06.770 --> 02:30:08.630
Heinlein science fiction world of the future. You know,

2711
02:30:08.631 --> 02:30:11.900
the strong job engineers building the space fairing world.

2712
02:30:12.380 --> 02:30:13.850
And I realize,

2713
02:30:13.851 --> 02:30:18.350
I'm conscious of the fact that I have a foot in both camps here where, you know,

2714
02:30:18.380 --> 02:30:21.800
I'm building VR, which is kind of the stuck in the matrix sort of thing,

2715
02:30:21.801 --> 02:30:24.530
the dystopian modern science fiction future.

2716
02:30:24.531 --> 02:30:28.100
But a large part of me does still kind of hanker for this,

2717
02:30:28.130 --> 02:30:30.680
this old sense of like, no, the possibilities are unlimited.

2718
02:30:30.681 --> 02:30:34.700
Technology will save us, we can get there. It's a matter of engineering.

2719
02:30:34.850 --> 02:30:38.270
We can build what we want. We've never been in a better position before.

2720
02:30:38.620 --> 02:30:42.460
They're smarter people in the world today than there ever have been and that,

2721
02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:46.370
you know, it's unlimited. It's not this limited world that we're stuck in.

2722
02:30:46.460 --> 02:30:48.830
We can go, we can colonize Mars,

2723
02:30:48.831 --> 02:30:51.590
we can colonize the moods and we can make space stations.

2724
02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:56.450
And the fact that we now have idealistic billionaires building this,

2725
02:30:56.480 --> 02:31:00.920
that we don't have to go ahead and necessarily wrangled the votes in Ohio for

2726
02:31:00.921 --> 02:31:05.720
the NASA station in Houston or whatever. I think it's a fantastic thing.

2727
02:31:06.020 --> 02:31:06.853
I agree.

2728
02:31:06.890 --> 02:31:11.660
Do you have a longterm vision in terms of what you're trying to do with virtual

2729
02:31:11.661 --> 02:31:16.340
reality and octopus? So I do, and it's, I am, you know,

2730
02:31:16.341 --> 02:31:17.600
it's something that people,

2731
02:31:17.601 --> 02:31:21.330
some people read this the wrong way and react incorrectly to it.

2732
02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:25.260
Where I've said that my pitch for VR is that the, the,

2733
02:31:25.590 --> 02:31:29.160
the promise of VR is it's to make the world as you wanted,

2734
02:31:29.250 --> 02:31:32.370
where people do not have the, it's just,

2735
02:31:32.520 --> 02:31:36.060
it is not possible on earth to be able to give everybody all that they would

2736
02:31:36.061 --> 02:31:38.970
want. Not Everybody can have Richard Branson's private island.

2737
02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.730
There's just not enough private in and out of islands in the world to give them

2738
02:31:41.731 --> 02:31:45.390
to people. But even on a, a much more mundane level,

2739
02:31:45.391 --> 02:31:47.760
not everyone can have a mansion of a house.

2740
02:31:47.790 --> 02:31:52.530
Not everyone can even necessarily have a home theater room and these are things

2741
02:31:52.531 --> 02:31:56.520
that we can simulate to some degree in virtual reality.

2742
02:31:56.700 --> 02:31:59.190
Now the simulation is not as good as the real thing. Again,

2743
02:31:59.191 --> 02:32:02.640
if you are rich and you have your own home theater and mansion and private

2744
02:32:02.641 --> 02:32:03.840
island, good for you,

2745
02:32:04.260 --> 02:32:06.720
we may still be able to offer you the convenience of being able to

2746
02:32:06.721 --> 02:32:08.880
instantaneously get to different places.

2747
02:32:09.210 --> 02:32:12.600
But you're still probably not the people that are gonna benefit most from it.

2748
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:16.500
But most of the people in the world aren't in that position.

2749
02:32:16.740 --> 02:32:20.730
Most of the people in the world live in relatively clamped quarters that are not

2750
02:32:20.731 --> 02:32:25.410
what they would choose to be if they had unlimited resources and the technology

2751
02:32:25.411 --> 02:32:26.670
curves for these things are,

2752
02:32:26.730 --> 02:32:31.730
this is $400 now we have an earlier one that's $200 that's less capable,

2753
02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:36.950
but these follow the cell phone price curves in many ways we have $25 cell

2754
02:32:37.501 --> 02:32:41.370
phones in India now bet our smartphones that do a lot of these things.

2755
02:32:41.550 --> 02:32:42.720
The technology curve,

2756
02:32:42.750 --> 02:32:45.840
Moore's law may be crapping out in terms of absolute performance,

2757
02:32:45.841 --> 02:32:49.500
but we've still got a lot of price performance that we can drive out of these

2758
02:32:49.501 --> 02:32:54.501
things and we can have virtual reality devices that can get cheap enough that

2759
02:32:54.931 --> 02:32:59.190
lots and lots of people will be able to have these and we can make better and

2760
02:32:59.191 --> 02:33:03.450
better software and it can be a better world in many ways. Now people,

2761
02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:07.320
everybody points towards like there's this art piece of art that goes around the

2762
02:33:07.321 --> 02:33:10.290
Internet of this sort of Dystopian kid in the corner, drew, you know,

2763
02:33:10.291 --> 02:33:14.730
drooling with glass goggles on with rainbow pictures on them and it's a terrible

2764
02:33:14.731 --> 02:33:17.010
looking place and people say it's like, oh,

2765
02:33:17.011 --> 02:33:18.390
this is the world you're trying to build.

2766
02:33:18.391 --> 02:33:21.750
People plugged into virtual reality that ignore the world around them.

2767
02:33:22.500 --> 02:33:24.510
And of course the first rejoinder to that is well,

2768
02:33:24.670 --> 02:33:26.550
is is life really better if he takes them off?

2769
02:33:26.550 --> 02:33:30.750
And he's in this horrible place there, but more concretely,

2770
02:33:31.080 --> 02:33:35.460
like I just came from in Dallas, it's a hundred degrees this week a there.

2771
02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:37.890
We changed the world around us in all that we do.

2772
02:33:37.891 --> 02:33:41.730
We live in air conditioning and people nowadays don't generally go, oh,

2773
02:33:41.731 --> 02:33:44.640
you're not experiencing the world around you because of your air conditioning.

2774
02:33:44.641 --> 02:33:47.130
You should be out there really experiencing the world.

2775
02:33:47.460 --> 02:33:51.990
Now that is what human beings do is we, we bend the world to our will.

2776
02:33:52.290 --> 02:33:57.290
And I think that a virtual reality that lets people do things that would not be

2777
02:33:57.361 --> 02:34:01.770
possible in the world or it comes down to it not economical and a lot of people

2778
02:34:01.771 --> 02:34:04.320
react negatively to any talk about economics,

2779
02:34:04.321 --> 02:34:07.590
but it is resource allocation. I am, you know,

2780
02:34:07.591 --> 02:34:10.200
you have to make decisions about where things go.

2781
02:34:10.530 --> 02:34:15.530
And I think that economically we can deliver more value to a lot of people in

2782
02:34:15.961 --> 02:34:17.070
this virtual sense.

2783
02:34:17.530 --> 02:34:20.920
We're at the very earliest stage of it right now with the experiences that we

2784
02:34:20.921 --> 02:34:23.890
have and the things you can do and how long you want to keep it on.

2785
02:34:24.100 --> 02:34:28.120
But there is a path to this comfortable thing that you can wear for hours at a

2786
02:34:28.121 --> 02:34:30.910
time. Maybe you spend your entire workday working in Ed.

2787
02:34:31.090 --> 02:34:33.580
Maybe your time after coming home is putting it on.

2788
02:34:33.581 --> 02:34:34.900
And I mean right now you can,

2789
02:34:35.170 --> 02:34:37.690
you can watch TV with someone else in virtual reality,

2790
02:34:37.691 --> 02:34:41.020
which is as mundane thing, but you can have I, you know,

2791
02:34:41.050 --> 02:34:45.400
your sister or somebody that's across the country and you could have meet in a

2792
02:34:45.401 --> 02:34:48.670
virtual space, look over and see each other, add, you know,

2793
02:34:48.671 --> 02:34:49.960
watch something on TV.

2794
02:34:50.140 --> 02:34:55.140
Like all activities that do not require an actual tactile physical thing can

2795
02:34:55.571 --> 02:34:59.980
eventually be subsumed in this where there are a lot of things that do require

2796
02:35:00.010 --> 02:35:00.820
the tactical stuff.

2797
02:35:00.820 --> 02:35:04.210
You're not going to be replacing food with virtual reality anytime soon,

2798
02:35:04.420 --> 02:35:08.740
but a surprising amount of things that people value are these largely audio

2799
02:35:08.741 --> 02:35:12.070
visual things. It's the decoration, the museum that you walk through.

2800
02:35:12.250 --> 02:35:14.470
You're not fondling the individual things there.

2801
02:35:14.471 --> 02:35:17.260
You're experiencing things in a way that could,

2802
02:35:17.261 --> 02:35:21.010
with a good enough virtual reality experience be replicated there without the

2803
02:35:21.011 --> 02:35:23.320
travel, without the lines, without the crowds.

2804
02:35:23.470 --> 02:35:26.950
You could have it private to yourself. And there's so many things like this.

2805
02:35:26.980 --> 02:35:31.390
It's not everything. It's to have your senses simulated fairly well.

2806
02:35:31.570 --> 02:35:34.690
But we can do an enormous amount with this.

2807
02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:38.740
And I always like internally, I'm almost a broken record in the company.

2808
02:35:38.741 --> 02:35:40.900
Most people are tired of hearing me harp about this,

2809
02:35:40.901 --> 02:35:43.330
but it's all about user value. You know what?

2810
02:35:43.331 --> 02:35:45.550
I care about building things as an engineer.

2811
02:35:45.551 --> 02:35:47.860
The whole point is to bring value to the world.

2812
02:35:48.190 --> 02:35:52.810
And I think that virtual reality can bring a lot of value. We're not there yet.

2813
02:35:52.811 --> 02:35:54.220
We're in very early days of,

2814
02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:58.150
there are certain niches of people today that can get a great value out of this.

2815
02:35:58.330 --> 02:36:00.640
I don't pretend that this is something that, you know,

2816
02:36:00.730 --> 02:36:02.980
everyone in the world can benefit from today,

2817
02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:06.730
but we're inching our way up towards that. And that's how, you know,

2818
02:36:06.731 --> 02:36:07.840
that's how the world gets better,

2819
02:36:07.841 --> 02:36:11.500
is by building technologies and distributing to them people so that they have

2820
02:36:11.501 --> 02:36:15.430
something better than they would have had if that didn't exist. John Carmack,

2821
02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:18.730
thank you for being you. Thank you. And thank you for everything you've done.

2822
02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:20.260
Thanks for being here as an honor.

2823
02:36:20.261 --> 02:36:23.200
I'm glad we finally got to do it and I really appreciate you. Alright, great.

2824
02:36:23.320 --> 02:36:24.940
Be Nice. Thanks. Thank you. Bye everybody.

2825
02:36:38.300 --> 02:36:40.950
<v 3>[inaudible] [inaudible] okay.</v>

2826
