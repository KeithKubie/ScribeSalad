00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.820
A lot of people have noted that astronomy
is a humbling enterprise to pursue. After

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.599
all, every time we make a new discovery, we
find ourselves further removed from importance.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.920
The Earth is but one planet among many, orbiting
a Sun that is one star among hundreds of billions,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.580
out in the suburbs of a galaxy that is one
among hundreds of billions more.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.980
It’s easy to feel pretty small when you
see all that magnificence out there.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.330
And we astronomers keep making it worse! Because
now we know that what we can see isn’t even

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.079
everything there is. Normal matter, the stuff
that makes up you and me and all we observe

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.360
in the Universe? That’s only a small fraction
of what’s actually out there.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.530
It’s time we talk about some very, very
dark matters.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.260
In the 1960s and 1970s, astronomer Vera Rubin
was observing spiral galaxies. She was interested

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.979
in how they rotate, because you can learn
a lot about a galaxy that way. Think about

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.799
the solar system: back in the 1600s, Johannes
Kepler figured out that the farther a planet

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.830
is from the Sun, the slower it orbits. Isaac
Newton put numbers to that, calculating the

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.630
strength of the Sun’s gravity, which means
we could, in turn, get the Sun’s mass.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.530
Same with galaxies. If you can measure how
they rotate — how rapidly gas clouds move

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.159
in their orbits near the edge of the galaxy
for example — you can calculate the mass

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.670
of the entire galaxy. Galaxies are so big
that you can’t physically see the nebulae

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.909
move, but you can measure their Doppler shift,
which gives you their velocity.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.049
What Rubin expected to see was that the farther
out from the center of the galaxy the gas

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.720
cloud was, the slower it would be moving,
just like more distant planets from the Sun

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.290
move more slowly in their orbits.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.790
What she got though was the opposite. For
many galaxies, the farther out from the center

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.490
you went the faster the clouds were moving!
Even at best, the velocities flattened out

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.560
with distance, when they should have declined.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.810
That meant the gravity of the galaxies was
constant throughout the disk, not dropping

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.219
from the center as you’d expect. But that’s
bizarre! Images of the galaxies showed that

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.530
the number of stars and other massive objects
clearly got lower the farther from the center

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.700
you went. There simply isn’t enough mass
far out from the center to account for the

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.000
rapid rotation rates.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.900
Or — not enough mass from things we can
see.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.739
The only explanation is that there must be
dark material contributing to the gravity,

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.020
something besides stars, gas, and dust. Not
only that, the galaxy must be embedded in

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.390
a halo of this material to get the shapes
of the rotation graphs right. And there must

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.459
be a lot of it! Rubin found there must be
five or times as much of this invisible material

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.430
than the visible matter in galaxies.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.750
Back in the 1930s, astronomer Fritz Zwicky
had drawn a similar conclusion measuring the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.200
speeds of galaxies in galaxy clusters. The
member galaxies were moving too quickly to

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.500
stay in the cluster; at the measured speeds
they should have been flung off. Therefore,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.600
he concluded, there must be far more gravity
in the clusters than just from the visible material.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.340
It turns out Zwicky’s observations had way
too much uncertainty in them to make any solid

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.690
claims. He hugely overestimated the amount
of invisible material. Rubin’s observations,

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.230
were far, far better and more accurate. However,
the term Zwicky used to dub this mysterious

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.569
material stuck, and we still use it: dark
matter.

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.730
Over the years, more observations have only
confirmed Rubin’s measurements. We see similar

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.709
behavior in elliptical galaxies, for example.
Ironically, better measurements made of galaxy

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.489
cluster member velocities show they do in
fact move too quickly, and clusters must have

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.200
dark matter in them too. Zwicky was right
for the wrong reason — and in the end, Rubin

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.870
is credited for making the discovery.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.470
Of course, the idea that so much of the material
in the Universe must be dark was met with

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.790
skepticism by astronomers. Everything gives
off some kind of light. But more observations

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.349
just kept supporting the existence of dark
matter.

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.659
So, what IS dark matter? That was the big
question. Astronomers were methodical. They

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.069
listed every single thing they could think
of that dark matter could possibly be: cold

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.970
gas, dust, dead stars, rogue planets, everything.
Even weird subatomic particles that were predicted

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.370
to exist in quantum mechanics theories, but
never seen before.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.549
Then they thought of ways they could detect
these objects. Cold gas would emit radio waves,

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.380
for example. But everything they tried came
up empty. One by one they crossed objects

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.800
off the list, and eventually everything made
of normal matter – atoms and molecules,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.330
protons, electrons, and neutrons – was eliminated.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.470
All that was left on the list was that truly
bizarre stuff: those screwy subatomic particles

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.970
no one had ever seen before. One such particle
is called an axion. They’ve never been detected,

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.240
but their properties match what we see of
dark matter: axions have mass, so if you have

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.440
a huge cloud of them they’ll have enough
gravity to affect galaxies. They don’t tend

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.740
to emit much light, so even a huge cloud of
them would be dark.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.350
And they another weird property: they don’t
interact with normal matter terribly well.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.310
An axion would pass right through you like
you weren’t there.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.940
If dark matter were made of axions, then clouds
of it could be enveloping clusters of galaxies

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.580
and we’d never see them. If that’s the case,
how could we ever know if they’re there or not?

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.280
It turns out there is a way. But before I
talk about that, we have to go over something

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.729
pretty weird. Actually several somethings
weird.

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.740
As I mentioned in our black hole episode,
one of Albert Einstein’s big ideas was that

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.949
space wasn’t just emptiness between stars.
In a sense it was an actual thing, with all

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.610
of matter and energy embedded in it.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.830
Although you have to be careful not to take
the analogy too literally, in many ways it

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.620
acts like a fabric with everything stuck to
it. This is more than just a theoretical construct;

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.580
it has real implications.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.430
For one, what we perceive as gravity – the
force pulling two objects together – was

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.639
actually just a bending of this fabric of
space, a warp. It’s like a bowling ball

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.419
sitting on a soft mattress; the surface of
the mattress bends, and if you roll a marble

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.620
past it, the path of the marble will curve.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.180
This is true for light, too! It’s like having
a bend in the road; cars follow the bend as

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.710
they move, and trucks do too. Everything does.
With light, it doesn’t bend nearly as much

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.940
as matter does, but it does curve if it moves
through space distorted by gravity. The more

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.470
massive an object is, the more gravity it
has, the more it warps space, and the more

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.020
it can warp the path of a light beam.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.229
You know what else bends light? A lens! So
we call this effect “gravitational lensing.”

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:22.460
Now picture a cluster of galaxies. It has
a lot of mass in a relatively small space

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.419
– well, in cosmic terms. If there’s a
galaxy on the other side of the cluster from

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:31.090
us, much farther away, the light that more
distant galaxy sends out gets bent on its

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:36.860
way to us. The image of the galaxy can smeared
out, distorted, forming fantastic and weird shapes.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.440
Einstein’s equations tell us that the amount
of bending depends on the mass of the cluster,

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:45.630
so we can, in theory, measure the mass of
the cluster by the distortion of objects behind

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.370
it. Not only that, but it gives us a map of
where that mass is!

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.120
Astronomers used this method on a cluster
of galaxies located about 3.5 billion light

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.479
years away called the Bullet Cluster. It’s
a very special object; it’s actually not

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:03.830
just a cluster, but a collision of two clusters.
That’s right, two huge groups of galaxies

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.770
are physically colliding, and may eventually
merge to form one huger cluster.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.639
When galaxies collide they tend to pass through
each other like ghosts. But in clusters, between

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:18.490
the galaxies, there are vast amounts of gas.
When clusters collide, the gas in the two

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.860
clusters does indeed smack into each other,
and gets incredibly hot. So hot, in fact,

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.470
the gas will emit X-rays.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.870
This provides an interesting opportunity.
Optical light images show the two clusters

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.729
next to each other. They’ve already one
pass, in fact. The galaxies moved through

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:37.979
each other as expected. The gas in the clusters
can’t do that, though, so you’d expect

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:42.710
most of it to be between the galaxies, having
slowed down as the clouds collided with each

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.240
other more or less head on.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.699
Using the Chandra X-ray observatory, astronomers
could map out where that hot gas was. And,

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:55.050
as expected it lies mostly between the galaxies,
having slowed down after the collision. You

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.539
can even see how the collision has shaped
the gas, forming a bow shock in one cluster

00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:02.539
like the waves of water created by a rapidly
moving boat.

00:08:02.539 --> 00:08:07.000
But there’s more. Even though the Bullet
Cluster is very far away, there are actually

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.139
hundreds of galaxies even farther away that
can be seen in the optical images. The gravity

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:16.610
of the matter in the Bullet Cluster distorted
those background galaxy images subtly, and

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:21.660
by very carefully measuring that distortion,
a map of all the mass in the Bullet Cluster was made.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:27.020
Including dark matter. If dark matter is made
of axions, then you’d expect it to mostly

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.900
be surrounding the subclusters themselves,
because, like the galaxies, the clouds of

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.420
dark matter axions would pass right through
each other.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:39.520
And when you do make the map that’s exactly
what you see! The background galaxies show

00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:43.409
that there’s a lot of matter, shown here
in violet, centered on the two clusters, but

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:47.459
it’s clearly not the hot gas seen by Chandra,
and is giving off no light.

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:49.779
It looks very much like dark matter.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:53.370
Since the Bullet Cluster observations were
made, several other clusters have been observed

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.550
showing the same sort of behavior. Attempts
have been made to explain these clusters without

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:01.750
using dark matter, but in the end the simplest
explanation looks to be the best one.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.220
The stuff we see isn’t all the stuff there
is.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.540
To be honest, we still don’t know what dark
matter is. Axions are one possibility, but

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:15.320
others exist. Lots of experiments have been
set up to try to detect the various flavors

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.740
of subatomic particles, but the very nature
of dark matter — it doesn’t give off light

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.950
and doesn’t interact with normal matter
well — makes it really hard to find. That’s

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.769
why it took so long to even know it existed
in the first place!

00:09:26.769 --> 00:09:32.460
But even though it’s incredibly elusive, it turns out that
dark matter has had a profound effect on the Universe.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.080
As we’ll see in upcoming episodes, we’re
getting a pretty good idea of how the Universe

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:42.089
got its start, and how it’s evolved over
the eons. We think smaller objects formed

00:09:42.089 --> 00:09:48.300
first, clumping together into larger and larger
structures. So stars formed first, then galaxies,

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.720
then clusters. It turns out that larger structures
would have had a hard time forming in the

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.560
early Universe as energy was blasted out by
the newborn stars and galaxies; bigger stuff

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.660
couldn’t aggregate due to all that heat.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:04.459
That is, without dark matter. When you include
dark matter in the physics, the structures

00:10:04.459 --> 00:10:06.410
we see in the Universe CAN form.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:11.130
How about that? Something like 85% of the
matter in the Universe is stuff we can’t

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:16.140
see, can barely detect, and is made of something
we know not what. But the largest structures

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.470
in the cosmos owe their existence to it.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:23.230
We humans can get a little arrogant, thinking
we occupy a special place in the Universe.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:28.550
In a sense, we do, because most of the Universe
is cold, empty space, and we live in a relatively

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:33.460
warm and dense part of it. But the stuff that
makes us up, the protons, electrons, and neutrons

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:38.600
of normal matter – that’s in a serious minority
when it comes to all the matter there is.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:44.240
In a way, Obi-wan Kenobi was right; there
may not be an actual Force, but there IS dark

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:48.579
matter. It surrounds us and penetrates us;
it binds the galaxy together.

00:10:48.579 --> 00:10:52.079
Today you learned that the kind of matter
we see – what we call normal matter – is

00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:57.029
only one kind of matter. There is also dark
matter, which we cannot directly see, and

00:10:57.029 --> 00:11:01.980
which interacts with normal matter only through
gravity. It affects how galaxies rotate, how

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:06.870
galaxies move in clusters, and how large structures
form in the Universe. It can be detected in

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:11.690
many ways, one of which is by seeing how its
mass affects the path of light coming from

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.279
distant galaxies as it passes through dark
matter in galaxy clusters.
