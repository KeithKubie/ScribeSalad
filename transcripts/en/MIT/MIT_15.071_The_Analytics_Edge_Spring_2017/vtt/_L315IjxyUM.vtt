00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.140
When Watson receives a
question, the first step

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.670
is question analysis.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.080
One of the things Watson tries
to figure out in this step

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.210
is what the question
is looking for.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.620
This is defined as trying
to find the Lexical Answer

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.300
Type, or LAT, of the question.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.280
The LAT is the word or
noun in the question

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.470
that specifies the
type of answer.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.720
You should be able to replace
the LAT with the answer

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.850
to complete the sentence.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.580
For example, for the
question, "Mozart's last

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.770
and perhaps most
powerful symphony

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.680
shares its name with this
planet," the LAT in this case

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.370
is "this planet."

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.380
If we replace this with
the answer "Jupiter,"

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.920
it makes sense.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.570
Mozart's last and perhaps
most powerful symphony shares

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.120
its name with Jupiter.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.270
For the question, "Smaller
than only Greenland,

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.910
it's the world's second largest
island," the LAT is "it's."

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.260
If we replace the LAT with
the answer "New Guinea,"

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.650
it makes sense.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.120
"Smaller than only
Greenland, New Guinea

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.850
is the world's second
largest island."

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.220
Unfortunately, the
LAT is not "island,"

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.520
which would be more descriptive,
since the sentence with "New

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.160
Guinea" in place of "island"
does not make sense.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.980
We can see in these two examples
that sometimes the LAT is very

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.630
specific, like "this planet,"
and sometimes it's very vague,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.880
like "it's."

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.460
If we know the LAT, we
know what to look for.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.420
However, in an analysis
of 20,000 questions,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.360
2,500 distinct LATs were
found, and 12% of the questions

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.680
did not even have
an explicit LAT.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.360
They had LATs like "it's."

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.789
Furthermore, even the most
frequent 200 explicit LATs

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.550
cover less than 50%
of the questions.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.420
So to enhance the
question analysis step,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.360
Watson also performs
relation detection

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.020
to find relationships among
words and decomposition

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.980
to split the question
into different clues.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.280
The second step in Watson
is hypothesis generation.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.100
The goal of this step is to use
the question analysis of step

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.190
one to produce candidate answers
by searching the databases.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.510
In this step several
hundred candidate answers

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.280
are generated.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.700
For the question, "Mozart's
last and perhaps most powerful

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.520
symphony shares its
name with this planet,"

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.050
candidate answers could be
Mercury, Earth, and Jupiter.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.760
These are generated using
various search techniques.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.380
Then each candidate
answer plugged back

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.750
into the question
in place of the LAT

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.700
is considered a hypothesis.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.100
For the question about
Mozart's symphony,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.200
hypothesis one would
be the question

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.400
with "Mercury" in
place of "this planet."

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.490
Hypothesis two
would have "Jupiter"

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.360
in place of "this planet."

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.510
And hypothesis three
would have "Earth"

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.050
in place of "this planet."

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.350
If the correct answer is
not generated at this stage,

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.260
Watson has no hope of
getting the question right.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.760
Therefore, this step
errors on the side

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.220
of generating a
lot of hypotheses

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.040
and leaves it up
to the next step

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.260
to find the correct answer.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.140
In the next video, we'll
discuss how steps three and four

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.930
score and rank the hypotheses.
