00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.301
From damming rivers to changing the chemistry
of the atmosphere, humans have had a powerful

00:00:05.301 --> 00:00:09.711
impact on our planet. But what would happen
if we suddenly disappeared?

00:00:09.711 --> 00:00:13.960
The first few weeks would be chaotic. Within
hours, power plants would run out of fuel

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.470
and shut down. As lights go out and electric
fences lose their sting, over one and a half

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.411
billion cows, nearly a billion pigs and more
than 20 billion chickens will break out of

00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:27.880
their enclosures, desperate for food. Without
any humans to feed them, most of these livestock

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.001
will starve or become food for over half a
billion dogs and a roughly equal number of

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:36.941
cats who now have to fend for themselves.
Of course, many of our fancy breeds are ill-suited

00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:41.631
for life in the wild, and will probably be
outcompeted by hardier mutts, not to mention

00:00:41.631 --> 00:00:47.181
wolves, coyotes and wildcats. Other animals
that depend on humans, from rats to cockroaches,

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:52.781
will suffer drastic population declines. Some,
like body lice and head lice, will go extinct.

00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:56.791
In the cities, many of our famous boulevards
are now rivers. Without electric pumps to

00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:58.961
keep
them dry, underground subway tunnels will

00:00:58.961 --> 00:01:03.071
quickly fill with water. Other streets will
be overtaken with weeds and vines, followed

00:01:03.071 --> 00:01:04.701
by larger plants and trees.

00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:09.530
But before that happens, most cities will
be wiped out by fire. Modern houses, especially

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.911
in the suburbs, are still largely made of
timber. With no firefighters around, a single

00:01:13.911 --> 00:01:17.610
lightning strike is all it takes to start
a fire that could burn whole subdivisions

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.621
to the ground. In the countryside, many wood
structures will be destroyed within a few

00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:25.720
decades, if not by fire, then by termites
and other decomposers.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.610
After 100 years most wood structures will
be gone, and anything made of steel - from

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.250
apartment
buildings to cars and even bridges - aren’t

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.220
far behind. Steel is mostly iron, and without
constant

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.311
application of paints and coatings, it will
quickly react with oxygen in the atmosphere

00:01:39.311 --> 00:01:42.661
and return to its native form of iron oxide,
or rust.

00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:46.311
By this time humans have been gone for a few
hundred years, and most species of animals

00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:50.271
around the world - at least, the ones we haven’t
driven to extinction - will have bounced back

00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:52.420
to
the levels they were at before we evolved.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.271
But their distribution will remain forever
altered.

00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:59.860
Camels now roam Australia, while in North
America dozens of species of songbirds imported

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.460
from Europe will continue to thrive. It’s
even possible that in some parts of the world,

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.201
escaped zoo animals could form new wild populations,
leading to the prospect of lions on the Great

00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:12.171
Plains, or hippos in South American rivers.

00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:15.951
Forever proliferating through space will be
the electromagnetic radiation we created from

00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:18.171
our radios, satellites and phones.

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:22.201
But if anything will outlast us on Earth,
it may be our trash. The chemical bonds that

00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:26.561
hold together plastics or vulcanized rubber
are immune to most of the digestive enzymes

00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:32.031
used by bacteria to break down natural polymers
and unlike metals, plastics don’t rust or

00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:36.841
corrode. These microplastics escape into waterways
or drift along in the ocean and are eventually

00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:41.521
deposited in sediments. Hundreds of millions
of years from now, alien geologists from outer

00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:46.041
space may be surprised to find sedimentary
rocks full of tiny carbon-based particles

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:48.801
that were once part of rubber tires or plastic
bags.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:52.741
Of course, whether something survives depends
greatly on the conditions. Everything will

00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:54.681
last
much longer in deserts, where there is no

00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:59.431
moisture to speed up rusting or support decomposing
organisms. And while the carbon cycle will

00:02:59.431 --> 00:03:04.631
return CO2 levels to equilibrium after a few
thousand years, local deposits of long-lived

00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:09.731
organic chemicals or radioactive material
could persist for a very, very long time.

00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.991
It’s hard to know what alien paleontologists
of the future will make of us; how they will

00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:16.241
explain
our love of plastic or the fact that within

00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:19.131
a geological eyeblink we exploded out of Africa
to

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:23.991
colonize virtually every inhabitable space
on earth. But they’ll definitely wonder

00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:26.991
why, if we
were so successful for so long, we disappeared

00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:28.251
so quickly.

00:03:28.251 --> 00:03:32.641
