00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
It's amusing, after your morning coffee
or tea,

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.140
to start tapping on the cup with your spoon.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.600
It's pretty much the same pitch everywhere,
tun-tun-tun, whatever it is, and then maybe

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.859
it's the characteristic pitch of this
cup, and if you take another cup and

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.470
another spoon, for that matter, maybe you 
get a different sound.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.610
Who knows? So maybe it's always the same
pitch from this particular cup

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.100
if tapped by this spoon. But then, I started tapping
somewhere else.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.460
Those four points emit a common pitch,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.680
And those four points also emit a common pitch,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.300
but a higher pitch than those four
points. We'll explore what's causing this,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.100
but you might first think that it has to
do with the handle. That seems to be a very

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.600
suspicious culprit, and thank you very
much for pointing that out too.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.110
Of course it has to do with the handle, but-- if it
has to do with the handle, wouldn't you have

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.780
thought that this half closer to the handle
and this half farther from the handle

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.590
should behave differently?

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.100
But that's not how the symmetry is broken.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:26.800
Indeed, the point next to the handle and point
farthest from the handle

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:36.840
behave exactly the same way. Whereas 45 degrees 
off, you get the higher pitch.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.120
It has to do with the handle, perhaps, but the symmetry-breaking pattern is not so naive

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.480
as we at first thought. Let's understand what's
happening, and in order to do this we'll

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.380
break it up in two stages. First, we'll
understand why any quadruplet of four

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.219
points that form the vertices of a
square always give you the same pitch,

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.649
a common pitch, and then we'll understand why
this quadruplet emits a

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.420
higher pitch than those four points.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.800
Okay, so let's forget about the handle. So
the handle-- pretend the handle's not there.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.819
When we tap this point, we are making this point
vibrate. We're setting it in motion

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.360
like this.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.220
Well, roughly speaking,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.080
the point diametrically opposite can
react in one of the two ways. When this

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.920
point is doing that, the other point can
go like this,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.240
Or go like this. We say in phase

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.880
or out of phase. Now, this reaction--
this response-- is essentially moving the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.700
cup back and forth, back and forth,
sliding it as a total rigid body, as a

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.760
whole body, and it does not really (to a good approximation) deform the cup.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.920
But, of course, the sound has to do with the
deformation of the cup, how it's vibrating altogether.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.380
So, so this is not producing
sound-- that's not what you're hearing--

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.709
what you're hearing is this response
when this point moves back and forth

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.490
this goes in and out and at the same
time like this

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.209
- Professor, why does that make a sound, by the way? 
- Because sound means that somebody

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.129
(for example, it can be your throat, it
can be for example birds chirping,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.820
it can be a cup chiming) is vibrating very, very
fast and shaking air around it, and when you

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.570
shake the air like this

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.050
the air next to it gets compressed and
bounces off because the air has some

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.590
elasticity, and then that bounce compresses the
next part of the air and bounces off

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.989
and there's a wave that propagates like
this towards the camera and eventually

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.920
reaches the ear and inside the eardrum
this wave is shaking the eardrum and

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.810
that's what you hear as a sound. Okay. So the
vibration and deformation ultimately, of

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.709
the very rapid deformation of the cup, is
producing the sound. And this response is not

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:46.640
really deforming the cup, whereas this one
is, so. And this is what's primarily

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.049
responsible for the sound. On the other
hand, the cup as a whole doesn't want to

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.890
change its volume if it can help it, it
wants to stay as incompressible as

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.270
possible. In other words, when those two go in, well,
by reaction these two are pushed out

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.600
in order to keep the same volume, and if
these go out these two are pulled in so that

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.350
you get this kind of rhombus-type oscillation, pum-pum-pum-pum-pum, and that's why any

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.060
quadruplet of four points that form the vertices of a square always sing in unison.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.019
It doesn't matter which of the four
points you start exciting, all the other

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.430
three follow, and four together go into
this losange

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.710
or rhombus vibration. Well, so we now
understand why this quadruplet of points and

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.449
this quadruplet of points each

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.910
emits a common pitch. Now, why this
quadruplet of points are higher-pitched than this

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.600
quadruplet of points are lower-pitched--
in order to understand that we must

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.200
resurrect the handle that we have been
neglecting so far. So the handle comes back.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.360
You see, when-- let's say that we
excite one of the four points, those,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.770
those four points. As we saw, it doesn't
matter which of the four points you

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.009
excite because all of them work in
unison. When those four points are

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:03.940
vibrating together, they have to take the
handle, drag the handle with them, because

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.090
you see, one of the points, vibrating points, is attached to the handle, so the

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.090
handle must move back and forth while
those four points are vibrating. In contrast

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.620
when those four points are made to vibrate,
you remember what happens-- when this goes in,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.570
this goes out and this goes in,
this goes out. The point just in between is

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.410
what we call a node. In other words, to a
good approximation, it's stationary,

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.400
it doesn't move in between, so as far as these
quadruplet of points are concerned,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.400
the handle is invisible-- it's as if the hand
were not there because it's attached to

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.260
a point that's not doing any vibration, vibrational 
motion. So we now have two

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.750
elastic systems-- you can think of them as
springs if you like-- this one and this one.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.610
One of them is attached to some heavy
mass that he has to drag along; the other

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.780
one is not attached to anything because
this is invisible to those four points.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.440
And they are made of the same stiff material that is the cup. So imagine two

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.840
springs, one of them is attached to a heavy mass, the other one is not attached

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.120
to a heavy mass, and when you let them go what you
hear-- the heavy one goes *wmmm*

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.780
[imitates low-frequency oscillations]

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.480
in a very sluggish way, whereas the back
goes hee-ho, hee-ho, and that's the difference of the

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:22.820
pitch that we hear. And that is why these four points
emit a low pitch whereas those four

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:29.610
points emit the higher pitch. So far, we saw
where the handle was and we try to figure out

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:35.339
what this sound pattern was like. The
inverse problem is also interesting

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:39.029
by which I mean, since we're talking
about the pitch of the sound that we hear,

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:43.189
let's imagine ourselves in a pitch dark
room. Say that we walk into this room.

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:47.279
We don't know where the handle is, but
imagine that we are allowed to go around

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:53.160
the cup, tapping it everywhere, and record the sound
pattern that we get from each point.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.020
From that recorded data of the sound pattern
can we reconstruct where the handle was?

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.140
That is the inverse problem. A bit more
abstractly speaking, instead of saying

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:06.809
that we know the cause and then by
solving whatever mathematical model,

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:10.889
partial differential equations, whatnot,
you try to predict what the effect

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:14.789
is going to be, we are going the other
direction. We have this observed data,

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:19.349
effects if you like, which we know to be
true, I mean, we just see this, and we

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:23.490
then try to figure out what on earth is
causing, is responsible for the

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.209
production of this effect. So this is the
inverse problem rather than our forward

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:30.990
problem. And if you think about it much
of the scientific endeavor is really

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.529
about solving an inverse problem. We
wanted to get to the bottom of things,

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:39.899
want to recover the cause, and this very,
very simple everyday morning breakfast

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:45.059
example shows that the inverse problem
is not always naively solvable. Indeed

00:07:45.059 --> 00:07:51.509
you probably agree with me that if I
took a cup and rotated 90 degrees, the

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:53.920
basic pattern that we hear

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.180
in a north-south-east-west and so on and
in between will be the same.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.080
We don't know where the handle is up to
90 degree rotation. You can be here, here,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.650
here, here. So we can narrow it down to
four possible positions

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:14.020
Yes. Well, okay, so there is some sort of
ambiguity, you know, as regards the

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.370
position because the handle can be here or
here or here or here and you'll get the same

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.070
pattern of the noise. But there's
something even worse.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.070
You can't even tell the number of handles
because instead of having a large handle

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.120
here you could have two maybe medium
handles, and you agree that the pattern

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.080
of the vibration will be the same, or
indeed four small handles here and here

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.650
and here and you'd probably get still the
same, what we call the ground state or the

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.160
same kind of vibration pattern. So you
can't even tell the number of handles

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.870
and you can't tell the position of handles
but up to symmetry, you can actually

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.510
start saying something and this is a
very typical solution in the

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.680
typical situation. You wanted to "mod out"-- you have to sort of neglect and

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.460
somehow take out this mentally and then start solving the problem. Anyway, so this

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:58.000
very simple example shows that the
universal problem is on the whole not always

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.200
solvable. But you can actually say
something when you sort of start

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.000
handling the symmetry in a clever way.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:13.100
- If we turned the lights out, and I was 
trying to figure out the cup, can I do it?

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:18.240
- We in general can't, but we can
say something up to symmetry. You know,

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:22.420
we know that for example there aren't three handles because that would break the symmetry in

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.270
a completely different manner. In fact,
ever since I noticed this phenomenon

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.930
I've been looking for a cup with 3 handles
because that would be very interesting

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:35.080
and recently a friend of mine, Brian
White of Stanford, got me 2 cups

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:41.320
and one of them has three handles. Now, I'm--
unfortunately it's not a very nice cup

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.430
in-- I mean, it is a very
beautiful cup-- but for our purposes, for our

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.450
purposes it's not a very well-performing
cup because it doesn't really chime nicely.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.180
And in between.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.020
So it's somewhat interesting, I 
mean, those three points

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:13.720
and those three points in between emit 
a common pitch, but in between...

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.400
I'm not sure that I can do this. You can't
really hear the difference.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:27.780
It's a very very small difference.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:34.139
Yeah. So in between there's a slight
rising of the pitch that I'd like to

00:10:34.139 --> 00:10:38.790
hear more clearly, so we need a larger
cup right away. And this is a very choppy

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:44.249
chunky mug from Stanford's math department,
but if you take a really well-made thin

00:10:44.249 --> 00:10:48.549
and delicate china cup, this chime is so much more beautiful, so I recommend it.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.960
Arrows 3. Well, it's 3 to the 3 to the 3. You ain't seen 
nothing yet. OK, so

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.940
here we go, 3, 4 arrows, one more arrow.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:11.570
Well, what does this mean? 3, 3 arrows of 3, 3
arrows...
