00:00:00.442 --> 00:00:03.490
- [Voiceover] So let's say S
is the value that this infinite

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.683
series converges to.

00:00:04.683 --> 00:00:08.350
We're going to assume that
this series actually converges.

00:00:08.635 --> 00:00:11.945
And the definition of the
series, each term is going

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:13.258
to be a function of N.

00:00:13.258 --> 00:00:15.018
We're going to assume
that this is the same type

00:00:15.018 --> 00:00:16.618
of series that we looked
at when we looked at the

00:00:16.618 --> 00:00:19.810
integral test, or namely that
this function is a continuous

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.226
positive decreasing
function over the interval

00:00:23.226 --> 00:00:24.669
that we care about.

00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:29.818
So it is continuous, it is
positive, and it is decreasing.

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:31.748
This isn't saying
continuous plus decreasing.

00:00:31.748 --> 00:00:33.012
Let me just write it that way.

00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:38.012
Continuous positive and it is decreasing.

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:41.837
So it could be a function that
looks something like this.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.488
Now, my goal of this video
is to see if we can estimate

00:00:45.488 --> 00:00:47.224
a range around S.

00:00:47.224 --> 00:00:48.904
So this is going to be very
useful, because we've seen

00:00:48.904 --> 00:00:51.481
some infinite series where
we are able to figure out

00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:54.224
what exactly does it converge to.

00:00:54.224 --> 00:00:56.143
But you could imagine
there are many, many more

00:00:56.143 --> 00:00:57.586
where we're not going
to be able to figure out

00:00:57.586 --> 00:00:59.554
exactly what it converges to.

00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:00.994
And instead we're going
to have to do it using a

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:02.507
computer or by hand.

00:01:02.507 --> 00:01:05.266
And in those cases, it's
good to know how good

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.650
our estimate is.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.866
And we also want as good
of an estimate as possible

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.922
with as little computation as possible.

00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:13.621
So let's think about how we can do that.

00:01:13.826 --> 00:01:15.731
Well, the way to tackle it,
you could imagine, is let's

00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:18.753
split this up, this infinite
sum, let's split it up

00:01:18.753 --> 00:01:21.017
into the sum of a finite sum.

00:01:21.017 --> 00:01:23.341
So let's say the first k terms.

00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:26.805
So n equals one to k of f of n.

00:01:26.848 --> 00:01:28.418
So this is very computable.

00:01:28.418 --> 00:01:31.777
If k is low enough and if
f a simple enough function,

00:01:31.777 --> 00:01:33.252
you could probably do this by hand.

00:01:33.252 --> 00:01:35.645
But you could definitely
do this with a computer.

00:01:35.704 --> 00:01:39.159
And then it's going to
be that plus an infinite.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.343
Plus another infinite series.

00:01:41.343 --> 00:01:43.199
But now you're going to
pick up at k plus one, the

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:44.654
k plus one term.

00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:48.587
And you're going to go
to infinity of f of n.

00:01:48.783 --> 00:01:51.639
So if we could put some
bounds on this, then that'll

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:56.639
allow us to put some bounds
on this right over here.

00:01:56.677 --> 00:02:00.312
Because this is just the
sum of the partial sum of

00:02:00.312 --> 00:02:03.862
the partial sum of the first
k terms and the remainder

00:02:03.862 --> 00:02:08.781
that we get after to get
us to the actual value.

00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:11.845
So you could see kind of
what's left over after

00:02:11.845 --> 00:02:14.309
we take that partial sum.

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:16.253
And this is easier to
write for me than this

00:02:16.253 --> 00:02:17.453
right over here.

00:02:17.453 --> 00:02:22.133
So they key is, can we come
up with some bounds for this?

00:02:23.148 --> 00:02:25.515
And to do that I'm going
to go to this graph and use

00:02:25.515 --> 00:02:27.642
some of the same arguments
we used, or the same

00:02:27.642 --> 00:02:30.679
conceptual ideas we used,
for the integration test.

00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:35.900
There's two ways to
conceptualize what the sum

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.835
represents relative to this graph.

00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:41.657
As we'll see, it can
represent an over estimate of

00:02:41.657 --> 00:02:44.827
the area between sum,
x value, and infinity.

00:02:44.827 --> 00:02:46.973
And it could represent
the underestimate of a

00:02:46.973 --> 00:02:48.246
different region.

00:02:48.246 --> 00:02:49.237
So let's look at that.

00:02:49.237 --> 00:02:53.004
So let's first think
about the underestimate.

00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:54.982
Let's think about the underestimate.

00:02:54.982 --> 00:02:57.279
So if this right over here,
let's say that this right

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:59.022
over here is k.

00:03:00.037 --> 00:03:02.209
Actually, let me do it
in a color that's...

00:03:02.373 --> 00:03:04.816
Let me do it in that yellow color.

00:03:05.093 --> 00:03:07.781
So let's say that this
right over here is k.

00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:09.661
This is k plus one.

00:03:13.168 --> 00:03:15.379
Let's do this is k plus two.

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.467
K plus 2, k plus 3, on and on and on.

00:03:19.467 --> 00:03:23.548
So one way to conceptualize
this sum right over here

00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:26.948
is it could be the sum of
the following rectangles.

00:03:27.978 --> 00:03:31.331
So the first term is this
area, the area of this

00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:32.601
first rectangle.

00:03:32.601 --> 00:03:36.049
Because this area's height,
or this rectangle's height,

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.041
is f of k plus one.

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:44.033
And its width is one, so
f of k plus one times one.

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:45.809
Its area is just going to
be f of k plus one, which

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:47.960
is exactly this first term
right over here, where

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.661
n is k plus one.

00:03:49.713 --> 00:03:51.784
And then the second term,
by that same argument,

00:03:51.784 --> 00:03:55.352
could represent the
area of this rectangle.

00:03:55.352 --> 00:03:57.703
The third term could represent
the area of the rectangle.

00:03:57.703 --> 00:04:00.423
And we could just keep
going on and on and on.

00:04:00.423 --> 00:04:04.087
So what are the sums of these
areas of these rectangles?

00:04:04.087 --> 00:04:06.068
What are the sums of
these terms representing?

00:04:06.068 --> 00:04:08.204
Well, you could view it as an estimate.

00:04:08.204 --> 00:04:11.705
You could view it as an
estimate of the area under

00:04:11.705 --> 00:04:15.638
the curve between x equals
k and x equals infinity.

00:04:15.638 --> 00:04:18.173
But it's going to be an underestimate.

00:04:18.173 --> 00:04:21.183
Notice these are all completely
contained in that area.

00:04:21.183 --> 00:04:25.006
So one way to think about
it is that our R sub k

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.756
is less than or equal to its
underestimate for the area

00:04:30.756 --> 00:04:35.756
between x equals k and
infinity of f of x dx.

00:04:39.982 --> 00:04:44.085
So that essentially puts
an upper bound on us.

00:04:44.085 --> 00:04:46.287
And this is already
interesting, because now we can

00:04:46.287 --> 00:04:51.287
already say if S -- so we
know that S is equal to this.

00:04:52.718 --> 00:04:55.415
Now if this is less than
this thing right over here,

00:04:55.415 --> 00:04:58.503
we can say that S is going
to be less than or equal to

00:04:58.503 --> 00:05:03.503
our partial sum plus this thing.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.480
Plus the improper integral from
k to infinity of f of x dx.

00:05:11.462 --> 00:05:14.477
Notice if this is equal to
this and now since this is less

00:05:14.477 --> 00:05:16.781
than this, this must be
less than what we have

00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:18.078
on the right hand side.

00:05:18.078 --> 00:05:20.477
So just like that, if we're
able to compute these two things

00:05:20.477 --> 00:05:22.502
and we are often able to
compute these two things,

00:05:22.502 --> 00:05:26.195
we're able to put an upper
bound on our actual sum.

00:05:26.703 --> 00:05:28.736
Now what about placing
a lower bound on it?

00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:32.626
Well, we could conceptualize
the same sum, the same

00:05:32.626 --> 00:05:33.734
R sub k.

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:38.734
Instead we can conceptualize
it this way, where the first

00:05:39.574 --> 00:05:42.018
term here represents not
this rectangle, but it

00:05:42.018 --> 00:05:43.953
represents this rectangle.

00:05:43.953 --> 00:05:46.017
Notice it has the same
height, but it's just shifted

00:05:46.017 --> 00:05:47.265
over one to the right.

00:05:47.265 --> 00:05:49.072
The second term represents this rectangle.

00:05:49.072 --> 00:05:52.372
This third term represents this rectangle.

00:05:52.392 --> 00:05:53.281
Why does that make sense?

00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:55.760
Well, the area of this first
rectangle, this is going to

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.138
be its height, which is f of
k plus one times its width,

00:06:00.138 --> 00:06:02.767
which is just one, so it's
going to be f of k plus one.

00:06:02.767 --> 00:06:06.118
So the area here is the first
term, the area here is the

00:06:06.118 --> 00:06:08.415
second term, area here is
the third term, the area here

00:06:08.415 --> 00:06:09.727
is the fourth term.

00:06:09.727 --> 00:06:11.671
One way to think about it,
we just shifted all of those

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:15.624
yellow rectangles one to the right.

00:06:16.162 --> 00:06:18.455
But now this is approximating
a different region.

00:06:18.455 --> 00:06:21.023
This is approximating the
area under the curve not from

00:06:21.023 --> 00:06:24.264
k to infinity, but from
k plus one to infinity.

00:06:24.264 --> 00:06:26.254
And instead of being an
underestimate, it's an

00:06:26.254 --> 00:06:27.598
overestimate.

00:06:27.598 --> 00:06:31.170
Now the curve is contained
within the rectangles.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.707
So we could say that R sub
k in this context, when we

00:06:35.707 --> 00:06:38.101
conceptualize it this way,
is going to be greater than

00:06:38.101 --> 00:06:40.364
or equal to the improper
integral not from k,

00:06:40.364 --> 00:06:45.364
but from k plus one to infinity f of x dx.

00:06:48.515 --> 00:06:50.332
And what does that allow us to do?

00:06:50.332 --> 00:06:53.091
Well, this places a lower
bound on this, which will

00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:55.003
also place a lower bound on this.

00:06:55.003 --> 00:06:59.779
If this is greater than that,
then this is going to be

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:02.539
greater than this replaced
with the improper integral.

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:03.963
So we can write that.

00:07:03.963 --> 00:07:08.226
So S is going to be greater
than or equal to S sub k

00:07:08.226 --> 00:07:13.226
plus the improper integral
from k plus one to infinity

00:07:14.853 --> 00:07:18.872
f of x dx.

00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:20.877
Now, you might be saying,
"Hey, Sal, this looks all

00:07:20.877 --> 00:07:23.898
"crazy, you have all this
abstract notation here, you've

00:07:23.898 --> 00:07:27.903
"introduced an integral sign,
this seems really daunting."

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:30.480
But as we'll see in the next
few videos, these are actually

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.131
sometimes fairly
straightforward to compute.

00:07:33.131 --> 00:07:34.675
This can be very straightforward
to compute if our

00:07:34.675 --> 00:07:35.843
k is not too large.

00:07:35.843 --> 00:07:37.530
If it's even large, a computer can do it.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:40.958
And then these we can actually
often compute sometimes

00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.970
numerically, but even more
frequently, and that kind of

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.034
defeats the purpose, but
we can also compute them

00:07:45.034 --> 00:07:49.252
using our analytic tools,
using, I guess you could say,

00:07:49.252 --> 00:07:51.721
the power of calculus.

00:07:51.765 --> 00:07:55.268
And so what this allows us
to do is put a pretty neat

00:07:55.268 --> 00:08:00.268
band around what our actual
value that we converge to is.

00:08:00.584 --> 00:08:03.495
And as we'll see, the
higher our k, the better an

00:08:03.495 --> 00:08:06.832
estimate we get and the
tighter arrange of our

00:08:06.832 --> 00:08:09.047
confidence for that estimate.

00:08:09.047 --> 00:08:11.071
And another way to write
these two inequalities is

00:08:11.071 --> 00:08:13.470
to write a compound inequality
that S is going to be

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.218
less than or equal to this business.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:21.499
So copy and paste.

00:08:22.264 --> 00:08:27.264
And S is going to be greater
than or equal to this business.

00:08:29.136 --> 00:08:30.649
So we could say this
business is going to be less

00:08:30.649 --> 00:08:32.340
than or equal to S.

00:08:32.369 --> 00:08:34.436
So let me just copy and paste that.

00:08:34.464 --> 00:08:37.546
So copy and paste.

00:08:37.546 --> 00:08:39.361
Oops, that's not what I wanted to do.

00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:42.556
So copy and paste.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.173
Then we could write it just like that.

00:08:45.232 --> 00:08:47.720
And so the next series of
videos will actually apply this

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.615
and we'll see that it's
pretty straightforward.

00:08:50.615 --> 00:08:52.644
It looks a little daunting right now.
