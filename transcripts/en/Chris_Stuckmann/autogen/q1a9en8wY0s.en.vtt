00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:31.990
like he's actually a human being like he
 

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.980
like he's actually a human being like he
isn't like just a rock or a robot like

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:34.990
isn't like just a rock or a robot like
 

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.970
isn't like just a rock or a robot like
he actually has some emotional

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:35.980
he actually has some emotional
 

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.410
he actually has some emotional
attachment to these people now this is

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:37.420
attachment to these people now this is
 

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.820
attachment to these people now this is
the third time we've seen him in a movie

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:38.830
the third time we've seen him in a movie
 

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.710
the third time we've seen him in a movie
so and they even set it up a little bit

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720
so and they even set it up a little bit
 

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.290
so and they even set it up a little bit
like when he's talking to Thor it's a

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:43.300
like when he's talking to Thor it's a
 

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.850
like when he's talking to Thor it's a
funny scene but he's like I had to kill

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:44.860
funny scene but he's like I had to kill
 

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.769
funny scene but he's like I had to kill
my own father and my mother yeah my

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:46.779
my own father and my mother yeah my
 

00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:48.090
my own father and my mother yeah my
mother's gone and everything and he's

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:48.100
mother's gone and everything and he's
 

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.860
mother's gone and everything and he's
like I think that's I think that's

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:49.870
like I think that's I think that's
 

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.990
like I think that's I think that's
harder than having to kill a sister like

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000
harder than having to kill a sister like
 

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.390
harder than having to kill a sister like
it's funny but it's true he really has

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:54.400
it's funny but it's true he really has
 

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.070
it's funny but it's true he really has
lost a lot and I feel like maybe Gamora

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080
lost a lot and I feel like maybe Gamora
 

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.360
lost a lot and I feel like maybe Gamora
kind of his last love really that's

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:00.370
kind of his last love really that's
 

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:03.720
kind of his last love really that's
alive so I can I can see how a guy like

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:03.730
alive so I can I can see how a guy like
 

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.610
alive so I can I can see how a guy like
that would make that mistake it's

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:05.620
that would make that mistake it's
 

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.470
that would make that mistake it's
frustrating cuz you're like it was right

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:07.480
frustrating cuz you're like it was right
 

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.090
frustrating cuz you're like it was right
there can you have waited a couple more

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:09.100
there can you have waited a couple more
 

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.100
there can you have waited a couple more
seconds but that's what love is I know I

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:11.110
seconds but that's what love is I know I
 

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.530
seconds but that's what love is I know I
get it it's frustrating because it makes

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:13.540
get it it's frustrating because it makes
 

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.750
get it it's frustrating because it makes
star-lord less appealing because you're

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760
star-lord less appealing because you're
 

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.760
star-lord less appealing because you're
like it's your fault but at the same

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:17.770
like it's your fault but at the same
 

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.280
like it's your fault but at the same
time out of any character if there was

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:20.290
time out of any character if there was
 

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.660
time out of any character if there was
one that had to do that I would say it

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:21.670
one that had to do that I would say it
 

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.329
one that had to do that I would say it
would probably be him because he's the

00:10:24.329 --> 00:10:24.339
would probably be him because he's the
 

00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:27.840
would probably be him because he's the
most human just normal guy out of out of

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:27.850
most human just normal guy out of out of
 

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:29.519
most human just normal guy out of out of
the majority of them that isn't as

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:29.529
the majority of them that isn't as
 

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:31.620
the majority of them that isn't as
heroic as say Tony Stark is because

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:31.630
heroic as say Tony Stark is because
 

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.449
heroic as say Tony Stark is because
Tony's been through more he's had more

00:10:33.449 --> 00:10:33.459
Tony's been through more he's had more
 

00:10:33.459 --> 00:10:34.740
Tony's been through more he's had more
life in death scenario so you already

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:34.750
life in death scenario so you already
 

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.660
life in death scenario so you already
tried to give his life for New York in

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:36.670
tried to give his life for New York in
 

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.640
tried to give his life for New York in
the first Avengers and star-lords had to

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:38.650
the first Avengers and star-lords had to
 

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.199
the first Avengers and star-lords had to
do a lot of terrible decisions too but I

00:10:40.199 --> 00:10:40.209
do a lot of terrible decisions too but I
 

00:10:40.209 --> 00:10:41.730
do a lot of terrible decisions too but I
feel like maybe that was just sort of

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:41.740
feel like maybe that was just sort of
 

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.630
feel like maybe that was just sort of
like the last straw

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640
like the last straw
 

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.120
like the last straw
like his mom okay that was terrible my

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.130
like his mom okay that was terrible my
 

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.860
like his mom okay that was terrible my

cam done so I kind of feel with you I
 

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:51.720
cam done so I kind of feel with you I
kind of agree with both of you really

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:51.730
kind of agree with both of you really
 

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.340
kind of agree with both of you really
it's it was a little out of character

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:53.350
it's it was a little out of character
 

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:56.280
it's it was a little out of character
but if anyone had to make that choice I

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:56.290
but if anyone had to make that choice I
 

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:57.510
but if anyone had to make that choice I
would say it was him I feel like it's

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:57.520
would say it was him I feel like it's
 

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.460
would say it was him I feel like it's
more appealing at least to me because if

00:10:59.460 --> 00:10:59.470
more appealing at least to me because if
 

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.040
more appealing at least to me because if
he makes it more human then it's it's

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.050
he makes it more human then it's it's
 

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.810
he makes it more human then it's it's
more human but they also had a

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:03.820
more human but they also had a
 

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.880
more human but they also had a
plan in place to save the universe and

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:05.890
plan in place to save the universe and
 

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:07.830
plan in place to save the universe and
at the last second we make mistakes we

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:07.840
at the last second we make mistakes we
 

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.770
at the last second we make mistakes we
do and I agree with that but not even

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:10.780
do and I agree with that but not even
 

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.720
do and I agree with that but not even
from that scene the whole movie he was

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:12.730
from that scene the whole movie he was
 

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.700
from that scene the whole movie he was
sort of an unlikable character and I I

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:14.710
sort of an unlikable character and I I
 

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.190
sort of an unlikable character and I I
feel like that was just the one out of

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200
feel like that was just the one out of
 

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.410
feel like that was just the one out of
place character in the entire movie that

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:19.420
place character in the entire movie that
 

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.240
place character in the entire movie that
didn't really mesh with previous other

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:21.250
didn't really mesh with previous other
 

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.670
didn't really mesh with previous other
films if you make a person in the film

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680
films if you make a person in the film
 

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.260
films if you make a person in the film
like a character rather than a human

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:25.270
like a character rather than a human
 

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.540
like a character rather than a human
being which one are you gonna you know

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:27.550
being which one are you gonna you know
 

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.640
being which one are you gonna you know
say oh yeah I'm more connected to the

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:29.650
say oh yeah I'm more connected to the
 

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.470
say oh yeah I'm more connected to the
human being rather than the character in

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:31.480
human being rather than the character in
 

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.570
human being rather than the character in
the film so I feel like star-lord in

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:33.580
the film so I feel like star-lord in
 

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.980
the film so I feel like star-lord in
this movie was more of a human being or

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:34.990
this movie was more of a human being or
 

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.090
this movie was more of a human being or
anything like a character written in a

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:36.100
anything like a character written in a
 

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.890
anything like a character written in a
script to me what those all the

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:37.900
script to me what those all the
 

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.570
script to me what those all the
decision-making he's with you I feel

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:39.580
decision-making he's with you I feel
 

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.980
decision-making he's with you I feel
like if any character should have caused

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:40.990
like if any character should have caused
 

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:43.320
like if any character should have caused
that incident maybe like the plan to

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:43.330
that incident maybe like the plan to
 

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.880
that incident maybe like the plan to
fail should have been Drax because he's

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:44.890
fail should have been Drax because he's
 

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.190
fail should have been Drax because he's
the one who lost his entire planet the

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200
the one who lost his entire planet the
 

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.080
the one who lost his entire planet the
Thanos and he lost his temper in the

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.090
Thanos and he lost his temper in the
 

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.490
Thanos and he lost his temper in the
first that's a good Guardians movie

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:50.500
first that's a good Guardians movie
 

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.380
first that's a good Guardians movie
where he made the plan fail the first

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:52.390
where he made the plan fail the first
 

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.020
where he made the plan fail the first
time so maybe I feel like maybe that

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:55.030
time so maybe I feel like maybe that
 

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.010
time so maybe I feel like maybe that
character would have worked better for

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:56.020
character would have worked better for
 

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:56.820
character would have worked better for
that situation

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:56.830
that situation
 

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.610
that situation
maybe they kind of had him almost lose

00:11:59.610 --> 00:11:59.620
maybe they kind of had him almost lose
 

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.620
maybe they kind of had him almost lose
his shit the first time he sees Thanos

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:01.630
his shit the first time he sees Thanos
 

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.050
his shit the first time he sees Thanos
and then I feel like after he got sliced

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:04.060
and then I feel like after he got sliced
 

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.570
and then I feel like after he got sliced
up in the Domino pieces he probably was

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:06.580
up in the Domino pieces he probably was
 

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.980
up in the Domino pieces he probably was
