00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.090
NARRATOR: In 2011, it was
declared that Afghanistan

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.580
was one of the most
dangerous places in the world

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.010
to be a woman.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.090
But that wasn't always the case.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.800
In the 1960s and early
'70s, Afghanistan

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.630
was often viewed
as more progressive

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.080
than neighboring countries
when it came to women's rights.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.830
Back then, women were able to
pursue an education, get a job,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.280
and even vote.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.840
But when Islamic fundamentalists
group, the Taliban,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.710
seized control of the
country in the mid '90s,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.120
everything changed.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.530
PAULA BRONSTEIN: Why are women
treated the way they are?

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.710
A lot of it is the culture.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.900
A culture that's existed
for so many years.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.410
NARRATOR: That was Paula
Bronstein, a photojournalist

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.510
who has spent the last
15 years documenting life

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.730
in Afghanistan, with a
particular focus on women,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.790
a group that is once again
finding its voice as it strives

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.730
to distance itself from
the Taliban's ideology.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.050
PAULA BRONSTEIN: This is a
very conservative culture

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.620
in terms of Islam and the
thoughts and the feelings

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.180
about what kind of presence
a woman has in society.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.740
PAULA BRONSTEIN: When the
Taliban took over in 1996,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.010
a strict version of
Islamic Sharia law

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.240
was imposed across Afghanistan.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.000
With a number of specifically
aimed at stripping away

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.450
the fundamental human
rights of women and girls,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.200
bans were imposed on women.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.740
They couldn't even leave the
house without a male chaperone,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.250
and were required to a burqa so
as not to show any bare skin.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.120
Disobeying these laws often
meant brutal punishment,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.170
and the fear of reciprocation
is still so great

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.660
that some women have continued
to abide by these laws

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.130
even though the Taliban was
ousted from power back in 2001.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.410
PAULA BRONSTEIN: They
were so programmed

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.100
to not being seen,
hiding behind the burqa,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.900
and then somehow feeling like
even my camera can x-ray them.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.840
PAULA BRONSTEIN: This was
a challenge for Paula.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.670
However, over time,
she eventually

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.182
started to gain
their confidence.

00:01:57.182 --> 00:01:58.640
PAULA BRONSTEIN:
In Afghanistan you

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.660
sit down to have tea, that's
how you discuss everything.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.400
That's how you get
to know people.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.510
It's the culture.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.110
Me being a female
photojournalist means I can get

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.960
a certain kind of access that
perhaps male photojournalist

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.476
cannot.

00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:16.100
NARRATOR: Paula's
unique access allowed

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.140
her to document a
side of Afghan life

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.327
that is rarely seen by the West.

00:02:20.327 --> 00:02:22.410
PAULA BRONSTEIN: There
were so many women's issues

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.370
to document, and stories
to be told-- poverty,

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.990
forced marriages, many of
them being child brides,

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.370
the abuse that goes on
within the household

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.872
that nobody sees-- physical
abuse, mental abuse,

00:02:38.872 --> 00:02:41.080
domestic violence in general.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.660
No one felt it was important
to have an educated woman,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.250
so quite a few of
them are illiterate.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.950
NARRATOR: Low levels of
literacy and old social stigmas

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.120
that around the idea
of working women

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.160
meant that the majority
of Afghan families

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.510
rely almost exclusively
on a man's income.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.950
However, the number of wars
over the last three decades

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.170
has meant that many women
have been left widowed

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.950
and without a household income.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.530
PAULA BRONSTEIN: What happens
to women who don't have

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.250
a male who dictates their life?

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.870
All of the sudden there's
a uneducated woman who

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.190
has to try to feed her kids.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.165
How is she doing it?

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.180
Women's issue, here's
the legacy of the war,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.800
the country has got so
many permanent scars.

00:03:39.692 --> 00:03:41.400
NARRATOR: During her
time in Afghanistan,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.590
Paula did document
some cultural shifts

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.770
in favor of women's rights.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.215
In 2014 she took these photos
of young women rallying

00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:52.226
for Ashraf Ghani during
the presidential elections.

00:03:52.226 --> 00:03:53.850
PAULA BRONSTEIN: I
really love the fact

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.410
that women have-- they
were in huge numbers,

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.700
without burqas, waving
flags, and it was just

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.180
kind of a joyous occasion.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.410
I loved the energy of the
women that were-- they

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.630
had come out to vote,
they were at rallies,

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.580
they were just really involved.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.092
I felt like that's a positive--
kind of a positive sign.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:20.550
NARRATOR: And there
are other signs

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.940
that things might be
changing, albeit slowly.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.220
There are still many obstacles.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.930
The Taliban continues to
be a strong presence here,

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.580
and longstanding social
stigmas about women's rights

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.670
are still a problem.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.310
For Paula, it's hard
to gauge how long it

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.460
will take for Afghan women to
truly stand on equal footing

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.460
with men.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.740
But she does believe that the
spirit to make that change does

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.160
exist among the
women she has met.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.660
PAULA BRONSTEIN: They really
do show amazing amounts

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:59.170
of stamina and just
pure passion to do

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.492
what they want to do in life.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.100
NARRATOR: The Taliban
still has strongholds

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.820
in parts of Afghanistan.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.410
To find out what it's really
like for American soldiers

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.500
deployed to these
regions, take a look
