[inaudible]

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.390
<v 1>joining me today is a national security expert,</v>

3
00:00:07.391 --> 00:00:12.391
the bestselling author of defeating Jihad and a former albeit brief strategists

4
00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:16.770
to president Trump.
Doctor Sebastian Gorka.
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Thanks.

5
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:19.960
Let me,
David,
I am happy to have you here sir.
First off that voice,

6
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.460
you have a very,
have you ever done any voiceover work at all?
Um,

7
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.230
it's don't tell anybody,
but it's my dream.
What I wrote defeating Jihad.

8
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.650
Um,

9
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.220
I asked about the audio book and I said I'm going to get to do the audio book,

10
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.230
right?
My publicist,
you can do the prologue,
then we'll get a pro.
I was crushed.

11
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.370
So the next book coming out in June,
why we fight?
I'm sorry if you're listening,

12
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.200
Margie,
I'm doing so I,
I really can't believe that.

13
00:00:47.201 --> 00:00:51.670
So first up,
we have already spent a good amount of time talking about star wars,

14
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.510
so I am very impressed.
Your Green Room and not post.

15
00:00:55.511 --> 00:00:59.080
I'd never seen that in the quarry poster before.
Yeah,
on the LP.

16
00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:03.910
So I've impressed that is the original 1977 poster.
I wonder,
do you think,

17
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.090
because we're obviously going to talk a lot about national security and foreign

18
00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:07.870
policy and all that,

19
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.670
do you think any of your thoughts related to foreign policy had anything to do

20
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.890
with Star Wars?
Because I do think at some level,

21
00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:19.000
some of the way I view the world has been shaped by some of the Lore and all

22
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:22.870
that.
I,
I'm not sure if it's cause and effect,
but,
but absolutely.

23
00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:25.840
In terms of good and evil,
I mean totally.

24
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.460
I mean the first three movies are about good versus evil before they become this

25
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.380
social justice warrior absurdity.
So yeah,
sure.
I mean,

26
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.390
but as much as being the son of people who lived on the Nazi and then communist

27
00:01:39.611 --> 00:01:42.160
dictatorship,
these things kind of flow together.

28
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.440
So star wars and growing up under

29
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.270
the child of people who escaped from dictatorship.
Right.
There you go.
All right,

30
00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:53.440
so you are in California because you were talking to a couple conservative

31
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.230
groups here in California.

32
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.020
People don't believe that conservative groups could exist in California.

33
00:01:59.021 --> 00:02:01.600
But I mentioned to you before,
we just had governor John Casick gun,

34
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.650
he was talking with Arnold Schwarzenegger at some conservative groups here in

35
00:02:05.651 --> 00:02:10.330
California.
So there's,
it seems like something is happening in California.

36
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.590
I don't live here,

37
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.640
but I'd come in and out to do these events or something's happening.

38
00:02:15.641 --> 00:02:20.560
So something clearly is happening.
Um,
the energy,
I felt the,
uh,

39
00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:24.010
the events here,
uh,
is like the energy,

40
00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:28.300
I feel it events in Virginia,
um,
or elsewhere,

41
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.920
like Texas.
And there's a commonality.
Whoever you speak to,

42
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.240
they keep mentioning the same things.
They talk about the gas tax,

43
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.620
they talk about sanctuary cities.
They talk about the burden on businesses.

44
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.140
When you,
when you get these things repeated enough times,

45
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.030
you realize something is happening in California.
Who knows where it'll go.

46
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.880
But this,
this isn't the state,
you know,
I used to say,
you know,

47
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.680
the People's republic just last forever.
I'm not so sure anymore really.

48
00:02:56.681 --> 00:03:00.040
So do you think this could be something that could happen as soon our next,

49
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.590
<v 2>our gubernatorial election that's coming up now?</v>

50
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:06.850
Or do you think this is sort of longterm?
May Be presidential election 2020 or

51
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.630
<v 1>so.
Use the following with the election of Donald J.
Trump to president.</v>

52
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.200
The political rule book has it been shredded but buried and the Donald Trump

53
00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:21.700
jumped up and down on it.
It's gone.
So,

54
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.770
so any past expectations,

55
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.660
any trend lines are irrelevant.
I mean,
I traveled with the president to,

56
00:03:29.661 --> 00:03:34.460
we flew on Air Force One to Youngstown,
Ohio back in June.
And uh,

57
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.530
this is steel valley,
right?

58
00:03:36.531 --> 00:03:41.480
This is the hub of a blue collar Democrat,
manual laborers.

59
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.500
And we,
we,

60
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.790
we arrived at the stadium and the president was in the back.

61
00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:49.030
I was doing selfies with,
you know,

62
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:52.760
over the crowd and do love the crowd selfie.
I've seen many.

63
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.680
What is it costing me that they want to sell for?
Yes.
Show why not?
Um,

64
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.650
so I got to engage with these people and I realized that in this stadium about a

65
00:04:01.651 --> 00:04:06.170
20,
25,000 people,
everybody was either a former registered Democrat,

66
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.840
their parents or grandparents were all democrats.

67
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.110
And then what happens when the president,
when when the first lady,

68
00:04:12.111 --> 00:04:15.770
Melania comes out onto the stage,
it erupts.

69
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.330
The building erupts with chance with USA drain the swamp.

70
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.250
And this is Democrat territory.
Now if that can happen in Youngstown,
Youngstown,

71
00:04:25.251 --> 00:04:28.520
Ohio,
who knows what can happen in California.

72
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:29.241
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

73
00:04:29.241 --> 00:04:32.360
So I want to talk a little bit about your history and your parents and growing

74
00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:34.040
up there just mentioned,
but as long as we're on the,

75
00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:37.400
on the first part of the Trump portion of this,
let's just keep doing that.

76
00:04:37.401 --> 00:04:42.020
I heard you at the turning point USA a event in December,
give a speech,

77
00:04:42.021 --> 00:04:43.160
which I really thought it was wonderful.

78
00:04:43.161 --> 00:04:48.161
Like you described Trump as the icebreaker and what I've been saying around here

79
00:04:48.351 --> 00:04:51.470
is that I view him as the bull in the China shop.

80
00:04:51.471 --> 00:04:54.890
We wanted a panther to knock over a few things,
but we got the bowl.

81
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.450
And I think that really,
it's really the same analogy that we're using there.
Um,

82
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.200
so can you just show further on that?

83
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.480
<v 1>So,
um,
do,</v>

84
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.970
United States was covered for at least 30 years in this massive permafrost layer

85
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:11.860
of ice,
which is political correctness and it had frozen over the media,

86
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.300
education,
politics,
all of it.
To the extent that by the Obama administration,

87
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.250
federal government was telling you who could use which bathroom.
Right?

88
00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:22.850
So just insanity.
Um,
and then along comes a guy who,

89
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.050
the first day I met him in summer of June 15 in his office in Trump tower,

90
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.960
the first thing I knew about this man is he's the Kryptonite of political

91
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:32.531
correctness.
I mean,

92
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:35.710
he couldn't care less about what the New York Times or CNN says about a given

93
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:39.670
issue.
So along comes this man layer vies frozen over the country.

94
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.930
Fam slams into it like an icebreaker and smashes through the ice.

95
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.100
So he breaks a pathway full,
full the nation to,

96
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.530
to open up that see lane.
And,

97
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.190
and my argument to conservative audiences is that this is great.

98
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:57.830
This is monumental.
It wasn't going to be the path,
the path that could have one.

99
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.350
It had to be the bull,
it had to be the icebreaker.

100
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.640
But if you know your physics of icebreaking,
you can send that,
you know,

101
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.140
thousands of tons worth of shipping that we,

102
00:06:07.141 --> 00:06:10.280
that's tungsten hall rides up on the ice slices through it.

103
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.230
But if you don't have the flotilla behind it that comes up and keeps that

104
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:17.510
passageway open,
what actually happens in real life?

105
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.410
You send one shipping breaks apart almost instantaneously.

106
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.370
The ice comes around the bow and re knits itself right around the ship and

107
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:26.090
reseals.

108
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.290
So this is the moment in the conservative movement where we have to get serious

109
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:33.410
about what does it mean to be a conservative in the 21st century.

110
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.730
What's the role of government,

111
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:38.180
how does national security look so on and so forth.
Uh,

112
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.820
Donald Trump is the capitalist now we have to do the heavy lifting of ideology

113
00:06:42.821 --> 00:06:44.760
and politics and policy.
Yeah.

114
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.950
Do you think he will years from now when we look back be anything other than the

115
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:50.360
catalysts?
Like how do you,

116
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.560
how do you consider his ideas compared to traditionally conservative ideas?

117
00:06:54.561 --> 00:06:58.130
Cause just in the last couple of months after signing the Omni bus thing,

118
00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.600
and you know,
right now when we're taking,

119
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:01.430
we're taping this a few days before we're going to share it,

120
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:03.140
but there's a big mess in Syria.

121
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:05.360
We're not sure if there's going to be more intervention or not.

122
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.620
He seems to be doing some things that are probably a little more big government

123
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:13.190
than perhaps you want or,
or certainly than his base seems to want.

124
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:17.030
So where do you think he fits actually between catalyst and the and the
flotilla?

125
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.920
So first things first,
I hate labels personally.
I think labels is lazy thinking.

126
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.910
Um,
and in the case of Donald Trump then irrelevant and they have,

127
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:28.010
they have no application.
Uh,

128
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.770
I'll credit monitoring Monica crowd and my friend with this,

129
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.550
the weekend off to the election was David Horwitz is uh,
what was it?

130
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.820
A restoration weekend in Florida,

131
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.480
which was either going to be awake or the potty.
That was,

132
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.060
and Monica gave a great speech in which he said,
look,

133
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.820
everybody misunderstands who this man is.

134
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.240
He was never an ideological candidate because you simply cannot put him in a box

135
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.580
because of what he does,
whether it's his attitude to gay marriage,
whether it's,

136
00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.080
it just is what it is,
just a mixture.
He was never an ideological candidate.

137
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:05.360
He was an attitudinal candidate and she nailed it.
Now what does that mean?

138
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.740
Look at the last 40 years.
This guy is 71 years old.
He's not going to change.

139
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.400
He is who he is.
What has he done for the last 40 years as a professional?

140
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.670
He's been committed to one thing,
excellence,

141
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.370
whether it's a golf course in Scotland,
whether it's a skyscraper in New York,

142
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:27.430
it's excellence and all he's done is he's taken that concept and try to

143
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:33.460
translate it into excellence for America once more and that doesn't fit into

144
00:08:34.191 --> 00:08:38.720
neat neo liberal,
Neoucom,
Paleo calm.
It just doesn't fit.

145
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.320
He's about getting stuff done and being the best.

146
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:47.350
How do you link that to what the general conservative movement is now?
I get,

147
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.420
I get what you're saying about labels and I say it all the time.
The labels now,

148
00:08:50.421 --> 00:08:53.690
especially because of Trump,
the labels are all the brothers at this point,

149
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.010
but the thing I'm struggling to

150
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.880
<v 2>fully grasp about the Trump thing is how does this connect to,
you know,</v>

151
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.850
when I see you right now,
you have a huge split,
right?
We've got the,

152
00:09:03.851 --> 00:09:07.920
the Trump base and then you've got the never Trumpers and these people are,

153
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.700
that should be kind of lining up.
They can't quite get there.

154
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.950
And how do you connect those things?

155
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:17.030
Like how do you connect to what you're going to connect you with advertisers.

156
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:17.530
Yeah,

157
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:22.440
<v 1>but the number of Trump was a pathological pathological when,
when bill crystal,</v>

158
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.200
who's all obsequious and oleaginous 2 million in the green room at Fox,

159
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.750
when he tweets out actually tweets out in a choice between the deep state and

160
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:34.300
president Trump,
I choose the deep state.
They're built.

161
00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:39.520
You don't have a conservative,
you're a subversive,
right?
Get out of the tent,

162
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.860
get out of the 10.
So that's never going to happen.

163
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:46.960
The broader question of what does conservative mean today?
Um,

164
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.430
we can't answer that because have you seen a good article,

165
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.760
a really good article,
which understands first principles,

166
00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:59.620
founding principles about what Trump ism is or should be?
I haven't.

167
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.920
I've seen a lot of people who think they know what they're talking about,

168
00:10:02.921 --> 00:10:07.360
but who've never met the president.
So I think there's a lot of work to be done,

169
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.110
but it's not going to be done by conservative establishment individuals.

170
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.340
The NRO is not going to tell you who Trump is and the NRO is not going to

171
00:10:15.341 --> 00:10:19.660
revitalize the conservative establishment.
Right.
This is a new era.
It's exciting,

172
00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:23.020
but we have to get to work to define what it means to be a conservative

173
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.520
<v 2>to me is why it seems so obvious that you're so passionate about this that</v>

174
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:29.250
nobody else was going to do it.
And I think that's all.

175
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.250
So that's sort of what Monica was saying and it's sorta what Horowitz has been

176
00:10:32.251 --> 00:10:33.270
saying for a long time.

177
00:10:33.271 --> 00:10:36.960
Even when he sat right there that no one else was going to break through,

178
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.620
and now it's imperfect,
but at least there's

179
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.400
<v 1>let,
let,
let,
let me be brutally candid.
You know,</v>

180
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.500
I grew up in the UK to Hungarian parents who escaped communism.

181
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.460
I went through the,
the private school system in the UK,

182
00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.680
stiff upper lip and all that stuff,
and the debating club.

183
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.020
So the president's style is not exactly the style on used to.

184
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.390
I got to get used to it.
And I understand that people have issues.

185
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.930
The biggest people,
the biggest thing people have issues with on,

186
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.890
on the right or his tweets.
I get it.
But guess what?

187
00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.600
Who was going to Defeat Hillary?
Wasn't Jeb Bush,

188
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.580
wasn't even Senator Cruz.

189
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.110
None of them are going to the only person who could come through that.

190
00:11:20.111 --> 00:11:24.520
My asthma who could break through the ice or political correctness was this rank

191
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.390
outsider from Manhattan.
And whether you like it or not,

192
00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.100
he to say for the softly,

193
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:35.110
he was the necessary but not sufficient because of victory.

194
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.540
Um,
you don't have to like it,

195
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.870
but it happed to be him with that stock.

196
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:45.610
We tried to do Marquess of Queensberry rules for 30 years.

197
00:11:45.611 --> 00:11:49.090
Where did it get us?
What did he get us?
Mitt Romney.

198
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.140
Come on guys.
Right?
So it had to be Donald Trump.

199
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.590
Now we have to backfill what it means.
Yeah.

200
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.420
And that seems to be where I think you,

201
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:02.170
and so many of these other people that are either part or formerly part of the

202
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:06.030
administration.
So you had a very brief stint at the administration.
Uh,

203
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.790
first of all,
we've done some luck,
right?
I think years from now they'll go,

204
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:13.110
oh my God,
he was there for 90% longer than everybody else.
But,

205
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.190
but it pretty brief stint seven months.
First,

206
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:17.470
can you just tell me how you got involved because you had only,

207
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:19.840
you just mentioned you only met him a little bit before the election in the

208
00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:21.100
first place and then,

209
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.730
and then sort of what happened that had you leave because that will really tie

210
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:25.511
into the media,

211
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:28.330
which I think we're very much aligned on what's going on with the media right

212
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:31.420
now.
So a summer of 15,

213
00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:34.960
I got a phone call from a guy called Cory 11 Gowski that I'd never heard of.

214
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.370
And he said,
uh,

215
00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.400
candidate Trump is prepping for the big full GOP presidential debate on national

216
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:47.230
security.
And he'd like to talk to you
said,
sure.

217
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.620
So I took the plane,
flew to New York,
went to Trump tower.

218
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.610
It was just the three of us in Donald Trump's office.

219
00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.120
And we had this incredible blue sky discussion on national security issues.

220
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.640
You name it from the civil war up to the Middle East and nuclear weapons,

221
00:13:04.641 --> 00:13:07.900
all kinds of topics.
How knowledgeable did he seem about things?

222
00:13:07.901 --> 00:13:11.140
Cause this is one of the parts that I think people we have no handle on.

223
00:13:11.141 --> 00:13:14.830
Like does he really passionate and really interested but not a guy that you're

224
00:13:14.831 --> 00:13:17.890
going to debate what happened in Karbala in the ninth century.
But,
but,

225
00:13:17.891 --> 00:13:22.320
but really interested in this stuff and with opinions and,

226
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.020
and halfway through this discussion and he was sitting closer to me than you
are.

227
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.650
And Courtney's over here and he does a classic Trumpism.
He goes,

228
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.960
just stops the conversation.
Cholerae I like this guy,

229
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.400
let's hire him.
And that was it.
And he asked me to help write.

230
00:13:38.401 --> 00:13:41.230
It wasn't part of the campaign,
but I became an advisor,

231
00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:45.700
wrote policy papers that he used and the briefings,
uh,
and we stayed in touch,

232
00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:50.620
but I never joined the campaign.
And then as things progressed and he,
you know,

233
00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:53.260
the field whittled down to what it did,

234
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.520
I kept meeting General Flynn at events.
I was a participant.

235
00:13:57.521 --> 00:14:01.120
I was just in the crowd and I kept bumping into General Flynn and I'd known him

236
00:14:01.121 --> 00:14:03.670
from when he was director of the Dia.
And eventually we just,

237
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:08.890
he pulled me in and by October,
the month before the election,

238
00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.390
I don't know if you're familiar with the system and in,
in,

239
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:16.150
in the presidential election,
the last two runners get,

240
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:20.080
uh,
support from the federal government before the election and they get offices

241
00:14:20.081 --> 00:14:22.840
near the White House to create transition teams to prep.

242
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.630
And so Hillary got one story and,

243
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.870
and the president got another store of this building and I was pulled into the

244
00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:31.980
pits.
Hilarious.
It's in the same building.
Oh yeah.
And if you're talking there,

245
00:14:31.981 --> 00:14:35.280
the elevator.
Right.
So,

246
00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:40.620
so I got pulled in and asked to work on the National Security Council Transition

247
00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:41.771
Team for General Flynn.
And my wife,

248
00:14:41.771 --> 00:14:46.000
who has a background in the issues was pulled into work on the DHS team.
And uh,

249
00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:48.310
so I became part of the official transition team.

250
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.980
And up til the very last moment,
the week,
you know,

251
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.520
maybe the week of the inauguration I was going to be doing counter terrorism

252
00:14:55.521 --> 00:15:00.470
stuff.
The General Flynn and the NFC,
and then Steve Bannon,
who knows me,

253
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.470
reaches out in the last minutes of the new,

254
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.350
they're going to come and work for me and the office of the chief strategist,

255
00:15:06.351 --> 00:15:09.830
the strategist to the president.
And that's how you know,
at uh,

256
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.660
1201 on January the 20th,
I became a deputy assistant to the president.

257
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:18.950
<v 2>Yeah.
So the second that happened,
basically the media just went bananas.</v>

258
00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:22.560
And I knew,
I mean,
every store I mentioned to you that right?
No,
no,
no,
no.

259
00:15:22.561 --> 00:15:25.650
The act when they went bananas,
was it even before that?
No,
no,
no,
no.

260
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.330
<v 1>It's very interesting.
They didn't,</v>

261
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.220
they didn't go up honors until the,
the travel ban dropped.

262
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.320
And I realized things were not going well in terms of communicating the travel

263
00:15:38.321 --> 00:15:42.640
ban.
So I said to Steve and I set the shore and guys,

264
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.370
I've done a bit of media in the past.
Uh,

265
00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.950
I can be the face of this stuff if you want.
I mean,

266
00:15:47.951 --> 00:15:49.720
we've got the NSC communications team,

267
00:15:49.721 --> 00:15:52.390
but I'm prepared to go on CNN and debate these guys.

268
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.100
And so they threw me into the,
the,
you know,
the,

269
00:15:56.101 --> 00:16:00.040
the fire and I loved it and the left went nuts.

270
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.590
They just absolutely went insane.

271
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:08.010
And it was once I was vehemently representing the president on television that

272
00:16:08.291 --> 00:16:10.630
out came the hip pieces and the lights.

273
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:11.151
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

274
00:16:11.151 --> 00:16:15.320
So let's talk about that a little bit because I see this happening to almost

275
00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:19.850
everyone that I have any degree of respect for.
I see it happen.
I see it.
Right.

276
00:16:19.851 --> 00:16:21.980
It's coming.
It's coming to me now too.
I mean,

277
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:26.180
I see this to almost anyone that I think is trying to be somewhat honest,

278
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.190
the endless attacks.
I mean,
you know,

279
00:16:28.191 --> 00:16:32.030
there were just endless slew of things that you're an anti-semite and all of

280
00:16:32.031 --> 00:16:35.420
this craziness.
I mean,
at the turning point event that I saw you speak at,

281
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.270
you gave one of the strongest defenses of Israel that I've ever heard,

282
00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.990
but they almost take everything and do the complete reverse of that.

283
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:47.180
What do you make of that tactic specifically where it's literally the reverse of

284
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:48.021
what the truth is.

285
00:16:48.021 --> 00:16:50.840
It's not just like we're going to take a line and make it seem a little

286
00:16:50.841 --> 00:16:53.300
different.
We're a new sign.
It's absolutely,

287
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:57.580
<v 1>uh,
you've got,
you've got a big viewership.
I know your why.</v>

288
00:16:57.581 --> 00:16:59.290
I'm no longer a progressive thing has got,

289
00:16:59.291 --> 00:17:03.610
I don't know how many millions of views and uh,
I'll,
I'll open up a little bit.

290
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.850
Um,
the spot besides of your audience.

291
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:15.170
I have a reputation for being a scary dude.
I'm being a hot ass.
That's fine.

292
00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:18.920
But after the seven months that I went through in my family went through

293
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.720
every time,
every few weeks,

294
00:17:22.721 --> 00:17:27.721
I have the same emotional response and it probably surprises your others

295
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.440
<v 2>as a human being.</v>

296
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:38.520
<v 1>I want to try and understand how another human being,</v>

297
00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.500
who's never met me,

298
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.790
who knows nothing about me or what my family has been through,

299
00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:50.490
can write what they wrote about me will say what they say about me.

300
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:57.350
It leaves me speechless that you can have such venomous hatred for somebody and

301
00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:01.431
pedals.

302
00:18:01.431 --> 00:18:06.431
So agregious sets of lies and you not only call yourself a journalist,

303
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:13.740
but you actually think you're a human being.
Um,

304
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.180
I was attacked and that's fine cause I'm a politically commissioned officer of

305
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:23.010
the president.
I'm a proxy as a proxy for Steve.
I was a proxy for the president.

306
00:18:23.011 --> 00:18:25.500
I understand that.
That's okay.
But Hey,

307
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.780
why don't we debate the policies they never wanted,

308
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.950
never wanted to debate the policies.
It was ad hominem attacks and lives.

309
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.210
And secondly,
it's okay to attack me.
But guess what?

310
00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.240
It's not a Kate attack,
my wife.

311
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:44.490
It's not okay to tag my dead mother's reputation and it's not okay.

312
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.550
Attack my teenage high school age son either.

313
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:53.000
These people are reprehensible and they're out of control.
David.

314
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.220
And then not learning the doubling downs.

315
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.290
So that's the part that I'm concerned about right now that it's seat.

316
00:19:00.291 --> 00:19:03.510
People always ask me,
I didn't event nervine last night.

317
00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.300
And the question I'm getting more and more now is,

318
00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.400
is this thing turning around now?

319
00:19:08.401 --> 00:19:12.990
I sense my sense is that there is something brewing against it.

320
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.060
There's something brewing finally,

321
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.180
and I think any of us in this space or a little piece of it,

322
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.420
but to me it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.
And that,

323
00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:23.880
that's what I'm concerned about.
That you're nodding already.

324
00:19:23.881 --> 00:19:28.260
So I suspect you're going to write under what conditions does something like

325
00:19:28.261 --> 00:19:32.690
that change.
If we rule out violence,
right?
We don't want to have violence.
Okay?

326
00:19:32.691 --> 00:19:37.080
We've,
you know,
the worst war we ever had was our civil war.
Okay?

327
00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:41.260
600,000 Americans killed,
even though they're subtly condoning violence.

328
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:45.840
[inaudible] CEO of Twitter's condoning it.
Um,
so let,
let,
let's,

329
00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.500
let's pray to the good Lord that that's,
that's not where we're going.

330
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.440
What's the other option?

331
00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:56.460
What's the other scenario that they look in the mirror and they stopped,

332
00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.960
but why would they,

333
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:04.030
they reward each other for the lies?
I mean,

334
00:20:04.031 --> 00:20:08.590
look at Time Magazine's latest issue.
It's just a Farago of lines.

335
00:20:08.591 --> 00:20:11.230
It's all opinion pieces,
not journalism.

336
00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:15.730
When they look at the people who they celebrate at the get togethers,

337
00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.620
they're not journalists.
I mean,

338
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:21.910
there's maybe six journalists left in this country that are actually doing

339
00:20:21.911 --> 00:20:25.720
investigative research like Sarah Carter,
right?
Like Molly Hemingway.

340
00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.910
When are they going to be recognized by the Washington press corps?

341
00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:33.160
Never.
Never.

342
00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:38.280
Because they don't comport with the narrative that we're Nazis.

343
00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.470
And the president is a dictator.

344
00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.920
This is a man whose grandchildren are orthodox Jews.

345
00:20:44.921 --> 00:20:49.330
Can you wrap your heads around it?
New York,
CNN,
Huffington Post,
buzzfeed.

346
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.670
You'll reprehensible for calling this administration what you call it.

347
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.510
I know the PR.
He doesn't,
not that he doesn't have a racist bone in his body.

348
00:20:58.511 --> 00:21:03.100
He doesn't have a racist molecule in his body.
The stunning thing,
and this is,

349
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.160
this is what,
why.
It was such an honor to work for him.

350
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:10.030
The stunning thing about Donald Trump is,
and look,

351
00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.900
I got a Bible in my pocket.
I can swear on it.

352
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:15.280
I'll swear on this Bible,

353
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.540
this mine once every two things for all Americans.

354
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.680
He wants you and your family to be safe and he wants you to prosper,

355
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.560
which is what all the prep American president should want,

356
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.910
but you know it's stunning,
David.

357
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:33.160
He wants out for you whether or not you voted for him or not,

358
00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.350
he doesn't care whether you voted for Hillary.

359
00:21:35.351 --> 00:21:37.330
He doesn't care whether you want to be bloody throwing.

360
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.000
He doesn't care whether you stayed at home and ate Doritos.

361
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:45.190
If you're an American living here legally,
he wants you to be safe from harm,

362
00:21:45.191 --> 00:21:49.360
from gangs,
from terrorism,
and he wants you to prosper like he has prospered.

363
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.690
And the left,
this is the honesty of question.

364
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:57.870
The left will never ever believed that although it is true and I test it.

365
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.260
<v 2>So when they put you out there and as you said,
you,
you go there.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,</v>

366
00:22:04.261 --> 00:22:06.750
no.
That,
that,
that's what it's all about.
Right?
That's what it's all about.

367
00:22:06.751 --> 00:22:10.320
What you just said there.
Um,
w when they put you out there and as you said,

368
00:22:10.321 --> 00:22:12.510
you willfully went out to,
to go for the,

369
00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.850
for the ban the Muslim ban when we talked about it on the show.

370
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:20.280
[inaudible] right.
Okay.
So,
but I'm glad for it to their narrative.
Okay.

371
00:22:20.281 --> 00:22:23.190
So we talked about it a bunch on the show.
I did a bunch of videos.

372
00:22:23.191 --> 00:22:25.530
I tried to be very fair.
I have Muslim friends,

373
00:22:25.531 --> 00:22:28.410
I've had Muslims on the show and ex Muslims and I've had people that are

374
00:22:28.411 --> 00:22:30.960
critical of religion and people that are religious and the whole freaking thing.

375
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.900
Look most of the countries,

376
00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:36.090
the most of the most populous countries of Muslim people were not included on

377
00:22:36.091 --> 00:22:37.590
the band,
the original list,

378
00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.160
the original list was Obama by the Obama administration,
all that.

379
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.890
So I tried to talk about it as fairly as possible,

380
00:22:43.891 --> 00:22:46.410
but it seems to be one of those issues.

381
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:49.290
And then I think this will sort of lead us a little bit into your book as well,

382
00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:53.000
talking about radical Islam and trying to,
you know,

383
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.360
make the distinction between Islam as a set of ideas versus Muslims as people.

384
00:22:57.361 --> 00:22:59.700
And of course you shouldn't be prejudice and all of that.

385
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:04.620
This seems to be basically the stickiest thing that we have going right now.

386
00:23:04.621 --> 00:23:07.350
Right?
Like quicksand even talk about it.

387
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:08.650
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

388
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:13.540
<v 2>Uh,
you mean the threat,
the threat of jihadism?
Well,
just trying to,</v>

389
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.640
trying kind of things that,
are they real sneaky,
right,
man.

390
00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:20.950
The quicksand of trying to make the distinction of we have to be able to talk

391
00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:24.580
about ideas and why we have to fight for good ideas and against bad ideas,

392
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:27.880
but at the same time make sure that we're not being prejudice towards people and

393
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.580
making sure that America remains the open plurals,

394
00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.930
pluralistic society that it is.
Look,
the argument in my book,

395
00:23:34.931 --> 00:23:36.210
defeating Jihad is a very soon simple

396
00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:37.410
<v 1>one.
Um,</v>

397
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:43.970
we live in the only country ever created on the principle of individual freedom

398
00:23:44.761 --> 00:23:47.990
and,
and granted to us,
not by the government,

399
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.290
but by our creative because we are made in his image that the founding fathers

400
00:23:51.291 --> 00:23:54.860
said,
you are,
you have dignity because you all made in the image of the creator.

401
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.600
No,
because Washington says you have dignity.

402
00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.860
And that concept of the individual's dignity and the freedom that it provides is

403
00:24:04.941 --> 00:24:09.941
antithetical to the spectrum of politics that says managed perfectible and

404
00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:14.550
perfection can be created in real.

405
00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.930
My first degree was philosophy and theology and I studied,
uh,

406
00:24:17.931 --> 00:24:20.060
at this event here in,
in,
uh,
California.

407
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.380
All politics can be can be all ideological differences can be summarized in just

408
00:24:24.381 --> 00:24:28.040
two camps.
It doesn't matter which country you're in or what era,
two camps,

409
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:33.430
those that believe truth is objective and not manmade and those who say no man

410
00:24:33.861 --> 00:24:36.440
can define truth and perfection can be created here on earth.

411
00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:41.860
This statement that man defines truth leads to the gas chambers and to the

412
00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:44.060
gulags.
Okay.

413
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:48.950
Now social justice warriors don't realize that they're walking down the same

414
00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:49.460
path,

415
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.840
but it's the same concept to say I'm going to perfect the world and there will

416
00:24:53.841 --> 00:24:58.160
be justice and equality.
No you won't.
If we are free,

417
00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:02.510
there will never be justice for all and equality for all,

418
00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.800
as long as we are free because evil is real.
Evil exists.

419
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.930
Man is fallen and jihadism is just the latest version.

420
00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.340
Like my book is a very simple argument.

421
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:18.260
There's a connective tissue between al Qaeda and Isis and the Nazis of the Third

422
00:25:18.261 --> 00:25:23.050
Reich and the calmness of the Soviet Union.
Yes,
they wash it.

423
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.750
Different things wrong worship than air in rates.

424
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.800
One we should working class and other worship their version of Islam.

425
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:29.450
But guess what?
The connective tissues,

426
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.320
they're all totalitarians and if you disagree with them,
guess what?

427
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:37.190
You're going to be enslaved or murdered.
End of story.
And if you,

428
00:25:37.191 --> 00:25:40.880
if you deny that reality,
and I,
I've trained,
I don't know,
six,

429
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:42.890
7,000 federal offices,

430
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:47.630
I've trained more than that in the military when the military professional,

431
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:52.640
an FBI agent understands that his government is telling him what he can or

432
00:25:52.911 --> 00:25:57.890
cannot say about the threat group he supposed to be protecting us from then we

433
00:25:57.891 --> 00:26:01.540
have problems when President Obama says in,
uh,

434
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:05.780
2011 writes a memo to the chairman of the drug trees and the then attorney

435
00:26:05.781 --> 00:26:10.781
general all characters and training of FBI agents and the u s military must not

436
00:26:11.211 --> 00:26:15.050
mention Islam and especially must not mention the word Jihad.

437
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:19.550
Well that's like saying we're about to storm the Normandy beaches and guys,

438
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:24.110
make sure your [inaudible] and your boots are tied up,
but whatever you do,

439
00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:28.040
don't mention the word Nazi cause you could offend a German.

440
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.910
It's a bad SNL skit,
David.
Now it's insanity.

441
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.910
And the fact that we weren't allowed to talk about it truthfully,

442
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.620
that gets people killed.

443
00:26:36.621 --> 00:26:41.450
Political correctness eventually can lead to good people dying.

444
00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:46.800
So that also explains why there's such craziness in Europe right now.
Right?

445
00:26:46.801 --> 00:26:47.760
I mean,
we're going to see,

446
00:26:47.761 --> 00:26:52.110
it seems to me that we're going to consistently see the rise of right or far

447
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:52.944
right parties,

448
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:58.040
but it really is just the symptom of not being able to talk about these issues.

449
00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:02.610
Honestly,
let's differentiate between the rise of two different things.
Okay.
So,

450
00:27:02.611 --> 00:27:04.650
um,
we've just had an election in Hungary.

451
00:27:04.651 --> 00:27:07.470
We've seen elections in Italy and elsewhere and we've seen Brexit,

452
00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.940
let's don't conflate two issues.
There's the rise of very disturbing,
uh,

453
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.410
groups like y'all bic in Hungary.
They don't really crypto nationalists and,

454
00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:20.100
and feed off a long seat and antisemitic kind of era dentist,

455
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.790
uh,
sentiment in the country.
So these are the true sort of,

456
00:27:23.791 --> 00:27:24.990
they're not all white nationalists,

457
00:27:24.991 --> 00:27:28.500
but the true sort of f they want ethno state and they weren't right.
Like,
well,

458
00:27:28.501 --> 00:27:31.650
it's complicated because as history that this tree and on those better psi,

459
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:33.540
but they're bigots.
Yeah.

460
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.600
Linda gets okay then that you mustn't conflate that with the Trump phenomena and

461
00:27:40.741 --> 00:27:44.850
things like Brexit,
original,
uh,
causation.

462
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.370
And I don't even use the word populism.

463
00:27:47.371 --> 00:27:52.371
I reject the word populism unless your definition is part of populism is,

464
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.570
uh,
those kinds of politics that the elite to disagrees with that.
That's good.

465
00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.970
Definitely feel like I'm pretty sure that's not the standard.
Initially for me,

466
00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:03.030
this isn't populism that Trump winning or Brexit happening.

467
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:07.170
This is a reassertion of democracy.
I mean,
why,
why did Trump occur?

468
00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.810
Because people on the left on the right looked at DC and said,
you know,

469
00:28:12.811 --> 00:28:16.710
I don't know the difference between Sunni and Shia,
but guess what,
it's broken.

470
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.850
I don't know what a federal budget should look like,
but we're,

471
00:28:19.851 --> 00:28:21.180
we're spending like drunken sailors.

472
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.960
So it's the reassertion of accountable politics,

473
00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.880
vice faceless bureaucracy or uni party swamp dwellers,

474
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.990
whether they're in DC or whether they're in Brussels.
So for me it should be,

475
00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:36.720
we should welcome it with open arms.

476
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.420
This is a reassertion of accountable government,

477
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:43.590
but for the left that wants uniformity of thought and bigger government,

478
00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:47.700
it's fascism.
I,
so how does,
how do then does the,
right,

479
00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.590
how do you police that?

480
00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.570
I know that you don't like that idea of policing and government come in and fix

481
00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:52.681
it,

482
00:28:52.681 --> 00:28:57.450
but how do you make sure that the part that you're worried about doesn't lead to

483
00:28:57.451 --> 00:29:00.750
the good part?
Because I think from the way,
at least from the way I see it,

484
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.190
the left is always led now by its worst part.
So for,

485
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:05.580
and that's why they purge everybody.

486
00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:07.880
The video that you mentioned that I did on Prager u,
that's what I talked about.

487
00:29:07.881 --> 00:29:11.850
I mean anyone that steps out of group think you get purged and that's why I

488
00:29:11.851 --> 00:29:15.270
think there's such a movement towards libertarianism or classical liberalism or

489
00:29:15.271 --> 00:29:17.940
whatever you want to call it.
So I see what the left's doing on that.

490
00:29:17.941 --> 00:29:21.210
How do you make sure that doesn't happen on the right where the far right that

491
00:29:21.211 --> 00:29:24.580
you are worried about,
you think it's fair estimation to call it the fire,
right?

492
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.930
Yeah.
I don't even like the what would override?
Yeah,
I think it's bogus.

493
00:29:27.931 --> 00:29:32.030
I think those are just,
that's a new label for nationalist or,
or or,
or dentists.

494
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:36.800
Bigots.
All right.
That's a reader.
They're re wrapping themselves to be solid,

495
00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:39.930
fake to be fit for polite company.
Well I hate to tell you,

496
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.980
I hate to tell on your Wikipedia

497
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.570
<v 2>page,
you calls you all right,
of course.
Right.
And offset,</v>

498
00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.300
you know the the page that doesn't allow the subject to correct.
Right.

499
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.970
When I try and correct the lies,
it's frozen.
Interesting.
Wikipedia you,

500
00:29:54.971 --> 00:29:56.020
I told you right before we started,

501
00:29:56.021 --> 00:29:57.970
but your Wikipedia out of all of the ones that,

502
00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.070
cause I usually just glance there,
not for fact,

503
00:30:00.071 --> 00:30:04.720
but just to get a sense of what's going on.
Yours is such a mess.
It's,
I've tried,

504
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.000
I've tried to correct the friends who tried to correct it.

505
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.820
Then they froze it and then forget about it.
Yeah.

506
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.790
So what do you do though to make sure that those two things

507
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:17.630
<v 1>don't come?
We get the spine.
So those of us that have a podium,</v>

508
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:22.130
those that are out there,
those that wish to see the principles we believe in,

509
00:30:22.131 --> 00:30:25.400
in terms of the founding come back and be celebrated in this country.

510
00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:26.480
We have to call them out.

511
00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:31.430
Like we don't believe that you use legislation.
I mean,
hate speech.

512
00:30:31.431 --> 00:30:34.370
Gimme a break.
I mean,
either you're inciting violence,
so you're not,

513
00:30:34.371 --> 00:30:36.050
either you're committing a crime or you're not.

514
00:30:36.051 --> 00:30:38.960
We don't need extra labels and we don't,
it's censorship.

515
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:42.890
Call them out for what they are.
We need people on the right who say,

516
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:47.030
you know what?
Here's a racist that,
all right.
Think that's just bigotry.

517
00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:51.800
That's just the KKK wrapped up in a new bow.
Um,
it's up to us.
Yeah.

518
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:54.320
Do you think that's happening?
That's not gonna do it right?

519
00:30:54.321 --> 00:30:58.700
They're going to use it.
How to use those people to silence the majority.

520
00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:04.010
Do you think that we're not enough?
No,
not enough by,
by far.
Um,
we have,

521
00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:08.600
um,
begun,
but there's a lot of work to do.
Yeah.

522
00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.540
<v 2>Everything that's happening in Europe right now.</v>

523
00:31:11.541 --> 00:31:14.570
And there's definitely a distinction to be made between what's happening in

524
00:31:14.571 --> 00:31:18.470
eastern Europe versus Western Europe and Eastern Europe I think is dealing with

525
00:31:18.471 --> 00:31:20.150
some of their existential crisis.

526
00:31:20.151 --> 00:31:23.750
He's a little bit better perhaps because western Europe still a little behind on

527
00:31:23.751 --> 00:31:25.400
the political correctness stuff that you're talking about.

528
00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.370
Does everything that's happening in Europe right now,

529
00:31:28.371 --> 00:31:30.950
does it all come down to immigration,
do you think?

530
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:36.170
<v 1>No,
no,
no.
And uh,
immigration,
uh,</v>

531
00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:40.080
was the blue touch paper on the firework?
Um,

532
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:46.200
no,
it's,
it's the death of representative democracy.
I mean,

533
00:31:46.201 --> 00:31:51.120
I've watched this because I grew up in the UK under Margaret Thatcher.
For me,

534
00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.830
Maggie,
the Gipper blessing,
uh,
Saint John Paul,

535
00:31:55.831 --> 00:31:58.890
the second these were my heroes.
Um,
and

536
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:04.570
I remember riding to school on the bus in the morning in,
in west London,

537
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:06.880
and the bus driver would be Jamaican.

538
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.740
I'd be with my Indian or Pakistani school body.
I be this Polish guy next to me.

539
00:32:11.741 --> 00:32:15.210
I mean,
it's Super Trojan as part of London.
And as far as,

540
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.860
as far as I was concerned,
these are all Brits.
The guy must have,

541
00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.820
might've had the thickest Jamaican accent possible.
My,

542
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:24.040
my friend Martin's mom cooked the best Indian cars.
But guess what?

543
00:32:24.041 --> 00:32:28.090
We're all British.
Yeah.
Gum.
When Tony Blair came in,

544
00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.730
when Clinton came in,
this idea that,
you know,

545
00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:36.220
the West is guilty and words like British are pejorative.

546
00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.980
You're a good Jurati.
You're short effort.

547
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.240
That was the death of these countries.
I mean,
why do you think I'm in America?

548
00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:48.920
I'm going to proud American citizen now because they lost the plot.

549
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:53.120
The things that the gis that fought for the,
the,

550
00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:57.640
the Tommy's fought for
safe spaces.

551
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:59.023
Really.

552
00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:03.800
You a 19 year olds and being blown up over Berlin and bomber planes and you want

553
00:33:03.801 --> 00:33:08.640
to save space.
This is in the space of 70 years.
I mean,

554
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:12.260
what's going on in London right now?
This is the line of Churchill.

555
00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.330
Yeah,
it's,
it's shocking.
So I saw,
I'm sure you saw this,

556
00:33:16.331 --> 00:33:18.760
but just in the last couple of weeks they said London's crime,

557
00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:22.440
violent crime has now surpassed New York cities for the first time in history.

558
00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.590
And then Cindy Kahn,

559
00:33:23.591 --> 00:33:26.860
who's the mayor of baton shot a statement saying you can't carry knives.
I mean,

560
00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.930
first off,
people are walking around with Swiss army knives.

561
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:32.110
A woman that might want to protect herself might want to have a knife in her

562
00:33:32.111 --> 00:33:36.400
pocket.
I mean,
it all,
it seems like a mass mental disorder to me.

563
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:38.620
But that's what happens.

564
00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:42.310
That is the natural progression when you deny objective truth.

565
00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:44.830
If everything is plastic,

566
00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:48.580
then you will get wrapped around your own act solely in absurdities and effort

567
00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:52.840
for a mer of one of the most powerful cities in the world of financial centers

568
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:57.850
to say no one should ever have a knife on them and nobody needs a knife.

569
00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.570
So every plumber,
every tradesman,

570
00:34:01.571 --> 00:34:05.200
every person working at the fish market is suddenly out of a job.

571
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:06.990
So the congress sane.

572
00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:13.060
So what does your Britain or Europe in a wider sense have to do to reverse the

573
00:34:13.821 --> 00:34:18.010
tide on some of this stuff?
I mean,
we,
Nigel Farrage,
I dunno.

574
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.590
I mean it's lucky that the saying it crops up in every nation.

575
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:24.140
Every country deserves the politicians.
They elect.

576
00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:31.450
Don't bitch and Moan.
Get up there,
but I see where I live outside DC.
I mean,

577
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:35.500
you're the conservatives who's so fed up and they're constantly posting stuff on

578
00:34:35.501 --> 00:34:38.500
Facebook.
What have you done to do something about it?

579
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:41.570
Have you gone out with leaflets?

580
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:44.690
Have you given more than $5 to a local candidate?

581
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:48.860
Have you given up and surrender?
I see this all the time.
But people who say,
well,

582
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:51.830
greatest nation on earth,
and then they say,
well,
you know,

583
00:34:51.831 --> 00:34:53.670
we're going purple and yeah,

584
00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:56.690
there's so many bureaucrats moved in and what are you gonna do?

585
00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.153
What are you going to do?

586
00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.340
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

587
00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:03.930
<v 1>Would you have said that in 1776,
the founding fathers have said,</v>

588
00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.780
what are you going to do know?

589
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:10.380
Is this just a symptom of the success of the West that we've just become so

590
00:35:10.381 --> 00:35:11.610
successful that you're right,

591
00:35:11.611 --> 00:35:15.000
we kind of sit there and we sit on Twitter and we complain all day,

592
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:19.260
but we're all talking,
we're not doing anything.
Like it's all talk.
It's not do,

593
00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:24.450
uh,
it's,
it's much more than that.
It's deep.
I mean,
I,
I went to the Jesuits,

594
00:35:24.451 --> 00:35:28.050
I studied philosophy under them.
It was painful,
but I will,

595
00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.510
I won't regret a minute of it.
Um,

596
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:36.050
identity is a function of history and culture and values.

597
00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:38.053
And if,

598
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:43.210
<v 0>if you don't study Western civilization and your schools and your colleges,</v>

599
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:49.020
this is what happens.
If you don't understand why people have dignity,

600
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:53.880
just that they do.
Oh,
unless that conservatives,
right.

601
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:58.020
This is where you arrive at.
And,
and you know who's responsible for this.

602
00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:00.150
I don't blame the left David.
I,
this is not the day.

603
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:04.920
This is not the left a couple ability.
It's ours.
It's the conservatives.

604
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:11.030
The radicals when they saw Paris in fire in 1968 believed that they could do the

605
00:36:11.701 --> 00:36:14.490
same in America,
that we could have a left wing revolution.

606
00:36:14.491 --> 00:36:17.190
This is what your students for a democratic society believed.

607
00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:22.470
And when Bernadine dohrn and bill as took over the SDS and tried to execute the

608
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.420
Chicago days of rage,
what happened?

609
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:29.760
Because Americans are not rabble rousing,
uh,

610
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:34.650
leftists.
It died.
It was a damp squib optical there.

611
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.350
Maoist revolution that,
what was it?

612
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:40.590
The prairie fire manifesto died instantly.

613
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.910
So what did they decide?
They'd read that Trotsky,

614
00:36:44.911 --> 00:36:46.740
they'd read their letting they even you are Hitler said,

615
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.500
give me that children and I'll own that future.

616
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:53.190
So these people actually became tenured professors in Chicago.

617
00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:58.170
They became high school teachers.
And what did we do on the right?
We let them,

618
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:02.160
people who are avowedly believe America is evil.

619
00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:07.170
We're allowed to influence our education system to the point at which they

620
00:37:07.171 --> 00:37:11.070
pretty much owned it.
But with exceptional,
your hills,
Dale and grove city,

621
00:37:11.071 --> 00:37:14.940
they own the education system.
And,
and what was our response?

622
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:19.470
Homeschooling.
Great.
I mean,
I love the movement,

623
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:24.850
but you're not going to save [inaudible] that ain't enough.
So,
um,

624
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:28.410
it's going to be a hard slog.
It's going to be 20,
30 years of saying,
guys,

625
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.860
American means this.
And it's nothing to do with your skin color.

626
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.370
It's nothing to do with your sexual preference,
your social class,
your agenda.

627
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.920
America is eternal values.

628
00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.400
And that's what's going to be a lot of work.
