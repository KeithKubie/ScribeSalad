00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.010 position:56%
My name is Kathy McGuigan and I work

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.740 position:56%
on the Education Outreach Department
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.750 position:69%
We are thrilled to welcome you to the second
annual online conference for educators.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.210 position:69%
I'd like to introduce you to Lee Ann Potter,
the Director of Educational Outreach.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.150
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Kathy.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.390
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.510 position:75%
As Kathy said, I am the Director of
Educational Outreach at the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.710 position:70%
And I also am delighted to welcome all of you

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.500
to our second annual online
conference for educators.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.540
And specifically, to this
very special keynote session.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.800
It is my pleasure to introduce
award-winning author, Tonya Bolden.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.800
Tonya was born in New York
City and grew up in Harlem.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.290
As a child, she loved to read.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.970 position:67%
She attended a public elementary school and
a private secondary school in Manhattan.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.630
She graduated from Princeton
with a degree in Slavic Languages

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.490 position:56%
and Literature with a Russian focus.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.820
Bolden is the author of more
than 20 books for young people.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.960 position:61%
A skilled researcher, she has harnessed
the power of the past in her books.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.170 position:67%
She combines vivid story telling with links
to primary sources and firsthand accounts

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.110
of life during the time period
when a particular book takes place.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:27.760 position:72%
She has received a Coretta Scott-King Honor, a
James Madison Award, a Carter G. Woodson Award

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.170
and a National Council for Teachers
of English Orbis Pictus Honors.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.900
Today's presentation will focus
on four specific works of hers.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.410 position:64%
<i>Maritcha, A 19th Century Girl </i>, <i>Searching
for Sarah Rector, The Richest Black Girl</i>

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.270 position:58%
<i>in America </i>, <i>Capital Days, Michael
Shiner's Journal and the Gross Growth</i>

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.780 position:59%
<i>of our Nation's Capital </i>, and her most
recent work, <i>How to Build a Museum,</i>

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.700 position:59%
<i>the Smithsonian National Museum of
African-American History and Culture </i>.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.120
Which chronicles the history behind
the development and the building

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.750 position:66%
of the latest museum on the National Mall.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.710 position:69%
Elementary school librarian and past Library
of Congress Teacher in Residence, Tom Bober,

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.890 position:75%
will facilitate our conversation this afternoon.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.790 position:69%
Tom, a librarian at RM Captain Elementary in
Clayton, Missouri has used primary sources

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.600
on historical and scientific
topics from the Library of Congress

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.500 position:58%
to help students construct knowledge.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.830 position:67%
And I might add, Tom has a particular skill

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.360
with audiovisual materials
in the Library's collections.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.850 position:61%
We are thrilled to welcome both Tom and
Tonya and thank you all for being here.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.470
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Lee
Ann, for the introduction.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.680 position:64%
And I just wanted to say that I am really
honored too to be here with you all

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.120 position:75%
and to be having the [inaudible] opportunity to
talk to Tonya and to facilitate today's keynote.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.900 position:67%
We're going to start off Tonya with talking
about <i>Searching for Sarah Rector </i>,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.540 position:70%
a book that I was familiar with before we
had the opportunity to meet up just recently.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.780 position:69%
And it's one that I think really speaks to a
lot of people because we have a book that is

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.570 position:73%
about someone who is really unknown but is what
we also have revealed is this time in history,

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.260
this moment in history through the
information about this young lady.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.010 position:75%
And so I wondered, Tonya, if you would start off
by telling us just a little bit about the book?

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.870
But also telling us about
the inspiration for the book.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.870
Where did you get the idea
to tell us Sarah's story?

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.880
&gt;&gt; Hi, Tom.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.210
I stumbled upon the story.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.570
It was, I think, in 2010?

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:49.390 position:73%
A librarian in Connecticut sent me an email and
there was an attachment and it was an article

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.130
from <i>The Crisis </i>about Sarah Rector.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.740
And I thought, never heard of her.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.770 position:59%
I don't know that much about Oklahoma.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.020 position:67%
And I just said, "I want to do this story."

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:06.990 position:72%
And after I got the green light to do it,
then I went into panic mode because, you know,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.010 position:58%
there are very few secondary sources.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.820
So I had to comb through newspaper
articles and legal documents

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.310 position:70%
which is a long story on how I acquired them.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.950 position:70%
And it was really, really very scary because,
you know, with that book, with that story,

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.370 position:67%
the story that everyone told was that
during this oil boom in Oklahoma and Texas,

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.350 position:72%
only white men were allowed to be guardians of
oil-rich black children and Indian children.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.340
And that all the white guardians
ripped all the children off.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.000 position:73%
And as I'm doing the research and using common
sense, I'm saying, "I don't think that's true."

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.630
So I did a lot of second
guessing of myself but in the end,

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.940
I decided to go with my gut and
go with what I saw was true.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.240 position:73%
Yes, some children were ripped off but not all.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.590
&gt;&gt; And as I'm reading -- as I read
Sarah Rector for the first time,

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.530
one thing that I learned was
the history of enslaved blacks

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.850
and that they were held by
Indians from the Southeast.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.460
It wasn't something that
I was previously aware of.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.690 position:64%
It was this piece of American history
that was new to me and it made me wonder.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:23.720 position:70%
Was there a piece of history around Sarah --
or any of your other books that surprised you

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.930 position:56%
or caught you off guard or maybe
even changed how you viewed a moment

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.550
or an event or a group in history?

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.730 position:58%
&gt;&gt; Well, Tom, that's a good question.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.560 position:58%
I'm always learning because you know,
when you see a finished book of mine,

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.990 position:59%
maybe when I started the book, I knew
about 5% or 10% of what's in the book.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.650
So yeah, I didn't know anything

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.070
about the so-called Five Civilized
Tribes holding blacks in slavery.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.150
And so, and I didn't -- I had
no idea that there were people

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.350 position:64%
of African descent on the Trail of Tears.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.540 position:56%
I remember in a book -- my book on
the New Deal, <i>FDR's Alphabet Soup </i>--

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.680 position:61%
I found an article at which there was a
man who had been released from prison.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.200 position:75%
And a few months after he was released, he was
back at the prison gates, begging to be let back

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.020
in because he was broke and hungry.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.250 position:67%
And I thought, "Wow, this really happened?"

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.970 position:67%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you get these moments and I think
this really comes forth in your writing too

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.020 position:69%
when you share all of this research out that
there are these small moments in history

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:35.310 position:61%
that were not things that we learned in
school or not things that you see maybe

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.430 position:69%
when you're watching some kind of broadcast.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.540 position:63%
That there's these more nuanced things
that are happening in historical moments

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:48.020 position:67%
that maybe aren't what we expect and really
kind of reshape what we thought to be true.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.200
&gt;&gt; Well, Tom -- that's the wonder.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.810 position:64%
This is why I love doing history so much.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.510
Because it's an adventure.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.080
It's discovery.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.940
It's a journey.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.860
It's lifelong learning.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.870
And you often find in history
things that are stranger

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.320 position:72%
or more wonderful or wondrous than in fiction.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.860 position:70%
&gt;&gt; Speaking of fiction, you mentioned in
your author's note of Sarah's story this idea

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.090
of separating fact from fiction
when you're doing research.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:26.160 position:66%
And I was wondering how you sorted through
conflicting statements about Sarah's story

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.700
or any of the people and
events you've researched.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.140 position:66%
Was there this rule of thumb that you
could follow that you could share with us?

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.880 position:61%
Or was it more of a case-by-case basis?

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.710
&gt;&gt; Well, it depends.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:45.450 position:73%
I mean, one rule is that generally, the source
that's closest to the subject is more accurate.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.950
So you had newspapers in Chicago
saying this happened to Sarah,

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.140 position:63%
that's happened to Sarah, this is wrong.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.010 position:69%
And then I started to notice also that a lot

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.820
of newspapers just cut and
paste from other newspapers.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:04.170 position:73%
So everyone's saying the same thing and I
said, "You know, she lived in Muskogee County."

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:09.670 position:56%
And I started to find that in
Muskogee County, articles about her.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.480
You had less outrageous things,
claims being made.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.110 position:64%
So that's one rule of thumb is the source
closest is generally more accurate.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:22.380 position:75%
And then it was common sense because I realized,
wait a minute, this is the early 1900s.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:27.070 position:61%
They don't have investigative reporters
going from Chicago to Oklahoma.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.560
Few people had telephones.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.150 position:73%
So I said, "How could they verify any of this?"

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think the one thing that
really came across in the story too

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.210 position:67%
and I think you're speaking to this is
there is this -- there is this perspective,

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:43.900 position:64%
there is this -- bias might be too
strong of a word that really comes across

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.900 position:63%
and comes through in newspaper articles.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:52.240
So for example, you speak or write
a lot about the Chicago Defender.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.010
And they were really defenders
of Sarah and her well-being.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:03.550 position:75%
I was wondering what benefits you see in
sources that have this really clear perspective?

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.670
They have a slant.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:08.870
They have a -- something
that they're really pushing

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.290
for when you're researching
a story like Sarah's.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:18.080 position:70%
Does that make a difference in how you accept
the source or how you deal with the source

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.600 position:61%
or come to understand what it's saying?

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:26.050 position:66%
&gt;&gt; Yeah and I understand it too because
at the time, there were a lot of children,

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.470
black and Indian being ripped
off by white guardians.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.320
But we always know that, you
know, we can't generalize.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.250
Nothing is always and everyone.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.590
So like I said, you take
things with a grain of salt.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:41.200 position:70%
You know if a newspaper has a certain agenda.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.280
You know, and this is at a
time when you had, you know,

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.340 position:63%
lynchings and all -- you know, Jim Crow.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.780
So I could understand the bias.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:53.630 position:72%
But even in secondary sources, there are
certain scholars that I found to be, you know,

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.570 position:61%
really balanced and not have an agenda.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.210
And others, I always know to
take this with a grain of salt.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.280
They kind of have an agenda.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:05.630 position:59%
Like for example, when I'm in the 19th
century, Eric Foner or is it Foner?

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:10.690 position:67%
He's usually my go-to guide because I found
him to be very thorough and very balanced.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:16.360 position:70%
&gt;&gt; And how do you just -- how do you kind of
discovery that thoroughness and that balance,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.540
I guess is something I'm wondering
about when I hear you say that.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.360 position:73%
Is that bringing in those primary sources along

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.950
with these secondary sources
that you're mentioning?

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.860
Or what reveals that to you?

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.350
&gt;&gt; I think that comes with time.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.120 position:67%
I think when I first started out, I just --

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.270
with anyone that had a PhD so
okay, well they must be right.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:41.400
And then after a while, you --
it's like a gut thing, you know.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:47.440
When people will say with Abraham
Lincoln certain things he said,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.870
they'll kind of downplay it.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.210
And I think, no, okay.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.040
I know I really can't trust you.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.070
But it's a gut -- it's a gut thing.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.290 position:69%
And like you said, after a while, if you've
read a lot of Eric Foner's work, you know --

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:03.640
you feel like you know him
and you can trust him.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.770 position:63%
&gt;&gt; You said something there that just,
that made me kind of want to circle back

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.440 position:67%
to the primary sources that you dealt with.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.400
You said that you really felt
like at a point that you knew him,

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.320
that you knew his work, his
secondary source work.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.430
And it made me wonder then
about something like --

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.110
going back to the Chicago
Defender, if you'll let me.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:25.220
I'm guessing at a point when you
read enough of their work as well,

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:32.390 position:67%
do you feel like you know their work and
who they are and what their priorities are?

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:36.480 position:69%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you do because you could tell, you
know, their interest in sensation, you know.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.820
And they want to sell newspapers.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:47.000
You know and you just -- you
kind of, yeah, get a feel for it.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.250
And then too, along the way,
I started to [inaudible].

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.440 position:67%
I can't remember any now but discrepancies,
things that I knew were not true --

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.560 position:58%
small things that they were claiming.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.790 position:59%
And so then you start to you know,
the red flags go up and you say, okay,

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.660 position:59%
let me take this with a grain of salt.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.060
&gt;&gt; Wonderful.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:13.750 position:69%
Well, as I'm going through and we're looking
at different images that are either directly

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:19.160 position:63%
from searching for Sarah Rector or are
related to the time period and the event

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.840 position:70%
that Sarah Rector really has revolved around.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:27.600 position:58%
And Tonya, we're going to transition,
if we can into Maritcha now.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:34.480
This book also focuses on one
individual and one time period.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.030
And was actually, as I mentioned
earlier, and I misspoke.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:42.180 position:58%
I apologize but one of the books
that I was really very familiar with,

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.780
kind of right off the bat and
have used with my students

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:50.990
and students have really
connected with it as well.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:55.990 position:61%
Can you tell us a little bit about this
book and where it came from and where

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.570 position:67%
that inspiration for you came for Maritcha?

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.230
&gt;&gt; Once again, I owe it all
to a librarian [laughter].

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:06.790 position:64%
Diana Lachatanere at the Schomburg Center
for Research in Black Culture in Harlem,

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.310
one day said to me -- I was
there researching something.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:17.020 position:69%
And she said to me very casually, "You know,
we have this memoir unfinished of this,

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.490 position:58%
you know, black woman, a New Yorker."

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:24.180
She just said very casually, "You
might want to take a look at it."

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:29.890 position:64%
And so I went to the microfilm, micro
page and I, you know, read it and I said,

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:35.470 position:72%
"I have to do this story because you know, if
I were around in the 19th century in New York,

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:36.850 position:59%
you know, I would want to be Maritcha.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:37.850
I would want to be her friend."

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:44.930
And also because it's -- sometimes,
you know the way black history,

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.110 position:69%
black lives are presented, it's very narrow.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:53.270 position:73%
So you either think that everybody was enslaved
and I do descend from people who were enslaved.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:56.210
And most were in the 19th century.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.850
And if they were free, you'd
imagine that they are bedraggled

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:03.100 position:63%
and poor and, you know, and downtrodden.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:07.480 position:59%
And yeah, there was some of that but
there was always a black middle class.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.410 position:73%
I remember when the book came out, and one
teacher said, "You know, I never thought about,

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.000
you know, there being a black
middle class in the 19th century."

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.150
And I said, "Who did you think
Frederick Douglass hung out with?"

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:20.000
&gt;&gt; [Laughter] Absolutely.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.250
You're absolutely right.

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.430
And it is -- you did such an
amazing job of revealing that.

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:25.050
I'm sorry, go ahead.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.940
&gt;&gt; I was going to say the
other inspiration is that

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.430 position:69%
and when I work with kids, I tell them this.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.850 position:75%
I said, "Maritcha represents who most of us are,

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:37.290
ordinary people doing our jobs,
helping in our communities."

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:43.640 position:70%
You know, for example, she was among the
women who did that fundraiser for Ida B. Well

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.880
that allowed her to publish
her anti-lynching pamphlets.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:53.910
And I think the other thing is that
Maritcha grew up to be a teacher.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:57.320 position:59%
And when I was a little girl and
people said, "What do you want to be?"

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.500
I used to say, "Teacher."

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.310 position:63%
So there was that connection like -- and
she devoted like 50 years of her life.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:06.100
And that was at a time, as you
know, when women, if they will --

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.530
if they wanted to remain school
teachers, they could not marry.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.680
&gt;&gt; That is right, absolutely.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.600 position:70%
So yeah, you've got these -- what I'm hearing
you're making these wonderful connections

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:24.490 position:73%
between -- in some ways, yourself and Maritcha,
and I'm wondering when you read her piece

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:29.180 position:56%
that inspired this work, you
mentioned I need to tell this story.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:35.310 position:61%
Did you know right away that this was
a book or was it more an idea of I need

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.950 position:56%
to know more or I want to know more?

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.050
&gt;&gt; It was both.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:45.800
It was this is a story that needs
to be told and I want to know more.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:51.210 position:64%
And the other connection we had is that
as you know, when she went to Providence,

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:55.240 position:56%
she was the first black girl in the
Girl's Department in the high school

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.300 position:69%
and for the first year, no one spoke to her.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:00.520 position:64%
I mean, she really got the cold shoulder.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.210 position:61%
And I sort of had a similar experience.

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.940
I mean, no one gave me the cold
shoulder but you know I went

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:10.330 position:56%
to a predominantly white secondary
school so there was that connection.

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:17.470 position:70%
&gt;&gt; I want to jump in and move -- kind of take
those connections and move into one thing

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:20.050
that I noticed as I was connecting
with your book.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:25.960 position:59%
And that was the amazing images within
it and really within all of the books

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.630 position:67%
that we're going to be talking about today.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.440
It's just chockfull of these images
and they really, for the reader,

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.700 position:75%
play a role in the storytelling that's going on.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:41.300 position:56%
And so it really made me wonder what
role images, photos, maps, drawings,

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:49.650 position:75%
all of those played in your research and your
understanding of in this case, Maritcha's story.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:55.560
&gt;&gt; Well, to me, the narrative and
the artwork, they're all of a piece

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:59.260 position:72%
like I could say tomorrow whatever project I'm
working on, I'm going to get up and I'm going

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.250
to write chapter one or chapter
three or whatever.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.700 position:59%
And then find like it's not happening?

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:08.330
And then sometimes, I'll just start
searching the internet for images

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.840
and then I find something
that inspires the narrative.

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.060
So they go hand in hand.

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:16.510 position:70%
I mean, I always want the images to tell some
more of the story, not just be decorative.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:21.470
And I try to avoid stereotypes.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.720
You know, I think that's very
important for the children's books.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.990
Well, in everyone's books.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:29.450
For example, there was a case in
my book, IT Cause on Reconstruction

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.770 position:70%
when I covered the transcontinental railroad.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:39.200 position:75%
And there's in one way, a wonderful image of
workers, Chinese men and Irishmen working on it.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.770 position:61%
But their caricature was in stereotypes
and I knew I had to say in the caption,

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:48.830 position:67%
even the Harper's Weekly considered itself,
you know, liberal and sophisticated.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:54.120
It wasn't -- they still sometimes
engage in stereotypes.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:18:00.100 position:66%
&gt;&gt; One other thing, Tonya, that this
story did for me was reveal another moment

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:09.270
that I was unaware of and that
was the 1863 New York draft riots.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:15.350 position:67%
And you did an amazing job connecting these
riots into Maritcha's life experiences

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.700
as I'm sure she did in her
initial writing as well.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:24.150 position:72%
It made me wonder what you knew about the
riots before reading Maritcha's autobiography.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:29.200 position:59%
And specifically as a researcher, what
about that moment in her life led you

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.570 position:63%
to research it as thoroughly as you did?

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:38.820 position:72%
&gt;&gt; Well, what led me to research it thoroughly
was because, you know, her home was attacked.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.940 position:73%
And you know, the kids, the family had to flee.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.840
So it could have been -- I mean,
they could have been killed.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.580
But I think also because I
thought I, as a New Yorker,

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.570 position:70%
never heard of the New York City draft riots.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:57.150 position:63%
You know, it just reminded you too about
like, you know, what history has left

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:01.440 position:56%
out because you know, we have those.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.070 position:64%
So what I was coming up, history with
flashcard history was very simple, right?

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:08.730 position:72%
And so during the Civil War, all of the people
in the North were virtuous and righteous.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.480 position:63%
All of the people in the South were bad.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.980 position:72%
And you realize when you learn about the
draft riots that that wasn't -- it's not true.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:18.910 position:72%
And so, like I said, this happened in my city.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:20.380
And I never knew about it.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:28.330 position:72%
And I believe today, it's still considered the
worst riot in the nation's history, I think.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:28.720
&gt;&gt; You know what?

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.300
I don't know.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.990 position:59%
It certainly said -- I can imagine
that from the description in your book

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.260 position:66%
and from then some follow-up research that
I did because you're writing intrigued me

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.560 position:64%
and made me want to look further into it.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:47.000 position:67%
Is -- are there pieces I would imagine that
are parts of Maritcha's story or really any

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.260 position:61%
of the stories you want to tell, but
you just can't quite work into the book

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:51.760 position:58%
that you wished that you would share?

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.340 position:64%
Be able to share with people are these
little nuggets of knowledge that you pull

00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:00.720 position:75%
from these primary or secondary sources that are
out there that just don't have an opportunity

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.040 position:59%
to make it out into the final product?

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.810
&gt;&gt; You know, Tom, definitely, yes.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.000
Can I think of one now?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.740
No. Maybe [laughter].

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.360
&gt;&gt; It's okay.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:15.230 position:75%
&gt;&gt; You know, sometimes it may be -- because
sometimes I can be like a dog with a bone, like,

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.580 position:63%
I want everything in and I realize, you
know what, this is too much information.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.960 position:73%
I remember, once I was working on something
else and I kept insisting and going on, and on,

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:28.400 position:72%
and on about the My Lai Massacre and my editor
was younger, and she was like, that's enough.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.190 position:69%
And I realized because I lived through that,
I mean not through the massacre itself,

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.700 position:63%
but that was huge news when I was young.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:41.570 position:59%
So sometimes I can go overboard with
things that are -- you know, touch me.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:43.310 position:56%
But I'll try to think of an example.

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:51.200 position:66%
&gt;&gt; So Tonya, I love this -- this video for
several reasons, but I want to just point

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:55.970 position:58%
out a few that I -- since I have the
opportunity that I really connect to.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:21:03.610 position:73%
This idea that you've got one student here
who's really personalizing this look at history

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.620
when she says that Maritcha,
for her is a role model.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.570
She wants to follow her.

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:12.130 position:67%
She saw something in her beyond that
flashcard history that you mentioned again.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.560
If I can bring that up.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.560
And I think that that was powerful.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.030 position:75%
And the other thing that I love about this is --

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:25.050
is sometimes the little nuances
that you can find

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:28.340 position:72%
in book primary sources and secondary sources.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:32.330 position:59%
And that you include so wonderfully
in your book, are these little nuances

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:36.500 position:64%
that the young lady at the end says,
well, this one thing that was interesting

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.410 position:61%
that her parents ran an ice cream shop.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:42.880 position:64%
It was again like this very -- this kind
of loose connection, but something that's

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.910 position:67%
so endearing and that, I'm assuming,
really brought that student into the moment

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.110 position:66%
and into the learning that was going on --

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:56.070 position:56%
around Maritcha and her life and
the events that were surrounding it.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:22:00.720 position:72%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, the thing is, you know, you
write books, you put it out there, you know,

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.060 position:69%
we do school visits and things, but you
never know, like, how many people you touch.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:09.750 position:66%
And that's why it was so wonderful to hear
that she sees Maritcha as a role model.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:13.440 position:66%
And on the ice cream shop, yeah, it's kind
of intuitive, I guess, when you're writing

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:18.460 position:73%
for young people, you know, you think they
will enjoy this, you know, it'll mean something

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.530
to children because I remember
what it was like to be a child.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:28.450 position:72%
For example, if I'm -- talking about something
with money and trying to give a value to it,

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:34.980
I think I did it in Sarah Rector,
I think -- it wasn't an ice cream.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.870
It was maybe a sundae, when I
was trying to say what, you know,

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:39.670 position:69%
what you could get for a dollar or whatever.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:43.600
I always try to make it something
that a young person can relate to.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.970 position:59%
And during the pause, Tom, I did think
of an example of what I left out.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:48.460
&gt;&gt; Wonderful.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:54.760 position:66%
&gt;&gt; In Sarah Rector, I read a few articles,
probably in the Muskogee Times Democrat,

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.990
that her father sometimes,
like, got into fights.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.950
You know, got a little tipsy.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:06.380 position:73%
And I didn't think I needed to put that in,
but one of the things that that information did

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:12.260 position:59%
for me was boost my confidence in what
I believe was a truth in this story.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:16.880 position:67%
Because when I would tell people, you know,

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.660 position:73%
well it seems like the parents asked this other
person to be the guardian and they would say,

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.640 position:58%
well maybe he was -- a gun was put to
his head or maybe he was threatened.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.060 position:67%
Now seeing these articles where he was a
kind of a rough and tough guy, I said, nah,

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.620
I don't think this is the kind of
man who'd be bullied into anything.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.280
But I didn't feel, as I said,
that I needed to include

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.240 position:69%
that her father got into fights in the book.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:37.710
&gt;&gt; Wonderful.

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:41.520 position:58%
So it kind of informed the narrative,
but it didn't necessarily show itself

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.710 position:67%
in the final narrative, which I think is --

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.970
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:47.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah, which I think is a
wonderful example of these --

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.810 position:66%
again, all of these wonderful nuances when
you bring all of these different types

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:57.540 position:66%
of sources together, that really informs
the story that you end up wanting to tell.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.530
&gt;&gt; Tom, you know what?

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:00.550
I don't think it's really me.

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:01.640
I feel fortunate.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.490
It's like stories choose me.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:07.270
And my process is messy, you know.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.340 position:61%
I feel like I just stumble upon things.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:13.030 position:59%
So maybe it's a case of when the
student is ready, the teacher appears.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:18.380 position:56%
But it's like, I -- really I stumble
upon so much stuff -- and I think --

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:18.800
&gt;&gt; Oh, go ahead.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.270
I'm sorry.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:20.430
&gt;&gt; -- because [inaudible].

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:20.710
I'm sorry.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:26.730 position:72%
My philosophy is that, you know, writing is
acting and research is getting into character.

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:31.490 position:56%
And that research is not just fact
finding and getting dates of things.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.570 position:69%
It's really immersing yourself in a subject.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:36.360
It's surrendering to a subject.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:40.650
And I think when you -- you do
that, good things happen to you.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:44.690 position:72%
&gt;&gt; I'm writing this down because I love it and
I might need to share this with my students.

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:45.800
Writing is acting.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.510
Research is getting into character.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:53.510
And I think you're right, I
mean, this is -- a really --

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:58.770
a wonderful way for us to think
about the stories that we tell,

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.160
but the preparation for the
stories that we tell.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:08.150 position:72%
That research is so important to being able
to give a full picture and the picture that --

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:11.420 position:67%
that is really out there as best as we can.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.810
&gt;&gt; The research is everything.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:14.200
Everything is in the research.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:21.040 position:72%
I find, in my -- my experience, the voice, how
you open, like I said, with the F. D. R. book,

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:26.600 position:73%
that -- I used that example of that man begging
to be allowed back into prison in the opening

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.380 position:64%
and saying, you know, and lots of --
millions of people were broke and hungry.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.380
I don't plan these things.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:37.490 position:59%
I just -- like I said, I immerse
myself, I surrender and then it comes.

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:43.230
Titles, maybe not so much titles,
but openers, endings come out of --

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:47.730 position:66%
I stumble upon things during the research
and I think, oh, this is the way to start.

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:49.520 position:61%
You know, I -- never really have a map.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:56.510 position:69%
I've sort of have a map, but the map usually
is -- is nothing like the final journey.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:59.710 position:63%
&gt;&gt; Well, I love that idea that, yeah,
you have this idea of where you're going

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:01.050 position:59%
and maybe that's not where you end up.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:06.600 position:63%
Let's go ahead and explore that a little
more as we move into Capital Days:

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.090
Michael Shiner's Journal and the
Growth of Our Nation's Capital.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:16.020 position:70%
In it you tell, not only the story of Michael
Shiner, but also the story of Washington,

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:20.920 position:56%
D.C. from the burning of D.C. during
the war of 1812 to the Civil War

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.430 position:67%
and the end of slavery and much in between.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:29.180 position:66%
And in some ways, for me, this book felt
the most familiar because there are events

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:34.570 position:69%
and places that, I think, most of us are
familiar with, but because of this, I think,

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.510 position:69%
it was also the most revealing in some ways.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:44.490 position:56%
Showing me a depth to those
familiar moments that was new to me.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:49.620 position:59%
And I want to ask you, if I could,
about something in your author's note.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.150
You can tell I love author's notes.

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.360
I think they're very revealing.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:57.790 position:70%
You mention in your author's note from
Michael Shiner's story that you're not afraid

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:01.000 position:58%
as a researcher to say, I don't know.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.880 position:66%
How does that freedom of being able to say
that impact how you approach your research

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.140 position:75%
and how you share that research in your writing?

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:18.950 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Again, it comes down to thinking,
for example, one point in Capital Days,

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:25.240 position:70%
I mention that he lived in X place, you know,
and he was enslaved at the time and I said

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:31.820 position:67%
that we don't know exactly where because
enslaved people weren't in the directories.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.000
You know, sometimes you can figure
out why you don't know something

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.760 position:58%
and other times you just have to say,
for example, he wrote very little

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.880 position:61%
about his family, his immediate family.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.420
He never mentioned whether
he had siblings or not.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:50.900 position:72%
So you -- could just say we don't know, and I
think we all, especially our young people need

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.930 position:63%
to understand that, you know, as I said,
almost every book is a work in progress

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:59.830 position:70%
and that we don't know everything because we
never know -- we don't know what's been lost.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.710
That's what I think we forget.

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:04.960
Because a -- you know, especially
in D. C., right, with fires

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.050 position:58%
and other cities in the 19th century.

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:09.880
You know, there were fires.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.010 position:63%
There were, you know, natural disasters.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:12.930
There were wars.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:18.450
So we don't know how much we lost.

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:19.800 position:66%
&gt;&gt; And I think you're actually supposed --

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.750 position:75%
&gt;&gt; I think it's liberating to say we don't know.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.450 position:59%
I remember once, some young person
said to me about Maritcha when I said,

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.560
she may have played this,
she may have played that.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.100
He said, so you don't really know.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.280
And I said, "Bingo, right."

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:34.300 position:56%
But what I can do is do the research
and see what games were popular

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.010 position:61%
in the 19th century and then say maybe.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:41.400 position:66%
Because I think before, a lot of times for
children and for adults, people would --

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:46.940 position:63%
you know, just kind of maybe make
things up or, you know, skirt around it,

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:50.850 position:64%
but I think we have to say we don't know.

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.820
&gt;&gt; I love that word, also, you
just used, that word maybe.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.690 position:63%
And I think it's very -- another kind of
probably freeing word to be able to say

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.840 position:56%
that maybe this is what it was like.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:04.770
And it's based off of that
research that you've done.

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:11.130 position:67%
I think in -- in Capital Days, I'm going to
guess just maybe because of the location,

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:17.550 position:66%
maybe where you've done your most research
with Library of Congress resources.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:21.200
And I know from reading author's
notes that you've done research

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.940 position:59%
with other major institutions as well.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:30.540 position:72%
After researching several books -- for
several books, excuse me, how is your approach

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:33.020
to research changed over the years?

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:39.150 position:59%
How have you honed that ability and
what are some tricks that you know now

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:43.280
that you wish you had known when
researching for an earlier book?

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.500
&gt;&gt; Good question.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.080
Well, Tom, I've become bolder.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:52.080 position:72%
As I tell young people, you know, you don't --

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:57.110 position:63%
to write something, you don't need to
know everything, but you need to be able

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:03.310 position:59%
to find people who know more than you
do and then convince them to help you.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:08.230
So I guess I'm at a point now
that I could be -- I don't know.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.950 position:56%
The President has some information,
I would try to get it -- get to him.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:16.430 position:64%
So for example, I reached out to John G.
Sharp for Capital Days because, you know,

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:23.160
he had transcribed Shiner's journal
and I found his email and said,

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.270
I'm interested in doing a,
you know, book for children.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.470
Could I pick your brain sometime?

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:32.230
And he said, great, I wanted
his story to get out there.

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:38.370 position:63%
And then I sent him a copy of
Maritcha's -- kind of this kind of book.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:42.770
Also, with Dr. Adrian Cannon at
Library of Congress, there was --

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:49.810 position:64%
I had mixed information -- or conflicting
information rather, on who sold the book

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:52.860 position:56%
and how much it sold for when it
was sold to the Library of Congress.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.070
So, I didn't know her.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.170 position:58%
So it was like, Hi, I'm Tonya Bolden,
you know, and I want to know this.

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:57.930
Can you please tell me?

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:00.610 position:61%
And she gave me the information and
then, you know, I always say to people,

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:04.240
if you want to know more about my
work, you can check out my website.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.000 position:63%
You know, and let them know that -- you
know, I'm not trying to get other people

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.210 position:67%
to do my work for me, but I just need help.

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:13.510 position:56%
And I find that, especially
librarians, of course, and teachers,

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:16.760 position:59%
and archivists, they're there to help.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:22.740 position:72%
So, you know, too, when people ask me about
process, I often say read my acknowledgements.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:27.880 position:66%
So I wish when I was younger, I wish I had
been bolder about reaching out to experts.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.830 position:66%
I once emailed Eric Foner about something.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:34.730 position:69%
I was looking for an image of a black
Representative, I think, from South Carolina

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:38.230 position:63%
and I just wanted to know, you know,
have you ever seen an image of this man?

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.500
And I don't know if it was him,
but somebody for him, you know,

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.490
responded to me saying that,
no, we've never seen it.

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:48.050 position:66%
&gt;&gt; This is a whole new type of
sleuthing, like digging up email addresses

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:53.010 position:59%
and contact information for
individuals to make these connections.

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:58.820 position:61%
To really reach out there and go beyond
what maybe is right in front of you.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.010
How do you make that decision?

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:05.440 position:69%
How do you make the decision to say, I think
this may be here, or is it more of a --

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.690
an intuition of saying, I
want this and so I'm going

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:12.070 position:72%
to contact someone who may know more about it?

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:15.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like -- like, I want
to know this, I want to know this.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:19.760 position:64%
I went overboard in Sarah Rector because,
even though I knew I had the information

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:24.810
on when she sold her allotment,
the land on which she had oil,

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.860 position:75%
but I wanted to know what happened to that land.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:32.460 position:64%
So I tracked someone down at the Oklahoma
something or something Oil something

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:39.520 position:64%
and they referred me to someone else, and
this wonderful woman ended up tracking --

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:45.980 position:56%
she had like 30, I think, oil wells,
and -- giving me the documentation,

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:49.880
showing that years later some
were -- when they were capped.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:55.060 position:59%
When each oil well was capped and then
years later, that with new technology,

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:57.050 position:67%
some of the wells were being drilled again.

00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:01.570
And at the time of publication of
the book, there were still some

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:03.650 position:56%
of her wells that were in operation.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:06.720
That wasn't really vital to
the story, but I was just like,

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:10.630 position:72%
I want to know what happened to her oil wells.

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:12.870 position:70%
Oh, -- yeah, with John G. Sharp, there was --

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:19.660 position:67%
there's a scene in Capital Days when Shiner
has a pass to go someplace for the holidays

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:26.580 position:75%
and on his way back -- Christmas holiday, on his
way back some people in Fort Washington stop him

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:31.830
and think he's a runaway enslaved
person, and they want to, you know.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:35.870
And I'm thinking, why doesn't he
just show them his pass, right?

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:39.520
Because every time I've heard
about people having passes --

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.870
blacks having passes, they
had to have them on them.

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:46.140
So I -- I emailed John and said,
why didn't he just show the pass?

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:51.790 position:63%
He said, no, for the Navy Yard, you gave
your pass to the sentry when you left.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:54.410
I said, oh, okay.

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:56.940
&gt;&gt; And some of these primary
sources I'm seeing, as I'm talking,

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.570
you're talking about the Navy Yard,
which we had an image of earlier.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:03.390
You were talking about the oil
wells which we had some imagery,

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:08.500 position:66%
maybe not of Sarah Rector's oil wells, but
just that area and the oil wells on them

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.070
and what that looked like earlier.

00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:17.320 position:75%
Really providing a rich visual to accompany
these pieces of knowledge that -- that really --

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.940
that you reach out for and get from
these experts out in the field.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.860
Those people who, as you mentioned,
know more than you and you need

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.460
to convince them to help you out.

00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.760
Tonya, I wanted -- oh please.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.190
Go ahead.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:32.020 position:64%
&gt;&gt; I always send them a copy of the book.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:35.610 position:58%
&gt;&gt; have you had people reach out to
you, Tonya, in the same vein and say,

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:40.850 position:69%
well maybe even a younger student and say, I
want to know more about Sarah, or Maritcha,

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:45.070 position:66%
or Michael and -- and maybe they've got a
specific question that isn't in your book?

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:49.040 position:61%
&gt;&gt; I've had a few adult people, I think
some -- one of them wanted to find --

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.880
she thought that there was
a connection with someone

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:54.780 position:69%
in her family and Maritcha and she inquired.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.250 position:63%
I don't get that many from young people.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:01.280
Sometimes, to be honest,
I will get an email and --

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:04.460
and they really want me to
do their work for them.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:07.630
You know, it's like, can you tell
me who George Washington Carver is?

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:12.130 position:63%
[Laughter] One thing, can you back up
to the -- are we able to back up photos?

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:13.580 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Wherever you would like to go.

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.140
&gt;&gt; Lincoln's Inauguration.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.330 position:66%
Some might say, oh but it's blurry, right.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:22.930 position:64%
But that's why I love it, because in the
caption, because I know Shiner was there,

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:27.310
and I can say, in this crowd
might be Michael Shiner.

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:31.740 position:56%
And the imagination can look at, you
know, do I see a black man in the --

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.220 position:59%
we don't know if he was light-skinned.

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:36.170 position:58%
We don't know if he was dark-skinned,
but with the blurriness

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.910 position:56%
and all of that, -- so I don't know.

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:41.980
I can even make use of mistakes.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:45.280
&gt;&gt; I think that -- yeah,
absolutely, just as you mentioned,

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.030 position:73%
let the imagination, the maybes come out there.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:51.610
And Tonya, I don't want to -- don't
want to cut the conversation off,

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:54.460
but I do want to spend just a
moment talking about, if we could,

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.020 position:63%
How to Build a Museum, your newest book.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.240
I really enjoyed it.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:02.000 position:64%
I just -- I received an advance copy to
look through, so I could get a little bit

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.040 position:75%
of a preview, but I have my -- my brand new copy
that just kind of came hot off the press here.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.700 position:64%
And just one quick question and that is,
you know, it seems like that a large part

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:18.090 position:69%
of your research for this book, unlike your
others, was researching a more recent event.

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:20.010 position:58%
An event kind of as it was happening.

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:24.160 position:64%
You're writing about the museum being put
together as it was actually happening.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:30.920 position:72%
So, if you could tell us briefly, how was that
different, or similar to researching for some

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.660
of your other books that maybe
took place a century or more ago?

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:41.090 position:69%
&gt;&gt; Well, it was similar in a way to Shiner,
Maritcha, and Sarah Rector because all I had

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:46.000 position:73%
to do -- most -- what I had to deal with, when
I got to the actual part of the book that deals

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.390
with the building of the museum
was first drafts of history.

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:56.590 position:56%
So newspaper articles, interviews,
and in newspaper articles sometimes,

00:36:56.590 --> 00:36:58.450 position:72%
or magazine articles, sometimes have mistakes.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:01.140 position:70%
And in interviews, sometimes people misspeak.

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.370 position:63%
So, you know, I would have to confirm --

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:07.070 position:58%
get a lot of things confirmed because
I'm like, is this really true?

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:08.540
Do they really own this item?

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:09.940 position:56%
Do they have this in the collection?

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.160 position:58%
So that was -- that was exhilarating.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.250 position:59%
Also, things were constantly changing.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:18.820 position:61%
So at one point, because this is what I
was -- the information documents I got.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:23.530 position:67%
The base of the museum was going to be like
a platform or plant, and then it changed.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:29.250 position:67%
So it was just -- it was just staying alert
and then, too, I also knew that in the end

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:34.780 position:72%
of the day, the deputy director, the director,
and other members of the staff were going

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:38.920 position:56%
to read it and they would, you know,
update me if I needed updating.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.170
So, but it was -- it was exciting.

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:45.150 position:56%
Sometimes I would do things like,
say if this was this time last year,

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:51.420 position:66%
I would just search engine NMAAHC and the
day's date to see if anything new had come

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.900 position:63%
because it got so much coverage, so much
press, that things were always changing.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:59.620
Things were always being acquired.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:03.680 position:75%
So it was, like I said, it was a thrilling ride.

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.740
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:08.830 position:73%
And I -- I think, actually, that -- that answer
that you shared with us really kind of leads

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:15.560
into one of our audience questions
that I'd love to pose to you.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:24.020 position:67%
Is there an average amount of time that you
spend researching before you begin writing?

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:28.490 position:56%
How do you know, I guess, when it is
time to write and how does that idea

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:31.270 position:64%
of researching and writing work together?

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:36.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's all like a messy jumble.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:41.270
It was like I'd research to a
point and then I'll find something

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:44.050 position:59%
and I'll say, okay, this is my way in.

00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:45.990 position:58%
and then I'd know where I'm starting.

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:50.910 position:70%
But it could be -- what -- after that will be
a big TK because I don't know what I'm doing.

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:53.880
But I -- have to have a way in.

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.720
And then once I'm in, then
I fumble and stumble around.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.010 position:73%
It's really -- yeah, I'm not a person who says,

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.680
I want to do all the research
then I'm going to write.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.870 position:75%
Sometimes I may write something that's not based
on research, but it's like a concepty thing.

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:08.100 position:75%
Like I said, my process is really, really messy.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:12.530
I just sort of, you know,
follow the spirit in a way.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:19.820 position:66%
&gt;&gt; And with that, is there a -- I know you
say it's messy and I guess -- I think --

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:24.440 position:70%
I wonder if some of our audience members are
kind of a little more curious about what some

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:29.330 position:56%
of the messiness looks like, in
addition to what you shared already.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:32.930
This idea of -- is there a
process that you go through?

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:37.870 position:72%
And someone asked this question; do you have a
preferred method of processing through a book,

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:41.010 position:69%
or does each book proceed in its own manner?

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:44.040 position:64%
And I'm going to guess from the
messiness, there's some uniqueness to it.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:49.000 position:66%
I guess I'm -- I'm kind of more interested
in some of the similarities maybe.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah, when I've gone into
starting a book thinking, okay,

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:57.660
I know how this is going
to work, it doesn't work.

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:02.510 position:73%
Because Michael Shiner is based -- Capital Days
is based on a journal and Maritcha's is based

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:05.110
on a memoir, I thought they
going to have the same structure.

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:11.110 position:70%
But it didn't work because they're totally
different people, you know, she was Victorian

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:14.310 position:58%
and prim and proper, and he was
rough and tumble, and it didn't work.

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:16.810 position:75%
And I needed to start -- he was a man of action.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:18.660 position:63%
I needed to start that book with action.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:21.650
So I started with the War of 1812.

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:25.470 position:73%
What I mean by messiness, is -- is I -- I flit.

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:29.200 position:66%
You know, like I said, I may start writing
and then say, okay, this is not happening.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.380 position:69%
You can feel it when you're not in the zone.

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:36.010 position:63%
And I'll say, so go do picture research,
or I know when I can't write on say --

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:40.880
I don't know, a bill or a war
or something like that, I know.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.670
You know why?

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:46.000 position:56%
Because you don't really understand
it, you need to go do more research.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.660
Because when I start a book,
I'm usually in a panic.

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.460
&gt;&gt; When you start researching
or you start writing?

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:54.370 position:59%
&gt;&gt; When I have to start working on it.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.510 position:59%
Like once it gets to -- before it gets
to greenlight I'm like, I can do this.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:58.360
Yes, I can do this.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.340 position:58%
And then after it gets to greenlight,

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.610
I'm like a mass of insecurity
and it's like I can't do this.

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:06.020
I won't be able to do this.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.260
&gt;&gt; And I guess there's something
else I'm hearing too,

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:13.760 position:75%
and I'm wondering if you can speak towards this,
and I'm thinking about myself as a researcher,

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.910 position:67%
as kind of a casual researcher, my students
as researchers, this idea of flitting.

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:22.560
The word maybe that came to my
mind maybe also is backtracking,

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.270
when you're saying I don't
know enough about this.

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:27.000
&gt;&gt; How does that work for you?

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.490 position:75%
And -- it almost feels like that could be like a
really freeing kind of thing while also, maybe,

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:37.180 position:64%
a little panicky sort of feeling as well.

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:41.890 position:73%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, when I was younger, I would
just write things and know that it had no heart

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:46.580 position:66%
and soul and it was cold and then just
hope an editor didn't notice or something.

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.390 position:66%
But now, I'll stop and say, wait a minute,

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:52.560
the reason you can't write this is
because you don't understand it.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:56.450
You know, and it made me more
work, but go do more work.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:57.900
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:03.320 position:70%
And Tonya, yeah, and I think, I think this is
a wonderful point to kind of wrap, but I --

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:09.650 position:75%
first of all wanted to thank you, not only for
sharing some of the insights into that messiness

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:14.380 position:63%
that you described, but also giving us
the opportunity to think about ourselves

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.990
as researchers and our students
as researchers through you.

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:22.830 position:64%
I think much as the way as you are making
connections to Maritcha and I'm sure

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:28.310 position:64%
in many ways, to all of the people that
you've researched, I'm making connections

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:30.990
with you right now, and the
things you're telling me.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:33.330 position:58%
Giving me some things to think about.

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:38.830
And -- expanding kind of my
base of what I am able to do.

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:42.430 position:56%
Maybe encouraging me, as you
mentioned, to be a little more bold.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:45.080 position:70%
A little more daring with who I reach out to.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:50.780 position:61%
And so, I want to take this opportunity
to thank you for starting us off

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:55.170 position:73%
with our Library of Congress Online Conference.

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:56.420
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.520
Thank you, Tom.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.970 position:66%
Thank you everyone at Library of Congress.
