00:00:04.328 --> 00:00:07.509
- I was a teacher for 10 years
in Kalamazoo Public Schools.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.319
They're a mid-size urban
district in southwest Michigan,

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:12.966
and my first three years
I taught algebra I,

00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.218
geometry, algebra II,
the core math classes,

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:17.958
but I also taught an
introductory statistics course.

00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.165
And then in my fourth year teaching,

00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:21.325
I started teaching AP Statistics

00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:23.531
and taught it for my last
seven years teaching.

00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:25.830
I love how AP courses
really stretch students

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.152
and give them a chance to

00:00:28.152 --> 00:00:30.056
really challenge themselves

00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:33.446
and take on a subject
and a curriculum that

00:00:33.446 --> 00:00:35.327
is just a little bit harder than

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:38.577
a standard high school
curriculum might be for them.

00:00:38.577 --> 00:00:41.340
And it prepares them for a
level of rigor in college

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.895
that can be intimidating
for a lot of students

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:45.659
when they first enter a college course,

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.354
but students who take AP classes,

00:00:47.354 --> 00:00:49.700
in my experience, tend
to feel more comfortable

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.372
once they get to college.

00:00:51.372 --> 00:00:53.554
I discovered Khan Academy when

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.923
a coworker of mine showed it to me,

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:58.964
and this was back when
Khan Academy first started,

00:00:58.964 --> 00:01:01.542
and a coworker showed it
to me and I could actually

00:01:01.542 --> 00:01:04.003
get students the practice they needed,

00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:06.348
often they needed at home as well.

00:01:06.348 --> 00:01:08.554
Because our students
would for various reasons

00:01:08.554 --> 00:01:10.180
miss a lot of days of school,

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.037
and so getting students
the help they needed

00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:15.033
in the class or outside of the classroom,

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:16.913
Khan Academy was a great help.

00:01:16.913 --> 00:01:18.632
When I was an AP teacher,

00:01:18.632 --> 00:01:20.931
I liked to use a variety of methods

00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:23.810
for engaging my students with the concepts

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.808
we were learning,

00:01:24.808 --> 00:01:27.409
so I would some days like to

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.475
give a lecture on the material

00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:32.448
or other days maybe play
a game or do a simulation

00:01:32.448 --> 00:01:35.350
or maybe other days let them be self-paced

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.719
in some review problems.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.760
And Khan Academy offers a
way for teachers to do that

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.154
in their classrooms.

00:01:42.154 --> 00:01:43.965
You have content creators like myself

00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:47.541
working at Khan Academy
who have been teachers,

00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:50.118
teaching AP for many years,

00:01:50.118 --> 00:01:53.555
and we also have external
reviewers who work closely

00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:55.969
with The College Board
and who are table readers

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:57.688
and grade the AP Test,

00:01:57.688 --> 00:01:59.778
all working together to
make sure that the content

00:01:59.778 --> 00:02:01.844
is high quality for students.

00:02:01.844 --> 00:02:03.911
My entire career as a
teacher I felt like I was

00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:06.233
doing the world good by teaching

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:09.507
multiple groups of students a subject

00:02:09.507 --> 00:02:11.480
that I thought would be incredibly useful

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.988
for their professional, academic,

00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:16.937
and everyday lives because
teaching statistics,

00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:18.423
I feel like I'm equipping students

00:02:18.423 --> 00:02:22.590
with how to make informed
decisions in their lives.
