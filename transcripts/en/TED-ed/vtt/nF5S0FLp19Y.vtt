00:00:15.064 --> 00:00:16.258
Fourth and nineteen, folks,

00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:18.270
they've gotta have a play as time's ticking away

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.070
because they've got to stay in this ball game,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.182
they've got to win.

00:00:21.182 --> 00:00:22.900
They come out lined up in the empty set,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.065
three receivers to the right,

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:25.232
two to the left.

00:00:25.232 --> 00:00:27.651
Defense looks like they're gonna to man up with no safety.

00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:30.530
This is the exact offensive match-up that they want:

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.066
the best receiver lined up against the linebacker.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.776
Quarterback steps back to receive the ball,

00:00:34.776 --> 00:00:36.275
five yards deep in the gun.

00:00:36.275 --> 00:00:38.655
He takes a snap, drops three steps,

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:39.656
he plants his back foot,

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:40.955
he's looking for an opening.

00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:42.492
There's a blitz coming off the edge!

00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:43.917
He steps up to avoid the rush.

00:00:43.917 --> 00:00:45.085
He's looking down field.

00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:46.979
He's got the inside receiver making a cut.

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:48.880
He's got a step on the linebacker.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.230
Quarterback has a beat on it.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.294
He lets the ball go,

00:00:51.294 --> 00:00:52.130
it's in the air!

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.670
Receiver is out in front of the defender.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.710
He's got it beat!

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.420
He's out in front, racing for the ball!

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.090
It's coming down!

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.401
He cradles it at the fifteen!

00:00:58.401 --> 00:00:59.478
He's at the ten, five!

00:00:59.478 --> 00:01:00.167
Touchdown!

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:01.752
Unbelievable play!

00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:02.996
Now, wait a minute.

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:04.586
Of course, it's believable,

00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:05.640
it's physics,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.893
specifically the differences between scalars and vectors.

00:01:08.893 --> 00:01:10.861
So, let's just see that replay.

00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:12.588
"Quarterback steps back to receive the ball,

00:01:12.588 --> 00:01:14.245
five yards deep in the gun."

00:01:14.245 --> 00:01:15.089
Stop.

00:01:15.089 --> 00:01:18.285
See, measurements are defined as two different quantities.

00:01:18.285 --> 00:01:20.535
Scalars are measurements with only numbers,

00:01:20.535 --> 00:01:23.785
and vectors are measurements with direction.

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:25.813
For example, when that quarterback takes the snap,

00:01:25.813 --> 00:01:28.957
he's five yards away, but from where?

00:01:28.957 --> 00:01:30.665
Back from the line of scrimmage,

00:01:30.665 --> 00:01:33.709
so the five yards by itself is a scalar quantity.

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:35.352
When you add a direction,

00:01:35.352 --> 00:01:36.796
like five yards deep,

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:39.048
it becomes a vector quantity.

00:01:39.048 --> 00:01:40.050
Five yards - scalar,

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.175
five yards deep - vector.

00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:43.345
OK, go ahead.

00:01:43.345 --> 00:01:45.348
"He takes a snap, drops three steps.

00:01:45.348 --> 00:01:47.557
He plants his back foot, he's looking for an opening.

00:01:47.557 --> 00:01:49.124
There's a blitz coming off the edge!

00:01:49.124 --> 00:01:50.810
He steps up to avoid the rush."

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.788
Whoa!

00:01:51.788 --> 00:01:55.203
Here's a difference between distance and displacement.

00:01:55.203 --> 00:01:56.536
Distance is a measurement

00:01:56.536 --> 00:01:59.152
without identifying where you moved.

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:00.412
It's a scalar quantity.

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:02.622
When the quarterback makes a three-step drop,

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.601
he moves about three yards back.

00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:07.203
When he moves about another three yards forward,

00:02:07.203 --> 00:02:08.841
when he steps up into the pocket,

00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:11.961
so that quarterback moves a total distance of six yards.

00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:14.793
That's a distance, that's a scalar.

00:02:14.793 --> 00:02:17.400
Now, displacement is a vector quantity,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.212
describing about how far out of place the object is.

00:02:20.212 --> 00:02:22.217
So the quarterback dropped back three yards

00:02:22.217 --> 00:02:24.142
and then moved back forward three yards,

00:02:24.142 --> 00:02:27.198
he's in the exact same place where he started.

00:02:27.198 --> 00:02:29.802
So, his displacement is zero yards.

00:02:29.802 --> 00:02:31.353
Distance - six yards,

00:02:31.353 --> 00:02:34.026
displacement - zero yards.

00:02:34.026 --> 00:02:35.790
So, let's look at what happened next.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.761
"Quarterback has a beat on it, he let's the ball go!

00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:38.654
It's in the air!

00:02:38.654 --> 00:02:40.287
Receiver is out in front of the defender."

00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:41.111
Stop.

00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:43.484
So, here's speed and velocity,

00:02:43.484 --> 00:02:45.615
but let's just do one thing at a time.

00:02:45.615 --> 00:02:48.251
So, speed is measurement without direction,

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.073
it's a scalar quantity.

00:02:50.073 --> 00:02:52.656
Velocity is a vector quantity.

00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:54.140
It is that object's speed,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.410
but with a direction of motion.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.496
So the receiver accelerates away,

00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:00.457
gaining both speed and distance.

00:03:00.457 --> 00:03:04.378
This takes the receiver 5 seconds to run those 50 yards.

00:03:04.378 --> 00:03:06.821
So his average speed, in any given time,

00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:08.553
is 10 yards/second.

00:03:08.553 --> 00:03:10.922
The linebacker tries to keep up,

00:03:10.922 --> 00:03:13.311
but his overall speed is slower,

00:03:13.311 --> 00:03:16.148
he only goes 35 yards in those 5 seconds,

00:03:16.148 --> 00:03:19.273
so his average speed is only 7 yards/second.

00:03:19.273 --> 00:03:21.069
They're both traveling in a forward direction,

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.529
so their velocity is also positive.

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:27.635
You can't go from resting to your peak speed immediately.

00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:29.365
You've got to build up to it.

00:03:29.365 --> 00:03:30.912
This is acceleration.

00:03:30.912 --> 00:03:33.808
At first the linebacker can keep up with that receiver,

00:03:33.808 --> 00:03:36.694
but eventually the faster receiver pulls away.

00:03:36.694 --> 00:03:40.944
That's acceleration, the change in speed over time.

00:03:40.944 --> 00:03:43.325
Acceleration is a vector quantity.

00:03:43.325 --> 00:03:46.617
It describes a rate at which an object changes velocity.

00:03:46.617 --> 00:03:49.762
Like velocity, acceleration is a vector.

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:52.588
It happens in a direction.

00:03:52.588 --> 00:03:56.692
So let's just look at that play just one more time.

00:03:56.692 --> 00:03:58.849
"Quarterback steps back to receive the ball,

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:00.468
five yards deep in the gun."

00:04:00.468 --> 00:04:01.347
Vector!

00:04:01.347 --> 00:04:03.394
"He takes a snap, drops three steps,

00:04:03.394 --> 00:04:04.598
he plants his back foot.

00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:05.852
He's looking for an opening.

00:04:05.852 --> 00:04:07.184
There's a blitz coming off the edge!

00:04:07.184 --> 00:04:08.983
He steps up to avoid the rush."

00:04:08.983 --> 00:04:09.931
Displacement!

00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:11.770
"He's got the inside receiver making a cut.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.520
He's got a step on the linebacker.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.023
The quarterback has a beat on it.

00:04:15.023 --> 00:04:15.906
He let's the ball go!

00:04:15.906 --> 00:04:16.847
It's in the air!

00:04:16.847 --> 00:04:18.313
Receiver is out in front of the defender!"

00:04:18.313 --> 00:04:19.277
Velocity!

00:04:19.277 --> 00:04:20.029
"He's got it beat!

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.736
He's out in front, racing for the ball!

00:04:21.736 --> 00:04:22.511
It's coming down!

00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:24.950
He cradles it at the fifteen, he's at the ten, five!"

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.958
Acceleration!

00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:27.869
"Touchdown! Unbelievable play!

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:29.768
That was a great play as time expired,

00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:31.040
resulting in the touchdown

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.381
and ultimately the win and pure effort."

00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:35.555
And pure science.
