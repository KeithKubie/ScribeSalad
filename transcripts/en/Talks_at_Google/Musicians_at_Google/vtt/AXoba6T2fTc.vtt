TIM QUIRK: All right,
welcome everybody.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.130
I'm very proud--

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:05.900
my name's Tim Quirk.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.390
I'm the head of global content
programming for Android.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.920
And I'm very happy and proud
to be here with Steve Jones

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.168
from the Sex Pistols.

00:00:12.168 --> 00:00:18.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.510
TIM QUIRK: All right, so Steve
and the Sex Pistols don't

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.800
really need much of
an introduction.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.600
But what's really interesting to
note I think, is that this

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.610
band, insanely influential,
genuinely revolutionary band,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.180
put out basically four singles
and one album in just a little

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.580
over two years?

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.840
STEVE JONES: Uh, yeah.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.230
TIM QUIRK: All right.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.150
And it had a massive
world-shattering impact.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.120
So we're going to talk about
that album today, because it's

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.130
coming up in a 35th anniversary
reissue.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.180
Somehow they turned it
into a four disc set.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.930
STEVE JONES: Box set.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.370
TIM QUIRK: I don't quite
know how that works.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.720
STEVE JONES: In one album.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.470
TIM QUIRK: Yeah.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.930
We'll figure out how
they did that.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.300
But I figured we should rewind
a little bit, and start at

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.390
something like the beginning.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.890
So I want to talk a little bit
about how the band formed,

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.532
what happened before the
album got made, and

00:01:08.532 --> 00:01:09.760
then the album's impact.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.270
STEVE JONES: OK.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.920
TIM QUIRK: So, basically the
band started as your and Paul

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.730
Cook's band, The
Strand, right?

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.200
That was in the early '70s?

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.510
STEVE JONES: Yeah.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.620
That was kind of just
goofing around.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:29.490
I acquired a bunch of musical
equipment, and gave the drums

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.600
to Paul Cook, because he
was my best friend.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.600
And I've known Paul Cook, the
drummer, since I was like 10.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.750
And we had a couple of other
guys from school who played

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.620
keyboards, and a bass player.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.270
None of us could play
a note, by the way.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.340
And they kind of went
to the wayside.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.570
And me and Paul kind
of carried on

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.820
a little bit longer.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.430
There was another guy called
Wally, Wally Nightingale.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.280
He was the Pete Best
of the Sex Pistols.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.920
He could actually play a
little bit of guitar.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.340
And I was singing at the time.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.850
And I didn't want to sing.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.710
But I was just going
along with it.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.290
And it got to a point
where it was just

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.020
me, Paul, Glen Matlock--

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.240
who used to work at Malcolm

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.810
McLaren's shop on the weekend--

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.860
and Wally.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.240
That was the four of us.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.690
And at that point--

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.810
we actually did one
show on the Kings

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.090
Road, at Salter's Cafe.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.390
And I was terrified.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.480
And I was singing.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.150
And we did about five songs.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.250
And I hated it.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.430
Singing wasn't for me.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.020
And that's when Malcolm
was getting involved.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.930
And we originally were called QT
Jones and the Sex Pistols.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.390
I don't know what that means.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.770
TIM QUIRK: I noticed you said
you acquired some equipment.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.440
You didn't say you bought
some equipment.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.130
STEVE JONES: You know
what I mean.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.875
TIM QUIRK: All right.

00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:07.150
Well, tell them what you mean.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.570
STEVE JONES: Huh?

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.580
TIM QUIRK: Tell them
what you mean.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.480
Where did you acquire it?

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.420
How did you acquire it?

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.000
STEVE JONES: I'm scared
to tell them.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.103
TIM QUIRK: I'm pretty sure the
statute of limitations is up.

00:03:14.103 --> 00:03:14.850
STEVE JONES: You think so?

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:15.280
TIM QUIRK: Yeah.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.260
STEVE JONES: OK, in that case.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.030
Well, I was a kleptomaniac
when I was a teenager.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.940
Through bad upbringing
with my parents--

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.170
wasn't the best parents--

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.230
very poor working class, and I
used to watch them steal, so I

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.100
kind of picked up the knack.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.140
Plus, I enjoyed it.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.390
It was like a buzz, too.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.760
I went away to various homes.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.430
One was in a place
called Banstead.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.260
It was in the country,
south of London.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.810
And I was there for
a year and a half.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.430
And I actually enjoyed it better
than being at home.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.340
They let us watch
Top of the Pops.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.150
Top of the Pops was a show once
a week, where they showed

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.210
you the top 20 whatever was
going on at the time.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.890
And I was 15, or 16, or
somewhere around there.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.750
And I saw Roxy Music on there
doing a song called "Virginia

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.410
Plane," and that changed
my life, really.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.910
I saw that and I'm like, that's
what I want to be.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.110
I want that.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.030
Whatever that is, the glamour,
and the cool, and the songs.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.500
I mean obviously I'd seen Top
of the Pops a million times

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.990
before that.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.830
But for some reason, when Roxy
Music did that song, that kind

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:46.950
was a turning point to me.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.760
So when I go out of
my rehabilitation

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.670
from being in Banstead.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.310
I proceeded to steal a load
of musical equipment.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.570
And that was my connection
to music.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.430
It was kind of a perverted way
of being closer to the band.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.780
I wasn't so much stealing it
because I wanted it to sell.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.540
I just wanted to part of
something they had.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.960
It was kind of weird,
but that was my best

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.460
thinking at the time.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:22.640
And acquired way more than
I needed of equipment.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.780
And musical shops, by the way,
many, many musicals shops I

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.440
broke into, which were a lot
easier back in the early '70s.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.730
They said they had alarms, but
all the time I knocked them

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.200
in, nothing ever went off.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.370
No one had cameras like now.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.860
I couldn't break in here.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.040
I'd be screwed in two minutes.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.390
TIM QUIRK: So you said you
didn't like singing.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.280
So the band was looking
for a singer.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.760
And I've heard--

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.900
I don't know how much
this is true--

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.400
I heard that Sylvain Sylvain was
offered the gig, Richard

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.040
Hell was offered the gig, and
Kevin Rowland, who later went

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.720
on to Dexy's Midnight Runners,
actually auditioned.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.380
STEVE JONES: As a singer?

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.880
TIM QUIRK: Yeah.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.102
STEVE JONES: We never auditioned
any of them guys.

00:06:13.102 --> 00:06:17.050
TIM QUIRK: So tell me
how you met Johnny.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.470
STEVE JONES: Well, he used to
go in the shop, Malcolm

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:26.120
McLaren's shop, which was a hang
out for certain types.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.030
It wasn't like any other
shops that was on the

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.010
Kings Road at the time.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.440
At the time it was basically
shops where guys would wear

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.310
suits with flares and tashes.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.860
That's what was going
on the time.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.090
And there was about three shops
that wasn't like that.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:48.320
There was Alkasura's, that
sold clothes to like Marc

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.550
Bolan, like glamorous,
glam clothes.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.340
Granny Takes a Trip was owned
by two American dudes.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.370
It was a mess.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.300
They were always shooting
dope in the back.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.780
I used to go in there so many
times and them guys would be

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.690
in the back.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.540
And literally you would just go,
I'll have that, and I'll

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.270
have that, see you later.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.530
And they had no idea.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.050
Perfect.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.740
Great, great clothes,
though, at the time.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.600
And then there was Malcolm's
shop, which had various names.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.730
Originally it was Too Fast To
Live, Too Young To Die.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.640
Then it was Let It Rock.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:29.360
Then it was Seditionaries
or SEX--

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:29.890
I don't know what order.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.330
I forget.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.125
But it was one of them places,
when it was Let It Rock, that

00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:35.880
had couches in there
and a jukebox.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.700
And I used to hang out.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.250
And I actually became friends
with Malcolm McLaren way

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.620
before the band started.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:48.100
And John was one of the
guys who came in

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.450
there on the weekend.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:56.090
And this is at the time when we
had the Wally guy, me, and

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.100
we would be rehearsing.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.720
And Malcolm started getting
involved a little bit.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.060
And we decided that I shouldn't
sing, and I was

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.070
thrilled about that.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.660
So I got pushed on guitar.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.880
And then we auditioned
singers.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.280
And John was one of the guys I
spotted coming in the shop

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.520
that he looked a
lot different.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.450
He had the green hair,
short green hair.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:22.490
And he had a "I Hate Pink
Floyd" t-shirt.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.820
It was a Pink Floyd t-shirt, but
he'd put underneath it "I

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.740
hate."

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.910
And he had his own kind of thing
going on, with safety

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:29.510
pins, and all that.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.115
And he looked great.

00:08:31.115 --> 00:08:35.539
I said we should try
that guy out.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:36.850
And we did.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:41.039
And we actually auditioned
him in the shop.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:47.780
We made him sing along to the
Alice Cooper "Eighteen." And

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.170
he was just taking the
piss out of it.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.780
But he definitely
had something.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.260
And we tried him out.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.435
And it kind of worked
straight away.

00:08:59.435 --> 00:09:04.160
So we got rid of Wally, got me
on guitar, and then we started

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.410
rehearsing.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.240
TIM QUIRK: Set the scene in
early '70s, mid '70s in

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.320
London, most people in the
audience look old enough to

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:14.810
remember it.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:20.295
But the milieu, just the
economic situation, and what

00:09:20.295 --> 00:09:22.970
was going on with the classes
seems like it was so integral

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.830
to what you guys wound
up becoming.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.390
STEVE JONES: It's kind
of like it is now.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.530
TIM QUIRK: Explain that.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:34.190
STEVE JONES: Well, back
then in '75, there

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.560
was a lot of strikes.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.030
There was a lot of people
out of work.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:44.682
And it was pretty grim in
the country at the time.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:51.280
Whether that was the reason, it
was just a coincidence that

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.720
we kind of came along at that
time-- we didn't come along

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.200
because, oh, look, everyone's
out of work.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.410
Let's start a band.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.130
It wasn't like that.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.650
It was just the timing.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:06.010
And it was great.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.090
I mean, I didn't really pay a
lot of attention to all the

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.280
strikes, and all that stuff.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.090
It never bothered me.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.190
Because I always stole.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:19.560
So I didn't have to get
a job to feed myself.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.350
TIM QUIRK: So now you've got--

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:22.610
STEVE JONES: I'm not proud of
being a thief, by the way.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.030
You're the one glamorizing it.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.992
TIM QUIRK: I just asked
you about it.

00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:27.493
STEVE JONES: I don't
steal anymore.

00:10:27.493 --> 00:10:29.160
TIM QUIRK: All right.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.090
So now you've got the
heart of the band.

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.670
You've got Paul on drums, Glen
on bass, you're playing

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.450
guitar, and Johnny singing.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.585
It was Johnny Lydon
originally.

00:10:36.585 --> 00:10:38.265
Who dubbed him Johnny Rotten?

00:10:38.265 --> 00:10:38.730
STEVE JONES: I did.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:39.640
TIM QUIRK: And why was that?

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.815
STEVE JONES: Because of
his teeth were rotten.

00:10:42.815 --> 00:10:44.850
TIM QUIRK: See, the American
conception is everybody's

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.150
teeth were rotten back then.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.650
STEVE JONES: Well English
people's teeth were rotten.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.070
Well they were.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.240
TIM QUIRK: But his were
worse than most?

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:50.890
STEVE JONES: His were
worst than most.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.770
Yeah.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.825
TIM QUIRK: What was the first
song this band wrote?

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.730
STEVE JONES: Original song?

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:08.170
I think it was "Seventeen."
It was called

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.440
"Lazy Sod," as well.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:16.790
But that was a tune that was
just a straightforward Buddy

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.710
Holly kind of tune, really.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.930
And John just put his usual
trademark lyrics on it.

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:31.020
It's not filler, but it's not
the best song ever written.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.730
TIM QUIRK: At what point did you
write a song that you, or

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.320
everyone in the band was like,
oh, wait a minute.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.872
We've got something here.

00:11:36.872 --> 00:11:41.230
STEVE JONES: I think "Anarchy"
was the first one that we kind

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.880
of thought we had something
going on.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.460
"Anarchy in the UK."

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.780
TIM QUIRK: You had a
quote at that time.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:51.970
You said, "We're
not into music.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:56.650
We're into chaos." Tell
me about that.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.000
STEVE JONES: I remember,
actually.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.250
We did a show opening up for a
band called Eddie and the Hot

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:07.540
Rods, at the Marquee,
Wardour Street.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:14.020
And we'd done about maybe five
or six shows before then,

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.270
using my equipment.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:18.700
TIM QUIRK: Your equipment?

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:19.980
STEVE JONES: My equipment.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.200
And this was the first show we
were opening up for this band.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.400
And they actually
had monitors.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.160
We'd never had monitors
before.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.240
And we never sound checked.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.100
We never had a roadie,
anything.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.800
And this band had been
going a while.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.670
They were part of this
pub rock movement.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.160
That was the thing that
was happening.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.100
There were all these bands, a
circuit, all these bands would

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.320
play pubs and stuff.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.240
And so John started singing.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.070
And I think it was the first
time he ever heard himself.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.850
And he was terrified.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.790
So he kicked one of the monitors
in the stage, because

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.420
he didn't want to
hear himself.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.360
And then it started a big
scuffle and the band, who we

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.160
were opening up for, was pissed
off, and all that.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.380
And it was just a big mess.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.570
And then some guy came up to
me afterwards, and asked me

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.280
that question.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.210
And for some reason, I just
said, "we're not into music.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.630
We're into chaos." I don't
know why I said that.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.960
That's what it seemed like.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.990
The gig, the show was
kind of crazy.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.770
And people didn't like us.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.380
No one liked us in
the beginning.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.320
I've got to point that out.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.280
I used to throw up sometimes
because I was so nervous.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.520
Because you didn't know
what was going to

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.690
get thrown at you.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.060
I mean, literally, that
was what was going on.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.430
TIM QUIRK: And yet very shortly,
it wasn't too long

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:42.820
before wherever you guys went in
England and played a show,

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.630
it seems like even if there
weren't a lot of people in the

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.400
crowd, they all went off and
formed their own bands.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.870
STEVE JONES: So they say.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:49.900
TIM QUIRK: Do you not
believe them?

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.250
STEVE JONES: I don't know.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.690
I mean, the 24 Hour Party People
is a good example, when

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.970
we played the Lesser Free Trade
Hall in Manchester.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.610
Supposedly Morrissey saw it.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:01.900
Go on, you know the list.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.500
TIM QUIRK: Buzzcocks, Joy
Division and Morrissey was

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:04.940
apparently there.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.850
STEVE JONES: Yeah.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:07.600
So.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.710
TIM QUIRK: And Marky Smith.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.270
STEVE JONES: So there
you go, you know.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:20.020
TIM QUIRK: There's a lot
of chaos and fighting

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.760
and stuff going on.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.310
Malcolm McLaren and some
other people were

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:25.650
trying to put this--

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.340
kind of say it's all part of--

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:30.380
recapitulating what the
situationists had been doing

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.300
in the late '60s.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.780
Did you're ever buy
any of that?

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.030
STEVE JONES: No.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.026
He was just trying to--

00:14:36.026 --> 00:14:38.110
he had a big ego, Malcolm.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:38.920
I like Malcolm.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:39.700
He was a friend of mine.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:44.460
But he was trying to rewrite
history, like so many people

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.000
do after the fact.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.180
I'm sure the Bible's got a lot
of bullshit things in there.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.220
You know what I mean?

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.510
Rewritten things.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:15:00.022
I mean, who wrote it originally,
the Bible?

00:15:00.022 --> 00:15:02.820
Who knows, right?

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.250
But you know what I mean?

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.330
I mean everyone does it.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.480
When you watch the Civil War
on A&amp;E, there's that guy.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.250
He talked like he was there.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.860
Me and Robert E. Lee, we did
this, and blah, blah.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.210
Everyone likes to try to put
their twist on something

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.990
that's happened, and then go
back and kind of quirk it to

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.010
make it look cool, and so on.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.430
TIM QUIRK: So at the time, how
much thought were you guys are

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:26.780
putting into what
you were doing?

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.310
Did you have a goal?

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.950
STEVE JONES: No, we didn't.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:29.680
There was no goal.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.810
We were just a band.

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:36.020
With different lyrics, not the
normal lyrics, and not the

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.910
normal aggression played.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.760
Aggression, mainly a lot of
people say, oh, we were angry.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.000
I'm sure I was angry.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.190
I didn't have a great
upbringing.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:50.580
But more of it was out of lack
of knowing how to play.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.620
When you don't know
how to play you

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.160
tend to just go harder.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.460
You know what I mean?

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.540
So I think that had a
lot to do with it.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.320
TIM QUIRK: I'm going to
read you a quote.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.390
This is from, I believe, I
think it was Paul Nelson.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.290
It was the Rolling Stone review
of Never Mind the

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:06.520
Bollocks when it
first came out.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.490
And there's two lines in it that
really jumped out at me.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.350
"Any theory of destruction as
highfalutin as this also

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:15.520
contains the seeds of freedom,
and even optimism.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.955
Anyone who cares to hate this
much is probably not a

00:16:17.955 --> 00:16:20.820
nihilist but a moralist and a
romantic as well." Does that

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.470
ring true to you?

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.234
STEVE JONES: There's a lot of
big words in there, man.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.010
Can you simplify that?

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.260
TIM QUIRK: He's basically
saying, you might listen to it

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.810
and it sounds angry
and hateful.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:33.530
But it's actually optimistic.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.790
And it's got a moral to it.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:36.400
STEVE JONES: The album?

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.870
TIM QUIRK: You feel that way?

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:38.190
STEVE JONES: Yeah.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:45.900
I think looking back on it 35
years later, I think it's just

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.640
a true album with no agenda.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.990
For sure there was no agenda.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.610
There was no agenda to,
oh, let's get a

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:53.840
single on the charts.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.750
Oh, let's do this, like so many
bands do, then to now,

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.180
like a strategy with an album.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:02.160
There was no strategy.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.010
We had these songs.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:04.060
We'd written them.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.760
We'd been playing around in
London in various places, not

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.980
many shows.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.470
And it was time to
record them.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.369
And we just, there was
no agenda at all.

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:18.839
And I think that's what's
pure about it.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.329
TIM QUIRK: It's always
interesting to me because, I

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:23.630
was a 13- or 14-year-old
kid in the

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.060
suburbs of New York City.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.369
When I first heard the record,
I was in junior high school.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:30.040
Somebody played it at a party.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.190
And I'd read a lot about punk
rock, and I'd heard a lot

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.810
about punk rock.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.600
But I hadn't heard any
actual punk rock.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.470
There was no internet.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:37.600
There was barely college
radio back then.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.910
STEVE JONES: You had to work
hard to be a fan back then.

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:42.880
Which is lacking now,
by the way.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.180
Sorry.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:43.620
Go on.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.700
TIM QUIRK: No, that's
all right.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.450
And when I first heard it, I
remember expecting to hear

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.800
some otherworldly thing.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.110
And I remember actually being
vaguely disappointed.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.110
It sounded great, but I said to
my friend, I was like, this

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:56.330
is just rock and roll.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:57.590
What's the big deal?

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:00.250
That was my initial impression,
just as a kid in

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.740
the States.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.830
But it still, even today, does
sound blisteringly different

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.030
than anything else that was
coming out at the time.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.590
How do you achieve that?

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.460
STEVE JONES: What?

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.640
TIM QUIRK: Just the sound?

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.890
STEVE JONES: I don't know.

00:18:17.045 --> 00:18:19.450
Yeah, it was just a rock
and roll album.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:24.690
But when we came to the States
and we played down South, they

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.710
didn't see it as, oh, this is
just a rock and roll album.

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:35.520
So many people have come up to
me and said they were at our

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.770
last show at Winterland.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.370
But they weren't
there, really.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.970
So years later, you
usually get these

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.090
people come up to you.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.740
Yeah, man, I'm a big fan,
blah, blah, blah.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:48.400
And they just weren't.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:54.870
They probably hated us at
that point, '78, '77

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.650
when it came out.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:02.510
And it was different than what
was going on at the time--

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:07.120
Boston, Journey, that's
what was going on.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.690
And Sex Pistols was a little
bit different.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:11.850
Don't get me wrong, now.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.292
I am a fan of Journey
and Boston.

00:19:14.292 --> 00:19:16.020
For real.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:16.620
TIM QUIRK: I believe you.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:22.130
STEVE JONES: I used to sneak
off closet Journey fan.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.480
TIM QUIRK: To me there's always
been two aspects to the

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.340
Sex Pistols.

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.760
And the bigger aspect is just
everything that was going on

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.160
culturally around you guys.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.570
And then, the music was almost
smaller than that in a way.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:35.590
Or at least it wasn't
considered as much.

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.250
So I want to talk a lot
about the music on the

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.970
record for a bit.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:40.600
So start with, who's
playing bass.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.400
There's all kinds of conflicting
reports.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.170
At the time to record came
out, Glen Matlock

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.080
had left the band.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.130
Sid Vicious had joined.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.250
But is he on the
record at all?

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.280
STEVE JONES: Sid?

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.950
Sid is fumbling around
underneath "God Save the

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:55.940
Queen" and "Bodies."

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.980
TIM QUIRK: OK.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.610
STEVE JONES: And basically the
whole album was played by me,

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:04.060
bass, "Anarchy in the UK" has
Glen Matlock in it because we

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:07.630
recorded that before
he got the boot.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:09.070
TIM QUIRK: But everything
else is you?

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:10.500
STEVE JONES: Yeah.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.740
TIM QUIRK: And did you know
how to play bass?

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:12.760
STEVE JONES: Nope.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.990
TIM QUIRK: But you knew more--
you knew better than Sid?

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.180
STEVE JONES: Yeah.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.096
I could go
dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.

00:20:19.096 --> 00:20:23.320
And that's basically
all it is.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.070
TIM QUIRK: You mentioned
"Anarchy in the UK" before,

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.770
being the song where you
felt things clicking.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.530
So tell me a bit about that
song, how it came together,

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.040
how you recorded it.

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:36.310
STEVE JONES: Well we initially
recorded it--

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:37.960
could I get another
one of these?

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.210
Thank you.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.780
We had a guy when we went on the
road called Dave Goodman.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.670
He was our sound guy
that we had.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:52.340
See, we didn't have any
guidelines to go by.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:55.110
Because we'd never seen
it before on the

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.130
other side of it.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.100
So we rented this guy.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.410
He was an old hippie.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:04.080
And pot head, smoking
all the time.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.760
And he did our live shows,
him and this other guy.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:09.920
And then it came time
to do some demos.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.860
And we did these demos in this
rehearsal room that I lived in

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.110
on Denmark Street in SoHo.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.440
We acquired it, this--

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.230
they lived upstairs and we
had the room downstairs.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:24.160
We acquired it off a band
called Badfinger.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:27.600
We bought it off them.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.190
I don't know if we bought
it or we leased it.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:33.120
So everything was done in there,
all the writing, all

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.670
the rehearsing.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:40.280
This album called Spun, that
was our first demos.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.290
We were experimenting.

00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:45.050
On a track called "Submission,"
I'm literally

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.730
blowing through a teapot to make
a bubble noise, to get a

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:48.760
bubbly effect.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.180
It was all stuff like that.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.790
Sonically, it sounded
like demos.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:59.960
And so we got the record
deal with EMI.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:04.320
And so we went to record
"Anarchy," and we carried on

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.080
using this guy, Dave Goodman,
who was still smoking 1,000

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.310
joints a day.

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:12.010
And we're in there,
laying it down.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.100
And this guy, we could never
get this guy happy.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.110
We did it 1,000 times.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.990
No, no, you've got to
do it more, more.

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:22.570
Finally, we said,
you know what?

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:23.950
You're out of here mate.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.035
We're going to get
someone else.

00:22:26.035 --> 00:22:27.040
He made us do it.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.430
We didn't want to do it,
because we liked him.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.450
But he didn't know what
he was doing.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:34.010
So then it was time to
pick a producer.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.730
And I was a big fan of Roxy
Music, like I said.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.970
And the guy who produced
Roxy Music was a guy

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.720
called Chris Thomas.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:44.360
So it was like, let's
get this guy.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.820
He's good.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.160
And then that's what happened.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.710
And this engineer called Bill
Price, they got hold of us.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:54.690
We went in this studio, Wessex
Studio in Islington.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:59.890
We laid down the track,
me and Glen and Paul,

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:00.730
the three of us.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:04.500
I think John might have been
doing a vocal in a booth.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.810
And we put it down about
two or three times.

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:10.110
He goes, OK, got it.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.730
And it was not--

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:12.620
he knew.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.600
He was a producer.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.440
He's done it before.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.460
So what was the question?

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.265
TIM QUIRK: You were telling me
about "Anarchy in the UK," how

00:23:20.265 --> 00:23:22.190
it came together, how
you recorded it.

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:24.770
STEVE JONES: So that's
it, yeah.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:30.170
And then he got me to lay
some tracks down.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:34.360
We put a lot work making Never
Mind the Bollocks.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.860
People think we're a punk band,
we just went in and la,

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.690
la, la, and it's done.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:40.530
No.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:47.610
We probably spent more time
doing that than most un-punk

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.750
bands, proper bands
were doing.

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:54.850
TIM QUIRK: "God Save
the Queen" was

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:56.750
another big one for you.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.250
Give him his water, or whatever
the hell is in there.

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:04.980
STEVE JONES: Oolong ginger
tea is today's special.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.140
TIM QUIRK: "God Save the
Queen," sort of another

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.550
landmark track for you guys.

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:10.950
Was that the second single?

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:11.980
STEVE JONES: Yeah, it was.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:15.560
That's when we was with A&amp;M.
That's when EMI had gotten rid

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.450
of us, and A&amp;M stepped in.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.330
TIM QUIRK: That that's quite a
feat, to put out one album,

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.280
but be signed to three different
labels-- signed and

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.380
dropped by two labels, and
signed to three labels.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.410
How did you manage that?

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:29.420
STEVE JONES: And we was with--

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.520
I think we still are with Warner
Brothers in America.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.010
I don't know.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.600
It wasn't my idea
to get fired.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.480
TIM QUIRK: But something
happened at A&amp;M's offices.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.560
STEVE JONES: Yeah.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.375
TIM QUIRK: What exactly?

00:24:42.375 --> 00:24:44.926
Different stories.

00:24:44.926 --> 00:24:47.170
STEVE JONES: It's
kind of naughty.

00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:48.360
TIM QUIRK: We're adults.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.830
STEVE JONES: Well, it started
at 7:00 in the morning.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:54.980
We did this fake signing
of the contract outside

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.950
Buckingham Palace.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:57.570
And we--

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:58.890
7:00 in the morning--
and we had already

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.360
started with the vodka.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.110
And so we went from there to
some other place in this limo,

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:07.070
and then some other place.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:11.320
We went to the studio to listen
to the finished mix of

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.570
"God Save the Queen." And then
we had a fight, in the

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:15.660
limo, all of us.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.480
We were drunk, hammered, at
3:00 in the afternoon.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.455
And then it was some bright idea
to go to the A&amp;M offices.

00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:30.190
And we went in there, spraying
shit on the walls.

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.440
And I had sex with a girl
in the bathroom.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.800
And one of the employees--

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:39.440
it was just a mess, basically.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.360
And they thought, oh shit.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.650
What have we signed here?

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:44.800
They didn't realize that
it wasn't an act.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.990
It's what these guys do.

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:50.230
It probably wouldn't have
happened like that we hadn't

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.966
been drinking since 7:00
in the morning.

00:25:56.532 --> 00:25:59.850
Shit happens.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.480
TIM QUIRK: So "God Save
the Queen," tell

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.180
me about that song.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.430
How did it come together?

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.930
STEVE JONES: Well, like I said,
John was always in the

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:14.330
corner scribbling lyrics, while
me, Glen, and Paul were

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.600
just thrashing out tunes.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.440
And Glen came down
with this tune,

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.700
sounded like the Beatles.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.330
And then I got hold of the riff,
and changed it to make

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:26.580
sound like the Sex Pistols.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.800
And Paul got a hold if it, and
then we just worked it out.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.400
We worked things out pretty
quickly, funny enough,

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.640
considering, now looking back.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.050
And John went at these words.

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:37.590
And he'd say hang on,
let me try this.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.180
Blah, blah, blah, boom.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.040
Next thing you know,
we got a song.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:48.230
TIM QUIRK: And at the
time, I mean now--

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:49.530
I'm not British, so
I don't know.

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.560
But there doesn't seem to be
quite the same level of

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.130
respect for the royal
family that maybe

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:54.600
there was in the '70s.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.425
So how was it received
when it came out?

00:26:56.425 --> 00:26:58.975
STEVE JONES: Not good by a lot
of people was offended.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:06.940
Plus, it was, coincidentally
again, it was the time for--

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.860
what Jubilee was that one?

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.530
Gold, no.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:12.160
Silver?

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.220
I don't know.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.090
One of them Jubilees.

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:21.450
And it was so offensive
that they couldn't put

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.530
it at number one.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:27.000
They left a blank spot
when it came out.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.120
Or, in fact, some people
put Rod Stewart.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.350
What was the song, Rod
Stewart's song?

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.120
TIM QUIRK: I can't remember
which song.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.030
I just remember it
was Rod Stewart.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.280
STEVE JONES: That's going
to drive me crazy now.

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:37.510
Oh no.

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:38.400
TIM QUIRK: Somebody Google it.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.060
STEVE JONES: Someone
Google it.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.310
We're in the right offices.

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:45.300
Anyway, it will come in a bit.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:51.710
But that showed you how
offensive it was at the time.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:55.490
And people wanted
to beat us up.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:59.230
TIM QUIRK: And you mentioned
that Glen made it sound like

00:27:59.230 --> 00:27:59.620
the Beatles.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:00.300
STEVE JONES: It's "The
First Cut is the

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.400
Deepest," Rod Stewart.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.220
I think that's it.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:03.890
Could be wrong.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:04.720
TIM QUIRK: We'll
get an answer.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.870
STEVE JONES: Sorry.

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.570
TIM QUIRK: So you mentioned
that Glen Matlock made it

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:09.550
sound like the Beatles.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:10.960
And Glen Matlock was
eventually no

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.060
longer in the band.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.110
And Sid joined.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.950
So what happened to Glen?

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:16.115
STEVE JONES: [SIGHS]

00:28:16.115 --> 00:28:17.365
Poor Glen.

00:28:19.722 --> 00:28:20.350
I don't know.

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:24.330
He just wasn't going in the
direction we was going in.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.200
It changed the dynamics a lot.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.130
For the song writing for sure,
and just his bass playing.

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.600
He was a good bass player.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.590
But he just didn't seem to want
to go down the road we

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.620
were going down.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.556
And I think McLaren had a bit
of manipulating in there to

00:28:42.556 --> 00:28:43.700
get him out and get Sid.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.760
Because Sid did look great.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.380
I mean, he was your classic--

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.910
I mean you couldn't
get a better image

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:56.350
guy for the Sex Pistols.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:58.150
Him and John together looked
great together.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:01.840
It was that classic Mick
and Keith look.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.250
Unfortunately, he couldn't
play bass,

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:05.460
which was not his fault.

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.910
But he was a fan.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:11.215
He used to come to a lot of
the shows beforehand.

00:29:11.215 --> 00:29:14.220
And I was a bit--

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:19.100
I wouldn't say I'm sticking bits
of tape on his bass, put

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.300
your finger there, and
then go there.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.250
I didn't want to
be doing that.

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:27.200
I wanted to be concentrating
on my own disabilities at

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.300
playing guitar.

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.060
TIM QUIRK: After Glen left, how
many more songs did you

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:33.310
guys write?

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:43.900
STEVE JONES: "Holidays in the
Sun." "Belsen Was A Gas." I

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:46.420
didn't write that.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.190
I think that was it.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:50.990
TIM QUIRK: "Pretty Vacant" is
another one that I wanted to

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:53.447
touch on, because that's
one of the standouts on

00:29:53.447 --> 00:29:55.180
the album, I think.

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:55.440
STEVE JONES: Yeah.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.420
TIM QUIRK: So tell me how
that one came together.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.270
STEVE JONES: Same way.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:06.680
I think maybe John and Glen
might have done that around

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.200
someone's bedroom.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.040
Because I think it was around
Glen's bedroom.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.620
Because I remember John was
always moaning, like, don't

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.380
ever let me do that again, write
a song with Glen Matlock

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.420
in his house.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.720
It wasn't a good
memory for him.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.210
So I think that was the original
where it started.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:30.420
And then it was brought down to
studio and then it was Sex

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.670
Pistol-ized.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.745
But John wrote all the lyrics.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:43.660
He wrote all the lyrics.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.480
TIM QUIRK: So the record came
out, I think it was 10/28/77.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.180
You guys would be broken up
in three or four months.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.360
So I want to talk a little
bit about the

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.540
aftermath of the album.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:57.885
Specifically, when you guys
came to the States, you

00:30:57.885 --> 00:31:00.720
mentioned this before, I don't
know how intentional it was,

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.720
but apparently Malcolm McLaren
had booked you guys outside of

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.720
the mainstream sort of touring
circuit clubs, where he knew

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.890
you'd have a hostile audience.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.280
I never saw you guys live, but
I did see a couple of films

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.480
that had a lot of footage
of those shows.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.330
It was wild watching it.

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:17.580
Because they weren't
really concerts.

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.190
They were more like
confrontations.

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.090
So tell me what that was like,
going through that.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:26.580
STEVE JONES: It was horrible,
not fun at all.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:31.780
The whole experience, coming
to America, was completely

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:37.140
what we wasn't used to, even if
we were playing in places

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.600
that kind of wanted
to see the band.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:43.000
I loved it when I first
came to America.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.910
But we wasn't doing it--

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:50.240
we got off the plane somewhere,
New York, and then

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.840
we got on the tour bus
and went to Atlantic.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.720
There was like, all the time,
there must have been at least

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.320
50 people following us--

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.910
from the FBI to--

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:06.390
what was that magazine
back then?

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:07.330
TIM QUIRK: Scream?

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:10.222
STEVE JONES: No, it was
all about drugs.

00:32:10.222 --> 00:32:11.194
I don't know.

00:32:11.194 --> 00:32:12.170
AUDIENCE: High Times?

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:15.170
STEVE JONES: High
Times, good job.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:16.420
They'd be following us.

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:25.060
The roadies were like Vietnam
Vets who were crazy.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.690
There was people trying to film
Sid shooting up, which I

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:30.310
think there actually
is footage of that.

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.650
And it was just like--

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:35.120
it was intense.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.900
And there was loads of media who
would follow us the whole

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:42.640
time we were in America.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.765
And it was bizarre.

00:32:46.765 --> 00:32:48.965
Our first show was in Atlanta.

00:32:48.965 --> 00:32:51.280
I remember having the flu.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:58.900
And the one thing that did stick
out was how much better

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:03.590
looking the girls were in
America, and how eager to

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.810
please they was.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:09.620
Unlike in England where there
were all ugly and spotty, and

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.880
think they're doing you
a flavor to have sex.

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:16.640
That's what stuck
out in my mind.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.390
I don't know what stuck out
in the other guys'.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:21.640
TIM QUIRK: How much
actual playing

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.010
happened during the shows?

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:24.870
How may songs could you
even get through?

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:28.710
STEVE JONES: We'd get through
a set, Never Mind the

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:30.090
Bollocks, basically.

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:32.802
Maybe a couple of covers.

00:33:32.802 --> 00:33:35.630
But [SIGHS]

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:36.660
it wasn't fun.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:42.130
Sid wasn't really playing bass
and that kind of deteriorated

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:43.561
through the--

00:33:43.561 --> 00:33:45.740
and how many shows did
we do, like 12?

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.380
TIM QUIRK: Yeah, it was
just a handful.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:49.210
STEVE JONES: And they were
all in dodgy places.

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:51.950
The only one was in San
Francisco that made sense.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:53.800
TIM QUIRK: And then that one
didn't last very long.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.360
And basically Johnny
quit on stage.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.530
What was that like?

00:33:57.530 --> 00:34:00.032
STEVE JONES: I don't think
Johnny quit on stage.

00:34:00.032 --> 00:34:01.941
He didn't want to quit.

00:34:01.941 --> 00:34:05.054
But I wanted to quit,
afterwards.

00:34:05.054 --> 00:34:08.389
TIM QUIRK: Well tell me
about that final show.

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:09.675
What's your recollection
of it?

00:34:09.675 --> 00:34:11.489
STEVE JONES: Well I
was sick again.

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:13.780
I had the flu again.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.250
[LAUGHS]

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:16.670
I don't know why I kept
getting sick.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:18.429
Maybe I was nervous,
I don't know.

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:22.770
But it was a disaster, man.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:26.920
We're playing at, I don't
know, the Winterland.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.159
It's like 5,000 people.

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:30.600
It was actually the biggest
show we ever played.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.639
All the other shows we
did, we were in like

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:34.299
halls, cowboy places.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:42.812
And there was no camaraderie
between the band.

00:34:42.812 --> 00:34:44.639
The crowd thought
it was great.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:46.790
And we were playing like shit.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:48.239
And it made no sense.

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:53.070
And I was just like, I've
had enough of this.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.000
That's me, though.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.360
I run.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.160
That's how I deal with things.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.550
And that's what I did.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:01.390
TIM QUIRK: And where did you
wind up right after that?

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:04.490
STEVE JONES: We ran to Brazil.

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:09.180
We was meant to go there anyway
to film- we were meant

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:12.660
to do some shows there
as the Sex Pistols.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.230
And Ronnie Biggs, the Great
Train Robber, was going to

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.480
open up for us.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.350
So the Pistols ended in San
Francisco, but me and Paul and

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:25.660
Malcolm went to Brazil and
carried on filming The Great

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.880
Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, the
movie we were kind of

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.080
doing at the time.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.970
And I had a great time there.

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:34.110
It was great.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:35.310
Brazil was great.

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:37.110
I loved that place--

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:40.210
bubble butts and cocaine.

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:42.300
TIM QUIRK: And then what
was it like after?

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.850
Sex Pistols split up, and you
continued your music career.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.900
What was it like playing with
other musicians, and having

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:51.680
the professional other bands
after the Sex Pistols?

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.986
STEVE JONES: I wasn't
a happy camper.

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.375
I got involved in drugs a lot.

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:04.530
I was miserable.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:06.110
It might have looked like I was
having a good time, but

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:09.420
really, I was a lost soul.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.950
And I've been sober
now, probably

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:16.370
be 22 years in October.

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:18.940
11 years off cigarettes.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:23.750
I'll be 12 years the next
month off cigarettes.

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.944
And all I do now is eat.

00:36:25.944 --> 00:36:30.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.320
TIM QUIRK: Tell me about
Jonesy's Jukebox.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.580
STEVE JONES: Well there was
two Jonesy's Jukebox.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:40.590
There was one on Indie 103.1
that obviously is defunct,

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:42.670
which I did for five years.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:46.420
It started organically, and it
turned into something that a

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.530
lot of people enjoyed.

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:48.880
I enjoyed it.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.630
It was fun, and then
that ended.

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:57.390
And about a year or so later,
I don't know how long, I got

00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:58.150
where I am now.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:59.445
I'm on KROQ.

00:36:59.445 --> 00:37:00.995
It's called Jonesy's Jukebox.

00:37:00.995 --> 00:37:04.630
It's on Sunday night, from
7:00 to 9:00 PM.

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:05.950
And I've been doing that--

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:08.540
it'll be two years next month.

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:13.530
And basically the gist of it is
I just play new music, with

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:20.040
physically CDs, and try and turn
people on to new bands.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.990
TIM QUIRK: And how do you find
new music that excites you?

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:25.400
STEVE JONES: Well at this
point, from doing it for

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:30.200
almost two years, people
send me a lot of stuff.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.910
I have a few little hipsters who
know what's going on who

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:37.450
send me stuff, new bands.

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:40.900
I enjoy doing it.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:44.630
TIM QUIRK: This year, I'm
curious, what are some new

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:49.880
bands you've heard this year
that you really admire?

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.745
STEVE JONES: Well there's
so many bands.

00:37:52.745 --> 00:37:55.080
Who did I play yesterday?

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:59.270
Ariel Pink's have you
heard of them?

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:01.410
Tame Impala, I like them,

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:03.280
Because they're kind
of original to me.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.440
They're not just copying
what's gone before.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.500
They're kind of--

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.180
you ain't going to find
it in Walmart.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.650
But I still find it interesting,
bands like that.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:15.730
There's a lot of bands, but
there's no movement.

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:18.150
You know what I mean?

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:21.170
Which there should be some
kind of movement.

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:25.110
It should be the Sex Pistols
35 years later.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.390
TIM QUIRK: Speaking of the Sex
Pistols 35 years later, I'm

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:30.290
curious how you feel about the
Sex Pistols being inducted in

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:33.630
the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame?

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:35.370
STEVE JONES: I don't know.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:37.774
I mean, it's kind of
a joke, isn't it?

00:38:37.774 --> 00:38:38.678
TIM QUIRK: Kind of, yeah.

00:38:38.678 --> 00:38:41.910
STEVE JONES: But I've got my
statue still in Cleveland.

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:44.402
I was thinking of getting it
and selling it on Ebay.

00:38:44.402 --> 00:38:46.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.790
TIM QUIRK: I like that idea.

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:47.880
AUDIENCE: If you signed it.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:51.390
STEVE JONES: Or maybe I say, let
me get the others from the

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:54.460
boys, and sell all
four of them.

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:55.310
I don't know.

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:57.110
Yeah.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:57.690
TIM QUIRK: At this point
I'm going to

00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:58.680
open up to the audience.

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:02.160
Anybody have any questions you
want to ask, just wander up to

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.260
the microphone.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.280
And while we wait for someone
to get up the courage to do

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:09.305
that, I'll just ask
you, tell me about

00:39:09.305 --> 00:39:11.070
the Bill Grundy interview.

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:13.950
Kind of a seminal moment in
the Sex Pistols career, a

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:15.350
career filled with
seminal moments.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:23.230
STEVE JONES: Well, if you don't
know who Bill Grundy is,

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:24.720
it was a TV show.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.720
There was two stations at the
time, back in '75, whatever,

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.100
6, 7, I don't know.

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:34.220
And it was at 6 o'clock.

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:34.720
Uh oh.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.080
Someone getting bold?

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:36.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm
getting bold.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.690
STEVE JONES: Go on then,
just get on with it.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:40.750
AUDIENCE: I don't want
to interrupt.

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:41.850
STEVE JONES: Shall I finish
this question?

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:43.840
TIM QUIRK: You can finish
your answer.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.080
STEVE JONES: We were rehearsing
to do the "Anarchy

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:51.630
in the UK" tour and promote
"Anarchy in the UK." EMI sent

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:54.500
a limo down to where
we were rehearsing.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.650
And the guy said, we're going
to the Today Show.

00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:01.520
That was the show that this
guy, Bill Grundy, was on.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:06.540
And we're going to talk about
the tour and the single.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.800
Queen was supposed to do it,
because we were on the same

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.850
label, EMI.

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:12.250
But for some reason
canceled it.

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:14.600
So they quickly got
us in there.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.120
So we get there.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.580
And like I said, there
was two channels.

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:22.570
Everyone used to watch
this show eating

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:25.600
their dinner at 6 o'clock.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.070
They put us in the green room.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:27.940
I went to the fridge.

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:33.100
There was all these bottles of
Blue Nun, a kind of wine.

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.550
So I'm nervous, terrified,
because we're going on TV.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:37.980
So I'm guzzling them.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.380
And then by the time we went on,
this guy obviously had no

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:45.340
interest in talking
about the tour.

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:50.300
He was like the classic
interviewer of that time.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.990
You know when you see the
Beatles being interviewed in

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:55.722
the '60s and '70s, these
interviewers kind of talk down

00:40:55.722 --> 00:40:57.995
to you, like derogatory?

00:40:57.995 --> 00:40:59.780
You know what I mean?

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.280
So you've got all this money?

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.390
It's ridiculous.

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:06.490
So this guy just got what
he was dishing out.

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:08.370
And we didn't go there
like we're going to

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:10.170
swear on this show.

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:17.620
He started making us look
stupid, and then he got what

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:18.870
he deserved.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:24.020
We didn't know the swearing
was going out live.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.710
I thought they had
buttons for that.

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:29.090
Hello, mate.

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:30.340
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.210
I'm kind of curious about how
you decided to learn to play

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:33.720
the guitar.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.230
I mean, you mentioned you went
to go see Roxy Music and that

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.980
inspired you.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.190
So you acquired some musical
instruments.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:42.430
And so I imagine some kid with
some musical instruments.

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:43.520
And now what do you do?

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:45.010
Do you have a friend
that teaches you

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:45.940
how to play a guitar?

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:47.780
Did you go to the library?

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.130
How many hours a day
did you practice?

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:50.530
STEVE JONES: Well that's
a good question.

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:55.720
Because I actually didn't start
playing guitar until

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:59.590
three months before we
did our first show.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:06.010
And how I did that was
through speed.

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:11.300
And these pills called
mandrakes, which

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:12.440
I'm sure no one knows.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.820
But they're like the equivalent
of quaaludes.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:16.720
They're like quaaludes.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.920
Anyway, I used to get
them from this

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.890
quack in Harley Street.

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:22.900
Every deviant used to
go to this doctor.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.450
He was just a quack,
just all right.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:29.120
And it was a diet program.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:33.720
Black beauties, and mandrakes,
like 60 of each.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.400
And so I would be in
Denmark street.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.870
Literally I'd take one in the
morning, and I'd be like this

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:39.600
for 12 hours.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.470
[MIMICKING GUITAR PLAYING]

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:44.260
And playing along to records.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:45.720
And that's how I learned.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.700
I didn't know what
I was doing.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:48.970
AUDIENCE: By ear?

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:51.180
STEVE JONES: Yeah, I'd just play
along to certain records,

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.050
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:54.110
I'd listen to the [? Faces ?].

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:55.087
AUDIENCE: Did you know
about different

00:42:55.087 --> 00:42:55.850
chords and chord changes?

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:58.610
STEVE JONES: No, I kind of knew
a couple of chords from

00:42:58.610 --> 00:43:00.290
the guy Wally.

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:02.480
But I couldn't carry a tune.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.890
It was just one of
them things.

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:06.350
You know, speed's
great for that.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:07.274
You should try it.

00:43:07.274 --> 00:43:08.262
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:08.262 --> 00:43:09.250
AUDIENCE: No comment.

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:13.040
STEVE JONES: I'm sure
I had ADD back then.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.250
But that would make me
focus like crazy.

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:19.740
AUDIENCE: Then did you continue
that intensity

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:21.310
through your whole
Sex Pistols?

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:23.460
Do you still play the guitar?

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.500
STEVE JONES: Do I still
play guitar?

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.915
AUDIENCE: Yeah, do you still
practice intensely?

00:43:26.915 --> 00:43:27.390
STEVE JONES: No.

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:28.536
You're kidding me.

00:43:28.536 --> 00:43:29.786
I couldn't care less.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.080
I got acoustic that I
play now and again.

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:39.170
My thing is to figure out
more chords, Beatle

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:42.960
chords, awkward ones.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.830
That's what I like doing
now, in my old age.

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:48.970
TIM QUIRK: Next.

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:55.440
AUDIENCE: What band did your
favorite cover of "Anarchy?"

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.450
STEVE JONES: Whose version did
I like best, you mean?

00:43:57.450 --> 00:43:58.430
AUDIENCE: Whose version, yeah.

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:00.040
STEVE JONES: Of "Anarchy?"

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.340
AUDIENCE: I mean, besides
your own.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.370
Megadeath?

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:08.930
STEVE JONES: No, I played
on that one as well.

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:11.150
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:12.460
STEVE JONES: I didn't really
like any of them, to

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:13.143
be honest with you.

00:44:13.143 --> 00:44:13.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:15.080
AUDIENCE: OK, that's
a valid answer.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:19.840
TIM QUIRK: Another one.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:22.100
AUDIENCE: When you were still
first starting out, and you

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.610
had all this stolen equipment,
were you ever afraid at a gig

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.120
that someone was going
to be like, hey man,

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:28.150
that's my drum kit.

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:32.400
STEVE JONES: No, I never
thought about it.

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.180
I was naive.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.050
AUDIENCE: Wasn't there some
crazy story about when you

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:40.305
guys were auditioning Johnny in
Malcolm's shop and he was

00:44:40.305 --> 00:44:41.990
fucking around, and fucking
up horribly.

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:44.950
And Malcolm was like, tell him
to cut that shit out, or I'm

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:45.600
going to kill him.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.550
STEVE JONES: No, he
didn't say that.

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:48.370
AUDIENCE: No?

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:49.640
STEVE JONES: I don't know
where you heard that.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:50.250
I was there.

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:50.988
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:53.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:56.900
AUDIENCE: And I think you
narrated a movie about this

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.680
crazy football match in a town,

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.700
where the town is divided.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.090
And there's a ball, and they try
to get the football from

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:05.780
one side of the town
to the other.

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:06.830
STEVE JONES: Where'd
you hear that?

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:08.600
AUDIENCE: A friend of
mine produced it.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.360
STEVE JONES: But they didn't
use my voice in there.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:11.820
Because they recorded
it badly.

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:15.550
And I went back there
to re-record.

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:16.480
Have you seen it?

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.400
AUDIENCE: No.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:22.640
STEVE JONES: It was a mad
thing that started.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.150
It was two towns, and they'd
have this big ball that looked

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:25.830
like a melon.

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:29.190
And the goal was to get
it to this one place.

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:30.000
It wasn't a football.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.150
But you put it--

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:32.760
and they used to beat the
shit out of each other.

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.790
And it was a whole thing.

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:37.390
It was a shame really, because I
really liked the idea of it.

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:39.960
And I did the voice
over for it.

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:43.620
But the guys who recorded it
didn't record it right.

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.210
And they wanted me
to re-record it.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:45.900
And I went down.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:49.460
And they told me they had
to cut the lines they

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.160
wanted me to do.

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.595
And they were bullshitting me.

00:45:52.595 --> 00:45:53.950
And I don't like being
bullshitted.

00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:57.090
And basically they wanted me to
do the whole thing again.

00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:57.860
What are you nodding for?

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.760
You're saying, no,
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.325
And that's my manager,
by the way.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.265
And so, if they would have said
that, I would have done

00:46:08.265 --> 00:46:09.480
it, gladly.

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.210
But they messed it up.

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:12.860
They tried to con me into
doing it, so I didn't

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:13.710
end up doing it.

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:15.860
AUDIENCE: You want me
to talk to them?

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.410
STEVE JONES: No, I think they
used someone else in the end,

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:18.890
because I didn't do it.

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:21.350
I left.

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:22.320
AUDIENCE: Well that's
why I didn't see it.

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.800
Because I found out
it wasn't actually

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.140
you doing the narration.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.240
I protested it.

00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.490
STEVE JONES: Shame.

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:33.034
TIM QUIRK: We got another
question.

00:46:33.034 --> 00:46:35.250
AUDIENCE: I saw you play
in the mid '90s

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:36.480
with Neurotic Outsiders.

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.300
And I thought it was a
really cool project.

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:40.160
I wondered if you could talk
a little about that

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.690
collaboration with the guys from
Guns N' Roses and John

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.230
Taylor from Duran Duran.

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:49.200
STEVE JONES: Yeah that was like
'95, '96 we started up.

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.400
We were doing these shows
at the Viper Room

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:52.640
every Monday night.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:58.100
And it just starting
as a loose thing.

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.940
Me and John Taylor
were friends.

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:02.160
Ralph, I met a few times.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:05.360
And Matt Sorum, the
drummer, we knew.

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:09.220
Actually it was a benefit for
someone, on a Monday night at

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:09.810
the Viper Room.

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:12.100
We continued to do it.

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.670
It turned into this thing.

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:16.720
And then [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:20.260
from [INAUDIBLE], who was
working at Maverick at the

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:24.190
time, signed us, gave
us $1 million.

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:25.300
Can you believe that?

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.525
That would never happen now.

00:47:26.525 --> 00:47:29.280
Give you a million pesos.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:32.230
So we did a record.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:37.500
And unfortunately we weren't
really there to promote it.

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:41.100
I was doing the Sex
Pistols tour.

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:42.080
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:45.540
was getting word that
Guns N' Roses was

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:46.610
getting back together.

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:50.010
And so it kind of all fell
apart, which was a shame.

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:52.825
I think we could have gotten
more mileage out it if we

00:47:52.825 --> 00:47:55.410
would have paid more
attention to it.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:56.380
It's just one of them things.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:01.480
It's a good record produced
by the guy from--

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:05.658
what's his name?

00:48:05.658 --> 00:48:06.972
AUDIENCE: Elton John?

00:48:06.972 --> 00:48:08.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:09.560
STEVE JONES: No, Elton
John plays like this.

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:13.980
What was his name?

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:14.810
AUDIENCE: Billy Joel.

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:16.020
STEVE JONES: No.

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:16.980
He's not a keyboard player.

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:18.760
He was in--

00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:22.820
aww fuck.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.070
AUDIENCE: Ray Charles.

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:28.690
STEVE JONES: No.

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:29.970
Hold on.

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:32.600
This drives me crazy,
this stuff.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.820
Jerry Harrison.

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:35.200
TIM QUIRK: Oh, Talking Heads.

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:35.430
STEVE JONES: Talking Heads.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:37.830
He produced it.

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:39.250
He did play a bit of
keyboard, right?

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:40.500
OK, good.

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:45.730
It was fun project, that.

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:46.810
TIM QUIRK: OK, so
as we finish--

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:47.500
STEVE JONES: Hold on.

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.270
TIM QUIRK: Another question.

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:51.100
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure if I
heard this right or not, but

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:54.220
during the Olympics, they were
playing Sex Pistols.

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:55.510
What do you think about that?

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:58.655
STEVE JONES: Well,
unfortunately, in America you

00:48:58.655 --> 00:49:00.890
didn't get to see it, because
NBC cut it out.

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:02.340
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:02.960
But the crowds were there.

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.030
That's the bottom line.

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:06.120
STEVE JONES: Well everyone
else in the world saw it,

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:09.230
except in America.

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:10.890
TIM QUIRK: I assume it wasn't
"God Save the Queen?"

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:13.810
STEVE JONES: "God Save the
Queen" was in the beginning,

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:16.490
just before the lyrics started,
when it was going

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:17.920
down the river.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:22.480
But in the actual show, there
was a bit where they actually

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:27.880
spent about a minute and a half,
a minute seven, where

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.220
the whole thing stopped and it
started and they use an old

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.440
footage of us.

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.100
And they did a whole number.

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:35.430
I still haven't seen it.

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:37.960
But your question is, what
did I think about it?

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.850
I think it was great.

00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:40.850
AUDIENCE: That's what
I'm thinking.

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:41.680
It's amazing.

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:42.560
Here you are.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.490
This band that came out there,
like you said, made these

00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:47.050
songs, didn't know what
you were really doing.

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:49.780
But just did it with this
inspiration, just energy,

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.820
that's all it's really about--
energy and having a good time.

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:58.330
But then it's like years later,
the social media,

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:00.880
whatever, we never said, hey
these guys, they're rock

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.050
stars, or whatever.

00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:03.930
You were the underdog
for a long time.

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:06.290
But then over the years, because
of the steady fan

00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:08.210
base, and the young kids
listening to what their dads

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:11.072
listen to, and whatnot,
it's just bam.

00:50:11.072 --> 00:50:12.230
Great inspiration.

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:13.310
STEVE JONES: Thank you.

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:18.240
I think that scenario will
probably never happen again.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:22.610
It was only purely through Danny
Boyle, his insight of

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:23.780
the history of England.

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:28.220
Basically that's what the
opening ceremony was about.

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:31.270
I hated listening to it in
America, with these idiots

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:33.110
talking, joking.

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:35.250
They didn't even know what
they were talking about,

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:38.300
whoever the interviewers were.

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:38.990
Do you agree?

00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:40.410
Did you see?

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:42.280
Oh, it was horrible.

00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:42.720
I know.

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.240
Just spoiling it.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.720
TIM QUIRK: So I take it if--

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.440
well, let me ask.

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.540
Mick Jagger got knighted.

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:50.620
If you were offered a
knighthood, would you take it?

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:51.056
STEVE JONES: No.

00:50:51.056 --> 00:50:53.240
TIM QUIRK: All right.

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:54.616
STEVE JONES: I don't think so.

00:50:54.616 --> 00:50:55.840
TIM QUIRK: Ah.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:57.320
There's a chance.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:02.660
STEVE JONES: I couldn't
face myself to

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:03.990
do it, I don't think.

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:07.015
Even if I wanted to in the back
of my mind, Sir Steve

00:51:07.015 --> 00:51:12.730
Jones, I don't think
it would be.

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:14.950
Do you get any benefits
from it?

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:15.410
TIM QUIRK: I know nothing
about it.

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:16.250
STEVE JONES: Health insurance.

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:18.840
TIM QUIRK: Everybody
calls you sir.

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.190
STEVE JONES: I heard that Ben
Kingsley gets upset if you

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:22.420
don't call him sir.

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:23.230
TIM QUIRK: I heard that, too.

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:24.940
I don't know if it's true,
but I heard it.

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:27.237
STEVE JONES: Well I heard it
too, so it must be true.

00:51:27.237 --> 00:51:29.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:30.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
Queen's got a good sense of

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:31.720
humor, though.

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:34.290
STEVE JONES: I thought it was
great that she actually--

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:36.880
I thought it was one of them
look-alike Queens with the

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:42.350
James Bond guy in the
Buckingham Palace.

00:51:42.350 --> 00:51:44.360
I thought that was outrageous.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:46.980
That would never have happened
20 years ago.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:48.060
AUDIENCE: Then they had
that one where she

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:48.900
jumped out of a plane.

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.150
STEVE JONES: Well
that wasn't her.

00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:53.380
TIM QUIRK: All right.

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:56.720
So let's finish up here, with
it's a 35 years ago, around

00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:01.410
about maybe a month from now,
Sex Pistols released this

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:05.990
lean, mean, Never Mind the
Bollocks, changed the world.

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:09.900
And now it's being reissued as
a deluxe box set, four discs,

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:11.460
a whole bunch of
other goodies.

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:14.150
Tell the world why they should
buy the reissue.

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:15.259
STEVE JONES: I don't want
to tell them to

00:52:15.259 --> 00:52:17.730
go out and buy it.

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:20.440
No, I'm kidding.

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:30.610
No it's, like I said, basically
it's one album we

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:34.890
did, which is an achievement
in itself.

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:37.470
We were together for like
three years, right?

00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:38.820
One album.

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:42.320
I think that, in itself, I liked
the fact that that is

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:45.930
it, and not 10 albums.

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:51.100
But this Universal, I think
they're doing a great job.

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:53.540
They've dug up all this
other stuff that I

00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:54.790
didn't even know existed.

00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.130
If you're a fan--

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:01.686
if I'm a fan of something, even
though it's like, oh, but

00:53:01.686 --> 00:53:03.255
I've kind of got it all,
I still want it.

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:07.160
You don't have to buy it.

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.120
No one's forcing
you to buy it.

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.880
There is some funny
stuff on there.

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.940
For me, I don't know if anyone
is going to be interested, but

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.240
it's me and Paul Cook screaming
at each other for

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.640
about minute.

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.290
I thought that was the funniest

00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:24.000
thing I've ever heard.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.450
There's a bunch of outtakes.

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:31.310
If you're into the band,
you'll enjoy it.

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:32.180
And it looks pretty.

00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:36.480
There's a bunch of pictures that
I've never seen before.

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.274
TIM QUIRK: All right, thank
you very much, sir.

00:53:38.274 --> 00:53:38.756
STEVE JONES: Hold on.

00:53:38.756 --> 00:53:41.648
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:41.648 --> 00:53:44.815
STEVE JONES: I'm Jonesy's
Jukebox Twitter and Jonesy's

00:53:44.815 --> 00:53:46.830
Jukebox instagram.

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:49.610
I'm no longer on Facebook.

00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:50.510
Thank you.

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:54.430
[APPLAUSE]
