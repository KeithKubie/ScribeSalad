00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
Beto mentioned that we should provide 
bitmaps at different resolutions.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.700
In our app, the 48dp icon on the Nexus S
looks to be about the same size

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.760
as on the Nexus 4, and on the Nexus 5.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.420
However, in reality, this asset
that's being displayed,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.810
is actually a lot bigger 
in terms of pixels

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.090
compared to this one.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.000
To confirm, we can check out
the app resource folders.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.930
In the drawable folders, we see that
our app has a 48 x 48 pixel launcher icon

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.598
for mdpi devices located
in the drawable mdpi folder.

00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:31.900
To make an equivalent icon,
for the higher density devices,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.420
we need to make that icon 
progressively larger.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.900
To know exactly how big 
to make these images

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.680
and what the dp pixel
conversion should be,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.430
we use an mdpi device as the baseline.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.223
This is where one dp equals one pixel.

00:00:45.223 --> 00:00:49.633
Then on the HDPI device,
one dp equals 1.5 pixels.

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:53.530
And then it increases from there, 
all the way to an XXHDPI device,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.810
where one dp equals four pixels.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.211
For more info on the conversions, 
see the link below.

00:00:58.211 --> 00:01:01.181
Following those rules, these are
the sizes of the launcher icon

00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:02.779
in our drawable folders.

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:06.670
The MDPI one is 48 pixels x 48 pixels.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.000
The one for HDPI is
1.5 times the size of this one.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.510
For an XHDPI device, the icon 
is two times the size of the MDPI one,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.340
And for an XXHDPI device, the icon
is three times the size of this one.
