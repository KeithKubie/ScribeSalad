SHIGERU MIYAGAWA:
Guest lecturers

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.870
are an important part
of "Visualizing Japan,"

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.930
the residential course.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.290
Each time I teach it, I
have Professor John Dower

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.230
guest lecture at least
once, sometimes twice.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.470
So I also invite
Dr. Ellen Sebring,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.320
who is a specialist on
visual culture and history.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.050
And to prepare for
these lecturers,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.490
I ask the guest lecturers
to give me some assignment

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.960
to give the students.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.340
In the case of
Professor John Dower,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.299
he gave me a series of questions
about the MOOC content.

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:48.590
What did they think about this?

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.030
What do they think about this?

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.690
How do they improve the MOOC?

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.200
And the students wrote a
single page single spaced.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.260
And I gave that to Professor
Dower ahead of time.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.250
And he read it.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.250
And I think he spent almost
half the class talking

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.210
about what the students wrote.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.777
These students are very,
very engaged with the class.
