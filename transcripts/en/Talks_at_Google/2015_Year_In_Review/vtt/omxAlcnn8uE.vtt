RADHANATH SWAMI:
[SINGING IN SANSKRIT]

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.220
It is truly an honor and
pleasure to be with all of you

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:53.790
here at the headquarters
of Google this afternoon.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.060
Thank you for giving me
this opportunity to speak.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.700
Throughout the world, your
company, Google-- and of course

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.510
you know better than
me-- is so highly

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:20.510
respected as being one of
the most pleasing places

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.352
to work in.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.160
And how that's possible,
in this age where there's

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.300
so much conflict
and people always

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.160
trying to find something else,
is something very special.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:47.200
And of course what you are
contributing to society

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.310
is literally affecting
practically every person

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.575
on earth's life.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.655
So of course, along
with influence

00:02:57.655 --> 00:02:58.780
comes great responsibility.

00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:05.253
But I congratulate
you and your company

00:03:05.253 --> 00:03:08.355
for what you are contributing.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.840
Today's subject--
conflict resolution.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.240
It can be approached from so
many different perspectives.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.850
And if you're going to invite
a swami to Google, then

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.680
obviously, you're going to
hear a spiritual perspective.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.920
It's one of the most difficult
things in this world today,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.560
to cooperate.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.268
What is the core reason why?

00:03:50.268 --> 00:03:56.760
Why is there conflict
between family members?

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.310
Between people of The same
company, of the same nation?

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.010
Conflict between
different nations?

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.765
Conflicts with people within
the same religion, not

00:04:10.765 --> 00:04:13.435
to speak of other religions?

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.029
Practically the news every
day, it's about conflict.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.090
It's about me and you.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.770
Or us and them.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.660
And from a spiritual
perspective,

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.510
the core root of
that conflict is

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.990
conflict within our own
lives-- a disharmony

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.950
between the body and the mind.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.980
A disharmony with
the mind with itself.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.595
And ultimately a disconnection
between the body and mind,

00:05:02.595 --> 00:05:11.910
the intelligence, and our true
self-- our hearts, our souls.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.710
So much of what we do
is really disconnected

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.622
from our own hearts, what
to speak of our souls.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.840
Because we're so allured
by external conceptions,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:32.620
misconceptions, and
concerns that we

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.220
forgot the larger picture.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.650
Or let us say the
higher principles

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.093
that really life is about.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:54.390
I knew a man who I just
lived two blocks from when

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.682
I was a little boy, and
he was the wealthiest man

00:05:57.682 --> 00:05:58.515
in our neighborhood.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.980
And anyways, I kind of left
home when I was a teenager

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.970
and went to Europe, and
then hitchhiked to India,

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.780
and I never came back.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.720
But I met somebody-- my old
friend Gary-- and he told me

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.490
what happened.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:22.810
This person, before he died,
he gave his entire fortune

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:30.750
to his two sons and he
told them how to spend it.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:37.820
One son bought a beautiful farm,
gigantic property in Oregon,

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.050
and got horses.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.330
Pedigree horses.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.760
He got an airplane.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.870
He got a boat and
really nice cars,

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.230
and got married
and had children.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.950
That was his father's
money, and he invested it

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.150
in ways that accrue.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.580
The other son got involved
with people who influenced him

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.410
in a different way.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.680
And they convinced him,
you can triple your money

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.000
if you just join us.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.470
And he did.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.290
It was a narcotics arrangement.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.830
And he invested in
that, the first time.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.390
And he got caught.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.240
And it was obviously
a large sum.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.390
To this day, he's been
in prison for 35 years.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.620
So they took the same
money and used it

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:43.720
for a different purpose because
of the influence of the people

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.595
that was around them.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:52.480
So we're all very much
affected by our environment.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.470
And we all have choices who
we're going to associate with

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.050
and who we're not going
to associate with.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:04.026
And it's very important in
our lives, on every level,

00:08:04.026 --> 00:08:07.700
that we keep focused
on a higher principle.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.330
Because if we're not focused
on that higher principle,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.330
there are going to be so many
temptations and so many fears,

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.194
they're going to drag us down.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.230
Us and them.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.150
Spiritual platform--
when we're actually

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.100
connected to our
source, to our soul,

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.100
and we understand
our relationship

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.669
with the supreme
source, or with God,

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:41.830
then we see more in terms of we.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.898
The more we empower each other,
the more we're empowered.

00:08:45.898 --> 00:08:49.240
That's a higher vision.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.700
The lower vision is, let
me push other people down

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.775
so I could go up.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.860
Not far from here
is the Muir Woods.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.540
How many of you have been there?

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.840
Please raise your hands.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:09.940
Well, I live in Mumbai, so for
me it's really a distant place.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.920
But every year, I go there and I
take a walk with my dear friend

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.970
and brother, [INAUDIBLE]
and we usually

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.940
try to find a very
secluded area where

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.765
we could just walk sit and
talk among the redwood trees.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.740
One year, as we were
walking, we came

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:37.130
upon a large group of tourists.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.430
And they were talking a
lot, so we want to just

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.540
walk by them really fast.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.925
But as we were walking by,
we heard the forest ranger

00:09:45.925 --> 00:09:49.060
who was in the middle
of that circle.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.260
He said something that
really attracted my mind.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.250
He said, I am going to tell
you the underground secret

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.644
of the redwood forest.

00:10:00.644 --> 00:10:05.910
Now, I was a teenager in
the 1960s, and many of you

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.410
were there and many of
you heard about that era

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:12.070
of American history, and
we were really attracted

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.160
to underground secrets.

00:10:15.885 --> 00:10:19.740
So I said, let's listen.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.370
And he told a story.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:26.780
He said, these trees
are the biggest, tallest

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.530
trees on earth-- the
Sequoia and redwoods.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:38.960
Usually for a tree to grow
and sustain-- some hundred

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.620
of years old, some of them
are over a thousand years

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:47.770
old-- they have to
have really deep roots.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.520
And there's really
no trees in the world

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.246
that have deep enough roots
to support what a redwood is.

00:10:58.764 --> 00:11:02.740
The redwood trees
don't have deep roots.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.590
And they're on
hilly terrain, which

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.890
makes them very vulnerable.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.260
And it's lose soil.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.620
And in this area there have
been devastating earthquakes

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.730
over the thousand years
that they've been standing.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:20.460
There have been massive
blizzards, windstorms.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.490
How do they keep growing?

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:29.230
And then he revealed
underground secret.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:35.090
The roots of the redwood tree
underground, they grow outward.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.300
Why?

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.800
They're specifically
growing, searching

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.570
for the roots of other trees.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:49.100
And as soon as two roots
meet, they embrace.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:55.110
They wrap around each other,
forming a permanent connection.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.120
other.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.940
They support each other.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.990
Practically every
root is connected

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.140
to a root of another
tree all around them.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.745
And in this way, every
tree in the entire forest

00:12:07.745 --> 00:12:11.460
is directly or
indirectly connected,

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.692
supporting every other tree.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.160
The unity is their strength.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.610
And even little tiny redwoods
that are just coming out

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:26.340
of the ground are
very, very vulnerable,

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.310
but the roots of the
giant ancient trees

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:33.250
come and let them
wrap around them

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.700
and give them
their full support.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:44.120
So in this world, we are
subjected to many storms.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.720
Sometimes nice sunny days, also.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.700
And there are
earthquakes in our lives,

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.810
individually, collectively,
on many levels.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:00.480
There's that famous
saying, "United we stand,

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.570
divided we fall."

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.530
This is a beautiful
lesson of nature.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:12.760
Any of our strength cannot
compare to unified strength.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:22.220
Our own human body-- we
have so many more things

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.320
within the body.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.390
Each organ is a different
shape, a different color,

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:32.380
and performs a completely
different function.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.720
The lungs cannot do
what the heart does.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.440
The brain cannot do
what the kidneys do.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.730
The kidneys cannot
do what the knees do.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:49.220
The pancreas cannot do
with the gall bladder does.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.170
So they all have a very,
very special function.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.910
And the stomach.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.172
The stomach is
actually supplying food

00:13:58.172 --> 00:13:59.505
to every other part of the body.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.870
What if the stomach were to say,
you're all depending on me--

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:09.670
it's about me.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.570
I'm going to keep
this food for myself.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.530
I'm getting all these nutrients
and I'm getting all this food

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.310
and everybody wants it,
and everybody needs it,

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.310
but it's mine.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.543
And yours depending
on me and I'm

00:14:24.543 --> 00:14:27.320
going to keep it for myself.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.620
What happens to the stomach?

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:33.390
And what happens all the
other parts of the body?

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:39.250
You see, a healthy human body
is when every part of the body

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:43.590
honors, respects, and
appreciates every other part.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.310
And we recognize,
however big or small,

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.480
whatever color, whatever
shape, whatever function--

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.912
we're all part of a whole.

00:14:51.912 --> 00:14:57.780
A healthy body, every
part is serving the whole.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.010
And in serving
the whole, they're

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:01.225
serving every other part.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:10.910
The health of a stomach is it
serves every part of the body.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.810
The heart doesn't want to
keep the blood for itself.

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.960
The health of the heart
is supplying blood

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.370
to every part of the body.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.170
The health of the
eye is not just

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.020
to try to see-- it's
to give direction

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.320
to every part of the body.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.010
And when any part
of the body is not

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:34.385
in harmony with every
other part, it's disease.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:40.630
It suffers, and
everything else suffers.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.815
The same principle
as the redwood trees.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:51.550
Seva, or service, is
the higher principle.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:02.330
But the ego, which in
Sanskrit is ahamkar,

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.820
is always trying to
deceive us into thinking

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:11.635
it's about me, even at
the expense of others.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:25.390
What is depression, and anxiety,
and incredible suffering

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.285
from stress and all
of these things?

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.060
it's actually the
core of those problems

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.560
on the level of the ego.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.270
Because we're expecting so much,
and we're just not getting it.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.200
But if we do get it, then
the nature of the ego

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:52.384
is to become arrogant and
condescending toward those

00:16:52.384 --> 00:16:53.300
who don't get as much.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:01.810
That ego is the root
of disease of so

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.610
many of the problems
in this world,

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.380
individually and collectively.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.760
But it's so powerful.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.604
How can we actually be
liberated from that?

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:23.450
The beginning is to
recognize that our real unity

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:28.020
and our real prosperity is
based on uniting in a higher

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.020
principle.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.860
And it begins when we
ourselves, individually,

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.395
take the responsibility to
live according to those higher

00:17:36.395 --> 00:17:36.895
principles.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:44.740
In my own life, when
I was eight years old,

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:50.290
my mother told me,
she said, everyone

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:54.820
loves your father and
everyone loves me,

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.250
but we don't love
each other any more.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:00.450
We're going to separate.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.640
Now for an eight-year-old
boy-- and I never heard

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:07.490
of divorces in those days-- it
was just so confusing to me.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.800
My mother and father
don't like each other,

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.630
and they're going to go
different directions?

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:16.090
I felt so disoriented.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:20.010
I felt so bewildered.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.860
I felt such pain in my heart.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.820
I couldn't say a word.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.290
I just sat there and cried.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:35.250
And my mother looked at me and
didn't expect that reaction.

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:39.010
And then I jumped up and I ran
out the door of her bedroom

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.260
and I ran down the stairs
of our little house,

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.770
and I ran out the front door,
and I ran down my driveway,

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.160
and I ran across the street
and I ran across the block

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.410
and I went to a little forest.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.835
And she couldn't find me.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:03.640
When my father came home,
driving in his car--

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.260
at that time, when I
was eight, my father

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:13.850
was the largest car dealer of
a car called the Edsel in all

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.140
of Chicagoland.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.370
And he didn't sell any of them.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.650
It was one of the
biggest disasters

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:22.630
in automobile history.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:23.930
He went bankrupt.

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.820
So he was struggling.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:33.000
When he came home, I
listened with my ear

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.110
at the door of their
bedroom to hear

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.360
what they were going to speak.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:44.200
My mother told my father
how I reacted to what

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.710
they had already decided.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.520
There was complete silence.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.520
And then I heard them both say,
for the sake of our children,

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.975
we are going to make this work.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.960
It wasn't easy for them.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.200
They had serious disagreements.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:14.380
But somehow or other, they
found a higher principle

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.930
and they worked
through those things

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:21.680
that were impeding them
from embracing that higher

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.810
principle.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:27.750
And incredibly,
in a few years, I

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.680
had never seen any two people
love each other as much

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.170
as them.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:38.400
They were completely like
one heart in two bodies.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.060
They really appreciated,
they really supported.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.190
When my mother passed away,
they were married 58 years.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:54.245
Real love is not just a romantic
attraction that comes and goes.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.876
Real love is not
just a compatibility

00:20:59.876 --> 00:21:02.720
that whatever I think
is what you think

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.610
and whatever you think is what I
think, and I expect this of you

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:08.640
and you expect this
of me, and if you

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.790
don't reach my
expectations then there's

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:13.880
something wrong with you.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.950
Real love is based on a serious
commitment of responsibility

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:20.370
to a higher principle.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.634
And then it's not just
a sensual, mental thing.

00:21:22.634 --> 00:21:23.925
It really comes from the heart.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:33.481
They were completely together
on a higher principle.

00:21:33.481 --> 00:21:35.880
And I was just a little
eight-year-old boy,

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.850
and I was watching all this.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:41.230
And you watch things
that affect you.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.710
Things that are
very theoretical,

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.790
you see it and you forget it.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:48.690
But when something
comes to your life, when

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:55.050
it's somewhat traumatic,
you really learn from it.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:57.580
That's just the way human
nature sometimes is.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.985
What was that principle?

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:11.030
It was like a foundation
to my own spiritual life.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.910
I want to find that
higher principle.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:19.990
Because as I grew
up, I was working

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:28.380
with people who were of
African American descent

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.730
while in high school,
and I saw how much they

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.710
were discriminated against.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:39.670
They didn't have a
chance to really succeed

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:44.390
in the United States of
America in the 1950s and '60s.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:48.360
Probably 95% really
didn't have that chance.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.990
Constitutionally they
did, but socially, no.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.730
So that same principle I
learned from my parents example

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:04.302
that there is a
higher principle.

00:23:04.302 --> 00:23:05.760
I joined the Civil
Rights movement.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:17.110
And I joined the counterculture
because the Vietnam War just

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.690
didn't make sense.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:22.670
It didn't seem like a war
based on real ideals or values.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.650
It seemed like a
war that was just

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.580
due to a lack of communication
between the two countries.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.410
That's the way it
seemed to all of us.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:35.197
It was either based on business
or lack of communication.

00:23:35.197 --> 00:23:36.280
Is there really a purpose?

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:40.905
We didn't understand
if there was.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:48.280
So those so many conflicts.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.780
And that's when I
heard Gandhi say

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:55.240
you have to be the change
you want to see in the world.

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.800
And I understood if
I want to actually

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.430
be a part of the solution
rather than part of the problem,

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:03.060
I have to change myself.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:11.840
And in my own, life it
put on a spiritual journey

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:17.990
to really find
harmony with myself.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.440
The principle of yoga--
or for that matter,

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:30.340
according to literal definition,
religion, also-- is to reunite.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.950
To bind back.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:40.970
To create harmony between
our actions and our words,

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:42.700
with our hearts.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.310
With our souls.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:50.550
To harmonize the body, the
mind, with the living force.

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:54.060
And what is that living force?

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:57.720
In the Bible it is said,
what profitteth a person

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:04.080
if they gain the whole world but
they lose their immortal soul?

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.180
That's a universal principle.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.900
In the Bhagavad Gita there's a
very, very profound definition

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.389
of that soul.

00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:12.180
[SPEAKING SANSKRIT]

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.292
The soul is never born.

00:25:18.292 --> 00:25:19.325
It never dies.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:28.500
The soul by nature is
eternal, full of knowledge,

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.710
and full of joy.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:34.410
And what is that joy?

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:36.670
It's the joy of love.

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:40.390
To love and to be loved.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:47.882
And true love--
[SPEAKING SANSKRIT] --true love

00:25:47.882 --> 00:25:48.840
is [SPEAKING SANSKRIT].

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.690
It's not selfish.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.800
It's not arrogant.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.990
It's based on true care.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:06.130
And when you water
the root of the tree,

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.940
naturally that water extends
to every part of the tree--

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.260
the leaves, the
flowers, and the twigs.

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.680
So when we harmonize our
actions and our words,

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:23.520
our bodies and our minds, with
our own true self, the soul,

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.700
then naturally
from that point we

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:30.060
harmonize the soul
with the supreme soul,

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.830
or with God-- in my
tradition we call Krishna.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:36.800
There are many names.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:43.670
And when we harmonize ourselves
with the supreme source,

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:45.990
then like watering
the root of the tree,

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:48.095
we're harmonized with
everything and everyone.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:57.470
There's a lot of environmental
problems in the world today.

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:00.100
And some people who've
really studied it carefully

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.943
say it's a severe crisis.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:10.310
But it's not an
environmental crisis.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:14.040
It's a crisis in human spirit.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.920
When we're disconnected
from ourself,

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.220
when we're disconnected
from God, what happens?

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.970
We become disconnected
with other people.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:24.630
And we start seeing
the differences.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:31.790
And because of arrogance,
we're full of fear.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:34.400
Were full of the
desire to exploit.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:42.420
We have an obsessive need feel
ourselves superior to others.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.730
Why?

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:49.580
That obsessive need to feel I
am better than other people is

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.560
because inside we're hollow.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.045
We're shallow.

00:27:54.045 --> 00:27:55.530
We're in poverty.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.360
When I met Mother Theresa in
1971, she told that to me.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.910
That the biggest
problem the world

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.710
is hunger not if the belly.

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:13.270
Give some food,
you can help that.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:16.000
The heart.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.920
She said, in my
travels, whether I'm

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.910
with the richest people
in London or New York

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:25.660
or Los Angeles or San
Francisco, or whether I'm

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.400
with poor little
villagers, people

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.542
have a hunger of the heart.

00:28:31.542 --> 00:28:33.250
There's only one thing
they could satisfy

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.360
the hunger of the heart.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.505
To love and to be loved.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.270
And when we're disconnected
from that love, we're hungry.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:50.190
And then we need so
much intoxication.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.110
We need so much sex life.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:54.990
We need so much various
forms of entertainment.

00:28:54.990 --> 00:29:02.350
We need so much ways of just
forgetting that hollowness

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:03.350
that's within our heart.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.370
But when we actually
discover who we are

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:14.530
and what we really
have, then we understand

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:16.630
through our business,
through our occupation,

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.920
through our
relationships, we're not

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.935
trying to grab something
to fill the void.

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.930
We have so much pleasure within.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:33.250
Our greatest joy is to share it.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:34.820
To share it through our wealth.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.620
To share it through
our intelligence.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:39.100
To share it through
whatever influence

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:40.350
we have in this world.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:42.080
To share it with our loved ones.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:48.160
And ultimately, we see all
beings as our loved ones.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.610
And we recognize that we
have a harmonious connection

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:55.280
with the environment as well.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.870
If we're connected
to ourselves, then we

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:04.320
won't be thinking
in terms of greed.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:10.280
Exploiting the environment
means endangering

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.760
every living being
on this planet

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.790
in a small way or a big way.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:21.580
For me, that's not something
that a thoughtful, connected

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.910
person wants.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:27.060
Because if we care about others,
we care about the environment.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.300
We care about them.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.080
Whether a person
is black or white

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.840
or red or yellow or
brown, or whether a person

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.300
is rich or poor, or
eastern or western,

00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.590
or from one religion
or another religion,

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:45.190
or whether one is an elephant
or a cow or a dog or a cat.

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:48.100
Wherever there's life,
there's a sacred part of God.

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.620
And when we're connected
to our own self,

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:54.370
we feel the connection
of every living thing.

00:30:58.082 --> 00:30:59.540
The Gita tells
[SPEAKING SANSKRIT].

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:11.320
This means that true
wisdom, true knowledge,

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:16.640
is not just about how much
data we store in our brain.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:20.910
It's about being able
to see every living

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:25.330
being according to our inner
spiritual connection with them,

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:29.810
and therefore seeing
life as sacred.

00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:34.940
And seeing the equality,
like the different parts

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:40.780
of the body, seeing themselves
in relation to the whole body,

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.779
not seeing themselves
separated from that.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:50.940
And the Bible tells
the same thing.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.280
It's the first and
great commandment,

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.590
to love God with all your
heart, all your mind, all

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:58.460
your strength, all your soul.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:07.810
And what is the natural
consequence of such love?

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:11.200
That you love your
neighbor as yourself.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.430
Everyone's our neighbor.

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:19.590
The trees, the air,
all the different kinds

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:20.940
of people and animals.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.040
Everyone is our neighbor.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:30.190
That disconnect is what makes
us instruments of conflict

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:33.660
ourselves, and so
vulnerable to falling

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.980
into the influence of
the conflicts that's

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.880
all over the place, and just
getting swept up, sucked in,

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.490
and just being a part of it.

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.400
When it is said, stand out
from among men and be separate,

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:55.180
it doesn't just mean becoming
a monk and leaving society.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:58.090
It also means living
right within society.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:01.730
But being in the world
but not of the world.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.040
In other words, with
that strong connection,

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:08.410
with that foundation, with
our roots actually connected

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:11.020
to ourself and
connected to each other,

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:16.460
we learn that there is
no greater choice in life

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.850
than to live with
integrity and compassion.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:26.540
That, to a cultured person,
integrity and compassion

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:27.060
is wealth.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:35.060
The numbers in a bank account,
the amount of property

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:43.896
that are in our name, the amount
of nations we conquer-- that's

00:33:43.896 --> 00:33:44.395
not wealth.

00:33:50.054 --> 00:33:52.220
Because it doesn't bring
any happiness to the heart.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.940
Things could give some
pleasure to the body and mind,

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.105
but cannot touch the heart.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.010
Only love can touch the heart.

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:10.780
It is said that we should
love people and use

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.800
things to express our love.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:19.560
Where does conflict come in?

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.239
When we love things
and use people

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:26.699
to get them and keep them.

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:29.260
And things means prestige.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.480
Things means power.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:35.310
Things means wealth of
all these different gross

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:36.685
and subtle material forms.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:44.469
But what children
need to understand

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:50.840
is real wealthy is in our
integrity and our compassion.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:55.820
Because those are principles
that are based on love.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.958
Higher principles.

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:05.640
And when we make that
connection ourselves,

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:10.380
and when like-minded people
who are striving for that

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:17.030
embrace their roots with each
other through our affections,

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.420
then wonderful things
can happen in this world.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.850
No one should ever
think that I'm

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:27.280
too small to make a huge
difference in the world.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.830
Because the energy
of even one good deed

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:38.370
affects the entire planet
beyond what we can perceive.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:50.490
There's a saying, you can tell
how rich you are by counting

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:55.470
how many things you have
that money cannot buy.

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:58.370
Now that doesn't
mean money is bad.

00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:03.330
Money is really good
if good people have it.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:06.215
But money is really bad
if bad people have it.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:15.030
Similarly, power and fame.

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:19.030
If it's used with
compassion and integrity,

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:23.870
it can bring so much benefit
to ourselves and to others.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:25.860
And that's where real joy is.

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:34.220
In our tradition, we
chant God's names.

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:38.080
We offer our
prayers in this way,

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.930
to be an instrument of
grace in whatever we do.

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:52.840
I know one person in
Mumbai-- he and his family

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.990
were among the largest
industrialist business

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:59.050
families in India.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.580
And because of
change of policies,

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:05.530
because the government sometimes
changes policies that devastate

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:08.170
entire industries--
trading policies,

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:12.230
taxing policies,
labor policies--

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:15.290
that practically all
the people on his level

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:18.520
completely shut down.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.510
And so many of them
were committing

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:26.100
suicide or depressed.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.500
And he was coming to
our ashram every day,

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.530
and smiling and
dancing and singing.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:38.580
And while he was struggling
like anything to work everything

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:44.120
out, all the lawsuits
and all tax issues

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:48.450
and all of the liquidations
that are necessary-- I mean,

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:49.514
it was incredible.

00:37:49.514 --> 00:37:51.180
It was practically
all on his shoulders.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.790
It was a huge
international corporation

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:56.130
he was trying to save.

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.530
So much pressure.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:02.045
But while was doing it-- in
everything there's a risk.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.880
He was helping feed
thousands and thousands

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.410
of people in the ghettos.

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:11.580
He was helping widows
and supporting them

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.300
for their whole lives.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.560
He was helping the
monks, and somehow

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.880
or other empowering
them so that they

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:24.060
could go out and actually spread
beautiful, spiritual knowledge

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:24.640
to the world.

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:33.560
And I didn't know he
was doing any of it.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:40.410
One day our accountant, he
came and said, you don't know

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:42.670
and nobody knows all
the wonderful things

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:44.790
he's doing to so many
people, because he doesn't

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:46.740
want to get any credit for it.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:51.150
And he gave me a list of how
many thousands and thousands

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:56.620
of people he was actually
sustaining their lives

00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:00.755
and infusing them with so much
spiritual inspiration as well.

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.360
And he made it through.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.920
His companies,
they were changed,

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.215
but now they're very strong.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:17.720
So what does it
mean to be detached?

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.100
It doesn't mean to just
walk away from things.

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:26.080
I asked him, how do you remain
so sweet and so kind and so

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:27.950
charitable, even when
you're struggling

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:29.590
more than practically
anybody else

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:35.864
could imagine, in the world
of politics and business

00:39:35.864 --> 00:39:36.905
and everything, in labor?

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:43.350
He said, I'm just so grateful.

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:46.930
I'm so grateful that
I have God's names.

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:50.490
And I'm so grateful that
I have so many people who

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:54.820
encourage me and inspire me.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.480
He's totally humble.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.270
If you're grateful,
you're humble.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:03.080
You can't be grateful
and arrogant.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.270
They're contradictory.

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:06.870
If you're arrogant,
you can't really

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:08.130
be grateful for what you have.

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:09.554
You think you deserve it.

00:40:09.554 --> 00:40:10.970
And when you think
you deserve it,

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:15.200
you're not really
grateful for it.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.910
But people who have really
worked and achieved,

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:21.060
if they have this
higher conscious,

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:24.470
they're grateful
because they know--

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:29.930
just like when the stomach
provides really good nutrients

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:33.170
to the rest of the
body, the stomach isn't

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:38.280
saying you should surrender to
me to every part of the body.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.270
The stomach understands
without all of you,

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:42.145
I can't do anything.

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:47.890
And ultimately, without the
grace of God, what can we do?

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:57.330
So conflict resolution
really has its deepest

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:07.720
and most sustainable
expression when

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:10.910
individually and
collectively we help

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:14.530
each other to really connect.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:18.910
And give some time every day
to make that interconnection

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:22.080
through the people we're
with, through our spiritual

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:30.920
practices, and to the integrity
and character in which we live.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.160
These are some of my thoughts.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.790
Thank you very much.

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:42.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:45.290
Would anyone like to
ask any questions?

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:49.600
How was the experience
starting a hospital in Mumbai?

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.720
It was a wonderful experience.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:55.450
What happened?

00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:57.585
It's the same redwood principle.

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:08.260
I was giving talks like this in
the colleges and universities

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:09.050
of Mumbai.

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:10.610
I was invited.

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:14.350
And many of them were
medical colleges.

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:17.610
So many young people who
are in medical college,

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:21.820
they really wanted
to dedicate what

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:24.650
they do for that
higher principle-- it's

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:29.230
called bhakti-- of loving
service to the Supreme,

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:35.270
to God, who we call
Krishna, and to humanity,

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:37.500
who are all children of God.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:41.940
So they really believed in
that, and ultimately they

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:44.900
were all
undergraduates, and then

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.510
they graduated from
medical school,

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:50.310
and then they went on
to become specialists

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:52.040
and super-specialists.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:55.260
And after some time, within
our little congregation,

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.520
we had gynecologists,
and ENT specialists,

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.760
and cancer surgeons,
and orthopedic surgeons,

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:05.060
and radiologists, and
general practitioners,

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:08.740
and we had pathologists
and everyone else.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:11.450
And we had ayurvedic doctors,
and homeopathic doctors,

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:12.700
and naturopathic doctors.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.700
They all went to
different schools

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:18.190
and they all had their
different practices.

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:21.780
And one day we just--
I don't have any money.

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.600
I don't have anything.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.060
But I'm like a
little cheerleader

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:31.000
who likes to encourage the
people who are doing stuff.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:33.180
I said, why don't we just
start our own hospital

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:36.010
and we'll all work together?

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:38.500
So everyone was really enthused.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.390
And because within
our congregation,

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:43.750
people in business and
industry and everything

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:47.520
like that, they were really
inspired by the idea,

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.760
so they helped-- they
provided the funds,

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.640
and we built a hospital.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:56.080
And then we had all
our doctors and all

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.690
of our nurses and
other people who

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:04.650
wanted to be a part of this, a
spiritually oriented hospital.

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:09.910
There was a family that
had a chain of vegetarian

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:11.750
restaurants.

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:16.070
And the father left the
restaurants to his children,

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:21.500
and he said, let me run all the
cooking for the canteen and all

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.060
the patients of hospital.

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:26.220
So he took charge the kitchen.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:30.190
And although they're getting
paid and everything like that,

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:32.530
but that's not really
why they're doing it.

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:34.910
That's a detail.

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:36.640
They're really doing
it because they just

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:42.070
love to work together
for a higher principle.

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:44.740
And it's actually
quite beautiful.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:46.374
Medicine is a lot like religion.

00:44:46.374 --> 00:44:47.665
There's a lot a fundamentalism.

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:53.750
If you talk to some
ayurvedic doctors-- not all,

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:58.040
but the really extreme
ones-- allopathic medicine

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.540
is like a nuclear poison.

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.270
It's destroying the world.

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:10.030
And there's certain really
extreme allopathic doctors

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:12.930
who consider ayurvedic
to just be witchcraft

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:17.550
and superstition and
misleading people.

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:21.070
And naturopath and ayurveda,
they have so many differences,

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:23.305
and homeopath-- everybody
has so many differences.

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:30.340
But in my non-medical
experience,

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.220
I've seen that every
single one of them

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.450
heals people in their own ways.

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:36.200
So why not work together?

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.300
So we have all the main
branches of allopathy,

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:44.030
plus we have a wing with
ayurveda, homeopathy,

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:47.300
naturopathy, acupuncture.

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.795
And everyone works together, and
it's actually quite incredible.

00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.610
And we have a spiritual
care department

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:04.280
because, just like
recently, our devotees

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:10.340
is from this hospital went to
Nepal after the earthquake.

00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:15.360
And they were telling me after,
they were helping people.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.160
The people had broken
arms and broken necks

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.030
and our surgeons were fixing
them and putting casts on them

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:23.690
and giving them
whatever they required.

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:33.140
But the thing that the
people appreciated the most

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:37.860
was not just fixing their limbs.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:42.120
Because almost all of them,
they lost family members.

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.030
They lost their homes.

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:46.570
They lost their businesses.

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:50.340
Emotionally, they
were destitute.

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.910
You fix their arm, you don't
make their life all that much

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:54.410
better.

00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:02.950
It was the spiritual care--
giving them the encouragement,

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:05.530
giving them hope, helping
them with their lives

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:10.470
in the spirit of compassion--
that they really appreciated,

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:13.590
more than anything.

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:18.010
When people are sick, when
people are dying-- and a third

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:21.570
of the patients
of the hospitals,

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:30.595
almost half actually, are
Muslims, Christians, Parsis,

00:47:30.595 --> 00:47:41.640
Sikhs, Jains, sometimes Jews,
and about half are Hindus.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:47.930
And the spiritual care,
everyone is equally enlivened,

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:51.610
because it's based on universal
spiritual principles that

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:55.890
uplift the heart, uplift
the souls, and give us hope.

00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:59.530
Even if we have to die
to understand and connect

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:01.800
to who we really are
and who we really--

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:05.390
our real connections with each
other beyond birth and death.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:13.260
So it started real
small, and now it's

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:17.470
doing a lot of
wonderful service.

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:21.910
And the more they actually
reach out to help,

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:25.140
for the pleasure of
Krishna, the more

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:27.820
they really reach out
to help the society,

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:32.490
the happier and more
enthusiastic they are.

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:34.360
I'll give one example.

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:38.470
We have a cataract eye camp in
a place called Barsana, which

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:42.860
is a holy place where Sri
Radha and Krishna lived

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:45.300
5,000 years ago.

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:50.320
And so many pilgrims go there
from all over the world.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.240
But outside of
Barsana, that there

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.550
are villages that
are so poor, people

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:57.300
have never gone to
school in their life.

00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:01.160
They've never seen a
dentist in their life.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.220
And if they don't
get a free surgery,

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:06.780
they're going to go
blind from cataracts.

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.910
So we do about a
thousand surgeries

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:13.090
in the span of about two
weeks when we go there.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:16.140
And we treat about
three thousand.

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:19.410
And one volunteer
doctor, who wasn't even

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:22.350
part of Bhaktivedanta
Hospital, he's

00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:25.470
just quite a
materialistic personality,

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:29.530
but he just was convinced to go.

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:33.840
And he left his very
luxurious home in Bombay

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.390
because doctors can make a lot.

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:41.070
And Barsana, there's no
luxurious facilities.

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:47.200
People are living in tents,
and it's cold, and it's muddy,

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:52.360
and it's really
primitive, actually.

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:55.000
And he was living
in those conditions.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.470
And he was doing
surgeries because he just

00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:59.640
felt, let me do something.

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:08.970
And there was one old
lady, she was about 90,

00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:12.430
and she was going blind in
both eyes with cataracts.

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:14.860
And he operated on her.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.590
This lady was so poor.

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:20.120
She was just dressed in rags.

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.795
She had nothing materially.

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:27.260
She had a lot of love for God.

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.110
For Radha.

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:32.640
When he took the
bandage off of her eyes,

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.240
and it was the
first time she could

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:42.760
see clearly in the years--
very uneducated lady,

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:47.530
and very, what to
say, unsophisticated--

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:49.490
she was so happy.

00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:53.010
With her hand, as hard as she,
could she started slapping

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:57.970
the doctor, this wealthy
doctor from Bombay--

00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:01.430
she started slapping
him on top of the head.

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:04.215
And she said, I bless you
my child, I bless you.

00:51:04.215 --> 00:51:05.640
I bless you.

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.150
I can see again.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:08.340
I can see from Krishna.

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:09.010
I bless you.

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:10.530
I bless you, I bless you.

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:13.740
May Radha shower
her mercy on you.

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:15.990
And she was saying like
that, and she was crying,

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:18.090
and joy and blessing him.

00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:25.760
And some of our people saw
she was really hitting him.

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:28.110
He started crying.

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:30.740
He said, I've never
experienced such

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:36.720
a deep, meaningful
experience in my life.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.390
I did something for this lady.

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:43.950
And that was about
eight years ago.

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:46.230
Every year he comes and
brings his whole family.

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:53.200
And it's a loss, because in
the two weeks that he comes,

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.620
that means two weeks he's
not making money in Mumbai.

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:02.910
And his children, during
their school vacation,

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:06.860
he brings them there
to just help do

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:08.760
seva for these poor people.

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.270
Because he wants to share
this wealth with them too.

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:15.890
What is wealth?

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:19.820
Wealth is what really
improves the quality

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:21.020
and the love of our lives.

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:28.780
And in whatever profession
we're in, that's the principle.

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:32.760
And our Bhaktivedanta Hospital,
in our spiritual care,

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.950
we try to help people
understand that.

00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:40.010
Because when they do,
they could actually

00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:41.950
process whatever
difficulties they're

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:49.140
going in with gratitude
rather than bewilderment.

00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:53.200
With affection
rather than anger.

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.970
Because they're connected
to God and each other.

00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:02.930
I hope that answers
your question.

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:06.200
Is there any other questions?

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.446
Yes, please.

00:53:07.446 --> 00:53:08.814
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:34.050
RADHANATH SWAMI: Well, there's
different kinds of meditation.

00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:36.720
You could chant God's
names while you're

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.920
running the marathon, and
that's also meditation.

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.490
Actually, I'm not
a marathon runner

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:51.450
but I walk sometimes fast,
and that's a meditation too.

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:55.800
We chant this Maha Mantra,
so with inhalation I

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.720
just remember a name of
God, and with exhalation I

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:02.336
remember the mantra.

00:54:02.336 --> 00:54:04.680
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna.

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.280
And that's actually meditation.

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:11.860
And it's actually as deep and
as effect a the meditation as

00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:14.590
sitting like this, because
it's not whether you're

00:54:14.590 --> 00:54:15.610
doing this or running.

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:19.410
It's a matter of how
you're connecting

00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:20.505
and how you're absorbing.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.140
So by chanting your beautiful
mantra when you're sitting,

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:29.640
that's beautiful.

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:34.300
But even when you're running,
or even when you're walking,

00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:37.090
or even when you're sitting .

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:43.030
So there's different ways and
they'll have the same result

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.895
if we're sincere.

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:52.160
But that connection, if
we value that connection,

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:55.820
is something very important.

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:58.240
The body, the mind,
the soul, and God,

00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:03.180
when we value that
connection and really want

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:07.470
to be an instrument of grace,
then we're really connected.

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:13.910
I'm truly grateful to
each and every one of you

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:19.430
for being here today and
allowing me to be here.

00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:21.140
Thank you very much.

00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:24.790
