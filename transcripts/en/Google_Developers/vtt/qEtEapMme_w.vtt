00:00:07.984 --> 00:00:10.440
JEREMY: Welcome to YouTube
Developers Live.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.480
I'm here with VidIQ.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.370
My name's Jeremy.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.600
And we have Rob and Todd.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.750
ROB: Thanks for having us.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.350
JEREMY: Great.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.440
Well let's jump right into it.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.900
Tell us a little bit about the
history of your company.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.480
ROB: Great.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.030
So we started about
a year ago.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.420
But really this idea originated
and this passion

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.400
six, seven years ago when Todd
and I were working on Viddler,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.380
our first startup, which was
providing a white-label video

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.320
hosting solution
to businesses.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.270
And what we found after working
with thousands of

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.400
companies was--

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.010
the common question was,
why aren't you

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.400
providing a YouTube solution?

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.540
Why isn't there a focus on
YouTube with your white-label

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.170
video product.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.900
And with that, we made the
decision let's go all in on

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.440
YouTube and help these
companies, these businesses

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.440
maximize their presence on
YouTube to get more views,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.725
more subscribers, waste less
time on managing all that and

00:01:02.725 --> 00:01:04.870
providing an efficient product
for them, so they could focus

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.580
on their production.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.270
JEREMY: Sounds like the idea
kind of came from some

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.980
experience with your past
startup, and you just saw the

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.065
trend, and you decided
to ride it.

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:14.960
ROB: That's correct.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.580
And we moved from the East coast
to San Francisco here,

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.010
went through IO Ventures and we
were successful in closing

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.990
a seed on Mark Cuban, Scott
Banister, and a number of

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.130
other prolific investors
here in the Bay Area.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.362
And it's been a fun
ride so far.

00:01:30.362 --> 00:01:30.720
JEREMY: Awesome.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.450
So tell me a little bit
more about what's

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.080
the main goal then?

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.830
ROB: So we say we work
with brands.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.810
Brands might be content
creators.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:49.310
It might be networks, the
MCNs, brands in general.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.872
JEREMY: MCNs are multi-network
channels, for anybody that

00:01:51.872 --> 00:01:53.291
doesn't know.

00:01:53.291 --> 00:01:55.250
ROB: They're growing, right?

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.570
You go to L.A, and it's all
that anyone talks about.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.560
And so we really provide a
product that helps them focus

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.080
on their audience
development--

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.979
more views, more subscribers
and again more time being

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.030
focused on their content
rather than the land of

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.450
YouTube and Facebook and Twitter
and maximizing your

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.570
audience that we provide a
suite of tools that helps

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.720
streamline all of that.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.540
JEREMY: Great.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.180
So less time worrying about
finding the audience and more

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.116
about making great content.

00:02:25.116 --> 00:02:25.522
ROB: Correct.

00:02:25.522 --> 00:02:27.480
JEREMY: So let's jump
right into it.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.215
I know our audience loves
to see demos, so let's

00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:32.036
go right into that.

00:02:32.036 --> 00:02:36.520
ROB: So I don't know if we can
pull up my screen here in this

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.770
framework Chromebook,
by the way.

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:42.980
JEREMY: OK.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.440
Go ahead.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.870
ROB: Are we live?

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.230
JEREMY: Yeah.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.500
ROB: So what we're seeing
here is Revision3

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.260
has a dashboard now.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.850
We did get permission from Jim
Louderback in Revision3.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:53.470
Thanks Jim.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.530
We appreciate that.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.850
And we're here showing stats
that we're grabbing from--

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.370
I know you can't see this
--stats from their YouTube

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.500
channels in the heads-up
fashion.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.180
So this is not only the
YouTube data, the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.700
subscriptions, the comments
and whatnot.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.810
But we're also grabbing
Facebook data.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.680
How many shares and likes
and comments are

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.970
occurring on Facebook.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.600
How many tweets around these
YouTube URLs are occurring.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.970
And so we will give you relative
data on how those

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.510
things are all performing in
relation to each other.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.200
We do that holistically, from
a heads-up dashboard.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.620
So you can compare here, for the
audience that's watching,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.780
how may be my YouTube watch
times comparing against the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.296
tweets on the individual
video.

00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:43.530
JEREMY: That's great.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.390
So like you're using
our analytics API.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.875
And one of our main use cases to
use that is to combine with

00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:52.830
other data and make
sense out of it.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.700
So you guys are bringing in all
of the social channels and

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.980
bringing that together.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.460
ROB: And I think that this
wouldn't be possible without

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.000
the V3 API.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.280
TODD: Yeah.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.650
We found that v3 API, you get
a lot faster for real time.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.510
So this is actually a proxy call
to YouTube to grab this

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.850
graph in real time and plot it
against the data we have

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.384
internally about tweets and
Facebook data, shares,

00:04:20.384 --> 00:04:22.320
comments, and likes.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.940
JEREMY: Great.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.150
Sorry.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.305
Didn't mean to interrupt.

00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:27.380
ROB: No.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.980
Love it.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.920
What we're viewing here
is kind of how we

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.420
view individual videos.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.270
Are we just looking at a
holistic view on the channel?

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.510
Now we're looking at
individual videos.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.160
And we're grabbing, again, more
than just the YouTube

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.990
data-- that's the tweets,
it's the Facebook likes.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.600
And one of the things that's
helping discoverability is we

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.310
built this tag recommender
that you can run on your

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.660
individual videos.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.680
So if you wanted--

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.320
I have 10 different tags.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.520
I'm looking for 15
more, or 10 more.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.610
Todd's been doing some fantastic
data work on trying

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.700
to find a relational,
high-volume, relatively low

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.510
competitive tags or search
terms that we

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.300
could optimize against.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.450
So again, with this notion that
most of your videos are

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.250
discovered in related
videos in search.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.750
Where is the YouTube SEO company
that's helping these

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.330
brands maximize their
presence on YouTube.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.260
And that's kind of a
big void that we're

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.190
helping fill right now.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.330
JEREMY: Great.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.460
TODD: And so to make it easy,
you can just select from this

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.926
list and add really quickly
whatever it recommends.

00:05:35.926 --> 00:05:40.270
ROB: So we also, just for basic
asset management, we

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.080
have an ability to upload from
the URL or from the browser.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.080
So if you have something in
Dropbox, you can quickly share

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.460
a Dropbox link, send it
to a YouTube channel.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.170
That way you're not downloading
it from Dropbox

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.570
and re-sending it to YouTube.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.222
You can just send it directly
to YouTube.

00:05:55.222 --> 00:05:56.578
JEREMY: You kind of just take
care of that on the back end.

00:05:56.578 --> 00:05:57.940
ROB: On the back end.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:58.410
Yeah.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.470
JEREMY: Great.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.830
ROB: Again, another thing
using the API--

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.490
what I'm walking into here is
our mass description editor.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.690
This is something that
you can create.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.480
You guys have fantastic mass
editing tools on the

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.890
description side.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.780
But if you want to treat it
like a campaign and get

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.420
click-through rates and views
and number of clicks on those,

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.750
and quickly turned it on and
off, we help manage that,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.430
which isn't an easy task.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.380
But we help do that.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.400
So if you wanted to quickly
share a link that goes out

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.155
against all of your channels--

00:06:35.155 --> 00:06:37.370
and we really encourage
people to promote

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.220
their latest videos.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.800
Like, send traffic to YouTube.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.680
Don't send them away from
YouTube on their description,

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.920
because that's only going
to hurt your watch time.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.920
As we both know, watch time is
absolutely critical right now

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.500
with YouTube.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.980
JEREMY: Yeah, we as we like to
view that as one of our main

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.230
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:57.756 --> 00:06:59.650
ROB: And so you can
drive traffic with

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.920
the click of a button.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.230
JEREMY: And so you guys would
run across all videos, pull

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.740
descriptions and add the links
and all of them, so they can

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.230
just do it in one [INAUDIBLE]
and push it

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.840
out to all of them.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.230
ROB: Yes.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.990
JEREMY: Great.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:11.300
ROB: Yeah.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.260
That wasn't--

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.600
how easy was that one?

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.390
TODD: Little tricky.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.260
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.600
TODD: It's cool to see
it run though.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.130
You've got a bunch of servers,
so it doesn't parallel.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:27.770
It's called a "watch it run."

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.690
ROB: One of the key things that
we discus a lot of around

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:36.100
the YouTube API is managing our
quota, and how do we queue

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.590
the calls that we have, whether
they be urgent calls,

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.690
or low priority calls?

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.350
How do we create a system that
works well on YouTube.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:45.330
And that's not an easy task.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.800
But it's something I think you
have to think about, for all

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.850
the developers out there,
when you're

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:50.640
building on top of YouTube.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.410
It's something that, when you
start dealing with thousands

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.312
of channels like we are, you
run into those issues.

00:07:57.312 --> 00:07:59.690
JEREMY: Yeah, you might need
to optimize to make sure

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.910
you're not killing your
quota right away.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.160
And we actually have a blog
post article on that.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.092
So any of you that are
interested, check that out.

00:08:07.092 --> 00:08:10.151
But definitely, that's a great
thing to point out, to think

00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:13.371
about that when you
start designing.

00:08:13.371 --> 00:08:17.300
ROB: And you guys have been
fantastic in directing us to

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.380
help solve those problems.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.110
We're very appreciative.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.590
We have a fan page app
that takes your

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.450
YouTube videos to Facebook.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.510
It's more Facebook
in that context.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.180
So we'll just move forward
to influencers.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.820
We will expose the top
influencers on your channel.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.950
People that are engaging with
your videos, whether that be

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.280
on YouTube or on Twitter.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.700
And we encourage content
creators to reach out to these

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:49.020
types of influencers, whether it
be a cross-promotional type

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.520
of deal where you're getting
them to host you on their

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.340
show, or bring you
on their show.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.470
There's a lot of reasons why
you might want to further

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.880
engage with these, whether
it's just sending them a

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.210
subscribe or a simple note,
saying thanks for watching us.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.240
But the data around
this is actually--

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.740
and the algorithm that we came
to come up with this leader

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.526
board of top influencers is
actually quite interesting.

00:09:09.526 --> 00:09:11.850
I don't know if you want to--

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.552
TODD: Yeah sure.

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:15.180
We're using subscriber data
and how long they're on

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.230
YouTube, and then just various
metrics about the profile that

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.930
we download, and to score any
one's that commented or

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.070
tweeted about your channel.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.050
So we can compile the ones we
think are the most interesting

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:27.730
for you to contact.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.335
JEREMY: Great.

00:09:30.335 --> 00:09:33.830
ROB: I'm stepping into
the Twitter portion.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:38.240
What we'll do is go and look
at all of the YouTube URLs

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:44.690
that are being shared on Twitter
and, in a list format,

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:46.400
share with you the
tweets coming in.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.980
We'll give you the Klout Score
about the Twitter user.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.740
We'll give you the YouTube URL
and the YouTube title that's

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.450
being exposed on Twitter.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.850
So what we built is
this capacity to

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.110
sort by Klout Scores.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.310
So you can say hey, if Tony
Robbins tweets out one of my

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.080
YouTube URLs, that you should
probably know about that.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.740
And if you're just using
HootSuite or one of these

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.700
other Twitter solutions, you
might not be looking for all

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.720
of thousands of your
YouTube URLs.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.860
You might just be looking for
@Revision3 or @YouTube.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.465
You're not looking for the
specific YouTube URL.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:27.680
And Revision3--

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.890
I'm sorting by Klout, and
Revision3 tweets from YouTube

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.920
as some of their most
influential people that are

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.020
tweeting about them.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.950
TODD: We found, I think it was
like 90% of [INAUDIBLE] rough

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.850
statistically, 90% of tweets
about your videos don't

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:43.610
mention your brand.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.390
It's just a YouTube link that
has a video URL in it.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.360
So this surfaces a ton
of conversations

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.265
that you're not seeing.

00:10:51.265 --> 00:10:53.665
JEREMY: Oh great.

00:10:53.665 --> 00:10:56.460
ROB: Now that's light on--
we're just grabbing the

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.220
YouTube URLs or from the
API on that side.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.540
But in the same kind of notion,
we're bringing YouTube

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:02.250
comments forth.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.160
So if you want to manage all
of your comments on a

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.310
real-time basis, in one heads-up
dashboard, we're

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.560
providing an interface
to go and do that.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.010
We'll expose subscriber data.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.840
If you want to narrow down all
the comments from that

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.090
individual user, you can
go ahead and do that.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:25.990
And in the same way you can
sort by reputation.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.180
Who are the top subscribers, who
has the most subscribers

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.050
that's commenting on
my YouTube videos.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.230
And let me go and address
that audience.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.340
Because they're much
more influential.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:41.780
They're much more worth
talking to.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.740
JEREMY: Yeah, that
makes sense.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.970
That totally makes sense.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.150
ROB: Again, this whole notion
of saving time.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.250
Like, don't waste time managing
hundreds of thousands

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.685
of comments when you can narrow
that down to just 50 of

00:11:51.685 --> 00:11:53.590
the most relevant.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.090
Especially for the bigger
creators on YouTube,

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:57.540
this is a big deal.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.970
TODD: It's a proven way
to get views too.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.380
Like we noticed videos that have
at least one comment from

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.060
you in them from the channel
owner have, I think it's like

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.730
three times, four times,
more views.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.380
So engaging that audience,
especially to the people that

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.036
are influential, is going to be
better than buying views or

00:12:14.036 --> 00:12:15.450
any of these crazy strategies
people are using

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.520
to grow their audience.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.790
JEREMY: That's an interesting
insight.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.545
This is great.

00:12:21.545 --> 00:12:23.470
ROB: And you can reply
from any of your

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:24.290
off-channels, right.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.130
So if you have five different
YouTube accounts, and you want

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.720
to reply from maybe your
personal one and not your

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.705
corporate one, you can do so
very cleanly in this UI, as

00:12:35.705 --> 00:12:37.060
you can see.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:37.850
JEREMY: Great.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:38.860
ROB: And it's real time.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.960
So we just added that, I think,
two or three weeks ago.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.200
So this was actually a pretty
big API challenge, just

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.730
getting this interface to act
real-time when someone's

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.780
logged in actively
on the dashboard.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.940
TODD: As you load the comments
page, it's going across all

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.150
your videos and looking
for new comments.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.690
You can see here, it's like a
bubble that's telling you

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.425
there's one more there that it
found across all your videos.

00:13:01.425 --> 00:13:02.210
JEREMY: Great.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.450
ROB: It's like in Twitter
search, it says like, hey,

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.190
five more tweets.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.080
Hit this to refresh.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.650
Kind of that same UI.

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:12.080
And it's just a time saver.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.240
If you're getting notified via
email via your tweets or your

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.450
comments, and then
you're going back

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:18.830
and forth, it's just--

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:20.250
meanwhile you can just
keep this up.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.740
Hey, I got five more comments
I gotta manage.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.110
I got 100 more comments
I gotta manage.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.190
Bam, click it.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.670
I'm in there.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:26.430
Do I gotta respond?

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.360
Do I gotta delete any of them?

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.790
Moderate and move on.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:31.690
JEREMY: That's great.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.660
That kind of gives them
a place to centralize

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:34.505
everything.

00:13:34.505 --> 00:13:34.860
ROB: Yeah.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.790
JEREMY: So just a
quick question.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:39.230
So what are you guys using on
the back end, what language?

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.870
TODD: That's Ruby on Rails.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.640
JEREMY: Ruby on Rails.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.680
TODD: We've got some JavaScript

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.705
that in Python, too.

00:13:43.705 --> 00:13:45.230
But primarily the back
end is Ruby.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.100
JEREMY: OK great.

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:50.025
And now you guys, I know for
sure you're using the

00:13:50.025 --> 00:13:52.400
analytics API again,
the new one.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.980
And you guys helped
us out a lot.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:58.560
You were early trusted testers
for that, which was great.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.140
The data API obviously, because
you guys are doing

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.200
some of the comment stuff and
some of the uploads and some

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.880
of the management of YouTube.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.010
And the player API, I'm
guessing as well?

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:11.185
TODD: I think that for just the
Facebook, which I don't

00:14:11.185 --> 00:14:13.030
know if you've showed
that yet.

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.720
We're just using a chromeless
API for that.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.010
JEREMY: Great.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:23.770
And so when you were starting
implementing them, did you run

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:27.600
into-- so it sounds like
obviously you guys used so

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.320
much data, and you have quite
a few clients, so you were

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.210
hitting your quota limit.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.670
So you had to plan
out for that.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.240
Did you guys run into
any other things

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.810
that surprised you?

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.400
ROB: So we left private
beta two, three

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.730
months ago, end of February.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:46.710
And we offer now a free product
that anyone can use,

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.390
just get a little bit
of a taste of what

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:50.260
they can do with VidIQ.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:55.460
And we had to prepare for
that influx of demand.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:15:01.390
And Todd, you can hint on the
level of sophistication.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:02.520
TODD: We had to get some--

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.090
you guys hooked us up
with more quota.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.650
That was super helpful.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.870
That was actually a huge
challenge in this was building

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.680
something that could ingest
YouTube data this fast and

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.900
accurately.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.330
We were surprised by the
complexity of the quota system

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.730
and how it's kind of
unpredictable.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:20.300
Some calls cost more
than others.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.820
And it seems like certain
times of day--

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.910
it seems like, it's kind
of like a black

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.330
box, the quota system.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:30.880
And we got good at it just
by trial and error.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.760
And so now we can prioritize
a certain-- like if a user

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.960
on-boards, as soon as they
[INAUDIBLE] we download all

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.670
this data about them
really quickly.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.990
We prioritize that over
our background

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:42.300
jobs and other things.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.000
So yeah, I mean, we
figured it out.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.970
I think it would've been less
surprising if we could predict

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.670
we can do this many
calls per day.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.115
It got a little better in v3.

00:15:55.115 --> 00:15:59.450
You guys have an easier-to-use
quota system.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:00.945
But even then, there's
like some things

00:16:00.945 --> 00:16:02.290
that cost 4x and 3x.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.110
And it's kind of still
not totally clear.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:08.860
Like, how many customers can I
take on and have live today.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.132
It's a hard question
to answer.

00:16:11.132 --> 00:16:12.870
I was kind of all
over the place.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:13.150
JEREMY: Yeah.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:14.800
No, that makes sense.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.710
We do provide some
information.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.100
I think for you guys, you're
probably looking more at like

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.030
almost a data warehouse, where
you want all the information

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.730
all the time, like
on a daily basis.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:29.840
And I've talked to you guys
about this, but we're building

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.870
a schedule reports feature, so
that you can schedule reports

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.160
and then pick them up on a daily
basis which wont' have

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.030
quite the quota impact on you.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:43.770
So that, the analytics API,
which is more like a dashboard

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.330
and bring information in, you
can use it for more real-time

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.790
information, where the
scheduled report--

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.210
you can pull all that data
information in and not worry

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.643
about the impact on your
quota as much.

00:16:54.643 --> 00:16:55.630
TODD: That could
be interesting.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.350
ROB: We talk with a lot of
creators and brands.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.400
And they want to know the
data immediately.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.560
They upload that video, they
want to see the views, they

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.180
want to see the comments,
they want--

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.750
like, especially with
that one, it's like

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.290
one video at a time.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.060
Like, I want to live
and breathe

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.280
that while it's occurring.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.740
And if the data is two days old
or a day old, or it's a

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.480
CSV export at night, it can be
challenging to serve that user

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.200
in a meaningful way.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.589
Now there's a lot of data
out there that we

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:24.310
can go out and get.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:25.800
But the more the better.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.184
JEREMY: Yeah, that's what we
hear-- the more the better.

00:17:28.184 --> 00:17:29.000
ROB: Push.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.160
Push data too.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.740
TODD: That's the
big one for us.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.600
There's a question later, but
getting push notifications.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.880
You have pubsubhubbub
on certain fees,

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.810
but not all of them.

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:41.860
And something that would be
awesome is, you're just

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.940
getting that across all videos
or even like a Twitter

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.990
streaming API kind of a thing,
where we can get just updates

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:51.300
and listen to a socket and find
out this many comments in

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.230
or five more views came in.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.540
It would be awesome to
be able to show that,

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.350
real-time, to users.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.180
I remember a prior show,
Jeff mentioned that.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.140
He's like, yeah, push
notifications.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:08.310
JEREMY: I mean, for Push we're
working on some things we

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.430
can't quite talk about yet.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:10.730
But we are doing that.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:14.460
And we are aware that people
do want like this fire hose

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.870
feed, or whatever you
want to call it.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.380
So we are aware of that.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.610
Yeah, the Push notifications
we hear a bit.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:23.620
Great.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:24.895
Is there anything else
you wanted to--

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:27.555
ROB: We have one last thing
where it's a mess.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.680
SEO optimizer.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.230
So we'll go and analyze
all of your videos.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:37.590
And again this is where looking
at a lot of data helps

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:42.260
and understand what might be the
most impactful tags to add

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.230
on a specific channel.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.330
And so we'll weight, like,
by score [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.930
And the one we're looking
at here is Wine Library.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.220
Wines from Egypt should
be tagged with Egypt.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.685
And we're just analyzing the
incoming search, analyzing the

00:18:55.685 --> 00:18:58.400
tags, analyzing the titles,
seeing where there might be

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.220
room for optimization across
all their videos.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.110
So I think this is one of our
more valuable features.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.570
This is why we get a
lot of customers.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:11.720
Because we're one of the few
guys really focused on search

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.600
and related videos.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.618
And this definitely, we've
found, provided organic life.

00:19:17.618 --> 00:19:22.500
JEREMY: Well, I really
appreciate you guys coming in.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.980
Anything you'd like to add?

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.660
I mean it sounds like you'd like
to add for new developers

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.770
that are thinking of using
any of these APIs?

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.800
It sounds like definitely plan
with quota in mind, to

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.760
optimize around that.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.195
Anything else?

00:19:35.195 --> 00:19:38.735
TODD: So when we first built
this, we built it in v2, the

00:19:38.735 --> 00:19:42.430
v2 API, just because
v3 didn't exist.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:45.200
And if I was doing it today,
I would do it in v3.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.086
I would use the analytics
API and v3 data API.

00:19:49.086 --> 00:19:52.372
And probably start thinking
about quota early.

00:19:52.372 --> 00:19:55.126
It's hard to wrap your
head around.

00:19:55.126 --> 00:19:56.280
JEREMY: Great.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.350
Yeah, anybody out
there, use v3.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:59.640
That's our new version.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.790
We're definitely pushing that.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.140
It's built on a whole
new stack.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.170
So all the new features
are coming into that.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.110
So we do have some
questions open.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.720
And we have one for you guys.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.725
Do you guys actually
have an API?

00:20:12.725 --> 00:20:14.040
TODD: Yeah.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.790
We do.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.012
This whole app is like a--

00:20:19.012 --> 00:20:22.440
it has a JavaScript API
that runs in the--

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:26.530
the entire JavaScript app
runs with an AJAX API.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:27.630
So we have one.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.870
It's not exposed in
documentation or anything.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:35.040
I think if there was use-case,
or if someone wanted to talk

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.870
to us, we could easily get
them on board with API

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:40.540
instructions.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.300
So it exists, but it's
just not documented.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.560
ROB: We do have two clients.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.190
So we're working with a few
clients right now on this

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:50.970
front as well.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:54.860
If anyone's interested,
API@VidIQ.com is where we've

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.620
been directing people.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.400
And what will we provide?

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:04.940
I think some of the stuff
is very SEO specific.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.630
So I think some of the
SEO has been like--

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.570
how do I get this data into my
CMS has been the question that

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:11.845
we've gotten a lot.

00:21:11.845 --> 00:21:14.002
JEREMY: So definitely check
with you guys on that.

00:21:14.002 --> 00:21:14.926
ROB: Yeah, we're open.

00:21:14.926 --> 00:21:15.730
JEREMY: Great.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.740
Well, I think that
wraps it up.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.280
We always like to plug
we are hiring at

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.350
YouTube, Developers here.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.850
So if you're interested,
definitely let us know.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:29.590
A big thanks to you guys for
coming today and for being

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:34.780
trusted testers and giving us
feedback on the new APIs.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.050
And anything you'd
like to add.

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:41.500
ROB: Just thanks, by the way,
trusting us with the API and

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.870
the data that customers
are authing with us.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:48.590
That's a big privilege that
we don't take lightly.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.830
And I think a lot of
the app developers

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:51.680
out there don't either.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.071
TODD: Thanks for building
the new APIs.

00:21:55.071 --> 00:21:57.940
A huge step in modernizing
YouTube APIs in v3.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:58.800
We're very happy about that.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.990
So congratulations on
that milestone.

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.640
JEREMY: Yeah.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.700
Thank you.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.280
We definitely want everyone
to move to those.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.270
So if you haven't checked them
out, definitely check out the

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.640
new versions.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.900
And thanks for joining
us today.
