00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:32.369
While it may come as a surprise to many, it
turns out the whole, “If anyone can show

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.141
just cause why this couple cannot lawfully
be joined together in matrimony, let them

00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:43.199
speak now or forever hold their peace” is
actually a required part of the ceremony among

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.539
certain church groups unless special dispensation
is made in those cases.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.399
So what happens if someone actually objects
and where did this part of the ceremony come

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.399
from?

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.430
As for the first question, in modern times
in the vast majority of cases, nothing would

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.699
come of an objection here, though there are
exceptions.

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.770
For an example of where nothing is likely
to occur, if someone were to object on the

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.980
grounds of their undying love for one of those
being wed or because they didn’t think a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.180
given person was suitable for the other, in
all likelihood the ceremony would proceed

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.290
without the person officiating the wedding
even acknowledging the objection.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.060
You see, a key part of that question is “why
this couple cannot lawfully be joined…”

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.770
Thus, if someone were to object, say, on the
grounds that they had knowledge that one of

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.439
those being married was already married, or
perhaps the couple were too closely related,

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.130
one of them was being forced into it against
their will, some form of serious, fraudulent

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.960
misrepresentation by one of the betrothed
was occurring, etc., then the minister in

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.930
question would be required to stop the wedding
right there and investigate the claim.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.180
Of course in modern times, this is highly
unlikely to ever occur even where some version

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.590
of this question is required because of the
process in acquiring a marriage license in

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.310
many countries and the extensive data officially
kept on people.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.689
Thus, the various ways in which someone could
object in a way the officiator of the wedding

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.820
might have to look into, should that be a
requirement in a given church, are already

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.930
sorted out before the ceremony itself ever
takes place.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.270
This all brings us around to where the whole
“speak now or forever hold your peace”

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.670
came from in the first place.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.020
As for the exact phraseology, this was popularized
in the Christians’ Book of Common Prayers

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.060
in the marriage liturgy section, with the
original version of this work popping up in

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.051
the 16th century with many versions created
since, including most notably the 1662 version

00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:29.820
which is the basis for most today.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.490
This work also helped popularize such other
common phrases as “Till death us do part”,

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.640
“Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to
dust,” and “Peace in our time.”

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.430
As to the ultimate origin of this idea, it
came about thanks to a few changes to marriage

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.650
law within the Catholic church in and around
the 12th century.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.650
Essentially biblical scholars of the day were
attempting to figure out how to properly define

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.160
what a marriage really was, when it started
exactly, and what was required to make it

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.160
happen.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.340
Many of these changes were made to try to
make it easier for people to wed, which was

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.500
deemed a good thing to keep people from sexual
sin.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.720
This all culminated in Pope Alexander III
decreeing that two people were married when

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.040
they both declared such to one another in
the present tense.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.290
If done in private, this created a clandestine
marriage.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.820
The problem, of course, was this allowed people
who the church would not normally deem legally

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.490
able to marry given church rules to get married
anyway.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.030
This also allowed some unscrupulous individuals
to take advantage of, say, a buxom young lass

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.810
by declaring his marriage to her privately
and then deny he ever did so the morning after,

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.200
or a variety of other similar situations.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.740
These were problems that needed solved, leading
to the 1215 Fourth Lateran Council which,

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.050
among other things, decreed

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.000
[W]e absolutely forbid clandestine marriages;
and we forbid also that a priest presume to

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.190
witness such.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.550
Wherefore, extending to other localities generally
the particular custom that prevails in some,

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.310
we decree that when marriages are to be contracted
they must be announced publicly in the churches

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.090
by the priests during a suitable and fixed
time, so that if legitimate impediments exist,

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.660
they may be made known.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.570
Thus, the reading of banns (simply meaning
“proclamations”) was born, initially among

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.860
Catholics and later spreading to certain other
Christian groups.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.240
For three consecutive weeks during the Sunday
services the proposed marriage was announced

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.269
and it was asked that anyone in the community
come forward if they knew of some good reason

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.680
why the two people should not be allowed to
marry.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.230
This would also be asked one final time whenever
the actual wedding ceremony itself took place.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.230
As for valid reasons that would be considered,
this included the aforementioned things like

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.500
if one person was being coerced or already
married, not old enough to marry (though if

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.780
the parents themselves didn’t object on
this point, it could be overlooked), etc.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.500
It’s also important to note here that just
because no one spoke up did not mean the church

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.660
might not annul the wedding after the fact
if some new information came to light.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.370
It was just a way to try to lower the odds
of something like that happening by polling

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.300
the general public before hand.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.820
While the banns and the question being posed
during an actual wedding has long since stopped

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.260
being a thing among many church groups (or
at least optional), particularly as civil

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.400
laws governing marriages and pre-screening
have more and more come to take precedent,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.760
they are still a requirement in a select few
church groups anyway.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.441
For example, with the Church of England, the
banns are still usually required, though this

00:05:14.441 --> 00:05:18.760
requirement can be potentially worked around
in various ways, such as, with the right set

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.270
of circumstances, the Common License procedure
or a Superintendent Registrar’s Certificate.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.010
If the marriage ultimately takes place without
the banns, the local bishop may in that case

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.030
also simply require some penance by the couple
to cease the marriage being considered illicit

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.360
in the eyes of the church.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.770
Not just for objections, however, the banns
also provide time slots for a church congregation

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.220
to pray for the couple and function as an
official announcement of the intention to

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.000
marry, which is in part why they are still
kept around in some church groups and generally

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.650
seen as a good thing, despite the somewhat
antiquated part about checking for any reason

00:05:51.650 --> 00:07:27.410
the couple should not be allowed

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.120
to marry.
