David you asked a very interesting
question because we live in the

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:05.990
question because we live in the
 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.230
question because we live in the
so-called digital age everything is

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240
so-called digital age everything is

word of the day however as you pointed

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650
word of the day however as you pointed
 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.640
word of the day however as you pointed
out analog has actually more information

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650
out analog has actually more information
 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.820
out analog has actually more information
you lose information by going from

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830
you lose information by going from
 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.850
you lose information by going from
analog to digital so then the obvious

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860
analog to digital so then the obvious
 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.880
analog to digital so then the obvious
question is why bother if you lose

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890
question is why bother if you lose
 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.099
question is why bother if you lose
information going from analog to digital

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109
information going from analog to digital
 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.380
information going from analog to digital
then why bother to make this

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390
then why bother to make this
 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.099
then why bother to make this
multibillion-dollar conversion all our

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109
multibillion-dollar conversion all our
 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:38.500
multibillion-dollar conversion all our

why well here's how it works an analog

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780
why well here's how it works an analog
 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.989
why well here's how it works an analog
signal is nothing but a squiggle with

digital only breaks things up into zeros

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739
digital only breaks things up into zeros
 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.789
digital only breaks things up into zeros
and 1 and nothing in between so if I

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:57.799
and 1 and nothing in between so if I
 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.939
and 1 and nothing in between so if I
take a curve like this and then break it

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949
take a curve like this and then break it
 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.459
take a curve like this and then break it
up into zeros and ones obviously I lose

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469
up into zeros and ones obviously I lose
 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.280
up into zeros and ones obviously I lose
information in the process so what do I

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290
information in the process so what do I
 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.980
information in the process so what do I
gain I've got to gain something back and

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990
gain I've got to gain something back and
 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.090
gain I've got to gain something back and
what I gain is enormous because once

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100
what I gain is enormous because once
 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.860
what I gain is enormous because once
everything is risu is reduced as zeros

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870
everything is risu is reduced as zeros
 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.670
everything is risu is reduced as zeros
and 1 zeros and ones it means I can copy

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680
and 1 zeros and ones it means I can copy
 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.240
and 1 zeros and ones it means I can copy

paper and I try to trace it out and then
 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.660
paper and I try to trace it out and then
if you make a copy of a copy you lose

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670
if you make a copy of a copy you lose
 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.940
if you make a copy of a copy you lose
more information for example take a

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950
more information for example take a
 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.970
more information for example take a
Xerox and make a Xerox of a Xerox and

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980
Xerox and make a Xerox of a Xerox and
 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.370
Xerox and make a Xerox of a Xerox and
then make a Xerox of a Xerox of a cervix

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380
then make a Xerox of a Xerox of a cervix
 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.250
then make a Xerox of a Xerox of a cervix
after a while the paper becomes almost

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260
after a while the paper becomes almost
 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.130
after a while the paper becomes almost
white because each time you throw out

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140
white because each time you throw out
 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.649
white because each time you throw out
something you lose information but now

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659
something you lose information but now
 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.860

you get zero in one make a billion

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710
you get zero in one make a billion
 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.360
you get zero in one make a billion
copies and you still get 0 &amp; 1 not only

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370
copies and you still get 0 &amp; 1 not only
 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.469
copies and you still get 0 &amp; 1 not only
that you can also massage the signal you

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479
that you can also massage the signal you
 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.859
that you can also massage the signal you
can play with it accentuate things bring

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869
