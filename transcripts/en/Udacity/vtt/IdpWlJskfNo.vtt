00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.930
So let's dig deeper into, how the agent may do the processing using this

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.050
primitive action. So, consider the sentence John pushed the cart. The AI

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.530
agent beings left to right, because we're talking about English language here.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.980
He first word here John is not a verb. So, the AI agent for

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.470
the time being, puts this in a list of concepts. And

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.400
ignores it it comes to the second word in the sentence. Which is pushed,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.700
there's a word here, pushed, and now the AI agent uses this particular verb,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.650
push, as a probe into it's longterm memory. So now, the frame for

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.330
propel is going to get pulled out, let's see what the frame would look like. So,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.750
here is the frame for propel that has been pulled out of the longterm memory?

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.330
And this frame tells us that we can expect an agent.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.540
We can expect an object. And indeed, although we are not shown here, this frame

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.030
may have additional slots and perhaps additional things can be expected. Now for

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.160
each of the slots, there is a rule budding in here. A rule which tells us,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.910
how can we pull out from a sentence, the entity that goes under the slot?

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.340
The filler that must go here. So here's a rule that says that.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.700
If there is a concept just before the word, and that concept is animate,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.790
then, whatever that concept is, put it here. Well, there is a concept just

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.880
before push, that's John, and let's suppose we have a lexicon which tells us if

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.550
John is animate, then we put John here. Similarly there is a rule here for

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.230
this slot, which tells the agent that if there is a object,

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.440
there is a concept that comes after this verb. And that particular

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.600
concept refers to an object that is inanimate. Then, take that particular thing,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.540
and put it here, and that's the cart. And so, we put cart here. So this way,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.380
this particular scheme, helps us derive the meaning of, John pushed the cart.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.890
And notice that the processing is a combination of bottom up and

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.270
top down, as we discussed earlier. It begins, bottom up.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.670
Because we are looking at the data. Right now we don't have knowledge. But,

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.970
as soon as some data is processed, it pulls in knowledge from memory. And

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.800
soon the processing becomes top down, this frame helps to general expectations.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.920
And help pull things out. This is almost acting, like a hook for

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.830
a fish. So once you have the hook, then you can capture the fish well. There

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.780
are several things to be noted here. First representations like this. First,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.770
representations like this, are called structure knowledge representations.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.050
There's not only a representation here, but, there is a strong structure to it.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.720
Earlier when we were discussing predicates and logic, or we discussing rules and

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.210
antecedents and consequence of rules. They are like the atoms of

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.196
knowledge representation. They don't have much structure. But by now,

00:02:38.196 --> 00:02:41.380
we have this molecule of forms knowledge representation. And

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.960
which a large number of atoms are getting connected with each other.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.000
And this connections are important, because once you have that structure of

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.740
the molecule it tells you what can go in the place of each atom. Second, this

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.820
is a simple sentence, and so the processing was quite simple. The sentences need

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.580
not always be as simple as this one. What happened to the sentence had the word,

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.800
push in it? And I picked a frame, that is not the right frame for it.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.620
Suppose I had pulled out a frame for move object is shown as propel here. Well,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.610
one possibility is, that if you were to select a different frame for making

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.240
sense of this particular sentence, there's a high I try to fill the slot for

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.660
this particular frame, I will find a lot of difficulty. In which case,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.740
I might abandon the frame and try a different one. The second possibility is,

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.680
that I may even force the interpretation of this into the slots for

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.130
the other frame. But, if there is a study here which contains large number of

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.840
sentences then, soon I'll realize this is not the right frame,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.010
I may abandon it and pick different frame. So for complex sentences,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.510
this processing is not as linear as we have pretended it to be right here.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.650
It is also possible, that sometimes one of the words en-map into two frames

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.955
equally well. Indeed, this is the basis of many of the [UNKNOWN] we encounter.

00:03:58.955 --> 00:04:03.620
So consider, I was wondering why the ball was becoming bigger. Then it hit me.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.080
Now, you of course understand the word hit there, that particular word,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.220
maps into two different interpretations, and that's why it is interesting and

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.500
funny. So here's another one. Two men walk to the bar to,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.490
the third one ducks. Now here the word, the bar is overloaded. So here,

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.770
walked into the bar, is getting interpreted two different ways.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.430
Indeed, people have tried to build accounts of humor, based on the kinds of

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.830
story interpretation that we are doing here. Could it be, that this is beginning

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.416
of a theory of humor. Of how you can tell stories not only to your machines?
