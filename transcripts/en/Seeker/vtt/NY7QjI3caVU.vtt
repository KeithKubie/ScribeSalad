00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.320
Cannabis is such a chemically complex and
controversial little plant.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.810
It has all sorts of social and historical
connotations that basically revolve around

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.880
getting high.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.980
But marijuana doesn’t have to get you high.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.870
There is a compound in weed that has documented
benefits for medical patients, without the

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.619
stoned feeling -- CBD.

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:24.869
While THC is the popular compound in the marijuana
plant, cannabidiol or CBD is THC’s non-hallucinogenic

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:25.869
buddy.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:26.910
The yin and the yang.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.779
The high people get from weed is caused by
a specific and well-known compound in the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.039
plant called Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol,
or THC.

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:38.519
It’s brother CBD doesn’t possess any of
the mind-altering, mood-changing properties

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.289
that THC does, and thus get’s a lot less
attention.

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:48.579
Many recreational users want the high, but
people who have cancer don’t.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.129
Many people want to get the benefits of of
medical marijuana, but also want to be able

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.109
to go about their day and not be locked on
the couch.

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.420
To understand these CBD-specific benefits,
we have to understand how cannabis (in general)

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.549
works in the brain.

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:05.140
A marijuana plant contains over 60 different
chemical compounds called cannabinoids that

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.060
act on the body’s endocannabinoid system.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.880
This system modulates all sorts of mind-body
functions.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.880
For example, if you’re in pain it keeps
your body from going haywire -- this is called

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.880
downregulation.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.690
It downregulates stress-related signals that
lead to inflammation and pain.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.080
It also works in your immune system and elsewhere
in the body.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.920
There are two main receptors that these cannabinoids
bind to, conveniently named CB1 and CB2.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.330
When a cannabinoid like THC hits the body,
it acts on the CB 1 receptor, and affects

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.170
memory, concentration and coordination.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.619
It gets you high.

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.430
When a cannabinoid like CBD hits the body,
it doesn’t act on CB-receptors, but hits

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.259
other, pain receptors that affect pain perception,
anxiety, inflammation and so on... thus, it

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.819
doesn’t get you high.

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:55.350
THC and CBD both have similar chemical makeups
but different structures, which is why scientists

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.500
suspect they act differently in the brain.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.859
So, of all these promising applications, CBD
is most famous for its potential to treat

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.920
pediatric epilepsy -- or more importantly
the seizures that are inherent to children

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.399
with epilepsy.

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.980
To put it simply, a seizure happens when the
brain’s electricity spikes and the brain's

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.510
circuitry freezes.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.709
One parent described their son's seizures
like "an overtaxed electrical grid.”

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.150
Researchers haven't fully identified the mechanisms
underlying CBD's capabilities to reduce these

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.959
seizures, but scientists think CBD may improve
the function of the endocannabinoid system,

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:29.959
somehow.

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.400
Then it can regulate the central nervous system
and protect against convulsive activity.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.540
Evidence of CBD’s benefits for pediatric
epilepsy have been largely anecdotal, until

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.540
now.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.520
A recent study published in the New England
Journal of Medicine found that children with

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.430
a complex form of epilepsy who took CBD saw
a 23 percent greater reduction in convulsive

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.510
seizures than those taking a placebo.Researchers
used a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial;

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.920
the gold-standard for trials.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.549
It’s a big deal for the future of CBD-as-medicine.

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.690
There’s a lot we still need to figure out
about CBD, but more research is hard to do.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.781
At the end of 2016, CBD was declared a Schedule
I drug, in part, because THC and CBD are both

00:03:12.781 --> 00:03:13.920
in the same plant.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.400
The DEA says it’s easier to keep track of
CBD if it’s regulated in this way, but after

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.349
recent studies we’re starting to see medicinal
benefits of CBD.

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.890
And Schedule I-ing a drug stymies research
because scientists have to go through an incredible

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.030
amount of bureaucratic hoop jumping to get
access to it.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.709
At this point, scientists still have to prove
that it’s safe and well tolerated, with

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.769
a set dosage and a known list of side effects.

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.409
Hopefully, the scientific process will continue
to run its course, even within the limitations.
