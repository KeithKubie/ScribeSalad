00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.860
There's a giant cloud of alcohol out there
in space just floating there… teasing us.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.000
Is that the only way we're going to be able
to drink in space?!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.520
Not… quite…

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.170
Happy Friday comrades, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.910
6500 light-years away, a giant cloud of alcohol
is floating in space.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.220
Just… hanging out.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.550
Alcohol is a mix of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen,
three extremely abundant elements, so to find

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.500
it out there isn't that surprising.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.659
Finding it has astronomers excited, because
the cloud of alcohol has the exact conditions

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:41.870
required to trigger an astrophysical maser
-- like a LASER, but instead of LIGHT it's

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.539
MICROWAVES.

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.120
The people who wouldn't be excited are everyone
else, because the cloud is made of methyl

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.260
alcohol… not the kind you can drink.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.389
But there is hope!

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:58.199
NASA cares deeply about the psychological
health of the astronauts, and a cold frothy

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.339
beverage is a great way to keep astronauts
mentally anchored to earth!

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.610
So, what about a having a drink in space?

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.780
Well, for NASA it's not really on the table.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.620
We've talked a bit about drinking in space.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.120
NASA has a pretty strict alcohol policy on
the ISS and on Shuttle missions, space is

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.730
dangerous, so being less than sober can cause
injury or death.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.710
That being said, NASA researched a sherry
wine to go up to SkyLab in the 70s, but it

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.930
never went to space.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.690
Turns out, the smell of the wine made people
nauseated during testing and the astronauts

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.230
-- on short-term missions -- didn't really
care if they had alcohol.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.430
After one astronaut made a public speech saying
they were looking into it, angry letters prompted

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.390
NASA to ban alcoholic beverages...

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.780
The Russians, on the other hand, very famously
had cognac on Mir and supposedly rationed

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.600
about 4 ounces per day… supposedly… *wink*

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.920
There is some science to support alcohol in
space.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.120
A 2011 paper in the Federation of American
Societies for Experimental Biology found resveratrol,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.450
a component of some alcohols, can prevent
significant bone density, muscle and metabolic

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.560
losses during spaceflight!

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.659
Even though the astronauts can't wet their
whistles that doesn't mean there isn't SCIENCE

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.810
TO BE HAD!

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.530
A Scottish whiskey distillery named Ardbeg
shot 20 test tubes into space to test the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.849
effects of microgravity on whiskey terpenes
back in 2011.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:17.849
They're scheduled to come down TODAY.

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.870
A terpene is an organic molecule that is part
of whiskey maturation.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.260
It’s a naturally occurring hydrocarbon that
can be found in termites, butterflies, hop

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.819
plants, pine tar and even paint thinners…it
helps give whiskey its flavor.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.580
When the space-matured whiskey lands it'll
be tested against control whiskey molecules

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.670
that have been chilling here on Earth to learn
more about how distilling works.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.840
It wasn't just whiskey either, experiments
have been done to explore how yeast behave

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.489
during fermentation, how foam and bubbles
behave in space, and even how a gas-liquid

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.969
mixture would behave in microgravity!

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.879
Turns out, beer doesn't work in space, nor
does any other carbonated beverage.

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.010
Coca-cola partnered with a company called
BioServe to try it out on the shuttle, and

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.659
it worked… okay.

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.090
The word they used was "palatable."

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.069
Do you think astronauts should be able have
a glass of wine with their re-hydrated dinner?

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.499
Should we let them get wastey-face up there?!

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:12.959
What would you want?

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.689
Have a cold one and spill your thoughts into
the comments here.

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:16.709
We want to hear them!

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.540
And check out my and Tara's other show TestTube
where we breakdown politics, world events

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.330
and curiosity about complicated news.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:38.750
Like this one on whether we can trust 
the Russian media…

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.239
