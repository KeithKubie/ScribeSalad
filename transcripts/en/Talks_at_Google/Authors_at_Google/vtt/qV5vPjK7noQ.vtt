00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.890
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thanks everyone for coming.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:02.890
I'm Brad Greene.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.350
I'm an engineering manager here at Google.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.689
I wanted to introduce to you David Kirp.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.220
David is a Professor at the University of
California Berkeley.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.390
He's previously been a Dean.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.890
He was on Obama's Transition Committee.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.169
And he's here to talk to us today about his
book, "Kids First."

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:21.829
And I'll turn it over to David.

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.499
&gt;&gt;David Kirp: Thank you for coming.

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:35.239
The inspiration for this project was an attempt
to think about what you'd want for kids in

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:43.739
a society that thought seriously about kids
and wasn't thinking pipe-dream expenses, came

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.989
from out of my time that I spent on the Transition
Team.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.239
I was with the Education Group.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.910
There were seven of us and there were probably
200 groups that came.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.890
So, there's the Technology and Education folks,
and the Pre-school folks, and the Child Care

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.780
people, and the Native American Head Start
people, and the Compensatory Education Program

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.860
in the Catholic schools and the--.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.000
You get the idea.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.090
The Voc-Ed people, all there.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.520
And they were all estimable folks.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.060
But the difficulty was they were all looking
at particular slices of kid's lives.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.659
And there was really nobody that was only
thinking about, talking about, a kid.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:40.850
So I wondered, putting on my policy wonk cap,
what would a policy look like?

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:49.700
What would a set, a system of supports for
kids from crib to college, or vocational training,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.420
look like?

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.409
And so, I traveled around the country.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.259
I had a little bit of money.

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:08.410
And I saw some amazing programs in the most
unlikely places--the Highlands of New Mexico,

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.220
and the middle of the barrio in Los Angeles,
and Washington Heights up at the tip of Manhattan--a

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.420
tough neighborhood.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:23.450
And one of my favorite programs is a preschool
in a neighborhood in Chicago that was so tough

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.099
that there was barbed wire around the playground
to protect the kids when they were there.

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.569
And they were all great programs.

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.850
But the problem is they were programs.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.819
They weren't systems.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.569
And that, to this audience, probably makes
particular sense.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.519
If you were lucky enough to be in a certain
place at a certain time and be eligible for

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.010
a certain activity, that was great.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.590
But a lot of folks weren't.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.209
And a lot of people, from one age group, children
got great stuff and then nothing else.

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:07.800
So, you might be a poor, single mom with your
first child and you sign up for something

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.230
called the Nurse-Family Partnership.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.239
Great, famous program.

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.520
A trained nurse comes to you once a week.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.720
A lot of work on child development.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.989
Helps you be a better parent.

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.330
Second birthday comes, the nurse and the mom
and the kid blow out the candles and the nurse

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.330
is gone.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.330
And there you are.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.390
There you are, a mom, without any of that
support.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.440
And then comes your second child.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.800
And those of you who've had kids, or can think
about siblings, will know that second child,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.080
first child often very different.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.049
The program says, "Sorry, we only look at
first kids."

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:56.959
And I think about a friend of mine from Chicago
who knew a young state legislator turned Senator

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.000
named Barack Obama.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.010
And he went to visit him in 2005 in his office.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.840
And they bonded over the classic middle-class
dilemma, "You have kids.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.599
Oh, my God.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.610
Summer camp is over.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:09.610
School hasn't begun.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.120
What are we gonna do with them for that two-week
time?"

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.770
And I thought for a lot of parents, it's not
two weeks.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.660
It's two years or three years or more.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.790
Parents are asking that question and there's
no good answer.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:30.260
And the final lynch pin for me with this was
an event in New York sponsored by something

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.680
called the Dream Foundation.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.360
The Dream Foundation is scattered across the
country.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.320
Provides tutoring and mentoring for kids from
about 3rd Grade on and then supports last

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.400
dollar support for college.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.290
It's a great program.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:53.070
And this girl, who is an NYU student, said,
"I happened to be in Red Hook, 3rd Grade,

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.970
Mrs. Ruiz' class, and the Dream Foundation
folks adopted our class.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.570
So, if it weren't for them, I wouldn't be
here."

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.380
And I thought exactly, "But if you showed
up the next year in Mrs. Ruiz' class, or you

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.610
happened to be in Mr. Brown's class down the
hall, very different life."

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.130
Programs, not systems.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.900
And as I started looking at what was out there.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.810
I thought, "What's the encapsulating concept
here?

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.310
What am I really trying to think about?"

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.870
And the answer was really simple.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.870
This book is about--.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.480
You can encapsulate it in one sentence.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.540
It's the policy version of the Golden Rule.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.220
Every child deserves what you would want for
a child that you love.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.130
Simple, straightforward, and very useful.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:46.170
So that, for example, there's a lot of attention
now being paid to early education.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.170
Very important.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.400
It's one of my five big ideas, but it's not
enough.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.060
People start thinking about this as the panacea.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.460
You think in Golden Term rules.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.160
Could you imagine saying, "Kid.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.980
We'll have to ignore you until you're three
or four.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.660
You're gonna have a great early education
and then you go off to the untender mercies

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.140
of the neighborhood public school."

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.020
Probably not.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:16.150
So, out of that, I came up with an agenda--a
five idea agenda.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.410
Why a list?

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.080
'Cause Americans love lists, right?

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.070
This is the David Letterman Show.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.570
Rick Perry certainly had his list the other
night.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.120
[chuckles]

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.070
We got colleges, US news rankings.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.190
And they're rememberable.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.190
And they're short.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.270
Short lists work.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:47.600
And I was looking for not new ideas, but tried
and true efforts that could be expanded and

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.210
had good basis in evidence and that really
were potential game changers in the lives

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.870
of kids.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:03.180
And the one big idea is if you put them together,
you get a synergy that really reinforces the

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.740
effect of any one of those ideas.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.450
So if somebody asks me, "What can we do now?"

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.180
I've got answers for that.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.590
What can we do that's really affordable, really
feasible, now?

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:18.590
But ideally, the scheme of some scope, when
I say what you want for a child you love,

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.680
I don't mean the Cadillac.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:29.080
I don't mean that you're giving folks an internship
at the Google campus in this summer and you're

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.750
sending them off to Argentina to learn Spanish.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.190
It's really the Kia model, not the Cadillac
model.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.560
But good stuff.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.770
Good, serious, engaging stuff.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.960
And at the end of this book, I try to think
about what "affordable" means.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.550
And I do a little bit of budgeting.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.270
And the easiest way to understand that budget
is if I had--I don't know what the quarterly

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.440
profits are at Google.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.470
That might be a better example here.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:06.620
But if I had a year's worth of Exxon profits,
I'd be halfway toward fulfilling this agenda.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.050
So, what's on the agenda?

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.050
Five items.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.620
First, strong support for parents.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.850
I don't know a parent who says, "I don't need
to talk to anybody.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.640
I know everything there is to know about parenting."

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.160
And we know how important parents are in kids'
lives.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.870
Not just at the beginning, but all the way
through their lives.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:34.750
And we actually do know some things now about
what you can do to help parents be the best

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.700
they can be.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.409
And my favorite system--on occasion I'm gonna
reference particular programs--there are a

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:46.430
bunch of good programs, like the Nurse-Family
Partnership that I mentioned before.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.430
They're small.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:51.030
My favorite system is called Triple P--Positive
Parenting Program.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:56.660
It exists actually here in San Francisco,
in Mendocino.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.570
It's scattered around the country.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.780
Its, in policy terms, one of the world's best
kept secrets.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:10.110
And it looks like this: First, for 20 years,
the developers of this program asked parents,

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:11.450
"What do you care about?

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.970
What are the issues you care about?"

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.050
"My kid can't sleep.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.210
My kid can't eat.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.210
My kid cries.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:20.960
My kid won't listen to me, having trouble
in school, fighting, etcetera"

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.930
And then try to develop strategies for addressing
those issues.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.770
And then tested them.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:35.530
And although the deviser of this program is
a psychologist, he was not interested in one-on-one

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:36.530
strategies.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:41.190
He wanted to reach parents where they were.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:48.200
And so, he then turns to everybody to whom
a parent might go--the minister, the social

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.780
worker, the principal, the teacher, the pediatrician.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.610
He says, "I'll give you training in these
programs.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:00.170
It's ten sessions for basic program if you
wanna learn about helping a parent cope with

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.550
a developmentally delayed child."

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.770
It's another special program.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.100
Training is free.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.380
And then you go out there in the community.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.380
You've got this tool kit.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:16.980
It's a little bit like doctors who go off
every year for a week or so of retooling.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.480
It's that same kind of effort.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.320
Then, they do a lot of social marketing to
get parents aware of what's happening.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.940
So, the minister says something to them.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.590
You go to the principal to talk about your
child.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:33.400
The principal says, "By the way, there's this
program that's available if you're interested

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.400
in doing it."

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.450
And the program is whatever the parents want.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:42.480
It's everything from pick up a pamphlet to
participate in a ten-week course to, on some

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.440
occasions when you have a really difficult
problem, it's some one-on-one or small group

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.600
work.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:54.320
And the data is amazing in terms of what the
impact is.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:03.060
In this country, the Center for Disease Control
did an evaluation of Triple P and the units

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:08.690
of comparison were eleven rural counties in
South Carolina that got Triple P, and eleven

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.160
others that didn't.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.190
That's a huge population base.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:17.750
And the CDC was concerned about abuse and
neglect.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:25.160
And it was interested in two measures--hospitalization
of kids in foster care placements, both indicia

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.850
of parent's abuse and neglect.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.840
Big, big differences between those communities.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:36.260
And they would've been bigger still had Triple
P been allowed to use TV ads, which they couldn't

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.650
because the TV ads would be seen across counties.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.760
This is new.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:49.401
And all of anything that I'm saying is quickie
rendering of what's in "Kids First," which

00:11:49.401 --> 00:11:51.480
you're getting at an amazing bargain price.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:57.529
I couldn't get the book at the price that
you have if you're sitting right outside.

00:11:57.529 --> 00:12:03.110
So, that's strong parenting . Item two.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.120
Really good early education.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:11.000
I doubt that I have to say a lot to this group
about why early education matters, about how

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.680
important early brain development is to kids.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.760
I do wanna say that it's not what goes on
in an early education program.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:29.550
A good education program isn't like pouring
a pitcher of water into the--the pitcher of

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.529
knowledge into the empty vessel of a kid's
head.

00:12:32.529 --> 00:12:33.760
A common metaphor.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.060
Kids are not empty vessels.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.130
They really are explorers.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:42.300
At 45 minutes, they're looking around the
room and they're beginning to recognize things.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.630
Forty-five minutes after birth.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.150
And at three and four years old, those of
you who've seen and spent time with those

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:52.210
kids, they really are curious about everything.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:56.860
And you give them things that really will
both satisfy their curiosity and whet their

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:01.110
appetite for more and you've got a teacher
who understands how to be helpful and how

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:03.680
to stand back and let the kids work.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.279
Amazing stuff goes on.

00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:07.650
But it's not just cognition that's important.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:13.220
It's also all those things that go on in a
good preschool classroom--learning to wait

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:18.690
your turn, to share, to not scream at somebody
or beat up on somebody.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:21.910
"Use your words," as the teachers would say.

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.180
All this extra emotional stuff.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.810
And that matters a lot as well.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:32.810
Not just nice, but it's really, it's important
in terms of lifetime outcomes.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:38.020
An economist named James Heckman, Nobel Prize
winner from the University of Chicago, had

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:46.650
a large sample of kids who were tested at
age three, both for cognition and for social/emotional

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:47.820
functioning.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:51.230
And then looked at again at age 18.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:56.990
And what the data showed was that the kids
who scored really high in cognitive terms

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.589
did better in school.

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:03.870
Not as much better in school as you might
imagine, but better.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:09.130
But the kids who were high on the social/emotional
scale, less likely to be pregnant, less likely

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:16.650
to be in trouble with the police, less likely
to be on drugs or drinking or all those other

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.530
things that matter.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:27.460
So, these so-called "soft" values that pop
up along the way here--good parenting-- and

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.800
what it does for parents listening to children.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.800
Good early education.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.930
They really have some hard outcomes.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:34.930
OK.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.310
Strong parenting support.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.720
Really good early education.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:45.080
Then three, connecting accurately rigorous
education with all the resources of the community

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.320
surrounding it.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:54.020
We are currently stuck in a debate that I
sometimes describe as Waiting for Superman

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.470
versus Diane Ravitch.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:59.529
Diane Ravitch wrote a bestseller about how
don't blame--.

00:14:59.529 --> 00:15:00.690
It's not just the schools.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:07.860
It's all the surrounding concerns of the social
issues that arise.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.420
And there's "Waiting for 'Superman'," which
basically says the schools are the enemy.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:18.270
The unions are the arch-devil and charter
schools are the answer.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:22.930
And that conversation, is it all about blame
the teachers and get better teachers in schools?

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:27.190
Look, hold them responsible and they'll produce
better reading and math scores.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:34.270
Or, is it in our social conditions that difficulties
of life in the inner city--.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:35.630
And the answer, of course, is both, right?

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.460
I mean, it's this silly kind of conversation.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:42.830
There's nobody out there who doesn't think
an academically rigorous education--.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:47.040
Just take that image of Lewis and Clark and
carry it on through.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.580
Children as problem solvers.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:55.600
All the things that you're asked to do when
you're working on the job--the problems you

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.250
need to solve--just imagine them applying
across the curriculum.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:02.300
That's what you want.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.800
Nobody would disagree with that.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:08.900
But it's also the case that the model of school
that says you show up at 8, you leave at 3,

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:15.790
you come 180 days a year, just doesn't work
anymore for many, many kids--not just poor

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:20.540
kids, but middle-class kids as well.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.540
Parents are working.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.040
What are you gonna do at 7 o'clock in the
morning?

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.650
So, they're working until 5, 6, 7 o'clock
at night.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:32.570
The community school model says, "We're gonna
start with that academically rigorous school

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.690
as the core and we're gonna work around that."

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:40.100
So, there are programs that have hot breakfast
in the morning.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:44.420
And teachers are there to help kids with their
homework.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.850
After school, all those things that have been
squeezed out of the public schools because

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:53.839
of the high stakes testing in literacy and
numeracy.

00:16:53.839 --> 00:16:57.170
All those things you don't get very much of
go on after school.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:01.420
So, science and history and social studies
and art and music and gym.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.180
You know, gym is really interesting.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:08.930
I discovered that the typical school now has
a gym class one day a week.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.589
Well, we also have an obesity epidemic.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:16.470
Somebody has failed to put those two parts
of the puzzle together.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:21.079
But you want all that kind of activity going
on after school for kids.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:23.470
You wanna figure out a way of engaging parents.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.980
You also wanna bring the health services into
the schools.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:33.910
I mean, it's great that all kids are now entitled
to health care through the Children's Health

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.130
Insurance Program.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:39.460
But being entitled and having a doc is something
very different.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:45.770
And as some of you who have kids know, if
your child needs to go to the doctor, you've

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:50.080
gotta take half a day off from work to make
the appointment and go to the doctor, etc.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:56.220
So, move the public health programs, move
some of the doctors into the schools.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.250
Provide that kind of service for the kids
and by the way, why not make it open to the

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.210
families in the community as well?

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:06.360
Why not open the school generally to the families
in the community of the school?

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.020
Make it a real community school.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:15.750
So, this also might just sound like nice stuff,
but it's not.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:20.540
I mean, it's much more than that.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.220
Start with health.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:27.960
About a third of the kids in the typical city
come to school with uncorrected vision problems.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.370
About a third of the kids come to school with
untreated dental problems.

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:36.200
And I don't mean they haven't been to have
their teeth cleaned in the last six months.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:41.140
These are kids who are in such pain that they
lose a million and a half days a school year--are

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.370
lost to dental pain.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:48.080
And about 30 percent of the kids have untreated
asthma.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.810
So think about it.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:53.429
If you come to school and you can't read the
blackboard and you're in pain, you're having

00:18:53.429 --> 00:18:58.450
a hard time breathing, being able to pass
that high stakes test in 3rd grade where you

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:05.100
gotta write three paragraph essays and read
a complicated passage and some non-fiction

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.200
text and some answer some ques-.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:11.040
It's hard to keep your mind on that stuff
if you're having a difficult time.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.110
After school?

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:19.880
Well, what we know is that the number of hours
that teenagers spend unsupervised after school

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:26.850
is a better predictor of school dropouts than
race or social class.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.900
So, being connected also, you know, why?

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.630
Because the kids get much more engaged in
school.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:34.630
They connect.

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.610
And it's not just the skill and drill part
of the world.

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:37.610
It's the fun part of the world.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:38.800
And summers?

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:45.559
Well, it turns out that kids from across the
social spectrum make about the same progress

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:49.460
academically during the course of the school
year.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:54.179
It's in the summers that the differences emerge
'cause middle-class families are scheduling

00:19:54.179 --> 00:19:57.250
their kids with a fancy dance card.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.990
But poor families?

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.940
I mean, those kids are hanging out on the
streets.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:09.120
So, that's strong parenting support, good
early education, connect school and community.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.170
Four.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:13.340
Get a caring, stable adult.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.840
A champion in kid's lives.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:21.970
When I would talk to people who work with
kids, I would hear this phrase "caring, stable

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:26.380
adult" so much that I thought maybe this was
a talking point, right?

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.549
Somehow like--.

00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:29.240
But it's not.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:34.090
You think back on your own lives and how you
got here.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.670
None of you made it on your own.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:43.160
You all had somebody--not just a parent--who
was there for you in some way.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.160
It was a teacher.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.370
It was a coach.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.160
It was a minister.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.160
It was the neighbor.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.490
In the case of the guy who runs a program
called Experience Corps, which is one of the

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.760
really good mentoring programs.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.860
It was the barber.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.260
Somebody who went out of their way.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:03.150
Somebody who could inspire you, could guide
you, could support you.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:08.340
The best of those systems is Big Brothers
Big Sisters.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.800
Been around for a century.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.030
Reaching about a half a million kids.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:19.500
And also, an evidence-based program, when
they've studied kids in that program compared

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:24.920
to a control group of students, what they
found is more engaged, happier, doing better

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.920
in school.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.299
The big effect?

00:21:27.299 --> 00:21:29.090
Better relations with their own parents.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.520
And that surprised me at first.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.250
And then I thought, "We're talking about teenagers."

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:38.559
Now, for teenagers to have somebody else to
connect to, some other adult who can show

00:21:38.559 --> 00:21:44.600
them alternative possibilities, other ways
of being and who doesn't have all that charge

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.650
of being a parent, well, it takes a lot of
pressure off.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:51.490
And it gives this kid someone else to talk
to.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:55.260
And that's item four on the list.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:22:01.590
And number five, finally, is probably the
only item that's not gonna be familiar to

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:03.200
you.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.790
And that's a children's savings account.

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:13.080
The program that existed in Britain for about
ten years and that's been introduced in Congress

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:20.790
for many years--bipartisan support one of
the last times it was introduced--its supporters,

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:27.049
its co-signers were Charles Schumer, liberal
Democrat from New York, and Rick Santorum,

00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:31.460
then Senator from Pennsylvania--a Conservative
guy.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:38.110
The model is this: Every child, every newborn,
gets five hundred dollars deposited in an

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:41.780
investment account at birth.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:49.000
For poor and near-poor families, the government
makes an additional offer.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.720
If you, parents, or family, or anyone contribute
more money to this account, we'll match it

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.030
up to five hundred dollars a year.

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.700
So, why does this matter?

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.910
Well, the obvious thing is there's gonna be
a nest egg.

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:08.310
The miracles of compound interest mean that
you're gonna get a fair chunk of money if

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:12.360
a thousand dollars is going into an investment
account.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:17.880
And a lot of kids, poor and working-class
kids are very, very good at thinking about

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.130
short term costs.

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:24.320
They look at the sticker price of colleges
and say, "I can't go there."

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:32.560
And the result of that in really highly technical
language is that poor, smart kids have about

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:39.530
the same chance of going to college as dumb,
rich kids.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:44.280
Money helps equalize that situation.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.470
So does savvy, because the other thing that
child's savings account does is it changes

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.330
the dynamic of families.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.950
Poor families start getting interested in
their kid’s futures because they see them

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:55.500
has having futures.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.870
And the kids themselves become more money
aware.

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:06.360
Banks are always--the Federal Reserve is always
talking about "what can you do to make kids

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.770
more money smart?"

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.500
Well, this program does it.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.940
When I've looked at what happens when you
give kids a matching kid's savings account,

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.809
they know a whole lot more because now they've
got some money to be smart about.

00:24:17.809 --> 00:24:19.770
Those statements are coming in every quarter.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:24.380
By the time those kids are seven, eight, nine,
ten, they're gonna begin looking at them and

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:28.140
seeing what's happening to their money and
talking about the dollars they have.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:35.190
When they've done these little studies, kids
are told, "We'll match up to whatever amount

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:39.250
of money, money that you save."

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:40.280
The results are pretty amazing.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.990
I always thought about teenagers as little
hedonists, but in fact, they turn out to be

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.990
little Puritans.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:50.169
They save a ton 'cause they do see what down
the road looks like.

00:24:50.169 --> 00:25:00.530
So, what you have is five pillars of support
that carry you from the time you're born to

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.980
helping your parents do the best they can.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.620
Really good early education.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:10.110
Helping to develop both your social skills
and your academic skills.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:14.150
An academically rigorous school connected
to all the resources of the community.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.890
A mentor to help guide the way.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:21.350
And then, that pot of gold at the end of the
rainbow.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:24.210
That's the hope.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:27.799
That's the ideal.

00:25:27.799 --> 00:25:35.830
And as I said, I mean, to me, it satisfies
for the broad majority of kids my Golden Rule

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:36.830
test.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:40.600
It's pretty close to what I would wanna do
for my own kid.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.780
It's affordable.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:47.330
When I try to work out a budget, I was talking
about 60 billion dollars.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.230
That sounds like a lot of money--maybe.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:57.530
But again, in comparison to any of the measures
that are out there, not such a fortune.

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:03.610
If every American drank one fewer Coke a month,
we'd have a billion dollars a year to add

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.830
to the pot.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.900
There's nothing partisan about this.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.049
Kids aren't Republicans.

00:26:10.049 --> 00:26:11.919
Kids aren't Democrats.

00:26:11.919 --> 00:26:13.340
Kids are kids.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:21.820
Parent's concern about kids cuts across lines
and so does their willingness to support kids.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:28.220
And yet, we're at a point in which for every
dollar that goes to a kid, seven dollars goes

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.090
to a geezer like me.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.580
And the reason for that is pretty clear.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.000
Four-letter acronym.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.420
First two letters are vowels.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:41.770
Anybody wanna tell me what that four-letter
acronym is that explains why seniors do so

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:42.770
well?

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.260
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: AARP

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.049
&gt;&gt;David Kirp: AARP, right?

00:26:47.049 --> 00:26:50.460
Seniors, 1960, were the poorest part of the
population.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:52.160
Along comes AARP.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.160
Mass membership.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:56.610
Forty-five million members.

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:02.059
And what they have harped on is three items.

00:27:02.059 --> 00:27:06.710
Seniors want social security, Medicare, prescription
drug benefits.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:09.440
That is it.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.860
Kid's advocates?

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:16.150
We don't have time to list all the things
that kid's advocates want.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:18.250
They're badly organized.

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:20.200
They're fractious.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.059
Politicians can get away with not paying any
attention to them.

00:27:23.059 --> 00:27:26.090
The old political line is, "Kids don't matter
because kids don't vote."

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:35.650
And until there is some effort to organize
all the folks who are engaged and involved

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:44.580
with kids, in an effort that even vaguely
approaches the AARP, unless there's some way

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:53.010
to push/nudge the political system into rethinking
its priorities, investing in the next generation

00:27:53.010 --> 00:28:00.490
and enabling families to be the good stewards
they want, then this becomes nothing more

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:02.679
than a nice conversation.

00:28:02.679 --> 00:28:09.630
And I say that with particular poignancy here
because this is a group that is interested

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:14.540
in reshaping the universe in various ways
and has a set of tools that can be put to

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.250
use in the interest of kids.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:21.400
And I hope that happens.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.470
And we can talk more about what that would
mean.

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:29.179
But let me stop now and invite comments, questions,
thoughts, puzzles that you might have.

00:28:29.179 --> 00:28:30.179
Yeah.

00:28:30.179 --> 00:28:31.179
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: So, how is AARP successful?

00:28:31.179 --> 00:28:32.179
And what won't stop, for example, groups of
parents--?

00:28:32.179 --> 00:28:41.660
Would it require seniors who have a lot of
money to create this?

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:49.260
And instead invested [inaudible ] money, or--?

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:53.370
&gt;&gt;David Kirp: Yeah, it's an--.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.881
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Can you repeat the question
into the mic?

00:28:55.881 --> 00:28:56.881
&gt;&gt;David Kirp: Yeah.

00:28:56.881 --> 00:28:58.630
The question is how did the AARP make it?

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:01.470
Which is a great question.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:08.360
And the answer is that a group of organizations
got together, agreed on a platform, and decided

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.971
on a model, which was "we're gonna be a mass
organization, 15 bucks a years, and you're

00:29:12.971 --> 00:29:13.971
a member of AARP."

00:29:13.971 --> 00:29:16.320
You don't have to do anything.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:21.270
So, when this organization starts growing
into the millions, when it shows up at the

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:24.160
bargaining table, people pay attention.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.250
You will notice that despite all the brave
talk about cutting entitlement programs, which

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:34.309
means cutting Social Security and Medicare,
it hasn't happened.

00:29:34.309 --> 00:29:43.090
And when a Republican Congressman was endorsing
serious Medicare cuts and transfers and was

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:50.250
kicked out of office in Buffalo this past
spring on that issue, people paid attention.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.940
So, the agenda is simple.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:56.130
The organizing principle is clear.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:30:00.410
The institution mushrooms over a period of
time.

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:12.880
It would take kid's advocates sitting down
at a table and being willing to put aside

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.549
adult egos--really tough to do.

00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:19.580
My program, my program, my program.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.580
And saying, "OK.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.500
For this year, this is what we're gonna focus
on."

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.970
And it can be at Washington.

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.520
It could be in Sacramento.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.170
It can be in Mountain View.

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:31.720
Wherever.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:37.610
These days, it's probably easier-- even despite
the state of economy here-- it's probably

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:42.590
easier to look at the local level than to
look at what's happening in Washington.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:45.210
But it takes that kind of energy.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:49.900
At the local level, it means you think about
the people who are involved in kid's lives,

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:54.169
you bring them together, you sit them down,
and you keep saying, "For the kids.

00:30:54.169 --> 00:30:55.169
For the kids.

00:30:55.169 --> 00:30:56.240
For the kids."

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:05.030
And eventually, they get engaged enough to
in fact, put aside what it is that their program

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:11.400
is about and think about how they can be more
powerful by combining with other forces.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.400
That's what's required.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.260
And it happens in some places.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:22.240
My favorite story comes from Illinois where
for the last 30-odd years, the kid's organizations

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.850
really have come together.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:25.850
And they have been able--.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:31.750
They were one of the first states to get pre-school--
state pre-school--universal state pre-school.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:37.200
Now, they were the first state to make sure
that that program included early pre-school.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.659
Zero to three as well as three to five.

00:31:40.659 --> 00:31:44.200
And they have a big child care program.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.580
How did they do this?

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.380
They did this in the way I'm describing.

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:48.380
They get together.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.380
They fight it out.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.370
They come out and say, "This is what we're
about doing."

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:56.450
Every year, they send about 30, 40 thousand
parents.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:32:01.750
They bus them to Springfield's state capitol
for Kid's Day.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:08.771
And one mom from south side of Chicago buttonholes
her state Senator and says, "Senator, how

00:32:08.771 --> 00:32:10.820
can we get more money for early education?"

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.380
And he said, "I wish I could help you, ma'am,
but there's nothing I can do."

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.710
And she said right back, "OK.

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.299
How can we elect somebody who can actually
do something?"

00:32:18.299 --> 00:32:19.299
[laughter]

00:32:19.299 --> 00:32:24.370
That's the attitude that's sorely lacking
and that we need to see more of.

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:25.370
Yeah.

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:29.750
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: So, if I look at the four points,
and I like the examples that I got from your

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:37.490
description of one, three and five, a pretty
good sense of what policies can support those

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:38.490
things.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:39.490
&gt;&gt;David Kirp: Mm-hmm.

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.990
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: Could you elaborate more on policies
that could support two and four?

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:48.940
&gt;&gt;David Kirp: So, what policies could support
early education and mentoring?

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.299
OK.

00:32:52.299 --> 00:32:56.530
Start with something that's happening in Washington
now.

00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:00.799
And that is an Early Learning Challenge grant
program that the Administration has introduced.

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:04.490
A five hundred million dollar program.

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:11.250
And that program says to the states, "We want
you to build a system of supports from birth

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:13.669
to age five."

00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:20.020
It's very much like what it was that I was
working on when I was on the Transition Team.

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.020
States develop a--.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.020
You know where the gaps are.

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.020
You don't have good child care.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.020
You don't have early education.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.400
You don't have parenting programs.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:33.549
So, we want high quality, public, private,
transparent, parent-engaged programs.

00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:37.039
And I was not a great fan of Race to the Top
because of its incentives.

00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:41.590
Here, the incentives are all in the right
direction.

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:47.200
More generally, there's a pretty effective--there
was--a pretty effective political push to

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.020
expand early education at the state level.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:57.270
Even through the 2000s, as money was getting
tight, more money was being spent across the

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:58.270
states.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:02.950
So now, about eight billion dollars is spent
as opposed to about two billion dollars seven

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:04.309
or eight years ago.

00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:11.729
The problem is this, and here's where the
political difficulty arises.

00:34:11.729 --> 00:34:13.739
Politicians are naturally credit claimers.

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:14.969
That's not an insult.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:15.969
That's a description.

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:17.919
They need to be able to say, "I did this."

00:34:17.919 --> 00:34:18.919
Right?

00:34:18.919 --> 00:34:20.869
If they're gonna get elected again, "I did
this."

00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:26.009
And it's a whole lot easier to say, "I added
50 thousand kids to the pre-school rolls,"

00:34:26.009 --> 00:34:31.779
than it is to say, "I demanded better qualified
teachers, smaller classes, and evidence-based--."

00:34:31.779 --> 00:34:34.690
The audience has gone away.

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:41.489
So, the task of the folks who are focused
on policy of early education is to start with

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:43.549
better and then move to bigger.

00:34:43.549 --> 00:34:48.739
It's a whole lot easier to move from better
to bigger, politically, than it is to move

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:51.099
from bigger to better.

00:34:51.099 --> 00:34:59.099
And that really again, means starting at the
local level and working out from there.

00:34:59.099 --> 00:35:04.710
It also means making sure that the horrible
fight that goes on between early education

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:08.239
folks and child care folks comes to an end.

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:09.930
I mean, this is just ludicrous.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:11.349
These guys are always at each other's throats.

00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:19.160
It's as if education goes on from 8 to 1 and
then the kids are left free to do nothing.

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.170
Their brains just turn off.

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:21.170
It doesn't work that way, right?

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:22.329
And it's all about education.

00:35:22.329 --> 00:35:24.710
And it's all about play.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:29.989
But those guys have got to get it together.

00:35:29.989 --> 00:35:31.710
Mentoring.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:38.460
What's interesting now is as the Baby Boomers
turn 60 and older, ten thousand a day, ten

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.799
thousand people a day, turn 60 years old.

00:35:42.799 --> 00:35:50.400
They say that they want to be involved in
giving back to the community.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.932
They're not just wanting to play bridge and
golf and what have you.

00:35:53.932 --> 00:35:57.759
And kids and the church are the highest two
items on their list.

00:35:57.759 --> 00:36:02.920
So, tapping that untapped potential is really
a task.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:07.400
Not just for government, but for private organizations,
I mentioned before an organization called

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:15.430
Experience Corps, which sends seniors into
the schools to tutor kids from Kindergarten

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.589
through 3rd grade.

00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:20.229
Experience Corps, on whose board I sit.

00:36:20.229 --> 00:36:22.150
So, they just merged with AARP.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:27.721
It's a great example of what I mean when I
talk about taking a program and making it

00:36:27.721 --> 00:36:28.721
a system.

00:36:28.721 --> 00:36:31.640
Experience Corps is a lovely little program.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.190
Ten thousand volunteers.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:40.750
What, from my view, if you think about the
infrastructure that AARP has, we're talking

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:45.130
about a hundred thousand in five years and
growing.

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:51.779
AARP's point of view, they love it because
they're now branded as selfless seniors.

00:36:51.779 --> 00:36:54.289
This is a way of doing well by doing good.

00:36:54.289 --> 00:36:57.700
Their organization, it's actually spreading
its wings.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.730
It doesn't have to be government.

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:05.059
Although, government can certainly fund, and
has funded, mentoring programs for kids, particularly

00:37:05.059 --> 00:37:06.729
at risk.

00:37:06.729 --> 00:37:09.489
The children of folks who are in prison.

00:37:09.489 --> 00:37:16.009
The children of kids who were, in one way
or another, in trouble.

00:37:16.009 --> 00:37:23.200
And the great thing to me about Big Brothers
Big Sisters though, is that it's open to everybody.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.269
It's like universal pre-school.

00:37:26.269 --> 00:37:28.779
It's like good parenting programs.

00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:29.970
Anybody can sign up.

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:30.970
It's about "the poor."

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:33.300
It's not about "them" needing help.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.680
I mean, this is a book.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:42.109
This is a set of ideas that's meant to cut
across the spectrum--the income spectrum.

00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:50.410
I spent a lot of time in my career thinking
about poor kids and special needs kids and

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:53.249
African American boys and their educational
problems.

00:37:53.249 --> 00:37:58.140
So, I get the importance of particular needs.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:03.979
I was a counsel in a case challenging a policy
in Texas in which a child who spoke Spanish

00:38:03.979 --> 00:38:06.760
on the playground got suspended from school.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:11.299
It's only 40 years ago that this happened.

00:38:11.299 --> 00:38:15.710
But here, I wanted programs that would reach
systems that would reach across the spectrum.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:22.420
For example, in terms of school readiness,
we know that poor kids come to school to Kindergarten

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:24.759
well behind middle-class kids.

00:38:24.759 --> 00:38:30.229
What we don't know is that middle-class kids
are as far behind wealthy kids when they come

00:38:30.229 --> 00:38:32.059
to school.

00:38:32.059 --> 00:38:33.910
And the numbers are bigger.

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:39.609
So, here's a program whose general thrust
is what I'd call "selective universalism."

00:38:39.609 --> 00:38:43.569
You focus first on poor families because their
needs are gonna be greatest.

00:38:43.569 --> 00:38:46.339
But you really do think broadly.

00:38:46.339 --> 00:38:52.650
I think it's politically much more feasible,
so that we're talking about us, not them.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:57.880
And I think it's ethically preferable to have
a world in which we really are not thinking

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:03.869
about just the poor, but we're thinking what
it is that society as a whole could benefit

00:39:03.869 --> 00:39:05.430
from and needs.

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:06.520
Yeah.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:18.319
&gt;&gt;MALE #4: I noticed one of the five things
that you don't talk about, or one of the things

00:39:18.319 --> 00:39:20.489
you don't talk about in the five things is
the quality of the education itself.

00:39:20.489 --> 00:39:22.170
Why isn't this topic in the book?

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:23.859
&gt;&gt;David Kirp: Well, it's a great question.

00:39:23.859 --> 00:39:25.460
&gt;&gt;[audience member coughs]

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:32.240
&gt;&gt;David Kirp: And why didn't I talk about
the quality of education in the book?

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:36.520
Because we're stuck in this sterile debate
about what quality means.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:42.410
Is it all about accountability and test results
and firing teachers and charter schools?

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:45.550
Is it about giving teachers lots of support,
etc.?

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:49.039
There is a ton of stuff out.

00:39:49.039 --> 00:39:51.359
That's the conversation.

00:39:51.359 --> 00:40:01.229
And as I say, I posit in this book that rigorous
academic programs are essential for kids--all

00:40:01.229 --> 00:40:02.390
kids.

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:03.390
I just--.

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:04.660
People pick an argument about that.

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:06.829
I don't see that.

00:40:06.829 --> 00:40:11.970
You can't solve the education problems of
this country with charter schools.

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:15.569
Not with 60 million kids and 3 million teachers.

00:40:15.569 --> 00:40:19.170
You're just not gonna be able to do it, whatever
you think about charter schools.

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:22.160
You've gotta work within public schools.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:27.289
And public schools are the only institution,
along with churches and libraries, that are

00:40:27.289 --> 00:40:28.289
in all communities.

00:40:28.289 --> 00:40:30.499
They become a base for what you're doing.

00:40:30.499 --> 00:40:33.269
But I just didn't see any reason to enter
that fray.

00:40:33.269 --> 00:40:35.589
It's a pretty well-worn area.

00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:37.089
And frankly, I don't think anybody's--.

00:40:37.089 --> 00:40:39.279
People's minds are made up by now.

00:40:39.279 --> 00:40:43.910
There's enough stuff out there about get rid
of the unions, or the charter schools are

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:48.019
really draining resources from our public
schools.

00:40:48.019 --> 00:40:53.880
So, I quite deliberately said, "I wanna look
at all the things that aren't just about 8

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:58.170
to 3, literacy and numeracy."

00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:59.589
That's the world that nobody is talking about
these days.

00:40:59.589 --> 00:41:00.589
&gt;&gt;MALE #5: [ inaudible ] books.

00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:01.589
Was there--?

00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:11.769
What was your issue with parents who can't
send their kids 

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:41.380
to charter school who don't feel well, at
least I want our kids to get the best education

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.380
they can, don't feel like they can save the
whole world [ inaudible ], but perhaps is

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:43.380
there a pitch that you could make that would
provide the [ inaudible ] to try to get the

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:44.380
best solution for them?

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.380
&gt;&gt;David Kirp: I think for parents, it's tough.

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:46.529
Parents are fundamentally conservative when
it comes to their own kids.

00:41:46.529 --> 00:41:49.380
We have all sorts of great ideas for changing
society.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:55.309
For our kids, we see this narrow pyramid of
what success looks like and all the failures

00:41:55.309 --> 00:41:57.339
along the way, or seeming failures along the
way.

00:41:57.339 --> 00:42:00.440
They wanna give kids every advantage.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:08.380
I think if you look inside public schools--and
I'm spending a lot of time these days in poor,

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.799
urban, Latino school district just outside
of New York City.

00:42:10.799 --> 00:42:14.609
The most crowded city in the country.

00:42:14.609 --> 00:42:18.059
Those schools satisfy my Golden Rule test.

00:42:18.059 --> 00:42:19.930
And I found brilliant teachers there.

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:24.930
So, one of the things I'd say to parents is
check your prejudices, walk into the public

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:27.220
school, see what's going on.

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:34.180
The other thing I would say is your child
is gonna be exposed not just in the 8 to 3,

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:38.239
180-day year, but all the time, to ideas.

00:42:38.239 --> 00:42:40.549
There are books in the house, right?

00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:43.069
You're having conversations at the dinner
table.

00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:48.079
You listen to middle-class families when they're
on Muni in San Francisco talking to their

00:42:48.079 --> 00:42:49.079
kids.

00:42:49.079 --> 00:42:50.079
They're always talking to their kids.

00:42:50.079 --> 00:42:51.730
"What's that out there?

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:52.730
What do we call that?

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:55.229
Do you like that?"

00:42:55.229 --> 00:42:57.049
It's always education going on.

00:42:57.049 --> 00:43:01.089
So, I think people fetishize the elite schools.

00:43:01.089 --> 00:43:04.680
Certainly when it comes to pre-schools.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:10.680
Not needed to spend 25 thousand dollars a
year to get a good pre-school education for

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:11.680
your kids.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.220
And I think that's the hype, danger hysteria.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:20.140
I think it's hard to ask parents--particularly
parents of young children, to get very politically

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:27.829
engaged because their lives are consumed with
making a living and raising their children.

00:43:27.829 --> 00:43:34.660
But it's not hard to get grandparents involved
because they do have the time and they have

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:35.660
the perspective.

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:42.140
And I've seen wonderful examples where grandparents
get engaged politically, for example, where

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:48.420
in a very conservative congressional district--the
district that's the home to George Bush's

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.809
ranch in Texas.

00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:55.240
The odds on favorite to win congressional
elections, somebody who'd been schooled by

00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:05.190
Karl Rove, who had a ton of money lost because
she had bragged that she had saved the state

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:09.469
a billion dollars by cutting kids off the
state's health rolls.

00:44:09.469 --> 00:44:12.479
All it took was one TV commercial.

00:44:12.479 --> 00:44:17.559
A kind of Walker Evans photograph of a mom
with her kid--her nine-year old kid--and the

00:44:17.559 --> 00:44:24.069
mom, who was a widow, was saying, "I love
my child, but if she gets sick I don't know

00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:28.359
what I'm gonna do because now I don't have
any health insurance because of what's happened."

00:44:28.359 --> 00:44:35.130
That's all it took for a bunch of very conservative,
particularly women and particularly grandmas,

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:37.979
to vote Democrat once in their lives.

00:44:37.979 --> 00:44:42.319
So again, this is not a partisan pitch.

00:44:42.319 --> 00:44:44.140
This is not a partisan set of ideas.

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:50.749
I think the Republicans would expand their
appeal enormously if they realized how broad-based

00:44:50.749 --> 00:44:54.650
the support is for kid's programs.

00:44:54.650 --> 00:45:01.940
But for people who are either in their 20s
and not yet having families, or people who

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:07.569
are in their 50s and 60s and their kids are
out the door, there's lots of room for supporting

00:45:07.569 --> 00:45:08.569
them on this.

00:45:08.569 --> 00:45:12.750
Also, for all those folks who work in kid-serving
organizations--the social workers, the teachers,

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:20.299
and the librarians, and the nurses, etc.--they're
all involved in kid's lives.

00:45:20.299 --> 00:45:26.469
And they're doing amazing work, but if could
also be thinking in policy terms and politics

00:45:26.469 --> 00:45:28.640
terms and not just "what I'm doing in the
classroom."

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:35.450
with a little bit of their lives, they'd make
an enormous difference in the conversation.

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:40.490
Do I see a hand back there?

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:41.849
Yeah.

00:45:41.849 --> 00:46:01.169
&gt;&gt;MALE #6: So, what can individual people
do at the national level to support [inaudible

00:46:01.169 --> 00:46:02.169
]?

00:46:02.169 --> 00:46:11.150
&gt;&gt;David Kirp: I think the most useful thing
to do, and I'm thinking aloud on these questions,

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:14.069
is to get involved.

00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:20.079
If there's a political campaign for a national
office, particularly Congress, that pits somebody

00:46:20.079 --> 00:46:26.489
who's got a record of being effectively anti-kid,
against the challenger, to be engaged in that

00:46:26.489 --> 00:46:28.219
campaign is hugely important.

00:46:28.219 --> 00:46:30.700
The reason for that is pretty simple.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.220
Politicians are risk-adverse folks.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:39.299
They see a few politicians go down in defeat
on kid's issues, they're gonna change their

00:46:39.299 --> 00:46:40.299
tune.

00:46:40.299 --> 00:46:47.140
So, to take the aftermath of my Texas story
was the Texas legislature convenes that January

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:52.390
and the first thing it does, the first thing
it does, is restore those kid's health cuts.

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:53.390
They got it.

00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:57.170
So, that would be idea number one.

00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:03.849
And I would, when it comes to organizations,
there is nothing that really spans this terrain.

00:47:03.849 --> 00:47:12.109
So, I would say you look for groups that are
doing either good substantive work, good research

00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:17.829
work, or good policy work on behalf of particular
groups of kids.

00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:25.430
I think that beyond the political universe,
people's energies are much better focused

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:26.910
at the state and local level.

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:33.359
Because that, right now, given what's happening--that
circus in Washington--things are much more

00:47:33.359 --> 00:47:40.920
likely to happen in Mountain View than they
are in Congress.

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.880
And I hope that happens.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:50.120
And I hope--it's a good last question--I hope
that you all think about ways that you can

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:58.670
use the talents that you have and the talents
this organization has to work for the interest

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:00.509
of kids.

00:48:00.509 --> 00:48:05.079
These are your--very crassly put--these are
your future consumers, future users.

00:48:05.079 --> 00:48:11.730
It would be nice if they were more able and
adept at being able to play both of those

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:12.730
roles.

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:18.119
They're also your own children and your neighbor's
children, so they matter on that basis as

00:48:18.119 --> 00:48:19.119
well.

00:48:19.119 --> 00:48:20.119
Thank you.

00:48:20.119 --> 00:48:20.510
