00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.440
NARRATOR: This is a photo of
the North Korean military.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.260
It looks surprisingly
candid, given how secretive

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.870
the North Korean
government is known

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.990
to be about affairs of state.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.320
Then unsurprisingly, it is also
a photo that was planned out.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.050
Not so much by the photographer,
but by North Korea itself.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.910
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.730
MATT PAISH: Hi, my
name is Matt Paish.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.310
I'm a video producer
based in Bath, in the UK.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.270
The photo was taken on the
9th of September, 2012,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.160
which is actually National
Day in North Korea.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.650
So what we can see in
photo are some soldiers

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.420
from the Korean People's Army.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.500
Most of them are
facing away, towards

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.450
a huge, huge, huge,
monument, which

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.790
comprises two very big statues
of the leaders of North Korea.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.610
NARRATOR: Matt was visiting
North Korea while on vacation,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.200
which might come as a surprise.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.380
The hermit kingdom is not
known for it's booming tourism

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.180
industry.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.410
But still, Matt found
himself here, on a bus,

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.330
trying to figure out
this strange country.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.670
MATT PAISH: The tour I
took lasted for eight days,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.960
and what's most of the sites
we visited were in Pyongyang.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.190
Activities on the
itinerary included

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.620
visiting many, many
statues and monuments.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.660
We went to a couple of farms,
we went to a fruit processing

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.310
farm, an ostrich farm, we went
to an acrobatic show, a circus,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.515
we visited a maternity hospital,
a university, a music Academy,

00:01:41.515 --> 00:01:44.760
a museum of gifts
to the Great Leader.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.860
You did get the impression
that they've just

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.410
been created purely for
tourists, to go to on a bus.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.786
There were no other
people around there.

00:01:52.786 --> 00:01:55.350
NARRATOR: But this
insanely regimented tour

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.479
may not have been the most off
putting thing Matt experienced.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.520
MATT PAISH: One of the
things that people ask you

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.900
when you go on holiday,
is usually, you know,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.030
how were the people.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.370
Well, in North Korea,
we didn't really

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.810
meet any of the people
so-- Other countries

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.310
that you go to, that
you may stand out,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.670
and you're clearly a
foreigner, people are generally

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.020
quite interested in you
and you can see people just

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.277
staring at you perhaps.

00:02:17.277 --> 00:02:18.860
But in fact, that
didn't happen at all

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.730
in Pyongyang, which is
really quite a bizarre thing.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.660
People were walking past
you, but they're not

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.576
looking at you at all.

00:02:24.576 --> 00:02:27.150
So it's really strange thing.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.160
NARRATOR: So this
picture of the soldiers

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.240
was kind of emblematic
of the trip in general.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.950
A carefully managed
view of North Koreans,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.700
with no actual
interaction or information

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.780
about them or their lives.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.400
It was a trip full
of moments like this.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.300
Matt, and North Koreans, at a
distance, hardly able to even

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.214
acknowledge each
other's existence.

00:02:49.214 --> 00:02:51.130
MATT PAISH: North Korea
is one of these places

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.190
that you hear an awful lot about
in the news and in the media.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.520
So being able to
actually go to the place,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.130
and see real people walking
around in Pyongyang,

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.950
was a real insight.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.590
And I consider
myself to be quite

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.227
privileged to have seen it.

00:03:08.227 --> 00:03:09.810
NARRATOR: At This
Happened Here, we're

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.410
always coming up
with creative ways

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.120
to tell stories through photos.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.400

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.900
you.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.630

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.300

photographers can

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.850
change your perceptions of war.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.700
A US Marine experiences
an extremely close call

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.390
from a Taliban attack.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.750
The dirt wall protecting him,
exploding from an enemy bullet.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.760
We can see that the
soldier is in danger,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.400
but what about the person
who took the photo?

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.860
