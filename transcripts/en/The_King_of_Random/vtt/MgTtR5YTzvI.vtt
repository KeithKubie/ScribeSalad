00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.899
In today's video we're going to see what happens when you try to boil superglue and we'll try and answer the question is superglue flammable

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:22.709
Superglue is super interesting stuff also known as cyanoacrylate this glue works form a very quick and strong bond

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.080
Most people have only used or bought superglue in some very small quantities it often comes in

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.049
Tiny tubes that only have a few drops in them, but we've gotten our hands on an 8 ounce container of superglue

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.680
That's a full cup of superglue all in one spot. There are a few different things

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.450
I would really like to try using this much superglue. The first thing I want to try is heating it up

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.489
I want to see if you can boil superglue and if you can what happens to it, here's the basic idea

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.878
We're going to empty 8 ounces of our superglue into a saucepan

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.579
That won't be used for anything else then boil it on a hot plate

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.609
What do you think is going to happen will the superglue just evaporate?

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.049
Will it catch on fire or do you think it's going to explode we're doing this outside today?

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.970
Because even if you aren't boiling it super glue puts off some pretty powerful fumes

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.559
It can irritate your throat your eyes and your skin and I figure that when we heat it up

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.479
Those fumes are gonna be multiplied by quite a bit and I really don't want that in any confined space

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.979
So we're in a nice open area

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.540
We've even got a fair breeze passing through which should make it easy to avoid breathing in any of these fumes

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.780
first a very quick test as

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.000
to the stickiness of super glue

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.700
 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.960
My gloves and my gloves and now glue it together

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.220
peel apart

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.559
It does the exact same thing if you get it on your skin

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.600
But it really hurts to try and peel it apart

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.079
this much super glue is actually fairly dangerous because if this got on you in any large quantities,

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.170
It could require medical intervention to get it off

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.130
like if this were to spill all over my clothing

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.589
It could stick my clothing onto my skin and I wouldn't be able to pull it off

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.649
So I have to be very careful not to get any of this on you

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.229
This stuff is amazingly thin and clear. It really just looks like water I

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.239
Don't want to waste this super glue

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.798
But just because I've never actually seen this much super glue out of a container in one spot

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.140
You got to play with it a little bit

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.549
I'm gonna feel slightly slightly oily on my fingers right now

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.110
Which I'm sure would glue together if I tell them you can see little bits where it's been

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.439
Done you could glue as it dries out. It's just it just feels like you know water or thin oil

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.839
It's pretty nuts. I'll see if I can glue my glove onto this rock

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:48.839
 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.129
I am NOT holding on to this rock. It's holding on to me. Really

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.940
The glue hasn't completely cured so I can probably pull my fingers apart and make it drop the rock let's try it

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.810
Kind of

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.009
All right, since I don't want my movement permanently arrested I'm gonna take this glove off and put anyway

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.250
We're ready to turn on our stove, but I've got one more thing

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.929
I want to do just to protect everything before I do that and that's just to put a sheet of foil

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.809
over our hot plate in case the superglue

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.149
Boils up and out or something like that. I don't want to spill superglue all over this plate

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.179
So just one piece of foil going across the top that's it

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.260
All right. Let's turn this on to low the breeze we've got going on might make this take a little bit longer than normal

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.360
I'm not sure we'll be able to tell the difference since I've

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:50.089
Never boiled superglue before I don't even know if it will boil. It might just heat up for light on fire

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.730
Smoke a lot

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.760
We've got fumes I don't think I can call that steam since I don't think cyanoacrylate glue

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.980
Contains any water, but it's vapor of some kind

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.220
(random grunts)(eww nate!) Oh boy!

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.700
 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.600
That that went from zero to extremely powerful in no time at all. Oh

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.929
Good thing we are not doing this indoors or I'm pretty sure the whole indoors would be like that Oh,

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.199
still in my eyes

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.159
Got me again I was upwind. (JUST USE A FRIGGIN MASK OR SOMETHING NATE!)

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.599
We've got some good white vapor coming off of the saucepan with the superglue in it

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.409
But I want to try turning the heat up. It's not really changing much

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.329
It's been doing the same little bit of vapor thing for like five minutes now. I think it needs more heat

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.770
Let's take it up to medium

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.120
Fun fact superglue was developed while trying to find a way to make custom lenses

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.000
Very breezy

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.490
Oh

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.859
We are starting to get some bubbles at the bottom of the pan and it looks a lot like when you're heating up water

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.560
So maybe this is gonna boil. I want to help it along. So it's been on medium for almost 10 minutes now

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.560
I think it's time that we turn it up to high

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:24.720
All right a lot of white vapor and as my cameraman and I can both attest it sucks if you get too near it

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.699
So glad it's breezy since we've got a nice steady stream of air going that way I can get a nice up close to it

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.699
Put it stick in it. Ooh, I hear bubbly noises see bubbly things a

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.280
Little bit there's so much of this vapor now hard to get close to it and really look at what's going on in there. ( Use a mask man! Not that hard!)

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.149
Even though the vapor is being taken away this fast. I

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.030
Can't really see much down into the bottom. Oh

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.909
It's so fast in its pane

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.849
Just a tiny bit of it goes toward your face and all the sudden it stings kids do not try this at home

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:12.109
Or at a friend's house or in some random yard. Just don't try this. You'll get that vapor all over you and it will suck

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.929
That's some good boiling action going on in there. Now. That's that we can see it through the vapor. Oh

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:25.249
Man, it's almost gone. Like most of this is burning away and it's kind of a yellowish green color in there now

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.130
Had no color when we started very clear looked just like water. Oh wow

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:38.539
It's evenly this and goopy stuff. I can got strings of it coming off on the stick. Oh, I think we are just about out

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.289
Superglue is all boiled and burned away

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.080
The fumes certainly seem to be gone

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.080
All that's left is a very sticky

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.789
Not glue sticky, but like gooey residue at the bottom of this pan

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.030
when heck of a nonstick coating

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.329
You can superglue isn't sticking to it

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:05.389
This is the result of boiling away one entire cup of cyanoacrylate glue

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.569
there's this residue stuff which

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:16.489
Has really lost most of that power that super glue has like putting it near my nose

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:22.579
Breathing in I can smell the superglue smell, but it's not burning. It's not making my eyes water

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:26.789
Pretty mild

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:30.019
Compared to even just a normal little bottle of superglue if you just smell that

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.489
Usually it'll make you flinch. It's kind of acrid burns the inside of your nose a little bit. This is just

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:38.029
Yeah, it smells kind of like superglue. I'm not gonna taste it

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:43.250
I taste a lot of things not gonna taste this that's amazing. How much of it is gone

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.919
So that means most of what's in superglue

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.500
Can be boiled away

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:50.569
some white powdery residue

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.840
Up on the sides

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:56.329
That looks like it might have built up just from the vapor

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:02.239
Rather than the liquid disappearing. We do have some more superglue and there's one more test

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.280
I want to try with it right now and that's just to see what happens if we apply a more direct heat is

00:08:07.949 --> 00:08:14.629
Superglue flammable, we're gonna pour some superglue down into the saucepan then take a blowtorch and see if we can light it on fire

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.650
You have season flames

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.280
Oh

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.280
I think I did it

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:36.319
That's that's it. Superglue is flammable. It doesn't light quite like gasoline or even alcohol

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:41.989
It took a little bit of time to really catch but once it caught it seems to be burning quite nicely

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.340
whoo now

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:48.889
All of the superglue is hot enough that it's boiling in the saucepan when we heated the saucepan up on the stove

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.669
We had a lot of very thick white smoke that burned

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:59.419
my nose and my eyes and my lungs if I even got a little whiff of it and this is burning and it's boiling I

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.400
Don't see any white smoke. So I think the vapors themselves coming off of the superglue

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:11.299
Or getting burned up and are therefore not able to react the same way if it gets in my face a little bit it kind

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.349
Of smells like I don't know it kind of smells a little bit like some fireworks. Oh

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:23.270
And there's the white stuff and we don't want any of that that is the result of lighting superglue on fire

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.960
Yeah, it really does have a skunk smell to it

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.579
Heating superglue on a stove until it boils and lighting it on fire

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.170
interesting results from both of them

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.070
Here's a challenge

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:40.910
What are some things we could do with large quantities of superglue that we haven't already thought of liquid nitrogen?

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:46.729
I already thought about it vacuum chamber. I already thought about it dry-ice already thought about it furnace. I already thought about it

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:49.460
Give us something new we want you to get creative with this one

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:54.499
Tell us your thoughts and if we use an idea of yours that we haven't already come up with will send you 25 bucks

00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:00.410
guys, we still have more for you to see that little box up at the top will transport you directly to our last video if

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.940
You haven't seen it. You should go watch it

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:02.640
If you have seen it

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.140
Maybe watch it again

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:03.640
The box at the bottom will show you what YouTube thinks you should be watching next and this bomb here in the center will subscribe

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.640
You to our channel, so you never miss a video

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.720
Don't forget to ring that Bell and we will see you in the next one. Talk to you then
