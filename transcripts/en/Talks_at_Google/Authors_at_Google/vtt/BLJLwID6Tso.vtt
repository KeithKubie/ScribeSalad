[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.900
WILLIAM CLEGG:
Thank you very much.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.730
I never thought I would write
a book when the publishers came

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.040
to see me two and a half years
ago in my offices in 2 Bedford

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.280
Row in London, and put
to me the proposal that

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.920
has ended up with this
book, "Under the Wig."

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.140
The book itself is unusual.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.500
It is certainly not a
standard autobiography.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.880
And if it was
going to be that, I

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.490
don't think I would
have agreed to write it.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.120
The purpose of the book
is to really demystify

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.410
the profession of being a
barrister to the layman.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.060
It explains how you become a
barrister, how you qualify,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.460
how you join a set
of chambers, which

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.950
is what we call our offices.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.040
How you develop a
practice, how you prepare

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.890
a case, how you
prepare questions,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.290
win the confidence of a judge.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.380
How you might become a QC,
how you might become a judge,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.820
and so on.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.180
And it does it in a
way that hopefully

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.100
makes it digestible
to people who

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.930
really have little or no
idea about how the law works.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.760
I think in order to make the
book slightly more attractive

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.920
as a commercial venture, they've
interspersed every chapter

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.930
with another chapter, in
which I have talked about one

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.670
of the cases that
I've been involved

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.050
in over the years, that
people will often remember,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.870
and which for one
reason or another,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.920
is of general interest.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.810
They include, for example, those
with long memories, the murder

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.050
of Rachel Nickell on Wimbledon
Common, when I defended

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.920
a man called Colin Stagg,
who was charged and found

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.900
not guilty of her murder.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.580
And very unusually, my defensive
of the man who had actually

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.480
committed that murder for
another murder, where he

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.470
murdered a mother and child
very near Plumstead Common

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.600
a few years later.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.930
There was the shooting
of Jill Dando,

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.490
the TV presenter
of the "Holiday"

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.990
program and "Crimewatch."

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.720
The Chillenden
murders, the murder

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.360
of Doctor Lin Russell
and her daughter.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.300
And the attempted murder
of the second daughter,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.330
Josie Russell, who made
a miraculous recovery

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.820
from the injuries.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.970
And cases that I've done with
"Rough Justice," a program that

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.280
worked on BBC, trying to
correct miscarriages of justice.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.770
One quite amusing
case involving a man

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.450
being convicted on
the basis of an ear

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.890
print, which was
completely and utterly

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.250
debunked in a
subsequent trial, where

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.818
he was found to be not guilty.

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:17.590
The trial of Private Clegg, a
paratrooper in Northern Ireland

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.410
in the Troubles, who was
convicted of murder when

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.130
the patrol that he was on
was driven at by a stolen

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.840
car at high speed,
and they opened

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.530
fire, and the backseat
passenger was killed.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.550
And the forensic evidence that
ultimately turned that trial,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.060
again in a retrial
situation, to result

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.060
in a verdict of not guilty.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.230
And some war crimes trials,
that I may talk about a little

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.710
later.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.640
So that is the sort of
way the book is set out.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.210
And reverting to the sort of
theme of today's talk, murder,

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.230
I've defended, in my career,
over 100 people charged

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.490
with murder.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.740
And I presume that the
first question really to ask

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.910
is, who is likely to kill you?

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.140
Statistically, it
is not going to be

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.820
the stranger in the street,
grabbing you on the way home

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.820
and killing you,
or a man or woman

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.520
breaking into your house
with a sawn-off shotgun

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.050
to commit a burglary
and shooting you.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.020
The person most
likely to kill you

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:48.520
is your partner, your
parent, or your child.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.880
And that is, I'm afraid,
a statistical fact.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.140
Murder by stranger is
actually very rare.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.870
They are, in fact,
for us lawyers

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.360
the most interesting cases.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.560
Because so often,
murder in the family

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.580
doesn't require a great deal
of detective work to solve.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:18.070
And hence, they don't
provide for a challenge

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.320
so far as us lawyers
are concerned.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.340
So the ones that we
find interesting,

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.350
indeed the ones in this book,
are, all but one, I think,

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.300
examples of stranger murders.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.660
But statistically,
they are very rare.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.270
Why do people commit murder?

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.170
Having reflected very
much on 100-plus murders

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.850
that I have defended,
most murderers,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.350
most people who kill, have
no previous convictions

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.280
of any kind.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.130
They are not people
who've been in trouble

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.170
with the police in the past.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.410
They haven't been
stealing and fighting

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.320
during the course of their life.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.420
Most occasions,
they are people who

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.300
have just snapped, for
one reason or another,

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.130
and struck out with
terrifying results.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:24.620
And I do subscribe to a theory
that it is within all of us

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.710
the power to commit murder.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.690
And everybody here
will say, of course,

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.442
but I would never do it.

00:06:31.442 --> 00:06:32.900
You may look at
the chap next door,

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.670
and think, not sure about him.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.910
But I would never do it.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.020
Whatever the strains
and stresses in my life,

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.920
I would never kill
another human being.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:53.660
I'm afraid the evidence tends
to suggest to the contrary.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.970
For my part, at any rate, and
I put the mentally ill to one

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.390
side, who undoubtedly
do feature significantly

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:07.220
in murder statistics,
putting them to one side,

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.570
I can, for my part,
sympathize, although not

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.460
condone, of course, the plight
of a single mother bringing up

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:22.130
a child in a bedsit, driven mad
by a child screaming all night,

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.120
who shakes the child
until the child stops

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.060
because it stops breathing.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.300
I can also understand,
but not condone--

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:42.790
sorry-- understand but
not condone the attraction

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:48.940
to an unemployed black boy who
has no qualifications seeking

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.290
peer approval by carrying a
knife in a gang where he feels

00:07:53.290 --> 00:08:00.440
belonged and perhaps respected
for the only time in his life.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.010
But I think the
best demonstration

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:08.690
of the fact that it is
within the power of all of us

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:13.700
to commit murder is to
look at what has happened

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.870
in the field of war crimes.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:23.930
My practice has involved
defending people accused

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:27.740
of war crimes, both committed
in the Second World War

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.390
and in the Balkans conflict.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.799
I think it was in 1991 that
Parliament in this country

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:39.549
passed the War Crimes Act.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:42.299
Mrs. Thatcher was
the prime minister.

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:45.030
She was an enthusiast
of the act.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.520
She had a constituency
in North London

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.790
with a high Jewish population,
who were bringing pressure

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:56.490
on her to try war criminals
in this country who were still

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.360
alive, and had been named by
the Simon Wiesenthal Center

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:06.630
as war criminals, but we're
living here completely safe

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.310
from prosecution.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:13.110
Because our law does not allow
us to try extraterritorial

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.350
offenses unless
statute so provides.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.570
So, for example,
take a simple case,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.840
if you go shoplifting in Paris,
you can't be tried in London.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.850
You could be tried in Paris.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.100
If I go and punch somebody
on the nose in Berlin,

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.330
I commit a crime in Berlin.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.310
I commit no crime here.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.300
And so it applies with murder.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.799
If you go and murder
somebody in Poland,

00:09:33.799 --> 00:09:35.340
then you've committed
a murder there.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.800
That's where the
crime is committed.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.750
You haven't committed
any crime here.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.060
You can't be tried here.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.640
Of course, the trouble
with the war crimes

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.780
was that the majority of the
crimes that concerned people

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.750
in this country
had been committed

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.955
in that corridor between
the Baltic states, Latvia

00:09:55.955 --> 00:09:59.220
and Lithuania, Estonia, down
through Poland, into Belarus

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.720
and the Ukraine, that were
a corridor that was invaded

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.930
by the Nazis during
the Second World War

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.710
and which had a high Jewish
population, following

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.470
from the expulsion of
the Jews from Russia,

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.930
by, I think it was,
Peter the Great.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:21.570
So there was a significant
corridor of Europe

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:25.860
that did have quite a
significant Jewish population.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.170
And for historic
reasons, quite a few

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.670
of the people involved in those
killings ended up in London.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.250
And I'll explain
why a little later.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.890
But it's a curious
story in itself.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:42.090
And they, of course, could
not be prosecuted here,

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:47.480
because the crime had been
committed in Belarus or Poland.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.269
And they couldn't
be prosecuted there,

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:50.810
because when the
Iron Curtain was up,

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:54.950
there was no question of
any extradition in relation

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:57.500
to those countries at all.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.890
And indeed, they would probably
not be liable to extradition,

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.760
because you can't
extradite somebody

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.450
who's going to face the death
penalty in the country to which

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:09.260
they are going, unless there's
a copper-bottomed guarantee

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.170
by that government that
they will not be executed.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:17.250
So they had been living here
quite normally since the Second

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:17.910
World War.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:23.190
And were then, already, old men.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:28.350
The first man to be
arrested for war crimes

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:32.220
was a man called
Szymon Serafinowicz.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:39.930
And I came to represent
him by pure chance.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:46.590
A solicitor who used to instruct
our chambers with fairly

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:50.940
mundane cases had
an article clerk,

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.820
somebody training to
be a solicitor, who

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:59.460
was playing snooker in a snooker
hall in Dorking, in Surrey.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.960
And the chap on the
next table said to him,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.070
you're a solicitor, aren't you?

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.910
To which he
untruthfully said yes.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.120
And he said, my dad's
in a bit of trouble.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.130
Do you think you can
possibly help him?

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.955
To which he said, yeah, all
right, what's he charged with?

00:12:17.955 --> 00:12:20.890
He said genocide.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.000
So that brought the game
to a fairly rapid end.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.850
And it wasn't long after that
Szymon Serafinowicz rolled up

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.240
in my office.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:38.100
And just reading from
the book, "Serafinowicz

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.550
was the Belorussian
police commander

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.200
in the small town of Mir.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.200
He had somehow managed to
engineer himself a reason

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.660
to be away from Mir on the day
the Einsatzgruppen massacred

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.820
the town's Jews.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.040
Though he would have been
responsible for deploying

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.600
his officers, who were present.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.740
Instead, he was charged with
four counts of murdering Jews

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:10.880
in 1941, during the
so-called mopping up

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.900
operations conducted by
the Belorussian police

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.670
on Nazi orders."

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.190
Now, just pausing there.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:23.660
What had happened
was, that the Nazis

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:28.850
had put into place something
that was unbelievably

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.520
called the Final Solution.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:35.060
And the Final
Solution was a plan

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:39.740
to murder every Jew
in Eastern Europe.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.640
And that was to be achieved by
having the Einsatzgruppen, that

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.840
was a specialist
squad of soldiers,

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.640
move slowly from village to
village, from town to town,

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.570
and literally round up all
the Jews, who then had already

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:01.010
been confined in ghettos, and
were required to wear clothes

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:05.300
with a yellow star on
for easy identification,

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.860
march them out of the village
or town to an open space,

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:14.300
where normally a pit had been
dug, herd them to the pit,

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.430
and machine gun them.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:21.600
Get them all into the pit,
fill it in, and then move on

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.310
to the next town or village.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:29.620
Now this horrifying, almost
unbelievable practice,

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.950
was going on day,
after day, after day.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.200
And the Belorussian
local police force

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.700
came into it in
the following way.

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.850
Because word was getting
round to the Jews

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.210
in the ghettos what
was going to happen.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.810
Some thought it was
just ludicrous rumors

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.140
and couldn't possibly be true.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:54.690
Others could see the way life
was going and believed it.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.910
And some would hide.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.930
We had witnesses in the case
who had taken the floorboards up

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.320
of their house and
got the children

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.820
and themselves under
the floorboards

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.430
and got other people to
nail them down again.

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.830
So that when they did
the sweep through,

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:11.970
there was no sign of them.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.511
And then, obviously,
afterwards, they

00:15:13.511 --> 00:15:20.930
would break out and try to see
if they could survive the war.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.360
The role of the
Belorussian police

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.280
was, that once the
Einsatzgruppen moved on

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:32.390
to the next village, they were
given the task of mopping up,

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.290
as it was called.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.090
In other words, any
Jew that was found

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:45.250
who had survived
the first massacre

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.080
would be shot by
the local police.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.520
And then thereby ensuring the
successful outcome, as they

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.700
saw it, of the Final Solution.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.580
Inevitably, some
Jews did survive.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.240
One remarkably passed
himself off as a Gentile

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.430
and worked in the
German cavalry stables

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.430
for most of the
rest of the year.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:14.860
And when finally unmasked
as a Jew and put into a cell

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.560
to await execution,
a German officer

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.430
went and left the door open
to allow him to escape.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.300
Another found
refuge in a convent

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.730
and spent the whole of
the remainder of the war

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.980
in hiding in a convent.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.570
Many more went into
the woods and lived

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:38.170
a terribly hard, primitive
life in the woods

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.720
with partisans, who
were already there,

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.270
who were primarily communists.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.700
And fought the
Germans from there.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.350
And a number of
them also survived.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.080
And these people
were still alive

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.380
in the 1990s and
early 2000s and were

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:58.240
able to come over
here to give evidence.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:05.170
But picking up on
Serafinowicz's position.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.930
"Instead, he was charged with
four counts of murdering Jews

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.180
in 1941, during the
so-called mopping up

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.030
operations conducted by
the Belorussian police

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.099
on Nazi orders.

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:18.520
By the time the Nazi
death squads got to Mir,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.109
quite a number of
the town's Jews,

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.650
having got word of
the impending roundup,

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:26.349
had fled into the forests or
hidden under the floorboards

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:27.849
of their houses.

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:31.790
As a result, quite a few
survived the massacre.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.400
When they later discarded
their yellow starred clothing,

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.550
they believed they were
safe, because the Nazis had

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.820
no way of knowing whether
they were Jewish or not.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.710
They were unaware
that the local police

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.830
had been enlisted to
identify any Jews left

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:49.160
after the massacre
and eliminate them.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.360
Amazingly, some lived
to tell the tale.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.100
Survivors remained
in the forests

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:59.120
for three years, many joining
existing partisan groups

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.300
of communist sympathizers
who'd escaped the Nazis,

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.660
and some forming their
own partisan groups.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.810
Others concealed themselves
in the weave of ordinary life.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:20.810
One man, who was herded
to the death pits,

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:24.710
toppled unscathed into the
pit as everyone around him

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:28.680
was cut to shreds
by machine gun fire,

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.340
and was covered in as
the pit was filled in.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:36.090
Later that night, he dug himself
out from under the dead bodies

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.620
and survived the war."

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:45.700
It was a remarkable
case to be involved in.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:55.450
And provided a very
keen insight into what

00:18:55.450 --> 00:19:02.590
was it that made the police
participate in those mopping up

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.655
operations.

00:19:05.655 --> 00:19:10.720
Serafinowicz himself
was called the commander

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.220
of the local police force.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.830
In truth, he was little more
than the station sergeant.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.070
It was quite a small town.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.750
And he had ensured
that he was not

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:23.220
in the town on the day of
the Einsatzgruppen massacre.

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.560
And had made sure
that he was elsewhere,

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.730
perhaps indicating a
desire to distance himself

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.110
from that awful event.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.420
He certainly couldn't stop it.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.360
And any attempt to stop
it would have had him

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.220
shot without a doubt.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:44.890
In the aftermath,
the evidence was

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:51.870
that he had participated in some
of the cleaning up operations,

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.570
largely under
German supervision.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:58.710
And had gone out to villages
where locals were shot.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:09.350
The position was that
when the Nazis originally

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:17.000
invaded Belarus, they were
looked upon by liberators,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.230
by many of the locals.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:23.040
Because before that, they had
been under Russian occupation.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.280
And they were an extremely
harsh occupying force.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.510
And had shot, and
had sent to work,

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:35.330
labor camps, many of the
so-called intellectuals

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.590
in the village.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.990
Doctors and people like
that, who for some reason

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:41.780
were perceived to
be anti-communist,

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.640
were all shipped off.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:49.940
So the original German invasion
was seen as a liberation.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.520
Views soon changed.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:56.170
They were out of the
frying pan into the fire.

00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:01.130
But those who had been
sympathetic to the communists

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:05.000
were promptly shot by the
Nazis when they arrived.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.050
And going on in history, when
the Russians then re-invaded,

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.570
anybody who'd been
sympathetic to the Nazis

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.860
was then shot by the Russians.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.120
So if ever there was
a time to be neutral,

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.890
it was undoubtedly then.

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:22.190
And one is-- with
Serafinowicz, in a case,

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:28.280
where he was a perfectly
ordinary police sergeant who

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.610
before the war was
busy investigating

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:35.180
whether one farmer had stolen
some chickens from another one,

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.950
and who had managed to
butcher so-and-so's cow.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:44.090
And that was the extent really
of his role in the community.

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:45.590
There was never any
question that he

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:51.920
had any anti-Semite beliefs
or anything like that.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.630
He was just an
ordinary policeman.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:59.650
When the Germans
invaded, had he not

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:02.950
complied with their directions,
he would undoubtedly

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.160
have been shot.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:14.170
So in a way, faced with that
awful dilemma, what he did

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:20.940
was to follow orders and to
ensure that at least some

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:27.660
of those who were Jews who had
survived the original massacre

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.890
were, in fact, executed.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:34.220
But it's an illustration.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:39.800
And the first today of
somebody who would never

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:44.930
have committed any
crime at all in his life

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.730
were it not for
the circumstances

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:50.120
in which fate placed him in.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.030
And I don't think
anybody can actually

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:59.180
say how we would have acted
in those circumstances.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.442
Because we've never been
put in those circumstances.

00:23:02.442 --> 00:23:04.150
It's easy now to say,
well, I, of course,

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:05.191
would never have done it.

00:23:05.191 --> 00:23:07.520
They could have shot me,
but I wouldn't have done it.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:12.920
But can anybody here actually
imagine the sort of questions

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.240
that people like him had
to address an answer?

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:21.530
Of course, when he
was arrested here,

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.950
we were then put in the
position of investigating

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:28.920
crimes that had happened
nearly 50 years before.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.600
And so much of the facts
of what had happened

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.000
had become part
of local folklore,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.510
being told and retold
a thousand times.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:41.420
And how much was a
reflection of those stories?

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:45.080
And how much was
actually genuine memory?

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.760
It was difficult to ascertain.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.760
But I certainly had
to cross-examine

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.430
an elderly pensioner
on the basis

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:56.000
that when he was 13 years
old, looking out of a window,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.430
he might have been
mistaken as to who

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:04.460
he had seen parading seven
Jews to what was ultimately

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.780
their execution.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:09.950
And how reliable the memory
of a 13-year-old child

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.970
was when he was then
an elderly pensioner

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:18.825
is something I'm still
very unhappy about.

00:24:18.825 --> 00:24:25.310
Serafinowicz ended up in
England in a rather curious way.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:31.670
Because when the fortunes of
war turned and the Germans were

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.220
in retreat from
the Russian front,

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:39.700
it became perfectly
obvious to those in Belarus

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.770
that the Russians would be
back sooner rather than later.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:46.550
Because they could see the
retreating army of Germany.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:50.240
And there is no doubt at
all that if the Germans had

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.210
got into Mir and
Serafinowicz was still there,

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.100
they'd have shot
him, because he would

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.580
have been down as
a Nazi sympathizer,

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.430
as indeed, they shot all the
other policemen who had not

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.020
escaped.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:09.620
So by a circuitous route,
through Austria, and Hungary,

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:17.120
and Italy, he managed to
get to the Allied front

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:24.374
and joined the Italian army
that was then fighting.

00:25:24.374 --> 00:25:26.540
Although Mussolini was
originally on the other side,

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.340
there was, in fact,
a brigade that was

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.290
fighting with the Allies.

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:34.640
And ended up fighting the
Germans in North Italy.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:40.730
And after that, he was
allowed to come here.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:44.060
And indeed, did come here, as
did many others, who could not,

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.890
of course, have gone
back to Belorussia,

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.750
to his home, because
he'd just have been shot.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.550
So he came here and
worked as a carpenter

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:56.120
until he retired and had never
committed any criminal offense

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.340
in this country at all.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.070
Thereby, perhaps demonstrating
that this is not somebody

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:06.860
who, without the pressure,
the extraordinary predicament

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.620
he was placed in, would
have ever offended.

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:14.065
He, sadly, never stood trial.

00:26:14.065 --> 00:26:15.440
I say sadly because
I think there

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.020
was a reasonable chance he would
have been found not guilty.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.720
Because he had done
quite a lot to mitigate

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.730
the local population
against the Nazis.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.920
And had negotiated
with them for people

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.590
to be saved who were due
to be executed and so on.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.200
And when I went to
Belarus, I found a woman

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.750
who still prayed for
him every day for saving

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:39.260
the life of her husband.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:43.400
He, sadly, developed Alzheimer's
before the case could be heard,

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.610
and was found unfit to stand
trial, and died very shortly

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:49.160
afterwards.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.390
And that caused a slight change
in approach by the prosecution.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:58.730
Because they had picked him out
of the potential war criminals

00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:04.050
because they felt he was
in a position of command.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:07.460
And they didn't want to just
go for a private in the army

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.300
and prosecute him.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.030
They wanted somebody who was
in a position of command,

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.540
to make the process
worthwhile in their eyes.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.820
And I can see the logic of that.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.830
Of course, by the time
the case was over,

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:21.766
it dawned on them that anybody
in a position of command

00:27:21.766 --> 00:27:23.015
was likely to be in their 90s.

00:27:26.325 --> 00:27:27.700
And as likely as
not, there would

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.450
be the same problem with health
as they had with Serafinowicz.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.390
So the next chap
they tried was a chap

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:38.020
called Anthony
Sawoniuk, who was known

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.840
as "Andrusha the Bastard."

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:46.360
And that is, indeed, the
title of the chapter about him

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.530
in the book.

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:52.360
And he was called
that because that

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:59.740
is how he was known in
his village in Belarus.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:05.350
He was from an extremely poor
family with no father, hence

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:08.890
the name.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:12.160
And his mother made a
pittance of a living

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.520
doing washing for other
families in the village.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.430
They had no land.

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:20.470
So unlike many
others, they were not

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:24.070
able to scratch a
living from the soil.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:30.910
He had been badly
bullied at school.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:34.240
And when the Germans invaded,
he was then, I think,

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.740
17 years old.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.650
And when they asked
for volunteers

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:42.770
to join the police
force, he volunteered.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.730
He'd never had any
employment before.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:48.430
And it must have
seemed to him that this

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:54.040
was a golden opportunity
to improve his lifestyle.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:58.250
For the first time in his
life, he was given a purpose.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:59.810
He was given a salary.

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.590
And he was given a gun.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:05.290
And he became a very
officious policeman,

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:08.670
that much was clear, getting
his own back on all the people

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.770
who'd been bullying
him for years.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:15.340
And became very
unpopular in the village.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.820
And here, I'm afraid, did
take, so it would appear,

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:23.830
to the task of rounding
up any surviving

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:27.460
Jew from the massacre in his
village with a great deal

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:31.870
more enthusiasm
than Serafinowicz.

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.870
But I mean, I think
that perhaps reflected

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:37.060
on somebody who was
very much influenced

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.980
by the propaganda of the time.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.200
He was not an
intelligent man at all.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.380
Serafinowicz was perfectly
intelligent individual.

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:48.610
He was, I'm afraid,
rather stupid.

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:54.250
And was eventually
convicted of two counts

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:57.490
of murder following
his trial and sentenced

00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:59.510
to prison for life.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:02.500
But rather like Serafinowicz,
he had lived here

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:07.780
working, in fact, for the London
Underground, ever since 1946,

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:08.830
until his retirement.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.120
Never committed any offense.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.910
Never been shoplifting, never
punched anyone on the nose.

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:16.510
Never done anything at all,
or anything before the war.

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:20.350
But again, circumstance
had involved him

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:31.870
in participating in cold-blooded
murder of surviving Jews

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:37.930
in a way that was, when looked
at in any ordinary eyes,

00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:39.595
truly terrible.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:56.850
He took, with other policemen,
five Jewish prisoners

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:58.950
into the woods
outside the village.

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:02.010
Domaczewo was the
name of his village.

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:06.810
And pressed a gun against
the skull of each of them

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:09.330
and pulled the trigger.

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:15.300
And it's difficult to imagine a
more awful or cold-blooded way

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:20.700
to execute people, particularly
bearing in mind that numbers

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.100
two, three, four, and five,
of course, had seen what's

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:27.490
happened to those before them.

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.920
So what he did, and it
was proved in the trial

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:38.610
that he had done, although
he denied it in his trial,

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:44.910
was really quite
unbelievable cruelty.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:49.320
Yet, he was a man who
had never committed

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.170
any crime of any kind.

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:54.990
And I venture to suggest that
both Serafinowicz and Sawoniuk,

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:58.740
had there been no war would
have lived their entire lives

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.050
entirely peacefully
without committing

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:04.690
any offense of any kind.

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:09.720
And the same thing really
happened in the Balkans War,

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:18.660
which was a truly terrible
conflict involving, as it did,

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:23.880
genocide on a pretty
terrifying scale.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:36.600
And I was instructed there to
do the appeal in the first war

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:41.160
crimes prosecution in
an international setting

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.340
since Nuremberg
in 1946, which was

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:49.440
when the UN set up the court
for the former Yugoslavia

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.300
in the Hague.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.770
And the first person to be
defended there was a man

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.460
called Dusko Tadic.

00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:00.690
And I went to see him.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:03.570
"I met Tadic in the
United Nations detention

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:07.110
facility, which was
a jail within a jail,

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.300
outside the Hague.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.700
I had to go through
a Dutch jail to get

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.940
to the detention center,
where the security was

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.340
provided by UN guards.

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:21.180
It smelt of stale cabbage,
like all other prisons

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:22.680
I have visited.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.660
But it was more peaceful
than a normal prison,

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.790
with plenty of time for
visits when families

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.990
could make the journey.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:32.520
The relaxed atmosphere was
fostered by the Irish governor,

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.140
who had managed
to house prisoners

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:38.940
on opposite sides of the
conflict without any animosity

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.220
that I could detect.

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:44.820
Tadic seemed to be
a gentle family man.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.820
Like Serafinowicz
and Sawoniuk, he

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.550
was not a general or politician
who had ordered troops

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:54.010
to engage in genocide
or ethnic cleansing,

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.700
but a low-ranked
traffic policeman who

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.550
had previously been a postman.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:03.060
Like many others who behaved
barbarously during the war,

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.870
he had lived a perfectly
conventional life beforehand,

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:10.830
exhibiting no signs of racial
prejudice or anti-Muslim

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:12.510
sentiments.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:15.120
Once the war
started, however, he

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.480
joined the Serbian
Paramilitary Force,

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.780
which murdered Muslims in
cold blood solely because

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:24.030
of their religion.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:27.030
Tadic had been convicted of
shooting two Muslim policemen

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:31.350
in the head during an
operation of ethnic cleansing

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:35.190
through the territory
of Prijedor in Bosnia.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:37.290
The Muslims in the
towns and villages

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:40.560
visited by the
paramilitary force

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.620
would have the men separated
from the women and children

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:46.889
and taken away to
concentration camps.

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:49.949
Frequently, though, the Muslims
would receive prior warnings

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:52.590
that the paramilitaries
were on their way

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:56.460
and would evacuate to
a safe place nearby.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.250
Two policemen who were
Muslims were still in the town

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.320
when the gunmen arrived.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.900
They were detained in
the marketplace when

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.600
Tadic was alleged to
have walked up to them,

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:10.080
put a pistol to their
head, and fired.

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:14.400
This was seen by one witness,
Nihad Seferovic, a Muslim who

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.880
had escaped before the
paramilitaries arrived, but had

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.890
returned to the village in
order to feed his pet pigeons."

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:26.910
Tadic's conviction rested
on his evidence alone.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:37.520
And there again was a case
where a perfectly ordinary man,

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:42.050
postman, then a
traffic policeman,

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:45.800
had killed two men in
completely cold blood,

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:53.060
having been caught up in a
war where the propaganda was

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:57.750
pitching religion
against religion.

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.830
And he had been living, as
indeed most of the people who

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:03.710
I came across in the
Balkan conflicts,

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:07.070
who had been charged with
war crimes, had been living,

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.610
cheek by jowl with
peoples of other religions

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:14.330
in perfect harmony
before the war began.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:18.350
And it's quite
extraordinary to me

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:22.010
just how people
were managed to be

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:25.940
recruited to play such a
part in the genocide that

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:26.810
went on there.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:36.680
After I did his case, I was
asked to defend another Bosnian

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:41.990
Serb, called Goran
Jelisic, who had

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:45.090
been convicted of war crimes.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.650
But, in fact,
acquitted of genocide.

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.830
Who was in charge of one
of the concentration camps

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:56.360
where he would, it would
appear for his own pleasure,

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:01.160
torture and kill inmates
who were Muslims.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.590
He was a slightly
different individual

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:08.420
and I suspect was
really a psychopath.

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:16.730
He was a very cold and difficult
to reason with individual,

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:19.340
as opposed to Tadic, who
had a delightful family who

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.840
would come to visit him.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:23.550
Gave me a bottle of the
most disgusting plum vodka

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:28.280
I've ever had in my life as
a Christmas present one year.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:34.940
Whereas, Jelisic was not such
an attractive individual.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:44.810
And then, finally, I acted for
another man, called Josipovic.

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:53.240
I mean, just to reflect on
the allegations in his case,

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.660
"I was instructed to act
in the appeal for Drago

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.550
Josipovic, a Bosnian
Croat, convicted

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:02.810
with four others of carrying
out a blood-curdling attack

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:06.710
on Ahmici, a small
village in central Bosnia

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:09.950
on the 16th of April 1993.

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:13.970
More than 100 civilian Muslim
men, women, and children

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:18.950
were killed in the assault,
which was part of a rampage

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:23.600
by the Croatian military
police, known as "The Jokers,"

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.200
through Muslim settlements
in the Lasva Valley.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.110
All 169 Muslim
houses in the village

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:32.960
were destroyed, along
with two mosques.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.450
Not a single Croat
home was torched."

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:45.650
It's an incident in that war
that has still to this day

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:50.000
sent shock waves through
those who have read about it.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.980
As I say, more than 100 people
were shot or burnt alive

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.480
in that massacre.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.270
And yet, he was a
perfectly charming man,

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:02.720
who'd lived a perfectly
law-abiding life, up

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:07.190
until the moment when
that conflict began.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:14.000
So reverting to the sort
of theme of the talk,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.180
why do people commit murder?

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.780
I think it's circumstance.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:24.320
Circumstance can put
you in a position

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:29.060
whereby people act in a way that
they would never act otherwise.

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:33.500
It can happen in a
domestic setting.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:41.940
It can happen as a result of
war and international conflict.

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:44.510
But it's not a crime that
is committed generally

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:48.350
by criminals, in the
sense of people who've

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:51.410
been in trouble throughout
their life with the police

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:53.190
or anything like that.

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:56.840
It's a crime that
can be committed,

00:39:56.840 --> 00:40:00.320
and statistically is most
likely to be committed,

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:05.390
by the person you love,
your neighbor, your partner,

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:09.110
your parent, or your child.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:11.630
So just reflect
on that as we come

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:16.250
to Christmas, which is
always statistically

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:20.941
a high time for murder.

00:40:20.941 --> 00:40:22.190
Which is more business for me.

00:40:26.467 --> 00:40:27.800
I'm keeping an eye on the clock.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.133
Because I know you've all got
jobs to do this afternoon,

00:40:30.133 --> 00:40:30.770
and I haven't.

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:34.520
And there's about
15 minutes left.

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:38.020
So I'm very keen to
take some questions.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:44.040
I've focused just on one aspect
of my career and everything

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:44.540
else.

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:48.260
And I mean, there are,
in the book, of course,

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:51.470
quite a lot of examples
of miscarriages of justice

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:52.930
in a domestic setting.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:56.280
But I don't think I've got time
to go into those in any detail

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:56.780
now.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.940
So you'll have to buy the
book, those of you who haven't

00:40:58.940 --> 00:40:59.990
already got one, that is.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:03.300
But I'm very happy to
take any questions at all.

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:06.770
Generally, not just about
what I've spoken about today,

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:09.500
but about the profession
or anything else, if there

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.754
are any.

00:41:11.754 --> 00:41:13.170
AUDIENCE: Hi, I
was just wondering

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:17.420
what you think about the
rising popularity of true crime

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:19.620
and whether programs
like "Making

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:23.280
a Murderer," or
podcasts like "Serial,"

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.640
have been kind of useful
from a justice perspective,

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.280
or actually detrimental,
in terms of everyone

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.560
weighing in with their own not
necessarily informed opinion?

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.140
WILLIAM CLEGG: I did
watch "Making a Murderer,"

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:40.140
but I'm afraid I haven't got
enough energy to see more than

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:42.250
about the first two episodes.

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:45.060
I thought it was a bit slow.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:51.720
But I think it's very
difficult to actually equate

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.190
that with a real life.

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:54.760
I know it's a true story.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:42:00.180
But it seemed so
far removed to me

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.990
from what we would come across
as lawyers that I didn't really

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:12.760
find it either very interesting
or particularly helpful.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:16.470
So I don't think that those sort
of programs really do any harm.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.290
But I really don't
think they do any good.

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:22.970
I think the programs
that do rather better

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:26.910
are those that focus on a
case where there's perhaps

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:31.500
been a miscarriage of justice
and explore what went wrong

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.470
and why.

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:37.320
And we've seen cases about
Guildford Four, the Birmingham

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:41.080
Six, Colin Stagg.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.620
They're doing one now
about the Jill Dando

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:48.150
case and Barry George, that may
be broadcast early next year.

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:50.220
I think those sort of
cases are probably better,

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.380
because they focus
on a particular crime

00:42:53.380 --> 00:43:00.740
and analyze that in
a way that's more

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:03.320
like an investigative
bit of journalism

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:04.920
than the sort of
"Making a Murderer,"

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:07.520
that I just didn't
like it very much.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.720
Did anyone else like it?

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.520
Did people like it?

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.390
Yeah, they did.

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:12.780
No, no one liked it.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.062
The gentleman here I
know had a question.

00:43:15.062 --> 00:43:16.520
AUDIENCE: I just
wonder whether you

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.561
think there should be some
statute of limitations

00:43:18.561 --> 00:43:21.549
for some of these crimes?

00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:22.340
WILLIAM CLEGG: Yes.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
up to six years,

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:25.463
but you know, someone
can remember something

00:43:25.463 --> 00:43:26.500
from 40 years ago.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.730
WILLIAM CLEGG: It's
extremely difficult,

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:29.900
a statute of limitation.

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:33.780
Some countries do
have it, of course.

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:38.090
I don't think that the quality
of justice in the Second World

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:42.350
War war crimes investigation
was terribly high.

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:46.310
Because I think so much evidence
has been lost over the years.

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:51.150
And my own personal view was
that was too little, too late.

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:54.740
But I do find that in
some of these cases, where

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:59.330
you have pedophile cases,
where people have only

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:01.970
been able to come
forward after many years,

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:06.740
to describe what happened to
them when they were children,

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:10.190
it seems to me that those sort
of cases should be prosecuted,

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:12.680
because the reason
they weren't prosecuted

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.600
before was because
the person accused

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:19.760
had so terrified the victim
that they hadn't got the ability

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.140
really to complain before.

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:22.950
So it is difficult.

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:25.640
I mean, we're dealing
with pedophile cases

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:29.460
going back 40 years and more
in the courts at the moment.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:35.480
And it is one of the growth
areas for criminal justice.

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:40.130
Not long ago, nearly a quarter
of cases in the Crown Court

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:43.790
involved some sort of crime
of sexual-- sexual crime

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:46.850
of some sort, either
historic or current.

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:50.400
Which was an amazing statistic
compared with 20 years ago.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.344
AUDIENCE: And over the
course of your career

00:44:55.344 --> 00:44:56.760
and the length of
your career, you

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:02.100
must have seen a huge change in
both the use and sophistication

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:08.456
of forensic evidence and that
type of DNA sampling and so on.

00:45:08.456 --> 00:45:10.080
I'd be fascinated to
hear your thoughts

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.080
on the extent to which
it's improved or changed

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:16.740
the prosecution process.

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:21.000
WILLIAM CLEGG: Well, DNA
has been a fantastic aid

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.540
to criminal investigations.

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:29.610
I mentioned briefly the
Rachel Nickell murder in 1974,

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:31.980
I think it was.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:35.250
There, the man who had
really murdered her was a man

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:37.110
called Robert Napper.

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:40.500
Colin Stagg was undoubtedly
completely innocent.

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:46.860
And it was only years later
when DNA profiling had developed

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:49.120
to such an extent,
that for the first time

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:54.030
they were able to analyze
a tiny DNA profile left

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:57.200
on Rachel Nickell's
body by the murderer,

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:01.050
that they were able to
identify that profile as coming

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:05.190
from Robert Napper, who
had, by that time, murdered

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:09.940
another woman in very
similar circumstances.

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:12.312
And that's an
illustration, if you like,

00:46:12.312 --> 00:46:14.520
of that crime being solved,
where it would never have

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.790
been solved otherwise, by DNA.

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:20.370
Another case that's in the book,
just by way of illustration,

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:23.520
is a case of a man
called Mark Dallagher.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.550
He was a Rough Justice
case that I did.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:29.920
And he'd been convicted
because of his ear print.

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:33.660
A woman was murdered
in Huddersfield

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:39.150
during a burglary, a 96-year-old
widow, smothered by a pillow.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:42.060
And the police found
a perfect ear print

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.120
on the outside
window of the house.

00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.740
And the theory was
that the burglar

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.990
had put his ear to the window,
couldn't hear anything,

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:50.550
and had broken in.

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:54.290
And a rather idiotic
policeman from Holland

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:58.140
called van der Lugt,
if you believe it,

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:01.680
had given evidence that
ear prints are unique.

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.750
And it was
Dallagher's ear print.

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:06.606
Well, he was convicted of
murder on this daft evidence

00:47:06.606 --> 00:47:07.980
and spent about
eight years there

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:11.100
before I got
involved in the case.

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.230
The court of appeal
overturned the verdict

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.300
on the basis of fresh evidence.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.820
And again, it was DNA
evidence that was not

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.230
available at the time,
but available then,

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:23.370
that managed to extract
a particle of DNA

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:25.860
from the center of
that ear print, which

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.740
proved conclusively
that whoever did it,

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:30.447
it could not possibly
be Mark Dallagher.

00:47:30.447 --> 00:47:32.280
So there were two cases
where they've really

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:35.430
made a big contribution.

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:41.460
And I think now DNA is
more valuable to crime

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:44.320
detection than fingerprints.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.370
It's been a huge advance.

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:50.310
And it's enabled people
who've been acquitted

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:54.390
of crimes that they
were guilty of years ago

00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:57.390
to be retried on fresh
evidence and justice

00:47:57.390 --> 00:48:01.600
to be done when evidence
that wasn't there before,

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.599
which must be good
for everybody.

00:48:04.599 --> 00:48:06.390
AUDIENCE: I just had
a question, presumably

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:08.639
that some of the people that
you've been representing,

00:48:08.639 --> 00:48:13.350
you've faced intense press
scrutiny, or scrutiny

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:14.940
from the court of
public opinion.

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:16.860
I just wondered how
you dealt with that,

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:20.940
because I'm sure people
have taken offense maybe

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:24.270
to some of the people that
you've represented or defended.

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:28.020
WILLIAM CLEGG:
Yes, the answer is

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:31.410
that there has been a great
deal of press interest in a lot

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:34.840
of cases that I've done.

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:37.590
But I think, in a sense,
the barristers are slightly

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:41.850
protected from it.

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:46.710
And I've certainly never
had any personal criticism

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:48.510
for defending in a case.

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:52.500
One thing we're always asked
is, how can you defend somebody

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:55.470
who you know is guilty?

00:48:55.470 --> 00:49:02.340
And the answer to that question
is quite an easy one to give,

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:06.880
but it requires a moment's
reflection, really.

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:09.614
We can't defend anybody who
tells us that they are guilty.

00:49:09.614 --> 00:49:12.030
So if somebody comes to me and
says, look, I did kill him,

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:13.350
but I want you to get me off.

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:15.150
I say, well, I can't defend you.

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:17.730
You've either got to plead
guilty or go somewhere else.

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:21.330
I can't do it, because you've
told me you've done the crime.

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:24.800
And that is an absolute rule.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:27.934
However, if there is strong
evidence against somebody,

00:49:27.934 --> 00:49:29.350
but they come to
me and say, look,

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:31.099
I don't know what the
evidence looks like,

00:49:31.099 --> 00:49:33.630
but I tell you I
didn't do it, then

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:38.550
we are not only able to defend
him, it's professionally

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:41.400
required that we do defend
him, because we have something

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.960
called the cab rank rule, which
means rather like the taxi,

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.750
we have to take the next
case that we are given,

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:51.600
that we are able to
fit into our diary

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.510
and is being paid at the
rate we normally charge.

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:59.250
We cannot say, I don't like
that case because it's got a lot

00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:01.050
of evidence against
it, I think I'll lose,

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:04.500
or I don't like the allegation,
or I won't defend it

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:08.060
because it's involving a rape,
which I think is so awful,

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:09.060
I won't defend somebody.

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.650
You have to take the next case.

00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:14.880
And that ensures that everybody,
however heinous the crime

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:18.180
that they've been accused of,
will be defended by somebody.

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:22.560
Because unless they are, you've
got no justice system at all.

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.700
So it's the cab rank rule.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:25.530
It also protects us.

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:28.330
Because the answer
to anybody who says,

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:32.100
well, I was asked to do the case
and under the cab rank rule,

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.050
I'm not allowed to refuse it.

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:36.450
So it gives us a
good get-out as well.

00:50:39.610 --> 00:50:41.850
After this, next.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:43.840
AUDIENCE: I'm just
wondering in your 47 years,

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.530
we talk about access to
justice and we see, obviously,

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:49.470
a lot of coverage in the media
around changes to legal aid

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:53.590
and barristers taking
industrial action and so on.

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:57.390
And I'm very curious to hear
your assessment of both access

00:50:57.390 --> 00:51:00.120
to and quality of justice,
and how that may have changed

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.740
over the course of your career.

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:03.531
WILLIAM CLEGG: Gosh,
how long have you got?

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:13.110
Briefly, the Ministry of Justice
has suffered greater cuts

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:19.590
by way of a percentage than any
other department of government.

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:27.780
The cuts have been so deep
that court buildings are now

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:28.980
dilapidated.

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:33.430
You can go to courts in London
today, the lifts don't work,

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:38.580
the carpets are threadbare,
the lavatories are broken.

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:40.630
The paint is peeling
from the walls.

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:43.480
It is a complete disgrace.

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:46.170
If you go, as I do sometimes,
to the third world,

00:51:46.170 --> 00:51:51.390
and go to their courts, they are
immaculately clean, spotless,

00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:53.820
and there is a pride
in the fact that they

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.660
are able to have
such pristine courts.

00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:59.610
It has long been lost here.

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:07.470
Judicial morale is
at an all-time low.

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:10.540
They feel that they're
not appreciated.

00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:15.390
They're not given the rewards
that they are entitled

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:18.120
to expect from their role.

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:21.270
And the position in relation
to publicly funded work

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:25.440
as a barrister is
now that the rewards

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.530
are so low that it's
beginning to impact

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:31.190
on diversity in the profession.

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:34.050
We have spent 40
years trying to ensure

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:37.080
that people join the profession
from all walks of life.

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:40.920
And that you can come in and
earn a living defending people

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:42.530
accused of crime.

00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:45.900
We're now rapidly approaching
the point that unless

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:52.830
you've got a private income or
a partner who is a high earner,

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:58.260
you just cannot afford to
be a publicly funded defense

00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.400
advocate.

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:02.290
And I think that's
a real tragedy.

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:06.290
But I'm afraid to say
that is the truth.

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:10.310
Barristers' fees have
been cut by well over 50%

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:14.240
in the last eight years,
which is extraordinary.

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.210
Imagine what would happen if
they'd done that to nurses.

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:19.640
I mean, it doesn't
bear thinking about.

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.300
You had a question.

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.300
AUDIENCE: Yes, several
[INAUDIBLE] ones.

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.605
WILLIAM CLEGG: Don't worry.

00:53:24.605 --> 00:53:26.480
AUDIENCE: You speak
quite a lot about murder,

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.271
and all the kinds of
different cases there,

00:53:28.271 --> 00:53:29.810
but do you cover
all criminal cases?

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:30.601
WILLIAM CLEGG: Yes.

00:53:30.601 --> 00:53:33.110
AUDIENCE: And if so, is there
a particular case or crime

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:36.634
that you enjoy defending--
enjoy may not be the right word.

00:53:36.634 --> 00:53:38.550
WILLIAM CLEGG: Yes, I
think there probably is.

00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:40.970
I mean, what I've actually
done most of in recent years

00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:42.260
is not murder at all.

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.570
What I've done most
of is to defend

00:53:44.570 --> 00:53:49.400
in commercial criminal
fraud trials, normally

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:51.320
with an international
perspective.

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:54.350
So for example, the last
two big trials I've done

00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:57.770
was to defend the
managing director

00:53:57.770 --> 00:54:02.240
of a huge multinational
engineering company called

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:07.880
Alstom for alleged
corruption in India

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:11.750
over the building of the
Paris Metro and in Warsaw

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:16.320
over the construction of
the tram system there.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.342
And that's the sort of
case that I do mostly.

00:54:18.342 --> 00:54:20.300
And I find that much more
interesting in a way.

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:23.180
It's a great challenge to
understand the industry.

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:26.090
Before that, I
defended people who

00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:29.900
were setting the LIBOR rate
for Barclays Bank, I mean,

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:31.220
the LIBOR.

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:33.850
So those are the sort
of things I do mostly.

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:37.120
And they don't make for a
good book, particularly.

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:42.110
But there is one in there about
a fraud case involving a mining

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:48.650
company in North America, in
Montana, involving the Butte

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:49.910
Mining Company.

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:51.837
But, yes, that's
what I do mostly.

00:54:51.837 --> 00:54:53.420
I haven't done a
murder case for years

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:56.190
and probably never
do another one.

00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:59.480
But that was where I
learned my skills, as it

00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.640
were, doing general crime.

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.230
AUDIENCE: I have a
pretty loud voice,

00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:06.290
but what made you
pursue criminal law

00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:08.522
over the other disciplines
when you started out?

00:55:08.522 --> 00:55:10.730
WILLIAM CLEGG: Oh, I always
wanted to be a criminal--

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:15.130
I think it was watching
"Perry Mason" on the telly.

00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:16.380
I used to watch it every week.

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:17.600
And he never lost a case.

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.690
Sadly, it doesn't
transfer into real life.

00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:23.030
But what always attracted
me, more than anything

00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:25.460
else, was the oral
advocacy, and you

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:28.160
do more of that in
a criminal court,

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.040
with a criminal practice, than
any other area of the law.

00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:33.800
And I also found it fascinating.

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.190
And I still do.

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:38.360
I mean, there are
plenty of barristers

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.910
who do different types of law.

00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:46.864
But for me, I was
always set on crime.

00:55:46.864 --> 00:55:47.780
And I don't regret it.

00:55:50.265 --> 00:55:51.890
HOST: Great, well,
thank you very much.

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:53.310
[INAUDIBLE] William Clegg.

00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:56.360
[APPLAUSE]
