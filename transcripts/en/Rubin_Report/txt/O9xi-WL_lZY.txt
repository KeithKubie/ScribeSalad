Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:05          All right. So let's shift to your new book, living with the monks. I want to get the, the subtitle totally right here cause I love it. What turning off my phone taught me about happiness, gratitude and focus. So we are taping this right now. Uh, we're holding it for a little bit because I want to air this right before I go off the grid because my audience knows I do this August off the grid thing. Literally lock my phone in his safe. No phone, no TV, no electronics, no nothing. I'm going to work on my book a little bit. I'll probably escape to a beach for a little bit. I'm not even totally sure what I'm going to do, but just get off the endless information grid. So before we talk about me and why I think it's good to do that. What led you to wanting to do this in the first place?

Speaker 3:          00:50          Well, I'd spent, I'd invested so much in the physical side from my whole life, you know, running marathons and doing endurance events and had a navy seal move in with me. But I really had felt like I had neglected the inner side and just the inner work and I was just going so fast. So I felt too to really, again, maybe I'm turning all their, I don't know, but to get the whole package or that what I want and be as well rounded. I really needed that side. There's the spiritual side. And um, and I was just thinking like, well who would be the best teacher? And I thought monks and I didn't know anything about monks other than like watching some movies, you know, fringe articles here and there. I thought that'd be really cool to learn about, you know, the traditions and how amongst lived their lives. And I'm doing exactly what you said. You know, I'm, I'm bombarded by information and I don't spend any time alone. And when you don't spend time alone, you lose your super power, use your intuition because you're being influenced by everybody else and your exercise, your gut muscle. I was losing my superpower. So I said to Sarah, I think I want to go. And, and

Speaker 2:          02:01          was there a moment that you really felt that you had lost it or that you could really recognize that you lost it? Because I think a lot of people walk around with that all the time now. I just felt just cause the endless social media, you're so hit with stuff constantly that it does make your, your sort of inner monologue sort of harder to listen to because it's just being slammed in every way.

Speaker 3:          02:19          It was a buildup. I just felt so distracted. Yeah. And you know, we all feel overwhelmed. I mean, but I felt really distracted and I felt like, you know, I have four kids a job, I'm married friends, my parents are getting older. I mean all these different things. And then all these different social media things and news and Netflix and Hulu and the, a little bit about, I'm like, I just want to, like, I got to, I wouldn't be alone. And so it was a buildup. And then we, my wife and I were talking about it as I just want to, I'm going to go and live in a monastery. And she was super encouraging, you know, and she was like, um, so, so that's what happened.

Speaker 2:          02:57          So what do you, do you give a call, you,

Speaker 3:          03:00          you to say, is this a Yelp thing? Yeah. Uh, yes. Siri. I, um, I actually found this monastery through a friend of mine who was actually my publisher and a, I went to a monastery with eight months, which already was a misconception for me cause I thought monastery meant community meant hundreds, but there were eight months at this particular monastery for which had been there for 50 years. Wow. And they lived on 500 acres in the states, but in isolation, 500 acres. And similar to what you're about to do in, in August or now, um, you know, no phone, no Internet, no news, no this, no that. Uh, and I just took 15 days to decompress. So what was it like? So you get there day one, I mean, what was the most shocking part? I got sent to a pretty open guy. So there was probably not much that can shock you, but like what do they say?

Speaker 3:          03:54          Do they like take all your stuff? First of all, they were Russian Orthodox. They weren't Buddhists like that arrest. I didn't, I had no expectation of anything. And um, I walked into my room, which they call cell, that's the rooms are called sales and monastery. And it was the size of this carpet, like where we are. And I had a bed, one little desk with a light and brother, uh, Christopher, who was like my Goto monk, uh, sat me down and he said, tomorrow at 7:00 AM we'll start with prayer, reflect, reflection and meditation. And I said, okay, it's 6:00 PM, you know, what do I do next? 13 hours. And he looked at me and he said, you think? And I said, okay. And he left the room and I realized like, I can't call my wife, I can't, there's no books in my room. I mean, they had books, but there are no books.

Speaker 3:          04:51          There's no like, it's super like eerie, quiet. Yeah. And I'm like, all right, I'm going to, I'm going to meditate. Let me start the journey. I took a TM, transcendental meditation course, set my timer for 20 minutes, and I sat in my chair and I started to close my eyes, focused on the mantra. And, um, I'm getting bombarded on, well, how am I kids, my wife, you know, the hawks are going to be, what are we going to do this shit, you know, everything's going through my head and I will talk about the hawks were window by the way. I'm sitting and I'm going and I'm like, why hasn't my beeper beep? Cause I've been here forever. And I'm like, I probably didn't start it. So I let me just keep going, keep going. And finally there's no beep. And I said, well, let me just reset my beeper and I'll start over.

Speaker 3:          05:33          No, I go back. That will be cheating anyway. I mean my chair forever. And I finally like, this is ridiculous. I'll just let me reset this and start this again. I opened up my eyes, I look at my time or three minutes and 27 seconds. Wow. And I am really calculated how many minutes I have left on the monastery. I did 15 days times 24 times. And I was like, I just said to myself, I'm fucked. Like this is, this is great on paper in theory, but this is going to be fucking hard. And I just sat in my room and I was like, oh my God, why did I get myself into where you allowed to leave the room? I can leave the room. Um, I couldn't leave the property. This is the craziest situation. So the monks to keep the lights on at the monastery, they breed German shepherds.

Speaker 3:          06:27          So there are 11 adult German shepherds, eight monks. And so they're selling German shepherds. Yes. They sell puppies. That's, and they trained dogs. They're world renown dog trainers. World's, they've written books. They've sold millions of copies of books. They're just, it's just a really unusual scenarios. So yes, I could leave myself and walk around the monastery, but first of all, it's four degrees outside. It's P, there's no lights. It's like pitch dark at four o'clock. It's freezing. There's bear according to the monks like, so no, I really couldn't leave them. Right. So I mean I just kinda like, um, I ended up walking 120 miles up and down the driveway they had because I had to get some exercise over the course of my journey, but I didn't, I didn't leave. So, um, I just sat there and you know, the first five to s five days was really, really difficult for me.

Speaker 3:          07:25          And I started immediately doing probably what I think most people do. Certainly what I do, I started giving myself an out. I started justifying that it would be okay to go home early jazz, seven days, man, that's enough. Get out of here in seven days. No one's gonna say, Oh, you didn't do whatever. Just, and I started creating all these excuses in my head and I started thinking myself like, what are the goals do I have in areas of my life and my giving excuses in, you know, and really started like analyze everything that was going through my head and put it into out the, the real my real world. And I just saw a lot of things about myself, you know, through the, through just being quiet and alone. How did you break through that moment of I can get away with seven days here.

Speaker 3:          08:13          Like what was the actual thing that turned down on it? I have a two words that changed my life that I refer back to all the time. And um, the, when I wanted to go home, those two words were like, I signed up 15 days. That's what, that's what this goal was 15 days. Day five when I really want to go home and I missed my kids and I couldn't call them. You know, the two words are, remember tomorrow when you have a big split second decision or a big major decision, how, how is that decision going to make you feel tomorrow? So I said to myself, if I drop out and quit now the one time I'm going to do this in my life, how am I going to feel about this tomorrow when I get home? When someone says, how'd you do? Did you make it terrible?

Speaker 3:          09:00          You know, if I, my legs are swollen at mile 18 I want to drop out of the race. So the marathon, but I don't want to come home. And the next day after the New York Marathon, did you finish? So remember tomorrow. So I just kind of said that to myself over and over, like just remember how you gonna feel about this and remember how proud you are going to feel at the end of the journey. And before I went, my wife said, don't leave until you have a breakthrough. You're broken. And I'm like, I'm not broken. And I haven't had a breakthrough. I'm saying,

Speaker 2:          09:31          so did you get broken or have a breakthrough?

Speaker 3:          09:33          You know, it's funny. I have to, I know the answer, at least the one I had some breakthroughs for sure, but I never felt broken. And I think, I think the reason I never felt broken is because it has a definitive end date. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          09:46          So broken for you would have been like, I'm leaving.

Speaker 3:          09:49          Okay. Would it be like, yeah. It would have to really take me to a place of, you know? Yeah. Yeah. I mean I had moments of being broken and Super Sad. I mean, you know, like when you're away from everything and you don't know what's going on, you just don't know. You don't know God on my kids getting bullied or something happening is my wife. Okay. You know is the world in risk is you just don't know and you start to imagine that the world's going to end. I think your brain automatically goes to the words, it doesn't go to everything. It's great. It's like, Oh shit, I should've been so much nicer than my wife because I'm going to go there. She's not going to be home when I get home. Like you start sticking shit like that and then it just spirals because you have energy and space to think and imagine and dream and envision and all the shit that's like, it all comes to the surface and you know, cause it's in the real world.

Speaker 3:          10:47          If you're having a tough day, you could say to Dave, you, you, you, you guys were like, you know what? Let's put on a movie and Netflix and just so fucking escape. And you sit down, you order Chinese food and you have your Netflix and you watch it. But guess what, the issues don't go away when the movie's over. That shit is still there. Now your to do list. They're still there when I'm watching Netflix itself, right. They're still there and you know, this forced you, there was no escape. This was your escape. So it forced me to have to think through stuff and I got a lot of clarity.

Speaker 2:          11:20          You know, it's funny, although this is in no way comparable. When I did my off the great thing last year and half for a week, we were at 10 days or so, we were in Mexico and I just, I just needed to do nothing. I just needed to wake up every morning, have a light breakfast. I went to the gym and then I would just sit there. I got the same seat at the beach every day and I would just sit and stare at the ocean for hours, really for hours and I'd do all that, try to do a little meditation and stuff. Um, but I did have that moment at one point where I was like, anything could be happening right now. Like World War three could be starting there, you know, terror attack. Like boom, you know, Zombie, like where do you go to like the craziest shit. And then I remember thinking, I was like, you know, you go there for awhile and then I suddenly got to the end of it and I was like, well nothing I could do about it right now. So I better reset to this, to this better place. And there's a real discipline in that in, in how you can control your mind and your thoughts.

Speaker 3:          12:10          I think the F for sure for the first three or four days there I was obsessed with my to do list and by day four or five I'm like, if a hurricane came and whisked my to do list into the ocean, life goes on. Like I'll be okay. Yeah. And you know, I was, I was like a captive to my to do list because you know, I'm always, and it's my to do list. For me. It wasn't even about finishing the tasks as good as I could possibly do them. It was about finishing up so I can keep, it felt so good to cross them off that even if it was 70% to what I could probably do it onto the next, onto the next, onto the next at the monastery. The the, the most only had to do list. There was no to do list. It was whatever is in front of me is my task at hand.

Speaker 2:          13:01          So tell me a little bit just sort of what that day looks like. So you get up the next morning, now it's day two. So Day seven did you say 7:00 AM or 6:00 AM 7:00 AM and then prayer starts?

Speaker 3:          13:10          Yeah, so they would ring a big, a big like Notre Dame, Notre Dame. We like Church and val loud. I was right next to which was the, which signals to go to the, to the church where they, we would have a bout an hour and a half service, which was meditation, reflection service that w was it religious in any way? They were Russian Orthodox. It was, it was a religion. It was religious. For me it was, it was peaceful. Um, but it was definitely, it's definitely religious. And then, and then we would shift to, um, breakfast, which was traditionally silent. Most of those breakfast, the breakfasts were silent and that would go to, let's say nine 30 or 10 and afterwards, that'd be a little bit of alone time. And then it would go to tasks and each of the monks would have a different responsibility, which was just unbelievably efficient. And I spend each day shadowing a different long, so I got two rounds basically. Uh, and then there would be supper. Dinner was lunch time, so they flip flop. So breakfast was a really light meal, which for me is just fruit. Then lunch, their lunch was dinner. That would be the big meal rest. Or if like sleep away camp you go less rest time we will see more labor, which could be cleaning the church, doing something, whatever the everyone's tasks where, yeah.

Speaker 2:          14:34          Did they always have stuff to do? Cause I, it's, it's like, it's kind of funny, like if you think about it, like, all right, so eight guys living at this place, you're always doing stuff always seems like there wouldn't be that much more to do. You know,

Speaker 3:          14:44          she didn't want to know why, if, if the toilet breaks, they don't call a plumber to fix the toilet. They built the monastery by hand. They, everything is, they do everything right. Well let's, let's get a swimming pool. Okay. Get a shovel. You get a shovel and you get a shovel, you know, let's figure out how to do it, you know, and we'll build, well, the swimming pool please. So they do every hire you for a couple of jobs. I didn't, I couldn't do anything. I was a supervisor. Um, and then, and then we would, there was just more time alone. So there was a tremendous amount of time. Yeah. But also true. A lot of work.

Speaker 2:          15:21          So talk a little bit about the disconnecting from technology. I get the concerns about your wife, your kids, things like that. How did you feel about not putting your hand in your pocket to go to your phone or not having an iPad right in front of you or television screen or the rest of it?

Speaker 3:          15:35          You know, it's funny cause when I got back, everybody asked me, well what'd you miss? And on the obvious answers I missed my family and this and that, but no one ever asked me what didn't you miss? And what I didn't notice at all were things that I do everyday that I thought I would miss. For example, I went during the NCAA tournament. I didn't miss not watching March madness. It's been a pivot, let's move suddenly I'm loved to do forever. And if I calculated how many hours of basketball I've watched, it's like, you know, it's probably a years of my life, but I didn't miss it and I didn't miss hitting like that. You know, liking my friend's picture and canned cocoon with, with, with a corona. I didn't miss any of that stuff. I didn't miss going through Hulu and Netflix and debating with my wife what to watch. And I realized I spent a lot of time on things that I really didn't miss. And if I eliminated some of those, I would freed up a lot more time to spend to do the things I love to do with people. I love to do them with. Yeah. So, but it was so comfortable with my phone's always in my hand. It was hard, man, really hard. It took, it took a long time to get past that.

Speaker 2:          16:44          Did you feel that there was like a little bit of a learning curve with it? Like when I did it and as I said, I locked my phone in a safe, I did not know the code and I found that for the first day or two I kept going in my pocket, even at the beach, like I'm just going to be, but there's nothing in my pocket. I don't even think my shorts had pockets, so I was just like going like this. And then there's like this weird anxiety of like, what's going on? What did I miss? Is the Zombie apocalypse or the war started or whatever. And then suddenly by day like five, I kind of felt empowered by day eight. I was like, I want nothing to do with that. Then maybe there's a little bit of like a return to a, it'll be okay, I'll manage it differently. Did you go through all of them

Speaker 3:          17:19          exempts the exact steps that you just mentioned in the exact timeframe you just did? Yeah. Um, once I got to the point where I didn't miss it, where the habit of checking before I went to bed or waking up at five in the morning and seeing anything new come in through, you know, the words. Once I got past that, yeah. Uh, I just, I didn't miss it. I didn't want it, you know? And once I got home and I put on the news and read, you know, like what's going on in the world and all the negative stuff, it was just like, ah, but here I am, I've been home and then I'm back on my phone and I came home. I'm like, I'm off email.

Speaker 2:          17:56          Yeah. I'm all, I don't need. Right Kevin, you know, but you drift back. So have you been able to put any kind of just personal policies in place to manage this stuff? Cause I'm, I'm still trying, I don't do phone in bedroom 90% of the nights. Every now and again it just somehow ends up there. But like that's one for me. So that at 5:00 AM I just don't do that.

Speaker 3:          18:15          Yeah. And you know I've been the obvious ones, you know. No, not in the bedroom. Not at meal time. Not In movies I'm at. And I used to sit and movies and I heard a ding or a beep or a buzz.

Speaker 2:          18:26          Yeah. I'd go into my shirt and look, you know, it's like light, you know, or look under here.

Speaker 3:          18:31          But now, so there's, so I, I became this, I think this will summarize my experience the best. They had a retreat at the monastery and they had all these guests and when the guests left they said to me, Jesse, you are going to clean up all the dishes like the, like the rookie on the team. Okay, there's 500 dishes stacked. So I started cleaning the dishes and I'm drawing them and cleaning up and drying them and they'd go and they bring more in and I turned to them, I'm like, I'm just going to take me forever. How am I going to do all of these dishes? And one of the monks turned, he goes, there's not all those dishes. There's only the dish that's in your hand. And I was like, it reminded me that I'll never wear, my feet are, and I gotta be where my feet are, you know, this is what I'm doing.

Speaker 2:          19:18          Yeah. There's something there. Because I do find that I actually like doing the dishes. I know that's a little nuts and I'm not doing it for him. I'm not doing it for 500 people. But I do find it's like one of like, I can't have my phone in my hand while I'm doing the dishes. Right. Like I, it's one little thing that you're doing right there. So I do find on these brief moments that you, you know, I'm on tour right now and it's like when I'm doing this, when I have these brief moments, I like doing like very menial. Like I really like gardening or just like cleaning up outside or like these things that aren't much because they seem to have this, this is incredible important. We've lost touch with a lot of those

Speaker 3:          19:55          things that help us feel connected. You know, like we have no connection to our food. We go to a supermarket, we have no, unless you live on a farm, like we're very disconnected from a lot of things that make us tick and simple things like that bring us back down to earth and they ground us. And I felt the same way I felt as a contributor, even if it's contributing to your own household, you know? And as opposed to having someone to come and clean it or however you guys do it or whatever. Um, but it makes you feel connected, important part of it. And uh, it creates momentum and wins. I can't explain it, but I felt the same way. I love it. I was,

Speaker 2:          20:38          yeah. Yeah. There's real value in that. Like even when you came into my house and you're really like, oh, it's so great here and this and that. And it's like, I really love, like we put a lot of effort into like I want to like wake up in the place that I

Speaker 3:          20:48          want to be at and like make it better and make it more valuable in all that. So for the average person that can't maybe go take a month to do this, what's the piece of advice? Or is it, can people do a weekend with monks? Can you do it? Can you just do a day with monks? Maybe. I think it was, and I think, I think anyone could spend time alone. Yeah. I think spending time alone and you reckon I recognize like I don't spend any time alone other than going for runs, which is, you know, but I think it's really important because I think the only way you can really be in tune with your gut is to be, is to spend some time alone. So I think that's really important. I think for me, I carry a lot of stuff in my head. I realized that I need to, like I put everything on paper now I get out of my head, it doesn't disappear, but it frees up space.

Speaker 3:          21:31          I had a lot of space and creative energy at the monastery because I didn't have, I wasn't cluttered. So now I have a two journal system that I use. It's very simple. I dump everything into one big journal. Doesn't go away, but it's out of my head. Yeah. I don't have to remember. I could get a kid at birthday present or whatever and then I make my daily kind of routine and, and, and this kind of thing. And um, yeah. And I think just being really aware of where your feet are is really important. I mean the monks from Mano taskers I live in a world of multitasking and I think that, you know, for the everyday, for everybody, I think that feels overwhelmed or field feels distracted, is to do one thing at a time and do it well and move on. Have you been back to the monastery since?

Speaker 3:          22:18          I'm going to go, I haven't been back. What I plan on going to go back to partake you get or is it just like, can you go like have lunch with them like just for some high fives and that like they're down for that sort of thing. Like I think the dad for some, yeah, for some high five I guess you'll find out. I mean I was like an alien. I came here, there I was full energy. I'm like, ugh. I'm like, well what are we running? Did it, did they have any idea of your history or just you know that your success is any of that stuff. They just think it's just some guy. Yeah, we're, we're letting in on this. I remember that must've been pretty cool in and of itself. I remember very clearly sitting down and I was telling him about my journey.

Speaker 3:          22:52          I was talking about coconut water and they all looked at me and said, what's coconut water? I was talking about the Atlanta Hawks and one of them raised their hand, said, I went to an expos game. Wow. In Montreal. And I'm like, that's baseball. Don't anymore. Like, you know. Yeah. All right, well for our last few minutes left, let's talk about the hawks for a second and just, Oh, you own a basketball team, which to me is, as you know, I love basketball. Like that's like the greatest thing on earth. Like I would probably stop doing all this. I would trade it in to own a basketball team. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm not the principal owner. I'm part of the yeah. And uh, we got a great group, but for me, living in Atlanta as a basketball fan, I was a season ticket holder for years first and then I was a consultant to the team, so I got to fall in love with the players, the coaching staff and management first and now to be part of the ownership group with my wife and friends.

Speaker 3:          23:45          It's a in a city that I live in. Yeah. And a team that I love. Yeah. It's like, you know, it's just, it's just unbelievable. There's, I was talking to my wife the other day, I said, you know, from my father and my family and my friends and the city, there's 80 plus games a year where I could put the tea nights a year, I could put the TV on. I'm thinking about you as a knick fan. Yeah. Multiply it by 20. And just, you know, as, and just really love it. So it's been super exciting and I think we've got a really bright future. So I'm looking forward to the next couple of years.

Speaker 2:          24:19          I know it was a little before your time of owning the hawks, but how has Dominique Wilkins not in the hall of fame?

Speaker 3:          24:24          And I love Nick. How's that guy? Not In the whole thing. He deserves to be, he deserves to be. He's a, not only is he great basketball player, but he's in Atlanta. He's, you know, he's just a big part of the, of the community. So if he's still part of the, Oh, is that right? And Yeah, he does the play, but he's, um, is that every game? So I, I never seen him say no to a photo or an autograph ever. Never just, um, he makes people feel really good and uh, he's very approachable. Yeah. What are you guys doing over there to just

Speaker 2:          24:58          bring all of the things that you've talked about here into the game and make it fun and add some of the other stuff that's not part of the 48 minutes? Like, you know, the Goto hurts go thing.

Speaker 3:          25:09          I think there's several buckets. There's the internal bucket and wrestlers, the principal on. He's done an amazing job of just, we have a new practice facility that's state of the art best, probably one of the best in the NBA. Uh, we're renovating the arena. Massive multi hundred million dollar rent of renovation that's going on now. So there's a whole, there's like the internal stuff and then there's the game presentation. There's so many layers, game presentation. There's the actual basketball side of it. Um, there's the nights that, that, that, that the team doesn't play, that the arena is available. We have a concert. I mean it's just, there's so many layers of it, but I think at the end of the day it's that enthusiasm and passion and just bringing whatever you can to infuse a culture of thick, of your emotional connection to the next you taught. First thing you said to me when I walked in with you took me to 94 games.

Speaker 2:          26:00          Yeah. You remember those? I remember where I was sitting for a certain games. You know what you're eating

Speaker 3:          26:04          and you're 25 years ago. I don't remember what I ate last week. Exempt. Right. You'd have no idea. There's just so much emotion. And if we could bring that same passion to the community and marry that with the Atlanta Hawks, that's going to be super powerful. And I think we can all run away.

Speaker 2:          26:26          What wasn't Mandy? It's pretty clear you're bringing that to your life every day. Cause this was just, I mean this flew by and it's like I could feel it on time. That's it. That's it. Well you got to go do Rogan now, so I don't want to, I don't want to steal all your brain power. You got three more hours with Rogan I sent to you are going to be up to it to the challenge and don't even drink caffeine. You just hopped up on coconut water. I am potassium doubt. You don't even need bananas anymore. Do you have any, why would he have been at this point? I had a lot of it and just eat the bananas too too. Well, listen, man, it's been, it's been an absolute pleasure. I suspect we will cross paths again perhaps in Atlanta because even though we're holding this for a little bit, uh, maybe a little bit, they come watch Ya. All right. We're going to come to the shore, the Peterson event in Atlanta. Awesome. Uh, for more on Jesse, you can check out Jesse itzler.com.
