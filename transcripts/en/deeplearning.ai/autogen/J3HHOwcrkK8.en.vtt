out that progress is often quite fast

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980
out that progress is often quite fast
 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.370
out that progress is often quite fast
until you surpass human level

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380
until you surpass human level
 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.580
until you surpass human level
performance and it sometimes flows down

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590

after you surpass human level

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150
after you surpass human level
 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.420
after you surpass human level
performance and I think there are two

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430
performance and I think there are two
 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.260

reasons for that

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270
reasons for that
 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.360
reasons for that
for Y progress often slows down when you

for Y progress often slows down when you
surpass human level performance one

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500
surpass human level performance one
 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.260
surpass human level performance one
reason is that human level performance

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270
reason is that human level performance
 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.110
reason is that human level performance
is for many tasks not that far from

there's a cat or listening to audio and
 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.900
there's a cat or listening to audio and
transcribing it so by the time you

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910
transcribing it so by the time you
 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.699
transcribing it so by the time you
surpass human level performance maybe

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709
surpass human level performance maybe
 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.280
surpass human level performance maybe
there's not that much Headroom to still

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290
there's not that much Headroom to still
 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.090
there's not that much Headroom to still
improve but the second reason is that so

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100
improve but the second reason is that so
 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.920
improve but the second reason is that so
long as your performance is worse than

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930
long as your performance is worse than
 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.960
long as your performance is worse than
human level performance then there

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970
human level performance then there
 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.729
human level performance then there
actually certain tools you could use to

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739
actually certain tools you could use to
 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.220
actually certain tools you could use to
improve performance they're harder to

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230
improve performance they're harder to
 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.680
improve performance they're harder to
use once you've surpassed human level

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690
use once you've surpassed human level
 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.510
use once you've surpassed human level
performance so here's what I mean

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520
