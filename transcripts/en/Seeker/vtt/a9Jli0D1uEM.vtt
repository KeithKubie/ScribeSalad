00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.000
What does speed have to do with sound?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.480
And if there’s no wall in the sky, how exactly
do you break a sound barrier?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.990
Hey guys, Amy here with you on DNews today
talking speed!

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.990
Fast things.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.990
Not drug things.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.850
Most of us will probably never go supersonic.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.520
Though the idea of cutting travel times in
half is so appealing, it’s not something

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.880
likely to become common place anytime soon.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.869
But let’s start with a bit of a history
lesson.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.210
In the 1880s, Austrian physicist Ernst Mach
was studying the supersonic flow of gases

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.480
using a shadowgraph when he successfully photographed
a bullet traveling faster than the speed of

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.480
sound.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.360
What his images showed was a bullet with a
shock wave in front of it and another one

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.329
trailing behind it, clear proof of the phenomenon
of compressibility.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.320
This research eventually led to the measurements
that bear his name: a Mach number is the ratio

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.620
of the speed of an object traveling through
a gas to the speed of sound in that gas.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.030
Because while we don’t think about it, air
is made up of molecules, and like any other

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.000
physical substance, those air molecules can
compress, and when they compress they form

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
shock waves.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.320
It’s these shock waves that make flying
faster than the speed of sound such a challenge,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.469
and in the 1940s, pilots were coming face
to face with this challenge.

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:09.780
These shock waves vibrate the air molecules
they’re made of, and when those molecules

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.279
vibrate they vibrate whatever is compressing
them.

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:15.969
In the case of a fast-flying airplane, the
shock waves can shake an airplane hard enough

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:17.139
to rip it apart.

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:21.119
It was clear to engineers in the 1940s that
the future of aviation lay beyond the sound

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.829
barrier, so someone would have to build an
airplane solid enough and fast enough to break

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.100
through that wall.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.009
It was the Bell Aircraft corporation working
on a contract with the US Army Air Force that

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.380
devised the solution.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.700
Taking design inspiration from a bullet, Bell
engineers designed the X-1 aircraft specifically

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.270
to break through that wall of compressed air
in the sky.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.329
The advent of supersonic flight opened a whole
new era of aviation, and though higher Mach

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.739
numbers don't come with the same “barriers”
every increase in speed is nonetheless a major

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:48.130
technological hurdle.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.950
The fastest manned flight on record was set
in 1967 with the NASA-Air Force X-15, a rocket-powered

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.719
dart of an aircraft that hit a top speed of
Mach 6.7, which is about 4,519 mph!

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.450
But the X-15 was a hypersonics research vehicle.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.389
Most fighter jets today aren’t nearly that
fast, though there are supersonic fighters.

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:10.929
Air Force planes like the F-15 Eagle and the
F-22 Raptor are both supersonic fighter jets,

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.819
and the F-22 can even hit Mach 2 using afterburners.

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.640
But there’s another challenge associated
with supersonic flight and that’s the sonic

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.640
boom.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.709
The sonic boom is the sound an airplane makes
when it smashes through that wall of compressed

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.129
air that builds up in front of it.

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.659
But the boom doesn’t just come once when
the plane goes supersonic; it keeps going

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.900
in the wake of that supersonic aircraft.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.680
This is exactly why the Concorde, the world’s
only supersonic passenger plane that flew

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.460
from 1976 to 2003, only ever flew over oceans.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.290
In fact, the Federal Aviation Administration
prohibited domestic civil supersonic flight

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.269
over land in 1973.

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.569
But all is not lost!

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.430
NASA and its aviation partners are looking
into identifying an acceptable loudness level

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.269
and working on so-called “low boom” aircraft
designs to reduce sonic boom levels and maybe

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.200
bring back supersonic passenger flights.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.550
But that’s still something to look forward
to down the line.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.209
And the U.S. Air Force always has its eye
on the future, too, and it’s a big supporter

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.209
of DNews!

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.620
The United States Air Force is powered by
Airmen and fueled by innovation.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.350
Every day American Airmen go above and beyond
to break barriers both professionally and

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.350
personally.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.519
Whether it’s overcoming poverty to become
a nurse and officer or becoming the first

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.379
female Thunderbird pilot, these Airmen are
known for doing what was once thought to be

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:17.480
impossible.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.480
