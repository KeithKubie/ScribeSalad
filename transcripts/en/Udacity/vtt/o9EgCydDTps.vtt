Web caching can reduce transit costs, for the local ISP,

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.280
by preventing every, each V to P request, from needing

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.110
to go to the origin server. Because, the content's also

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.310
closer to the client, clients should also see improved performance.
