00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:04.731
- [Voiceover] So, the problem
with allowing this spark

00:00:04.731 --> 00:00:08.353
to happen across here is if
this is not a mechanical switch,

00:00:08.353 --> 00:00:11.710
we can build switches out of
electronic devices, as well.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.894
But this is what we use transistors for.

00:00:13.894 --> 00:00:17.389
And a transistor is a rather
small, delicate device.

00:00:17.389 --> 00:00:20.694
And so, if I go in here
and I somehow cause

00:00:20.694 --> 00:00:25.189
a huge spike in voltage to
occur, very, very likely

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.810
I'm gonna destroy that
transistor that's used

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.303
in this position right here
as an electronic switch.

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:35.339
So, the way to deal with
this is to provide a place

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:36.397
for this current to go.

00:00:36.397 --> 00:00:39.641
Here's this current that's
flowing through this conductor,

00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:42.885
and the magnetic energy that's
stored around this inductor

00:00:42.885 --> 00:00:45.201
is gonna force that current to flow,

00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:47.007
even if we open this switch.

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:49.384
And in the case here we saw when we opened

00:00:49.384 --> 00:00:52.562
the mechanical switch, it
sparks right across there,

00:00:52.562 --> 00:00:55.176
so the inductor wins,
the inductor current wins

00:00:55.176 --> 00:00:56.161
in that case.

00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:58.167
And it can be very damaging to whatever

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:00.667
is in this position down here.

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:07.030
The best way to solve this is
with a device called a diode.

00:01:09.207 --> 00:01:11.149
And this is another semiconductor device,

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.066
it's not a switch, but a diode has,

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:17.766
a diode has an IV curve.

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.349
Here's V, here's I.

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:23.236
And it looks like this.

00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:28.309
The current, I'm just gonna sketch this,

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:30.933
the current is zero when
the voltage on the diode

00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:31.933
is negative.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.473
And it's somewhere around
here that the current goes up

00:01:37.473 --> 00:01:38.306
like that.

00:01:39.617 --> 00:01:44.045
So, when we have a diode, this
is the symbol for a diode,

00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:47.782
like that, and that's plus and minus V.

00:01:47.782 --> 00:01:50.215
And this is the current through the diode.

00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:53.144
So, positive current and
positive voltage is in this part

00:01:53.144 --> 00:01:56.896
of the graph over here, and
when I have a positive voltage,

00:01:56.896 --> 00:02:00.823
this is about .6 volts,
something like that,

00:02:00.823 --> 00:02:04.990
could be .5, could be .7, when
you have a positive voltage

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:08.939
on this, then the current starts to flow

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:10.117
freely through this.

00:02:10.117 --> 00:02:12.178
If this voltage goes
negative, so that means that

00:02:12.178 --> 00:02:15.176
this voltage is higher than this voltage,

00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:17.670
then the current actually
goes pretty much to zero,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.587
very, very small value.

00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:23.503
So, I'm gonna take advantage
of this diode device

00:02:23.503 --> 00:02:26.939
to help me with this
problem I have over here

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.557
with the current, and the
way we do that is we do this.

00:02:30.557 --> 00:02:34.724
We hook up a diode pointing
in this direction here.

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:37.735
Pretty distinctive.

00:02:37.735 --> 00:02:40.983
But anytime you have a circuit
that has an inductor in it,

00:02:40.983 --> 00:02:44.381
so it's a solenoid, or
a motor, or a relay,

00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:46.905
this is a way you can protect the devices

00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:48.405
driving your coil.

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:53.217
So, let's look at what
happens here when we push this

00:02:53.217 --> 00:02:55.954
push button down and let it go again.

00:02:55.954 --> 00:02:58.394
When we started out, we
had no current flowing,

00:02:58.394 --> 00:03:00.574
the push button was open,
so there's no current

00:03:00.574 --> 00:03:02.674
going through here, and
there's no voltage difference

00:03:02.674 --> 00:03:05.988
across here, both these
points are at three volts.

00:03:05.988 --> 00:03:08.664
And so, there's no
voltage across the diode.

00:03:08.664 --> 00:03:12.168
And that's that point right
there, no current, no voltage.

00:03:12.168 --> 00:03:14.914
So, all the currents are
zero, and the voltage across

00:03:14.914 --> 00:03:18.092
the diode is zero, so there's no current.

00:03:18.092 --> 00:03:19.341
Nothing's happening.

00:03:19.341 --> 00:03:20.965
Now we push the button down.

00:03:20.965 --> 00:03:23.959
And a current starts to
flow through the inductor,

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.393
and there's three volts
across the inductor.

00:03:26.393 --> 00:03:30.200
So, let's look at that,
there's plus three volts here,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.950
and there's zero volts down here.

00:03:34.752 --> 00:03:38.996
So, there's three volts
on this side of the diode,

00:03:38.996 --> 00:03:41.616
this is the side where it doesn't conduct.

00:03:41.616 --> 00:03:44.236
That three volts represents
negative three volts

00:03:44.236 --> 00:03:45.653
across the diode.

00:03:47.795 --> 00:03:49.791
Let me mark the diode voltage on here.

00:03:49.791 --> 00:03:52.124
Here's minus, plus, V diode.

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:57.368
And we'll call this V diode.

00:03:58.903 --> 00:04:02.461
So, this is a V diode of negative three,

00:04:02.461 --> 00:04:06.628
so we're operating over here
out at negative three volts

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.568
on the diode, and the current
through the diode is zero,

00:04:11.568 --> 00:04:13.258
there's no current flowing over here.

00:04:13.258 --> 00:04:14.876
All of this current is going down

00:04:14.876 --> 00:04:17.432
and going through the
inductor, and doing whatever

00:04:17.432 --> 00:04:20.099
this inductor is supposed to do.

00:04:21.676 --> 00:04:24.093
Okay, now we open the switch.

00:04:25.668 --> 00:04:27.297
Now we open the switch.

00:04:27.297 --> 00:04:30.483
And as you recall a minute
ago, what happened was

00:04:30.483 --> 00:04:34.400
this voltage right here,
this voltage went big.

00:04:37.442 --> 00:04:39.818
This went plus big, and we had like,

00:04:39.818 --> 00:04:42.562
100,000 volts or something.

00:04:42.562 --> 00:04:44.060
That's where it was headed.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.616
Well, we're not gonna let it get there,

00:04:45.616 --> 00:04:47.949
so I'm gonna take that away.

00:04:50.112 --> 00:04:54.223
So, this voltage here, as
soon as this switch opens,

00:04:54.223 --> 00:04:57.639
this voltage right
here, this is headed up.

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.516
This is going up, hard.

00:04:59.516 --> 00:05:01.505
But we're not gonna let it get very high,

00:05:01.505 --> 00:05:02.941
and that's the job of this diode.

00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:07.562
So, as soon as this
voltage here gets to about

00:05:07.562 --> 00:05:10.992
6/10ths of a volt higher than right here.

00:05:10.992 --> 00:05:14.325
So, when this voltage gets to 3.6 volts,

00:05:16.114 --> 00:05:19.281
what that means is that the V diode...

00:05:20.542 --> 00:05:23.292
Now equals about .6 volts, right?

00:05:24.845 --> 00:05:26.599
This is at three volts.

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.349
This is at 3.6 volts,
so V diode is .6 volts.

00:05:31.461 --> 00:05:34.878
And that puts us about here on the curve.

00:05:36.329 --> 00:05:40.699
And what's gonna happen is
this current that we had here,

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.382
this current that was flowing
down through this inductor

00:05:43.382 --> 00:05:44.374
is gonna do what?

00:05:44.374 --> 00:05:46.870
It's gonna go this way.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.932
It's gonna flow this
way through the diode,

00:05:49.932 --> 00:05:53.985
and that's this portion
of the curve right here.

00:05:53.985 --> 00:05:57.108
And it'll keep going like that.

00:05:57.108 --> 00:05:59.420
Look at that, we've
provided a current path

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.283
for this inductor that's not
gonna destroy what's down here.

00:06:04.283 --> 00:06:06.533
The highest voltage this will get to

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:10.700
is whatever voltage it climbs
to on this diode curve here,

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:15.936
which is gonna be between
.6 and point, say .8 volts.

00:06:17.384 --> 00:06:20.318
So, the highest this
is gonna get is point,

00:06:20.318 --> 00:06:21.735
3.6 to 3.8 volts.

00:06:24.748 --> 00:06:27.244
And typically, and typically
a transistor down here

00:06:27.244 --> 00:06:30.862
will easily withstand
this kind of a voltage

00:06:30.862 --> 00:06:32.279
on its terminals.

00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:36.733
So, this is called, the
effect of having this voltage

00:06:36.733 --> 00:06:39.400
go way north is called kickback.

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:45.593
That's kickback from an inductor.

00:06:45.593 --> 00:06:47.403
This diode is a protection diode,

00:06:47.403 --> 00:06:50.519
and basically what it does
is it supplies a pathway

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:54.080
for that inductor current
when this voltage goes

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.913
above the top end of the inductor.

00:06:59.134 --> 00:07:01.876
So, whenever you build something
that has an inductor in it,

00:07:01.876 --> 00:07:04.186
and it could be, you could build a circuit

00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:06.808
that drives a motor, or an actuator,

00:07:06.808 --> 00:07:09.114
or a solenoid, or something like that,

00:07:09.114 --> 00:07:11.423
or part of a robot, this
is one of the circuits

00:07:11.423 --> 00:07:12.611
you wanna keep in mind.

00:07:12.611 --> 00:07:14.399
Whenever you have an inductor
and you're gonna switch it

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:17.565
on and off, you basically,
you wanna design in

00:07:17.565 --> 00:07:21.398
a diode like this to protect
your circuit from those

00:07:21.398 --> 00:07:23.898
unstoppable inductor currents.
