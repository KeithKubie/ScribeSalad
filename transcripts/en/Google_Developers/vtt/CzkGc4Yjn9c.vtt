00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.905
FRANCOIS AJENSTAT: At Tableau,
our mission is simple.

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:08.920
It's to help people see and
understand their data.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.490
So the Google Cloud Platform
really helps a company like

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.690
Tableau analyze billions of
records of data at internet

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.470
scale with simple point
and click operations.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.460
All you need to focus on is
putting your data on the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.600
Google Cloud Platform, and
Google takes care of the rest.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.670
So you can focus on the core
aspects of your business

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.910
rather than managing all
that infrastructure.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.490
MOMCHIL KYURKCHIEV: So we are
Leanplum, and we're building a

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.500
platform to optimize the mission
critical metrics of

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.370
your mobile app.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.830
We're a young company,
less than a year old.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.370
And so for us, building
a minimum viable

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.390
product is very important.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.150
So we start with something
small, and then we upgrade it.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.680
I think App Engine is designed
exactly for this use case.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.320
I'm always surprised by how
fast mobile has managed to

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.280
penetrate in our lives
and the amount of

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.430
data that we collect.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.400
FRANCOIS AJENSTAT: We can
connect with Tableau to Google

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.180
BigQuery as well as
Google Analytics.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.320
And Google BigQuery, as part of
the Google Cloud Platform,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.170
really helps us analyze millions
and billions of

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.260
records in a way that was
never possible before.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.860
ANDREW FIST: BigQuery allowed us
to analyze large data sets

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.000
in very little amount of time,
and that's great when you're

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.350
building an Analytics product.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.540
And it's also great when you're
a startup, and you

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.170
don't have the ability to
reserve tons and tons of

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.360
instances, because you
get them all, on

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.850
demand, within seconds.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.930
FRANCOIS AJENSTAT: So if you
think about the traditional

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.950
environment, companies have to
install lots of servers, lots

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.640
of software on premise.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.350
They'll build Hadoop stacks with
thousands and thousands

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.700
of servers that are really,
really hard to manage.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.240
Now, the beauty of the Google
Cloud Platform is that it

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.985
makes all of that irrelevant.

00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:49.141
So slow moving, painful,
expensive, complicated, to

00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:52.970
fast, nimble, and responsive,
is really that difference

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.040
between the old way and the
Google Cloud Platform way.
