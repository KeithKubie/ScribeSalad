00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
What's up guys!

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.100
I brought you out to the mountains today to show you a cool trick you can do with a lighter.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.700
Now over the years I show you a lot of different ways you can start fires without using matches.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.020
But some people in the comments say why not just pack a lighter?

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.360
It's small. It's compact.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.940
And with the flick of the thumb you got instant flame.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.560
And that is true as long as your lighter works.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.520
Lighters are extremely handy tools for starting the fire,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.760
but they do run out of gas and sometimes the get smashed.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.480
You might find something like this on a hiking trail when you're hiking your camping spot.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.300
If you do, it's not garbage.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.550
The reason is because this striker wheel and flint will still make a spark.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.851
Now a spark by itself isn't enough to start a fire.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.000
We need a lot more than that.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.350
But, it's enough to get us started.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.540
Now the first thing to do is to find some kind of a flat board.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.960
Relatively flat like this.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.680
Because we're going to take the side of that striking wheel...

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.120
and run it slowly down the board like this.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.380
The longer the board, the longer your stroke is going to be.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.340
What this is doing is grinding off some of the ferrocerium inside...

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.640
and making powder you can use to ignite the flame.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.820
Now, you don't want to go too fast...

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.980
because if you go too fast it'll make a spark and the whole thing will go up.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.260
If you do just slow enough though you can scrape that ferrocerium rod into a powder...

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.340
without it actually igniting yet.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.740
You want to do this about 40 to 50 times on a stick about 8-10 inches long.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.270
Now by holding your letter sideways as you roll it as the dust forms,

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.590
it falls down and catches inside of the cap here.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.800
So all we have t do now is turn it up right into whatever material or tender we want to ignite.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.620
And then all it takes is a flick of the thumb...

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.060
we got ourselves a fire.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.430
So look at that guys just like that we have ignition of our tinder pile.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.500
While our little pile is smoldering here I'm going to make a little tinder bundle...

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.580
and we can blow this into a flame.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.680
Now, in an ideal world you put your tinder pile inside of your tinder bundle before you lit it.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.060
But since it's already going to be something like a business card just gently scoop underneath it...

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.600
And transferred over the file. Once that successfully transferred to the card...

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.160
Put your tender file over it and just gently roll it over.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.440
And you can see how nicely those embers are formed.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.000
That's going to build up into a fire very very quickly.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.640
And now this point all we have to do is add a little bit of oxygen...

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.400
and we've got ourselves a fire.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.280
There it is.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.500
How cool is that?

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.440
But, if you have something like a paper towel or Kleenex this is going to work even easier.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.080
Just make a pile of your dust right in the center of the paper,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.500
and when you give that a little flick the entire paper will catch on fire.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.260
You can use that as your tender instead.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.300
Just like that we have an instant fire,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.260
and we need to get our fire pit really quickly.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.900
A very simple trick and it does not get much easier than that.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.140
Thanks so much for joining me for this experiment.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.620
And I'll be looking for you in the next video.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.440
Talk to you then.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:03:03.420
