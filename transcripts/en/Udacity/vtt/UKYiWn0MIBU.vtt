00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.740
So, the first concept we will learn

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.830
in full tolerance is dependability. Dependability is

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.782
a quality of delivered service, meaning a

00:00:08.782 --> 00:00:13.210
characteristic of delivered service, that justifies relying

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.390
on the system to provide its service. So pretty much a dependable system

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.420
is one that provides the service in a way that makes us expect it to

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.710
provide it correctly and in a dependable way.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.818
Now, the service actually has two definitions. One

00:00:33.818 --> 00:00:36.260
is the specified service, which is what the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.130
behavior of the system should look like. And then

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.150
we have delivered service which is actual behavior.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.180
This is the behavior we actually got out

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.420
of the system. So we could say that

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.550
dependability is really about can we expect the delivered

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.720
service to match the specified service. Can we get

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.052
what we are supposed to be getting from this system.

00:00:58.052 --> 00:01:01.076
Now of course the system has some components which

00:01:01.076 --> 00:01:04.500
are called modules. So these are not components like transistors

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.280
and so on. These are the kind of largest

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.900
components of the system. So for example, a computer system

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.450
will have a processor and a memory and so

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.935
on. Each of these has components of its own and

00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:18.970
so on. And for each of these modules

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.620
we can specify some behavior that it should be

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.541
ideally getting. So each module has some sort

00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:27.760
of ideal behavior that we will want to expect

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.718
from it, but of course real modules will

00:01:30.718 --> 00:01:35.060
maybe not always exhibit this ideal behavior. So when

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.890
we talk about things that make the system

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.180
not be dependable, we're really talking about modules deviating

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.740
from specified behavior and that causing the system to deviate

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.850
so that the delivered service no longer matches the specified service.
