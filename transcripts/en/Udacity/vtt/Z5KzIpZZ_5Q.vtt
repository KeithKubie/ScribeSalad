Now, in order to understand how we obtain input from the user, it's best

00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:07.708
represented in a simple analogy. Newspaper subscription. For instance,

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:10.648
newspapers are printed every day with a rich set of data that I don't have

00:00:10.648 --> 00:00:15.165
access to unless I willingly subscribe to, or receive, that paper. Input

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:19.360
handling in HTML5 is a lot like that. In JavaScript we have the ability to

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.762
subscribe to this input data, such that when an event occurs, a block of code

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:27.860
will be called. To get started with this process you need to tell the browser

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.100
that you'd like to subscribe to a certain event such as On Click, On Mouse

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.610
Move, or On Key Down alongside what function you'd like to call when that event

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.040
happens. Let's take a look at the code. You can see here that we grab an

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.760
element from the dom named pLubbz, for life, and add an EventListener to it

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.478
from mousemove. What occurs is that when the mousemove event happens on the dom

00:00:49.478 --> 00:00:53.096
object the onMouseMove function will be called where we've previously defined

00:00:53.096 --> 00:00:56.320
onMouseMove before this declaration.
