00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.513
There are two tasks for you. First off, to make a new question. Here, we

00:00:03.513 --> 00:00:07.261
construct the question, and now we need to set the question text. There's a

00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:10.700
method for that. And we need to set the desired answer, and there's a method

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.568
for that. Really all you had to do is look up here and imitate how to set up

00:00:14.568 --> 00:00:19.204
the first question. In the present question method, we first display the

00:00:19.204 --> 00:00:24.938
question. Again, there is a method for that. To find that out, you actually had

00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:29.847
to look up the Question class, the method is here. There's no other way to show

00:00:29.847 --> 00:00:34.967
that question text than to call display. The code for reading the response was

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:39.500
already given to you. Now, we need to check if it's the correct response.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.320
That's the job of the checkAnswer method that you also had to discover by

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.486
looking at the code of the Question class. It gets the user's response and it

00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:51.885
returns true of false depending on whether it's correct or not. We were

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:55.698
supposed to print true or false. The simplest way of doing that is to just

00:00:55.698 --> 00:01:00.790
print the value of the Boolean variable. But, of course you could also print

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.698
true in this branch and false in this branch if you prefer. So if the outcome

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:10.281
is true, we return a score of 1 otherwise a score of 0. Let's just run this

00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:15.372
program. So let's see. Who was the inventor of Java? Everyone knows that or

00:01:15.372 --> 00:01:20.414
not. And who was the founder of Udacity? Oh, I better get that one right or

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:22.646
I'll get in trouble. Now,

00:01:22.646 --> 00:01:22.933
[LAUGH]

00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:26.665
I did this one right and at least I got a score of 1. So, now you have an idea

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:32.395
on how the basic question class works. And we're ready to refine that class by

00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:34.980
forming sub-classes of it.
