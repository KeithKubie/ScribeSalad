00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.290
- [Narrator] Hi this is
Kim from Khan Academy.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.540
Today we're learning
more about the landmark

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.000
Supreme Court case Dred
Scott versus Sandford.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.680
Decided in 1857, the ruling
in the Dred Scott case

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.370
inflamed sectional tensions over slavery,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.220
which had been growing ever more heated

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.090
over the course of the 1850s.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.590
Originally a case about whether
one man ought to be free,

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.940
Dred Scott versus Sandford
transformed into a case

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.020
about African-American citizenship

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.330
and the future of the
institution of slavery itself.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.200
To learn more, I sought
out help of two experts.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.630
Christopher Bracey is a Professor of Law

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.490
at the George Washington
University School of Law.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.550
He's an expert in US race
relations, individual rights

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.410
and criminal procedure.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.470
Timothy Huebner is the Irma O. Sternberg

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.950
Professor of History at Rhodes College

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.120
and the author of Liberty
and Union: The Civil War Era

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.400
and American Constitutionalism.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.170
Professor Bracey can you
take us through a little bit,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.550
just who was Dred Scott and
why did he bring this case?

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.363
- [Christopher] So Dred
Scott was born around 1800

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:07.790
and was the slave of Peter
and Elizabeth Taylor Blow.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.880
In 1818, Peter Blow
decides to move his family

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.000
and Dred Scott to Alabama

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.020
where he'd bought a cotton plantation.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.740
That didn't go so well,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.280
so he sells the plantation
and moves the family

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.350
and Dred to St. Louis, Missouri,

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.930
where he'd purchased a
boarding house called

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.807
The Jefferson Hotel.

00:01:24.807 --> 00:01:27.090
- [Timothy] And that
period really was a period

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.260
during which the nation was arguing over

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.260
the status of slaves and
the rights of slaveholders

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.430
and the future of slavery
in new western territories.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.597
And this issue came up
in a very significant way

00:01:42.597 --> 00:01:45.230
and a very controversial
way in the question

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.380
of the future of slavery in the territory

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.700
and ultimately the state of Missouri.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.100
After two years of arguing over this,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.610
finally in 1820 and 1821,
a sort of compromise

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.030
was set out by members of Congress.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.310
North of the southern border of Missouri,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.260
with the exception of
the state of Missouri,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
slavery would be banned.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.450
- [Christopher] In 1830,
Elizabeth Taylor Blow dies

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.390
and Peter himself dies two years later.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.450
But before he does, he
makes an arrangement to sell

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.650
Dred to an Army physician
by the name of Dr. Emerson.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.290
Dr. Emerson is an Army
physician, so he's gonna be

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.140
stationed in a lot of different places,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.210
not just in the slave state of Missouri.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.920
In fact, it turns out that
Dr. Emerson's first posting

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.340
with Dred takes him to Fort Armstrong,

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.560
which is located in Rock Island, Illinois

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.550
and Illinois is of course a free state.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.050
Under both federal law and Missouri law

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.630
as understood at the
time, Dred would have lost

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.010
his slave status and become a free man

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.540
as soon as he stepped
foot onto free territory.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.890
This was known as the Extra-territorial

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.440
Emancipation Doctrine.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.470
- [Timothy] It was perfectly
legal and perfectly possible

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.290
for a slave sojourner, a
slave who had been taken

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.280
into a free state or free territory,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.040
to file suit for his freedom.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.410
- [Christopher] Dr. Emerson marries

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.480
Eliza Irene Sandford of St. Louis.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.590
Dr. Emerson eventually
dies in 1843 and he leaves

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.500
the entire estate, including
the Scotts, to Mrs. Emerson.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.670
Mrs. Emerson decides she
would like to hire Dred out

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.900
to make some money for herself.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.710
Rather than be hired out,
Dred offers to purchase

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.320
his own freedom, and the
freedom of his entire family.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.610
But Mrs. Emerson refuses
to allow Dred to buy out

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.250
the freedom of his family.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.920
So Dred Scott files a civil lawsuit,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.140
what was called a Freedom Suit back then,

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.574
in the Missouri State court.

00:03:40.574 --> 00:03:42.860
And his claim was that
Mrs. Emerson was falsely

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.810
imprisoning him and his family.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.070
- [Timothy] And he was able
to do this with the help

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.470
of the sons of his formers owners.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.290
- [Christopher] The lawyer
is being paid by the children

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.220
of Peter and Elizabeth Taylor Blow,

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.240
- [Narrator] Wow.
Dred Scott's first master.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.450
In the meantime you
have a new development,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.870
Mrs. Emerson has remarried

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.650
to Republican congressman Calvin
Chaffee, from Massachusetts

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.670
and he can't be a slave owner and still be

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.240
a Republican congressman
from Massachusetts.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.990
So Mrs. Emerson transfers
title of the Scotts

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.270
to her brother John
Sandford who is a resident

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.560
of New York, with business
ties in St. Louis.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.530
- [Timothy] Now it was
eligible for the case

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.550
to go into Federal Court
in that it involved people

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.800
who lived in two different states.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.513
- [Christopher] So now
you might be thinking,

00:04:32.513 --> 00:04:34.550
"Well, filing a lawsuit
against your purported master,

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.270
that's pretty brave stuff."

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.270
But as it turns out freedoms
suits of this nature

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.560
were not that uncommon,
particularly in border states

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.890
where the slavery question
was hotly disputed.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.280
Indeed there were some 300
or so of these freedom suits

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.300
that were filed in
Missouri during the period

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.110
in which Dred Scott filed his case.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.230
Many people viewed the Missouri
Compromise as not so much

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.050
of a compromise but as
something that was forced

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.030
upon the slave states.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.390
And then you've got
the Kansas-Nebraska Act

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.890
which gave similar autonomy
to those areas to decide

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.220
the slavery question and
whether or not it would be

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.140
introduced into those territories.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.080
- [Narrator] Interesting,
so people in the North

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.600
who opposed slavery or at the very least

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.730
didn't want slavery to expand,
would have been looking

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.140
in the 1850s and saying,
"Hey I thought we already

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.990
decided this, there wouldn't
be slavery north of this line

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.600
and now you're saying
maybe Kansas and Nebraska

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.880
could be slave states."

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.070
- [Timothy] Right and
that was a huge issue

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.350
in national politics because
northerners are starting

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.290
to grow very suspicious of
southerners on the slavery issue.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.420
They're starting to
speak of what they called

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.080
the slave power,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.080
that southern slaveholders
held all of this power

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.930
in Washington and that
they were running the show.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.400
And that this 1854 act
had made it possible

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.131
for slavery to potentially
expand into an area

00:05:56.131 --> 00:05:59.360
where previously it had been banned.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.940
- [Christopher] And you
really do get this escalation

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.100
of tension and the
Fugitive Slave Act of 1850

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.870
which basically forced
requirements upon free states

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.410
to ensure the longevity
of the slave states

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.930
by requiring them to
undertake certain behaviors

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.140
and the return of fugitive
slaves only escalated

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.730
the tension and concern
about the status of slavery

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.220
in American life.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.270
- [Narrator] Alright so we're
in this incredibly tense time

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.270
of the 1850s with the slavery
question yet unanswered

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.233
and Dred Scott and his case
gets to the Supreme Court.

00:06:37.233 --> 00:06:40.040
So how does the Supreme
Court rule on this?

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.560
- [Christopher] In a seven to two ruling,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.110
the Supreme Court held that
Dred Scott was not a citizen

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.190
of the United States, and so therefore

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.780
he could not bring his freedom
suit before federal court,

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.640
which is really a jurisdictional question.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.380
But then the Court also
goes on to invalidate

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.810
the Missouri Compromise, despite finding

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.980
that it lacked jurisdiction
to hear the case.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.530
- [Timothy] What happens
when the case is being argued

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.220
is that one of the
arguments that's introduced

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.940
is this idea that when
Scott had been taken

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.920
into free territory, he
wasn't necessarily free

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.920
because the Missouri Compromise
was unconstitutional.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.490
And so what the Court
ends up doing is not only

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.650
ruling on the status of Scott, but also on

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.880
the status of slavery in
these federal territories

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.350
in the west and the extent
of the powers of Congress

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.040
over slavery in the west.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.400
- [Narrator] Interesting so
Chief Justice Roger Taney

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.300
is then leading the Supreme
Court and he, I guess,

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.540
leads the reasoning about this case.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.230
So what were some of the arguments that he

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.898
eventually accepted and
made in his decision?

00:08:00.898 --> 00:08:03.620
- [Timothy] Chief Justice Taney's
a very interesting figure.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.740
He had been on the court for many years.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.470
He, in his early years, had
been moderately anti-slavery,

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.850
had freed most of his
own slaves, and had made

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.550
anti-slavery statements.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.550
But by 1857 Taney
reflected the larger change

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.690
that had taken place
within his political party,

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.480
Taney was a Democrat.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.880
And the Democratic party
had become more Southern

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.430
dominated and more pro-slavery.

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:37.170
And Taney then, by
1857, really is a symbol

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:40.660
of pro-slavery Southern thought.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.590
- [Christopher] Justice Taney's opinion

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.480
is somewhat notorious.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.150
He makes a series of arguments and

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.880
one is legal, the others are
really not legal arguments

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.300
as I'll explain.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.780
What he starts out by
saying is that just because

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.270
you're a citizen of a state,
that does not make you

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.850
a citizen of the United States.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.378
He says basically the federal government

00:09:03.378 --> 00:09:08.060
has exclusive authority
to decide who is a citizen

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.640
of the United States.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.690
Then he makes a second
argument and he says

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.690
even if Dred Scott were a
citizen of the state of Missouri

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.130
he would not be a citizen
of the United States

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.370
because he's black.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.570
And what he meant by that
is that the word citizen

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.740
as used in the Constitution

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.250
and the Declaration of
Independence categorically excluded

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.780
members of the Negro race.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.690
- [Narrator] This is fascinating
because it seems to me

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.926
like Justice Taney may have
been ignoring a long history

00:09:39.926 --> 00:09:43.390
of free people of color
in the United States

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:47.140
who had voting rights,
who had property rights.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.890
- [Timothy] He was and that
was part of the criticism

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:54.330
of the majority opinion that comes in,

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.850
especially the dissent written
by Justice Benjamin Curtis.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.650
Curtis had the lengthier
of the two dissents

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.907
and the more thorough legal argument

00:10:04.907 --> 00:10:08.590
because, as you point
out, that in five states

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.810
at the time of the founding,
that African-Americans

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.528
did exercise the right to vote

00:10:15.528 --> 00:10:18.990
that was a sign or some
sort of an indication

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.130
of their status as citizens.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:26.130
And so the argument made
by Justice Curtis then,

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.990
is that Taney's reading of
history was that the founders

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:35.990
had not intended for
African-Americans to be part of

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:41.300
the people or the citizens
that were referred to

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.070
in the text of the US Constitution.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.110
- [Christopher] What
Justice Taney has done here

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:51.570
has basically created a
blind spot for himself

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.660
and he goes on to point out
that this is not his belief,

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.500
this belief in Negro inferiority,
but he said that it was

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.090
a fixed and universal belief
within the civilized portion

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.220
of the white race, he said
it was an axiom, a truth.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.610
But what's interesting
is that he says this

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:09.767
without a citation.

00:11:09.767 --> 00:11:12.360
He says that these aren't his
views, these are the views

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.390
of the framers, the
great men who were high

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.100
in literary accomplishment,
high in their sense of honor.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.470
He said that they perfectly
understood the language

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.690
that they used, and how it
would be understood by others.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:27.090
And there's this great
quote in the opinion

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:30.750
where he says that they,
the framers, knew that

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.530
it would not in any part
of the civilized world

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.180
be supposed to embrace the Negro race,

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.520
which by common consent had been excluded

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.560
from civilized governments
and the family of nations

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.193
and doomed to slavery.

00:11:44.193 --> 00:11:45.870
What Justice Taney has done here,

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.700
is he's attempted to rewrite history.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.120
- [Narrator] So how the
American people respond to the

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.750
Dred Scott decision at large?

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:58.750
Where they generally
for it, or aghast by it?

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.070
- [Timothy] Well as you might expect,

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:02.960
things were split exactly down the middle.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.210
What we see in the South
is white Southerners

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:12.000
believe that the ruling is a vindication

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.460
of what they had been arguing.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.800
Southerners had been
arguing for many years

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.000
going back to John C.
Calhoun, that Southerners

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.520
and that Southern slave
holders had a bundle of rights.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.860
And they argued that they
had the right to own slaves

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.330
as property in the southern states.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.940
They argued that they
had a right to recapture

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.350
fugitive slaves who escaped into the north

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.470
and they also argued that they had a right

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.650
to take slaves into the west.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.680
And so Southerners then
feel that the Court

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.260
and the US Constitution are on their side.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.660
You see a lot of folks in
the north who are hostile

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.880
to what the Court has done,
because once again they

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.060
see it as further evidence that the Court

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:59.320
is dominated by the Democratic
party, by the slave power.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.270
And many of these folks
then are going to be

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.480
members of a new party,
and that was of course

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.810
the Republican Party.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.770
- [Christopher] I think the
abolitionists were furious

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:15.340
and I think Frederick
Douglas' statement calling it

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.880
a brazen misstatement of facts of history,

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.570
a scandalous and devilish
perversion of the Constitution

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:25.420
resonated and even future
Presidential candidate

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.460
Abraham Lincoln, that same
summer that the case was decided,

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.970
went out and denounced it publicly.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:35.440
- [Narrator] So Lincoln of
course wins the election

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.135
of November 1860 which becomes

00:13:38.135 --> 00:13:41.720
a precipitating event of the Civil War.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:46.030
Do you see the Dred Scott
decision as being a really

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:48.353
important cause of the Civil War?

00:13:49.209 --> 00:13:51.470
- [Timothy] Yeah so these things
are all linked, absolutely.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:55.840
Think about the ruling by
Taney in Dred Scott ruling that

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.640
slave-holders rights are absolute.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.320
Taney rules African-Americans
have no rights,

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.560
slaveholders have total rights.

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.550
This makes it possible for Lincoln to rise

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:10.940
as a political leader in the north because

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:15.940
he has something that he
can strongly criticize.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.210
Lincoln basically makes the
argument that the founders

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:24.180
had hoped for slavery
to disappear ultimately.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.470
And Taney's making exactly
the opposite argument.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.510
So the interesting thing
is, if you think about

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:35.510
how this story ends, it
ends in March of 1861

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:41.580
when Abraham Lincoln is
sworn-in as the 16th President.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.830
And who swears him in?

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.243
Of course Roger B. Taney.

00:14:46.729 --> 00:14:48.580
So between the time
when Lincoln was elected

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.880
in November of 1860 and
the time when he takes that

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.800
oath of office in March of 1861,

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.830
seven Southern slave-holding states,

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.280
those are the states that
leave the Federal Union first.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.050
Four other states of
course will join them,

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.830
but not until after the Civil
War has already started.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.300
- [Narrator] So there's
no Compromise of 1860,

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.770
instead what we get is a
four-year long Civil War

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:18.770
where more than 620,000
Americans are killed.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.465
And at the end of that war,
the North, the United States

00:15:24.465 --> 00:15:29.450
is victorious and slavery
in the 13th Amendment

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.120
is abolished forever.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.230
How does the end of the
Civil War relate back

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.000
to the Dred Scott case?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.931
- [Timothy] The 13th
Amendment ends slavery,

00:15:39.931 --> 00:15:44.010
the 14th Amendment has
to undermine or overturn

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:47.450
the other part of the
Supreme Court's ruling

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:51.190
which was this issue
of the rights of those

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.270
who previously had been held as slaves.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:58.150
And the 14th Amendment
is going to do that work

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:02.730
by stating that all who
were born in this country,

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.770
by virtue of their birth here are citizens

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:10.770
and that they have rights
that will be protected

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.650
by the Federal government.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:16.170
And if you think about
it, what has changed,

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:21.070
what has shifted, is the whole
national discourse of rights,

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.830
from the emphasis on the
rights of slaveholders

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:28.000
that we see in 1857, to
an emphasis on the rights

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.510
of those who previously
had been held as slaves.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:35.490
And arguably then what we
see during the Civil War

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:40.490
and Reconstruction is the
advent of a new discourse

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.110
focusing on human rights.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.773
And that I would argue is
profoundly significant.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.800
- [Narrator] So what happened
to Dred Scott after this?

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.070
Did he and his wife live to see the end

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.040
of the Civil War and the end of slavery?

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.950
- [Christopher] Unfortunately
Dred Scott did not.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:02.480
The Supreme Court renders
its decision in 1857

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:06.410
but he dies, unfortunately in 1858.

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:11.410
His wife Harriet though,
lives on to about 1876.

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:15.940
So she did live to see
the end of the Civil War

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.193
and the end of slavery.

00:17:18.586 --> 00:17:21.140
The Dred Scott case
made clear, at the time,

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.780
that the struggle for
citizenship and of course

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.590
the later struggle for civil rights,

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:30.530
is about the desire to be
treated with equal dignity,

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.900
to be viewed as possessing equal humanity.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.601
And what is perhaps most moving, I think,

00:17:36.601 --> 00:17:39.810
about the Dred Scott case
is the dignity with which

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.670
the Scotts carried themselves
throughout the entire ordeal,

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.250
despite the Court's best
efforts to deprive them

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:47.920
of that dignity.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.930
It was ultimately Dred and
Harriet who gained the respect

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:51.903
of the nation.

00:17:53.118 --> 00:17:54.480
And it was the inhumanity of the Court

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.870
and the institution of
slavery that was laid bare

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:57.943
for all to see.

00:17:59.048 --> 00:18:01.000
- [Narrator] So we've learned
that the ruling in Dred Scott

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.440
helped bring about the Civil
War by further dividing

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.060
the North and South over
the issue of slavery.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.590
Opposition to the case's outcome propelled

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.200
Abraham Lincoln to the
national political stage

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.340
and opposition to Abraham
Lincoln propelled slave states

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.760
to secede after his election as President.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:21.520
But the Dred Scott case was
also about the lives and fates

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.150
of one man and his family.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:26.090
Although Dred didn't survive
to see the end of slavery

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.060
and the passage of the 14th Amendment

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.740
granting equal citizenship
to African-Americans,

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.040
his family lived to see the rewards

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.480
of the struggle he began.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.680
