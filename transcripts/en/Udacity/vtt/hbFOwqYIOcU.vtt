00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.490
So now let's talk about a specific agile method, which

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.850
is also one of the first ones, extreme programming, also called

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.430
XP. And to introduce XP, I'm going to start with

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.520
a quote. The quote says XP is a lightweight methodology for

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.180
small to medium sized teams developing software in the face

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.770
of vague or rapidly-changing requirements. And this is a quote from

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.010
Kent Beck the American Software Engineer that created extreme programming.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.630
And by the way Beck was one of the original 17

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.570
developers who signed the manifesto in 2001. And as you can see

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.940
we are still talking about the methodology. So we are not just

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.760
talking about going out and just start writing software. There are principles.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.130
And there are practices that we need to follow, but we're going

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.330
to do it in a much more agile, and a much more

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.720
flexible ways than we did for our software processes. And also note

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.340
that the vague and rapidly changing

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.190
requirements are explicitly mentioned, because this

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.130
is really one of the important parts about all of this agile methodologies.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.780
so what is XP? XP is a. Lightweight. Humanistic.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.250
Discipline. Of software development. It is lightweight because it doesn't

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.190
overburden the developers with an invasive process. So process

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.510
is kept to a minimum. It's humanistic because as we

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.760
said, it's centered on people. People, developers, customers, are

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.520
at the center of the process. It's a discipline, as

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.870
we said, it includes practices that we to Follow.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.470
And finally, is of course about software development. Software development

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.530
is a key point of the whole method. In XP, developing

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.910
is like driving, imagine having a road, a wind road, we need

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.110
to able to drive our car down the road, take the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.640
abrupt turns, react promptly to changes, for example obstacles on the road.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.610
So, in a nutshell, change is the only constant. Eyes always

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.980
have to be on the road and it's about steering and not

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.110
pointing, and XP is trying to do the same thing, while creating

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.190
softer systems. In XP we need to adopt a mentality of sufficiency,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.820
what does that mean? How would you program if you had all

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.010
the time in the world? No time constraints at all, you will probably

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.090
write tests instead of skipping them, because there's no more resources. You

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.200
will probably restructure your code often,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.210
because you see opportunities to improve it,

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.300
and you will take them. And you will probably talk to fellow

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.910
programmers and with the customer, interact with them, and this is actually the

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.700
kind of mentality that XP is trying to promote and agile processes

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.760
in general. And we will see that the following some of the practices

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.250
that XP is advocating, you can actually achieve these goals and you can

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.840
actually behave in this way. And the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.010
development process is going to benefit overall.
