important thing to maintain the temporal

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330
important thing to maintain the temporal
 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.660
important thing to maintain the temporal
consistence between adjacent frames so

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670
consistence between adjacent frames so
 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.540
consistence between adjacent frames so
from the you know from the secrets here

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550
from the you know from the secrets here

the temporal we have compared with the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340
the temporal we have compared with the
 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.310
the temporal we have compared with the
traditional image style transfer and no

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320
traditional image style transfer and no
 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.790
traditional image style transfer and no
or compared with our proposed method the

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800

the circles and the bond boxes there you

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030
the circles and the bond boxes there you
 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.030
the circles and the bond boxes there you
can see that the style changes the

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040
can see that the style changes the
 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.730
can see that the style changes the
changes significantly but for our video

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740
changes significantly but for our video
 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.370
changes significantly but for our video
part it can maintain a good consistency

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380
part it can maintain a good consistency
 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.220
part it can maintain a good consistency
so this will prevent it will eliminate

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230
so this will prevent it will eliminate
 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.620

Network and the content lost Network and
 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.900
Network and the content lost Network and
also the the temporal loss so with this

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910
also the the temporal loss so with this
 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.200
also the the temporal loss so with this
loss is the well design we can we can

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210
loss is the well design we can we can
 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.880
loss is the well design we can we can
train the networks to make the network

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890
train the networks to make the network
 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.440
train the networks to make the network
okay preserve the content and as well as

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450
okay preserve the content and as well as
 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.810
okay preserve the content and as well as

between our choice on the frames okay so

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960
between our choice on the frames okay so
 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.659
between our choice on the frames okay so
for these are special training we have

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669
for these are special training we have
 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.420
for these are special training we have
the two frame coordinator training so it

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430
the two frame coordinator training so it
 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.760
the two frame coordinator training so it
means that we input the adjacent to

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770
means that we input the adjacent to
 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.830
means that we input the adjacent to
firms into the network and then you try

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840
firms into the network and then you try
 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.839

function to join the network and also
 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:47.980
function to join the network and also
another another advantage is that we do

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:47.990
another another advantage is that we do
 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.659
another another advantage is that we do
not need to computer optical flow

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669
not need to computer optical flow
 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:51.580
not need to computer optical flow
information on the on the fly so it

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590
information on the on the fly so it
 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.330
information on the on the fly so it
means that we can well we can well make

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340
means that we can well we can well make
 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.140
means that we can well we can well make
the Magnum we can well max the inference

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150
the Magnum we can well max the inference
 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.059
the Magnum we can well max the inference
very fast because we do not need to

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:01.069
very fast because we do not need to
 

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:04.300
very fast because we do not need to
compute computer the optic flow normally

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310
compute computer the optic flow normally
 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.580
compute computer the optic flow normally
the optical is the most complicated part

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.590
the optical is the most complicated part
 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.189
the optical is the most complicated part
in video parts okay

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199
in video parts okay
 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:11.920
in video parts okay
and I thing is that because we are you

know this is name instant message this

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:14.719
know this is name instant message this
 

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:17.649
know this is name instant message this
is instant message a PPS so the person's

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:17.659
is instant message a PPS so the person's
 

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:19.360
is instant message a PPS so the person's
will share therefore their pictures in

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:19.370
will share therefore their pictures in
 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.450
will share therefore their pictures in
with the with the with their friends so

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460
with the with the with their friends so
 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.249
with the with the with their friends so
the pictures may be taking in and the

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:24.259
the pictures may be taking in and the
 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:26.170
the pictures may be taking in and the
different conditions for this case we

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:26.180
different conditions for this case we
 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.080
different conditions for this case we
want to handle the yeah makes the image

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.090
want to handle the yeah makes the image
 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.990
want to handle the yeah makes the image
quality enhanced enhanced for the

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000
quality enhanced enhanced for the
 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.420
quality enhanced enhanced for the
low-light images so we have if you take

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:34.430
low-light images so we have if you take
 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.219
low-light images so we have if you take
an image in the low light you can now

00:07:36.219 --> 00:07:36.229
an image in the low light you can now
 

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:38.110
an image in the low light you can now
you cannot define you cannot find the

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.120
you cannot define you cannot find the
 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.080
you cannot define you cannot find the
age of the content and also the the

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.090
age of the content and also the the
 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.050
age of the content and also the the
color you cannot find you cannot take

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:44.060
color you cannot find you cannot take
 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.240
color you cannot find you cannot take
the right colors so we proposed a method

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:46.250
the right colors so we proposed a method
 

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.480
the right colors so we proposed a method
to enhance the low-light images and we

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:49.490
to enhance the low-light images and we
 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.189
to enhance the low-light images and we
have the image here and with Mecca

00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199
have the image here and with Mecca
 

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:53.469
have the image here and with Mecca
displayed to the original video for

00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:53.479
displayed to the original video for
 

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:55.930
displayed to the original video for
remade part and also the edge part so

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:55.940
remade part and also the edge part so
 

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.579
remade part and also the edge part so
because the aji the mostess talent to

00:07:57.579 --> 00:07:57.589
because the aji the mostess talent to
 

00:07:57.589 --> 00:08:00.219
because the aji the mostess talent to
the human perception so for the low

00:08:00.219 --> 00:08:00.229
the human perception so for the low
 

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:02.320
the human perception so for the low
lighting in low light input original

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:02.330
lighting in low light input original
 

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.529
lighting in low light input original
part which we use in critical style to

00:08:05.529 --> 00:08:05.539
part which we use in critical style to
 

00:08:05.539 --> 00:08:08.079
part which we use in critical style to
encoded image and decode image cats are

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:08.089
encoded image and decode image cats are
 

00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:09.879
encoded image and decode image cats are
in low results and also for the edge

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:09.889
in low results and also for the edge
 

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:12.969
in low results and also for the edge
part will utilize also something like

00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:12.979
part will utilize also something like
 

00:08:12.979 --> 00:08:15.309
part will utilize also something like
the encoder decoder and afterwards we

00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:15.319
the encoder decoder and afterwards we
 

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:17.679
the encoder decoder and afterwards we
have the skipped layer and a ways the

00:08:17.679 --> 00:08:17.689
have the skipped layer and a ways the
 

00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:18.640
have the skipped layer and a ways the
iron style

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:18.650
iron style
 

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.709
iron style
to catch the edge information then paste

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:20.719
to catch the edge information then paste
 

00:08:20.719 --> 00:08:23.170
to catch the edge information then paste
this to the content information and a as

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:23.180
this to the content information and a as
 

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.510
this to the content information and a as
and also the edge information will

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520
and also the edge information will
 

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.309
and also the edge information will
combine them a together then to have a

00:08:27.309 --> 00:08:27.319
combine them a together then to have a
 

00:08:27.319 --> 00:08:30.519
combine them a together then to have a
enhanced quality of the images and then

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:30.529
enhanced quality of the images and then
 

00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:33.310
enhanced quality of the images and then
we catch some perceptual losses and also

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:33.320
we catch some perceptual losses and also
 

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.740
we catch some perceptual losses and also
other adverse or losses to enhance the

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:35.750
other adverse or losses to enhance the
 

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.040
other adverse or losses to enhance the
quality of the image okay this is some

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.050
quality of the image okay this is some
 

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.529
quality of the image okay this is some
results and we have the the first zero

00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:41.539
results and we have the the first zero
 

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.990
results and we have the the first zero
is a low-light images that were provided

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000
is a low-light images that were provided
 

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.350
is a low-light images that were provided
and we use the our networking how we can

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.360
and we use the our networking how we can
 

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.170
and we use the our networking how we can
well Rick we recover the content of the

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:50.180
well Rick we recover the content of the
 

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.600
well Rick we recover the content of the
image and also the colors can be well

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:52.610
image and also the colors can be well
 

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:53.820
image and also the colors can be well
preserved

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:53.830
preserved
 

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.030
preserved
okay so this is this is one part of we

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040
okay so this is this is one part of we
 

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.190
okay so this is this is one part of we
can share the images and improve the

00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200
can share the images and improve the
 

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.009
can share the images and improve the
image quality and the next step the next

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:02.019
image quality and the next step the next
 

00:09:02.019 --> 00:09:04.410
image quality and the next step the next
work is a mobile pose estimation

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:04.420
work is a mobile pose estimation
 

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.360
work is a mobile pose estimation
actually for the post estimation has

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:06.370
actually for the post estimation has
 

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.790
actually for the post estimation has
been well to study they either have been

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:08.800
been well to study they either have been
 

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.130
been well to study they either have been
well studied but for the mobile part if

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:11.140
well studied but for the mobile part if
 

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.400
well studied but for the mobile part if
you will need to perform the network

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:14.410
you will need to perform the network
 

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.920
you will need to perform the network
compression and also Mac hated to detect

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:16.930
compression and also Mac hated to detect
 

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.720
compression and also Mac hated to detect
the scattering the other joints very

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:18.730
the scattering the other joints very
 

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:19.500
the scattering the other joints very
accurately

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:19.510
accurately
 

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.560
accurately
so in this means this part when mostly

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:22.570
so in this means this part when mostly
 

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.870
so in this means this part when mostly
focusing on the network compression and

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880
focusing on the network compression and
 

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.840
focusing on the network compression and
the network returning okay so they we

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:27.850
the network returning okay so they we
 

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.329
the network returning okay so they we
ship to the network from the PCs to the

00:09:30.329 --> 00:09:30.339
ship to the network from the PCs to the
 

00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:32.759
ship to the network from the PCs to the
mobile wires and we can perform the

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:32.769
mobile wires and we can perform the
 

00:09:32.769 --> 00:09:34.440
mobile wires and we can perform the
detection of the person in the market

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:34.450
detection of the person in the market
 

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.230
detection of the person in the market
persons and also for some front and back

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:37.240

that is EC maybe for the projection part

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:50.500
that is EC maybe for the projection part
 

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.130
that is EC maybe for the projection part
so this is not for real time and this is

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:53.140
so this is not for real time and this is
 

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.980
so this is not for real time and this is

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:45.180
skating here okay
so based on this this architectural we

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:45.190
so based on this this architectural we
 

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.400
so based on this this architectural we
perform the prediction and we we have

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:47.410
perform the prediction and we we have
 

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.520
perform the prediction and we we have
the we also propose the three about

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:50.530
the we also propose the three about
 

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:52.770
the we also propose the three about
three criteria to evaluate whether we

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:52.780
three criteria to evaluate whether we
 

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:58.370
three criteria to evaluate whether we
can actually perform the a accurate

00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:58.380
can actually perform the a accurate
 

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.560
can actually perform the a accurate
prediction so we have we have the four

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:01.570
prediction so we have we have the four
 

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:03.810
prediction so we have we have the four
matrix and then we'll compare with

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:03.820
matrix and then we'll compare with
 

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.690
matrix and then we'll compare with
different visual representation from

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:06.700
different visual representation from
 

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.360
different visual representation from
which G to inception to rest last night

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:09.370
which G to inception to rest last night
 

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.100
which G to inception to rest last night
and the for the other part will compare

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:11.110
and the for the other part will compare
 

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.520
and the for the other part will compare
with M FCC and and also the one that

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:14.530
with M FCC and and also the one that
 

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:18.510
with M FCC and and also the one that
part so we can see that you consider all

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:18.520
part so we can see that you consider all
 

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.550
part so we can see that you consider all
the audio features and video feature

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560
the audio features and video feature
 

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.710
the audio features and video feature
together we can get a better result and

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720
together we can get a better result and
 

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.760
together we can get a better result and
better results but if we kind me sample

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:26.770
better results but if we kind me sample
 

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.590
better results but if we kind me sample
the middle level high level and a lot of

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:28.600
the middle level high level and a lot of
 

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.360
the middle level high level and a lot of
fuel strategy together we can get to the

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:30.370
fuel strategy together we can get to the
 

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.730
fuel strategy together we can get to the
best performance so another thing is

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:32.740
best performance so another thing is
 

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.760
best performance so another thing is
that from nothing imagine to note that

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:35.770
that from nothing imagine to note that
 

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.410
that from nothing imagine to note that
either we have the if we have the

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:37.420
either we have the if we have the
 

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.240
either we have the if we have the
engagements the inkatha means that is

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:39.250
engagements the inkatha means that is
 

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:41.850
engagements the inkatha means that is
the behavior of the users so we can if

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:41.860
the behavior of the users so we can if
 

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.830
the behavior of the users so we can if
we can cut his engagement so we can make

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:43.840
we can cut his engagement so we can make
 

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.010
we can cut his engagement so we can make

one part is the image understanding here

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:51.760
one part is the image understanding here
 

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.760
one part is the image understanding here
and the image understanding this is a

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:53.770
and the image understanding this is a
 

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.310
and the image understanding this is a
very difficult part because we you may

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320
very difficult part because we you may
 

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.200
very difficult part because we you may
understand the image caption and image

00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:58.210
understand the image caption and image
 

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.390
understand the image caption and image
can be a very difficult part because

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400
can be a very difficult part because
 

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.070
can be a very difficult part because
we're not only to understand the image

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080
we're not only to understand the image
 

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.919
we're not only to understand the image
content but also we need to learn the

00:21:04.919 --> 00:21:04.929
content but also we need to learn the
 

00:21:04.929 --> 00:21:07.530
content but also we need to learn the
language the properties or the behavior

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:07.540
language the properties or the behavior
 

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.870
language the properties or the behavior
of the language compositions and also we

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:09.880
of the language compositions and also we
 

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.720
of the language compositions and also we
need to perform a Amati motio

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:11.730
need to perform a Amati motio
 

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.720
need to perform a Amati motio

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:11.550
challenge because first we need to
 

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:14.370
challenge because first we need to
understand the language under the next

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:14.380
understand the language under the next
 

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:16.260
understand the language under the next
we need to understand the video

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:16.270
we need to understand the video
 

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.060
we need to understand the video
sequester but for the video sequester

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:18.070
sequester but for the video sequester
 

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.950

understand is even challenger the images

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:19.960
understand is even challenger the images
 

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.080
understand is even challenger the images
because the temporal we need to not only

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:22.090
because the temporal we need to not only
 

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.780
because the temporal we need to not only
consider the image account the spatial

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:24.790
consider the image account the spatial
 

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.700
consider the image account the spatial
content of the image but also we need to

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:26.710
content of the image but also we need to
 

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:29.070
content of the image but also we need to
consider the temporal relationship

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080
consider the temporal relationship
 

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.610
