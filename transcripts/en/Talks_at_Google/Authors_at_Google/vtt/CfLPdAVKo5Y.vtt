&gt;&gt; MASS: Okay. Let me get myself ready. I've
never had given myself an introduction, therefore,

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.209
that's good. Okay. Well, on we get started.
My name is Cliff Mass and I'm a professor

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:12.010
of atmospheric sciences at the University
of Washington. And my specialty is weather

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.160
prediction, the weather of the Pacific Northwest.
I'm getting very interested in local climate

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.380
change too. And I guess I'm here because maybe
not for that reason, but because of the book,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.630
so whatever reason I'm here, okay? I'll go
from there. And it's a pleasure to be here,

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.870
you know, a company that has, well, changed
the way I work. I mean, it's really--my life

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.331
has radically changed because of Google in
a positive way. And I should also say that

00:00:37.331 --> 00:00:40.579
Google had an impact on this book and, in
fact, if you go and look for the book, I do

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:49.760
have some 3D graphics that your company helped
me put together. So it's in here. So what

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.559
I'm going to do is I want to talk about--I'll
talk maybe 35 minutes on Northwest weather

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.659
and climate and then I'll open up to questions
and I can go live too. You can see I'm on

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:03.160
the web too. We may have some fun with that.
So let's talk about Northwest weather and

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.170
I'll start with 101, and I do teach 101. In
fact, I'm teaching 101 in this fall, so I'm

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.791
authorized to do this. And I'm only going
to give you a little bit of background that

00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:18.800
will be useful for later on. Well, the keeping
up on the Northwest Weather, it's dominated

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.750
by two things: the Pacific Ocean, the Mountains,
and everything else is a detail. And, you

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.960
know, the first question people want to know
is, why is the weather here generally pretty

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.340
temperate and mild, okay, except for the summer,
of course. And the key thing is--one key thing

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.350
is the mountains over here, okay? Here in
Seattle in Western Washington, we have double

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.570
protection against the cold air and the interior
of the continent. Now, you have very cold

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.260
air that hits Eastern Montana and the central
part of the continent, but we have two blocks:

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.320
one is the Rockies and one is the Cascades.
And the way it works is this. It's an East-West

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.660
cross section here, so it's cold here in Montana
and what happens is, the coldest air is basically

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.460
held back by the mountains. Some air that
does get across, it sinks down into Eastern

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.629
Washington. But when air sinks, it warms,
because you're going from relatively below

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.810
pressure here to high pressure down here.
And so when you have air that goes to high

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.140
pressure, it's compressed and it's warm, just
like in a bicycle pipe, you know, a bicycle

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.000
pump warms up as you pump it up. And then
we have another filter. We have relatively

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.170
cooler air in Eastern Washington, only the--so
some mild array gets across and as it sinks,

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.260
it warm up further. So because that we have
these two mountain barriers, we cannot get

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.569
the primo cold air from the interior of the
continent getting here into Western Washington,

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:47.090
unless it's the most unusual of circumstances.
The other thing is the Pacific. You know,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.599
the Pacific Ocean--and this is the SSTs, the
sea surface temperatures of the Pacific--it

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.400
really is pretty mild and we're talking about
the winter, you know, temperature offshore

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.180
here maybe 50 degrees and it's just not that
much different during the summer time. Weather

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.239
tends to come from the West to move to the
East. We're in the mid-latitudes. The weather

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.450
moves this way. And the air moves generally
that way as well. So, during the winter time,

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.019
you know, we can't get the cold air from the
interior, the air is going over the Pacific,

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.700
which is relatively mild, and so we just can't
get that cold. In the summer time, which we

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.730
only have high pressure out here, we have
some air coming in towards us off the ocean,

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.200
and that keeps the temperatures relatively
low. I'm sure, you know, it's relatively low

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.400
in the summer time. So it's the mountains
and the ocean. The other thing to keep in

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.459
mind is how much mountains affect precipitation.
And, you know, I don't think I'm shocking

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.659
anybody to talk about this. When air rises,
it tends to cool, right, because it's expanding,

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:46.219
right? You come from high pressure to low
pressure and when air expands, it cools. And

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:50.180
the amount of moisture air can hold depends
on temperature. Warm air could hold more moisture

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.569
than cold air. And so when it rises, it cools
and eventually, you know, it maybe able to

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.269
hold the moisture down here when it's warm,
but when it's colder, eventually, it gets

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.419
to a stage where you can just barely hold
the moisture to start it off with. You push

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:07.599
it any further, you get cloud droplets and
precipitation. So rising air, just cooling

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.659
and condensation, cloud precipitation, sinking
is just the opposite. You get warming and

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.000
drying. And so, you know, this is the pattern
we see all over the Northwest: up with rain

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.370
and clouds, sinking, the opposite. And it's
just so dramatic, it's amazing. During the

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.470
winter time, the winds set to be out of the
Southwest, okay, coming off the Pacific. So

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.030
air rises on the Olympics over here, and you
get this tremendous rainfall. You get 150,

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.550
sometimes 200 inches on this side of the Olympics.
And as the air sinks down into Sequim in this

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:46.180
area--you know, this is the famous rain shadow--you
may have 15, 18 inches in the area here. That's

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.720
a tremendous variability. And you have the
same thing to a lesser degree on the Cascades,

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.771
enhancement on one side and much less precipitation
on the other. So, you know, on one side of

00:04:56.771 --> 00:05:02.280
the Olympics, you got a rainforest and then
the other side, you have Sequim. It was actually

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.169
cacti that are natural. And, you know, I get
a lot of questions at UW from out of town.

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.449
From California, the number one question is
people want--they can't believe this dry.

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.699
They want to check about retiring up here.
I mean, Sequim is a retiree center. You may

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.990
know about that. They have all those golf
courses there. So, Sequim gets about 16 inches

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.320
a year. Los Angeles gets about the same. So
you have Los Angeles rainfall in Western Washington.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.370
It's really--I think it's pretty, pretty,
it's pretty amazing. The other thing is a

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.400
lot of exaggeration going on about how about
wet the Northwest is, especially the West.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.580
And our annual rainfall is really not that
unusual compared to the rest of the country.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.520
Seattle gets 38 inches; Portland gets 37;
Houston gets, you know, 47; New York gets

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:54.440
43; Atlanta, 50; look at that, Miami, 57.
So we don't--our total precipitation, we don't

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.650
get much here in the Puget Sound [INDISTINCT].
On the other hand, if you look at the number

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.370
of days of trace precipitation, just a hundredth
of an inch. There, well, okay, we're the leader

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.759
there, right? But what really gets bad is
the number of cloudy days, where we average,

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:16.330
you know--Portland, Seattle around 230 and,
you know, I mean, that's why you go to Miami,

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.830
117, right? So it's not the total rainfall
that's so crazy around here, right? Exactly,

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.320
we get a lot of light rain. I mean, that's
the essence of the rain here. The other thing

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.979
people don't think about is that we have what
we call a Mediterranean climate. So a Mediterranean

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:35.879
climate is one where you get a lot of precipitation
in the winter and it's dry in the summer time,

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:40.770
okay? And this here is the Seattle, Tacoma's
precipitation, okay? And here in the middle

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.820
of summer we are dry as hell and Ohio only
gets typically about 0.7 inches. In fact,

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:51.189
last year, we got a lot less than that, okay?
And then, it peaks up in the winter time,

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:54.629
November, December, January, February, right?
So we really have two seasons. It's really

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:59.190
only bad around here rain-wise for about four
months of the year. And we're drier than most

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:05.860
of the country during the middle of the summer
compared to New York. Look at New York. This

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:11.180
is four inches here. They get about the same
amount. So, okay, so you guys are real smart,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:17.600
what's the difference between us and them?
What don't we have that they have?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.580
&gt;&gt; Attitude.
&gt;&gt; MASS: Attitude is one. Look, it goes beyond

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:28.039
attitude. What don't we have in the summer
that they have in the space of the East Coast?

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:29.160
&gt;&gt; Humidity and thunderstorms.
&gt;&gt; MASS: Humidity and thunderstorms, right?

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.840
It's thunderstorms--and those are very related.
In fact--yeah, it is thunderstorms. There

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.430
it is. And, in fact, if you look at the map
of thunderstorms across the country, the annual

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.100
of number of thunderstorms, I mean, it's pathetic
[INDISTINCT] of the West Coast. Look at that.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.259
That's like ten, and here's Tampa. Here's
their headquarters over here. Well, they get

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:53.360
over a hundred. So why don't we get thunderstorms?
Well, it's related to the fact we don't have

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.659
humidity in the summer. Why don't we have
humidity? Why is it? Why is East Coast really

00:07:58.659 --> 00:08:01.300
humid in the summer and it's almost never
that way here?

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.879
&gt;&gt; Mountains.
&gt;&gt; MASS: What? Not the mountains. It's the

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:11.289
ocean. Strangely enough, it's the Pacific
Ocean that does that. Because our air is going

00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:16.090
over water, okay, you think you can pick all
the water that you can think of, right? The

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.361
trouble is that water is pretty cold and so
the amount of water vapor air can pick up

00:08:19.361 --> 00:08:23.590
depends on temperature. So since the water
is cold, even though you're going on all the

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.610
water you want, you can't pick up that much
water vapor. And so we--our air is actually

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.680
quite dry that comes in on us over here in
terms of how much water vapor that is in the

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:38.110
air, which is one way, well, one way that
expresses dew point where you have very low

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.620
dew points. So that's one--and water vapor
is important to thunderstorms because that's

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.491
an important source of energy for thunderstorms,
is water vapor. Because when the air rises,

00:08:47.491 --> 00:08:51.790
the water condenses and heat is released when
the water is condensed. The other thing that

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.690
thunderstorms like are a big change in temperature
with height. And this is sort of like--you

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.620
know, you can think of thunderstorms like
your hot cereal pot. Do you ever make hot

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.800
cereal, right? You heat it up and it starts
percolating, right, it causes convecting.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.660
Convection occurs when this big change in
temperature with height in your pot. Well,

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.180
the atmosphere is the same way. Well, to get
a big change in temperature with height, you

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.370
need to warm up the surface a lot, right?
But the trouble here is we don't--because

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.860
the air is coming up from the Pacific, we
don't warm up that much [INDISTINCT]. So for

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.630
a number of reasons, we don't get a lot of
thunderstorms and so we are dry. In fact,

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:27.970
in Seattle in July is drier than Phoenix in
July. You know, you don't think about that,

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:32.950
but it's true. The other fun thing about the
weather around here is the local weather features,

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.480
the fact that weather can be so different
in one place, you know, compared to some other

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.820
place 20 miles away. And that's one of the
things that got me really into this thing,

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.420
the local weather features. Well, in fact,
here, this is--what I have here in the picture

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:48.000
is one of the number one local weather features
here in the summer time. The big forecasting

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
problem in the summer is the onshore push.
You may here this on TV, the onshore marine

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.810
push. Well, this is a visible satellite picture.
This is the highest resolution satellite picture

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:02.140
that we get operationally from the weather
service and, you know, we're right over here.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.630
You can see these low clouds. These are all
low clouds stress coming along the coast.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.449
What happens is we can get a warm period,
like we had, like, a week or two ago, where

00:10:10.449 --> 00:10:14.899
it's all clear, very warm, and then the marine
air pushes up along the coast with the low

00:10:14.899 --> 00:10:18.550
clouds and then pushes in. And when it pushes
in, our temperatures drop and we get the low

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.860
clouds coming in. This is called the marine
push. This is the key summer time local weather

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:29.029
feature. Let me talk more about that later.
Okay. So mostly, local weather feature has

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:33.029
something to do with mountains. The number
one local weather feature where you are right

00:10:33.029 --> 00:10:38.990
now, and the Puget Sound, is the Puget Sound
Convergence Zone. Have you ever heard of that?

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:44.112
Yeah, you probably do. I got nods. Well, let
me tell you about that. When the winds on

00:10:44.112 --> 00:10:48.380
the coast are roughly between the West and
the Northwest, the air goes around the mountains--and

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.620
here's Olympics over here--it goes around
the mountains this way--they can't go for

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:56.769
the Cascades very well--they go around the
Olympic this way, and then the air then converges

00:10:56.769 --> 00:11:02.130
in on the opposite side. And what happens
is, when air converges in, it just can't keep

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.640
on converging forever, right? You got the
surface here, you have air converging, you've

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.740
got to force air to rise. And when the air
rises, it cools and gets clouds and precipitation.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:15.130
And so that's what happens here. The air converges
together and rises. And there it is. Do you

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:20.310
see those clouds right over there? That's
the Puget Sound Convergence Zone. Now, I'm

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:25.769
going to show you a weather radar image of
it. All of you are used to weather radar,

00:11:25.769 --> 00:11:29.270
right? You've seen it on TV all the time.
Weather radar tells you where it's precipitating.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:35.720
That's what it shows. And do you see that
band over here. This is the heavier mountains

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.220
right in here. That's the convergence zone.
Now, this is very useful knowledge if you're

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.180
recreationally-minded because if you know
there's a convergence zone going on, what

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.720
you also know is you can get out of it very
easily. So if you want to have a bike ride

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.023
or something, you know, and you're over here,
you shouldn't give up on it. All you have

00:11:50.023 --> 00:11:55.810
to do is, you know, put the bike in your car
and go south, you know, 10, 15 miles and you

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:59.920
can be in complete sunshine over here, okay?
As a matter of fact, that's something that

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.220
happens a lot. If you know the local weather
features here, you can often get it to good

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.500
weather almost anytime of the year if you
know where you go to--if you know where to

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:16.720
go. So here's the convergence zone. Okay.
Oh, wrong way. Another type of local weather

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.509
feature that really affects things are the
gaps. Okay, here's the Cascades here and there

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:23.930
are gaps in the mountains. There's the Columbia
Gorge here, there's the Fraser River Valley,

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:28.720
there's the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and there's
also another gap right over here. This is

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.700
not a sea-level gap. This is called the Stampede
Gap. And if you actually look at the good

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.920
top of the graphic map, you'll see that the
mountains are higher here, they're higher

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.750
here and there's a weakness in the mountains
right over here. That actually is a very important

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:46.290
gap. I'll tell you about some examples of
gap weather. All right. Some of you may have

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:54.870
been to Enumclaw, right? Enumclaw means place
of evil spirits in the Native American vernacular.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:13:00.040
And the question you may ask is why in the
hell is that an evil place, okay? Well, one

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.570
thing you may see on the news all the time--does
anybody live in Enumclaw here? I give the

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:12.529
trouble with the Enumclaw Chamber of Commerce.
The thing about Enumclaw is they get these

00:13:12.529 --> 00:13:17.350
amazing windstorms here or there where they
can have winds of over 100 miles per hour,

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:24.280
where it's actually nothing is happening anywhere
else. And here is an example. December 24th,

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:30.850
1983, I went there the next day to see this
in front of my own eyes. So this is an example

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:35.200
of what happened on that day. The winds gusted
to at least 118 miles per hour there before

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.240
the anemometer got blown away. Look mobile
homes, you know, well, they always get it.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:45.149
There's the BPA high-tension towers, they
were crumpled up. You know, power coming in

00:13:45.149 --> 00:13:49.171
from Eastern Washington just crumpled, well,
like Tinkertoys, okay, roof damage like this.

00:13:49.171 --> 00:13:56.620
It was--I couldn't believe it. And I did a
paper on that, on this thing, and I did this

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:03.100
map of the winds based on observations. Hundred
and twelve here, 8456, it's really localized

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:07.800
on the same night--and I remembered that night.
It was dead calm here in Seattle while the

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.610
winds were blowing 118 plus over there, okay,
dead calm. And these current of strong winds

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.600
came out here destroyed the--there was a boathouse
there--it destroyed the boathouse there, all

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:22.850
kinds of fun things, power outages all out
here. Well, why, why? Well, look at the terrain.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:28.990
Here's a better map of the terrain. The shade,
the dark shade is the high stuff and the less

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:33.630
high is by this model appearance. Can you
see that there's a weakness here in the mountains,

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:39.720
if you look closely? And so when we get certain
situations where we have cold high pressure

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:45.889
on this side, lower pressure on this side
and some flow approaching the mountains, what

00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:50.410
happens is, the air wants to find the weakness.
And so the weakness is here, and so the air

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:54.120
accelerates through this gap, then it's kind
of heavy and it accelerates down and accelerates

00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:01.079
right into this area here given these very
strong winds. So that's the reason why. And

00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:04.430
we've simulated this numerically, so, you
know, we can actually prove this is the case.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:10.029
Now, winds can go the opposite direction in
that gap and that makes possible this. There's

00:15:10.029 --> 00:15:15.430
a big wind energy complex all around Ellensburg,
around there. I don't know if you've ever

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.860
been there. And in fact, this is one of my
favorite places to visit. I was there a few

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.389
months ago, again, the Wild Horse Wind Farm.
And if you've ever been to that place, you

00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:26.620
can go--Puget Sound Energy has this wind farm
you can go visit, you know, not to far from

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:31.560
Ellensburg. Well, Ellensburg is a very windy
place and the whole area is very windy because

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.139
when the winds go from the other direction,
when there's higher pressure on Western Washington,

00:15:35.139 --> 00:15:40.180
lower pressure on Eastern Washington, the
air accelerates to the gap down to Ellensburg.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:47.360
And this is from a U.S. government document
showing you wind energy potential and, you

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.569
know, here's Ellensburg over here and a lot
of wind turbines are on this Whiskey Dick

00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:55.279
Mountain. That's where that--that's where
those turbines I just showed were, okay? So,

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:59.200
tremendous wind energy and it's because of
the gap, and Ellensburg is very windy or...

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:04.579
I don't know if you've ever been to Suncadia.
It's a hotel there. I don't know if you've

00:16:04.579 --> 00:16:09.779
been there. They put a golf course. It's up
there in Cle Elum and it's so windy that they--people

00:16:09.779 --> 00:16:15.660
almost can't play golf there because the balls
go flying around. You know, we have--some

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:20.360
of our weather features are more benign and
kind of interesting. Here's another example

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.000
of a local weather feature, lenticular or
mountain wave clouds. Do you ever see these

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:33.420
things over here? Isn't that pretty? We'll
try another one. And these are--and we see

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.850
these around here a lot. And this is caused
by air going across the mountains. If you

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:42.320
have air approaching a mountain, it's pushed
up by the mountain--and the air is relatively

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.810
stable, which means, if you push the air up,
they'll go up and they'll tend to come back

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.310
down again. It's all like a swing, right?
You can push a swing and it goes back and

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:52.649
forth, or the air does the same thing, or
a pendulum. And so when the air rises, it

00:16:52.649 --> 00:16:57.069
cools and you get clouds, and when it sinks,
the clouds disappear, and so you often see

00:16:57.069 --> 00:17:03.420
these, sort of, lens-shaped clouds that are
often rows, that form and leave the mountains.

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:08.919
And here is an example from space. Now, one
thing--oh, there was some fun slides I dropped.

00:17:08.919 --> 00:17:16.480
Maybe I shouldn't have. What do those clouds
look like? What do you think some people thought

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:24.130
these were? UFOs. And it's interesting story
that, you know, the UFO craze started here

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:32.159
in the Northwest. It started in 1947. A pilot
flying across the mountain, you know, he claimed

00:17:32.159 --> 00:17:39.110
UFOs, okay? And later on, some people, someone
from my department actually researched it

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:43.480
and found that it was perfect situation to
get these mountain waves. Now, I could give

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.821
you one other example. Have you watched the
presidential debate with Dennis Kucinich when

00:17:47.821 --> 00:17:53.220
he claimed that he saw UFOs? Where do you
think he saw it? He was staying in Graham,

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.850
Washington looking at the Mount Rainier. So
I think there's a possibility that, you know,

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:04.200
it could be the same thing. Okay. All right.
&gt;&gt; Why does the air go back up [INDISTINCT]?

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.629
&gt;&gt; MASS: Basically the atmosphere is stable
and I can't get to the detail, but basically,

00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:13.930
if you push air up--it's just one way to think
about it--if you push air up, it becomes colder

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.299
because it rises. It becomes denser than the
air around it and then it starts sinking down.

00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:24.060
Then it goes down, it overshoots. It becomes
too--it becomes warm than the air around it

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:27.650
because it's less dense and then it rises.
It's kind of the hand waving wave. Well, the

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:33.380
most intense weather that we get around here
are the Northwest windstorms, and I want to

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:38.331
mention that briefly. I have a chapter in
the book. I love these things. We get some

00:18:38.331 --> 00:18:42.679
world class weather around here and this is
an example of one of them. This is what--it

00:18:42.679 --> 00:18:46.670
was called mid-latitude cyclone, low pressure
center in the mid-latitudes. And this is what

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.080
it looks like in a satellite picture. I mean,
you don't have to be much of a meteorologist

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:57.070
to tell. It's right there, right? Okay. This
is very intense, low-pressure center here.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:01.570
So low-intense, low-pressure center, a cyclone
in the mid-latitudes, that's called the mid-latitude

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:07.100
cyclone. This is the inauguration-day storm
of January 20th, 1993. That's the date President

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:11.900
Clinton became president, okay? And I remember
this one. I was in my office [INDISTINCT]

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:16.780
department. The winds gusted to 88 miles per
hour UW. And I like [INDISTINCT] through hurricanes

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:23.789
and this was just like it. I mean, this was,
you know, in every way. Here's a more recent

00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:27.940
storm that some of you, you know, the younger
guys, I remember, the Hanukkah Eve Storm,

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:38.400
December 14th, 15th, 2006, yeah? Some of you
may have lost power for weeks. This is a surface

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.789
analysis of that storm right before it hit.
These lines are lines of constant pressure

00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:47.550
called isobars, and the thing I want you to
notice is how many isobars there are. That

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:52.790
means there's a huge change in pressure, especially
right there, okay? Now, winds are caused by

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:56.679
changes in pressure, differences in pressure
with forced winds. And so you can imagine

00:19:56.679 --> 00:20:05.360
what was going on there, right? And that area
went right over us. And the next day, I went

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.640
out to Mercer Island to take a look around.
Well, I couldn't drive anywhere. I had to

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:14.230
park the car near the freeway and walk in.
I walked in about 5 miles, and this is what

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:18.730
all the roads look like. I mean, this was
extraordinary damage due to this storm, you

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:23.160
know, hundreds and hundreds of millions of
dollars of damage. And those were the reasons

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.990
why this storm was particularly bad and that's
because so much trees went down. And why did

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:30.480
so many trees go down? Well, not only it had
strong winds, but the month before, the precipitation

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.430
was very, very heavy, and what happens is
the ability of soil to hold on to roots depends

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:40.570
on how saturated the soil is. Saturated soil
doesn't hold roots very well. And so we had

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:47.230
strong winds, saturated soil, and so, you
know, you can see what happened. But the strongest

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:51.970
storm, the strongest mid-latitude cyclone
to strike the Northwest was this one. This

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:57.400
is the Columbus Day Storm of October 12, 1962.
And this was probably the strongest mid-latitude

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.539
cyclone not only to hit the Northwest, but
hit anywhere in the United States in the last

00:21:01.539 --> 00:21:05.390
150 years. And just to show you where some
of the winds are, this is some guy named Wolf

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:10.190
Read. He's really into this. He had done the
Web. He has all these Web pages on the Northwest

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:16.980
windstorms. I want you to look at some of
these winds, 138, 131, 100 in Renton; 116

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:22.890
in Portland, 145 plus in Cape Blanco. We're
talking about winds over 100 miles per hour

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:27.440
all over the place. And so--this is at Cape
Blanco. They had sustained winds of 150 with

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:33.710
gusts to 179. This storm was equivalent to
a category 2 or 3 hurricane. I mean, we're

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:38.760
talking about the big time. And that's something
that can't happen around here. I mean, this

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:45.909
was probably the strongest storm since the
white men got to the Northwest. And, you know,

00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:51.270
one thing I want to stress: trees really make
it worse here. You know, people in Florida,

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:56.779
you know, they talk about their hurricanes,
but what do they got, some palm trees or something?

00:21:56.779 --> 00:22:00.419
You know, palm trees aren't going to do a
lot. They're not going to hit your house.

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:04.640
You get hit by a 140-foot fir, right, you're
going to know it, and your house can--just

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.809
cut the house in half, right? I mean, it's
funny, but it's not so funny, right? This

00:22:08.809 --> 00:22:13.679
makes things much, much worst here, here in
the Northwest. You know, the most costly damage

00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:19.200
here is not from windstorms. And it's actually
from flooding. And if you look at the billion

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.590
dollar storms, the official National Weather
Service documents, the billion dollar storms

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:26.340
across the United States, you know--you probably
can't read this very well--but these things

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.961
are... So that's flooding examples. These
are floods. I mean, the Columbus Day Storm,

00:22:29.961 --> 00:22:33.169
if this went to [INDISTINCT], it would've
been on there, okay? So we get--floods are

00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:38.070
big things, wild fires in California and hurricanes
in the Southeast, okay, and thunderstorms

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:43.320
in the Midwest. Most of our big floods are
associated with something that on the media

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:48.549
they call it Pineapple Express. And that is
when we have a current of moist warm air that

00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:52.419
comes out of the subtropics. And this is a
satellite image, because satellites can sense

00:22:52.419 --> 00:22:56.150
the amount of moisture 3-dimensional in the
atmosphere, okay, it's like Star Trek. We

00:22:56.150 --> 00:23:01.309
could do it, okay? And so this is a plume
of moisture coming in right from the subtropics

00:23:01.309 --> 00:23:07.630
into the Northwest. And our great range, rough
floods, and rainstorms are associated with

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:12.530
this. It has to be because the amount of water
vapor in the air depends on temperature so

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:16.580
for us to have really moist air that has to
be warmed to get the real primo floods. And

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.630
so this is an example of a pineapple express.
Some people call it atmospheric rivers. And

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:26.380
the less, really super, the last one, happened
in November 2006. You remember that one? And

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.059
you may not be able to read this page very
well, but these values, we're talking about

00:23:29.059 --> 00:23:36.220
here, the greens are 20 inches of rain in
a matter of a few days. That is a lot of rain,

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:39.200
considering we got about 30 inches typically
in a year. And Mount Rainier had 18 inches

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:44.300
in 36 hours. And I don't know if any you went
there, at Mount Rainier, after that disaster,

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:49.120
but it costs tens of millions of dollars of
damage, road taken out, you know, some of

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.370
my favorites places were washed away. Well,
something I added here the last minute for

00:23:52.370 --> 00:23:59.789
this talk I thought to be of interest is about
Northwest heat waves, okay, somewhat extreme

00:23:59.789 --> 00:24:04.480
that of events. You know, what we just went
through was very a historic, you know, period.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:11.080
And on the 29th of July, we had, you know,
the old record was 100 degrees. And in Seattle,

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.159
we achieved 103 and many, many other places
in the Northwest had their all-time records.

00:24:15.159 --> 00:24:20.320
All kinds of records were broken. I mean,
this--I mean, your grandchildren will ask

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:24.390
you about this storm, really. [INDISTINCT],
right across the lake to me up here, you got

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:28.240
105 degrees, okay? And it was 103 in my house,
which is not too far away. There's some place

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:35.910
down in--near Olympia that got close to 110.
And these are amazing temperatures. And the

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:42.601
question the people want to know is why? What
produce this heat? Well, we have this new--this

00:24:42.601 --> 00:24:46.350
is an upper atmospheric chart, and this thing--you
see an H, that's for high. This is what's

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:50.520
called a ridge of high pressure that builds
over us and we have this ridge that developed,

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:56.070
that was of extreme magnitude and extreme
persistence. So we start off with this tremendous--this

00:24:56.070 --> 00:25:03.830
pool of very, very, warm air. And then, on
the last day, ironically, some colder airs

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:09.620
started moving down into Montana over here.
And that was so--so there was some high pressure

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:13.279
associated with that. We developed this large
difference in pressure across the Cascades

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:17.200
and so air was pushed across mountains and
sunk. It was sinking down on the Western slopes.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.250
Sinking causes warming, right? And so you
got this extra warming that occur and that's

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:26.380
what spiked this up. So we have warm air and
then we had this--they had to spike up as

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:31.310
we got this offshore flow. And the other thing
that was really extraordinary about this thing--I

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:36.200
mean, you guys are technologists. Well, I'll
show off some of our technology. We forecast

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:41.919
this thing days ahead of time. This was from
a website--they were a private called probcast,

00:25:41.919 --> 00:25:46.340
www.probcast.com. This is the next-generation
technology in my field for forecasting. And

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:52.340
two days before it, it went all three, and
it just nailed it. And so--I mean, we've come

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:57.220
a long way to forecast extremes like that,
is very challenging. Maybe the question is--so

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:01.690
I can tell you how we do it, but... Finally,
the last thing I want to talk about is about

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:06.789
global warming around here and then I'll open
up to questions. And, you know, you hear all

00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:12.179
kinds of claims about global warming. Some
people talk about how the mountain snowpack

00:26:12.179 --> 00:26:16.440
has dramatically declined during the past
several decades. You've heard that, right?

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.409
And in fact, Mayor Nickels is big on that
one. I mean, he's claimed 50 percent drop

00:26:19.409 --> 00:26:22.360
in snowpack. The number of heavy rain and
windstorm events have already increased and

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:27.390
it will increase further in the global warming,
right? The media likes to say that. Some people

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:31.510
suggest the Northwest climate around here
is particularly sensitive to global warming.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.980
Now, on the other hand, there are other people
saying that global warming is some leftist

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.740
theory produced by Gore and his friends and
we don't have to worry about it, that it just

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:43.060
cycles and mankind is not going to, you know,
it has nothing to do with us. And I think

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:50.180
the truth of all of these is that none of
these are true. And the problem that many

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:55.980
of you know is that greenhouse gases are increasing.
And the greenhouse gas people talk about,

00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:02.220
most of all, is carbon dioxide, right, and
which is--which has increased rapidly during

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.480
the last several decades, and no matter what
we do, it's going to pretty decrease quite

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:10.710
a bit during this upcoming century, okay?
So CO2 is going up. Now, greenhouse gases

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:14.360
help keep us warm because they act like a
blanket. They actually--what they do is absorb

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.710
and send back down infrared radiation. Now,
I'll talk about that in a second. But greenhouse

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:20.049
gases are going up. Do you know what the number
one greenhouse is? It's not CO2. It's water

00:27:20.049 --> 00:27:24.340
vapor. Water vapor is a very potent greenhouse
gas. So anyway, the greenhouse, this greenhouse

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:30.420
stuff is important. I mean, the way, you know,
the way it works is our energy source is the

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.060
sun, so we have solar radiation coming in,
and that's what warms--and the atmosphere

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:37.580
is relatively transparent to the sun's rays
and hits the surface, the surface warms up.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:42.049
And then, the surface then emits infrared
radiation. In fact, everybody in this room

00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:44.860
is emitting radiation. Anything that is above
absolute zero emits radiation, okay? And so

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:48.919
you're emitting infrared, and so is the earth.
The earth emits radiation, okay? Now, if there

00:27:48.919 --> 00:27:52.419
was no atmosphere, that radiation would go
happily out into space, and then you'd have

00:27:52.419 --> 00:27:56.090
a balance between what's coming in and what's
going out. Well, the atmosphere have gases,

00:27:56.090 --> 00:28:01.019
like CO2, and methane and other gases that
absorb some of the infrared radiation and

00:28:01.019 --> 00:28:04.809
sends it back down to earth. It also emits
some out to space. So, instead of the stuff

00:28:04.809 --> 00:28:10.321
escaping, some of it is absorbed and sent
back down. That acts to warm us up. It's like

00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:13.750
a blanket, right? Why does the blanket keep
you warm? Because it lessens--it slows down

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:18.340
radiation or energy away from you. The problem
is, if you add a lot more greenhouse gases,

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.880
then you'll tend to increase this blanketing
effect, causing you to warm up. In fact, it's

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:26.100
worse than that because if you warm up the
earth, then that causes more water to evaporate

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.799
from the surface because evaporation depends
on temperature and that gives you more water

00:28:27.799 --> 00:28:30.529
vapor, which itself is a greenhouse gas which
causes you even more warming, and so the whole

00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:34.549
thing can rev up. Anyway, we understand this
stuff really well. There's no doubt about

00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:38.440
this business about greenhouse gases and how
it causes warming. It's absolutely and completely

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:43.600
understood from a theoretical and practical
level. We can simulate it, we can do everything.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:49.440
Okay. So, the way we try to simulate the future
climate is, basically, we use the same computer

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.870
models we use for forecasting, but we run
them for hundred years and we look at how

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:57.360
the greenhouse gases vary. So these are climate
models. Climate models are the same models

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.040
basically we use for weather forecasting.
And weather forecasting models have gotten

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:04.890
better, right? I mean, you know, some people
laugh about this, but actually we've gotten

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:08.610
much, much better at forecasting than we were,
say, 20 or 30 years ago. The main reason is

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:12.240
because of these computer models. Anyway,
this is a simulation, a hundred years into

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.790
the future, roughly, assuming that we don't
change what we do, okay, that we follow the

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:20.130
same trends in the past. And the thing you
keep in mind is that the Artic warms up the

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:29.710
most. The continents warm up more in the water
and the Eastern oceans warm up less than the

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:36.900
Western oceans. Now, where are we downstream
up? We're downstream of the ocean. Now, what

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:46.340
that does is that--and all weathers are coming
off the ocean, so our--we're going to warm

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:54.909
up more slowly than most places because we're
downstream of the ocean, which is going to

00:29:54.909 --> 00:30:04.880
warm up more slowly. So, actually, where we
are now is actually less sense to that global

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:13.980
warming than other places. I'm not saying
it's not going to happen, but it's going to

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:23.691
be slower here. The magnitude is going to
be somewhat less. Okay. And just to show you

00:30:23.691 --> 00:30:42.010
what's happened in last several years. This
is from '79 to 2008, the reds are warming,

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:47.050
but blue is actually cooling. The Eastern
Pacific hasn't warmed up. [INDISTINCT] coming

00:30:47.050 --> 00:31:05.360
in to us hasn't warmed up in the last 30 years.
And, in fact, if you look at the snowpack

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:14.309
and the Cascades, you'll see that it's up
and down a bit, 2006 from 1996, but there

00:31:14.309 --> 00:31:19.700
is no real trend, and that is because the
temperature of the ocean haven't change that

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:27.320
much. Now, eventually that's got to change.
What we've done is we have used some of our

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:32.409
computer forecast models at high resolution
and we've simulated forward a hundred years

00:31:32.409 --> 00:31:39.781
to see what the implications of global warming
is going to be here in the Northwest, and

00:31:39.781 --> 00:31:46.769
I'm going to show you that right now. These
are--I'm going to show you the change in temperatures

00:31:46.769 --> 00:31:58.460
in the winter time at the other surface. Now,
red is warming, blue is cooling. So this is

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:03.020
the difference in temperature between 1990s
and 2020s. And I want you to look--you'll

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:07.860
see that generally, you know, between now
and 2020s, I mean, we're talking about maybe

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:13.760
one or two degrees Fahrenheit, maybe something
like that. Here's the difference between the

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:20.460
1990s and the 2050s. Okay. We're still going
to see some temperatures getting up in to

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:31.429
the four degree range. And you see there are
certain bendings, there are certain places

00:32:31.429 --> 00:32:41.240
that
warm up more than others? That's where the

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:49.140
snow melts, is melting off. And the snow melts
off, you get enhanced warming. But now let

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:58.470
me show what it's going to look like between
1990s and 2090s. Some of you may live to see

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:08.010
that, especially the younger people in the
crowd. That is a different world. We're talking

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:14.919
about some--we're talking about 8 to 10 degrees
Fahrenheit warm ups in a lot of places. So,

00:33:14.919 --> 00:33:22.470
the warm up is not going to be linear. It's
going to be exponential. It's going to be

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:31.870
a lot than that. And the big warm up is not
going to be for the next 20 years. It's going

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:43.490
to be later in the century. And so, you know,
I wouldn't get my annual pass to see the snow

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:50.990
[INDISTINCT]. I [INDISTINCT] the money down
right now for the 2008, if you'll play a bad

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:56.049
investment. Now, everybody likes heat waves.
This is the number of summertime days with

00:33:56.049 --> 00:34:00.659
maximum temperature greater than 90 degrees
at Sea-Tac. These are only simulations, the

00:34:00.659 --> 00:34:07.500
number of days per decade. So, the 1990s,
2020s, okay, not that bad, you may not even

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:15.170
have to buy an air conditioner, right? 2050s,
and here's the 2090s. A lot of people in the

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:20.810
room got to see this one and some of you may
be lucky enough to see that one, right? It's

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:27.150
going--it's going to be a different world.
Change in snowpack, dramatic reduction of

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:33.650
snowpack in the Cascades by the time you get
to the end of the century, which has its own

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:43.960
implications. As the last slide, I'll show--this
shows you the amount of snow at Stampede Pass,

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:58.030
4000 feet, you know, Snoqualmie Pass area.
Here's 1990s, 2020s, '50s, 2090s. It's a real

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:06.230
different time. So that's what you got to
look forward to. We have a lot of work to

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:10.690
do on these simulations, but this is a taste
of what we're finding. The other things--and

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:23.790
I'll end with this--other major findings,
there doesn't seem to be any big change in

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:45.260
precipitation over the next hundred years.
There is no reason to expect stronger storms,

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:51.050
and it looks like we would become more like
Monterey. So you guys are in Mountain View

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:57.700
and you're going to have something in common.
It turns out spring and early summer may become

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:03.080
more--we have more low clouds here in Seattle
under global warming, because what happens

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:08.330
is, the interior of the continent warms up.
That causes pressure fault because warm air

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:13.140
is less dense than cold air. So you have lower
pressure in the continent, it's going to suck

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:19.210
some of that marine air in and we could actually
end up with more low clouds during the spring

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:34.970
and early summer. So, anyway, I think that's
where I'll end. Okay. You may talk and I'll

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:46.060
open it up to questions. I hope this works--about
the book or anything else. Okay.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:51.250
&gt;&gt; Can you tell us a little bit more about
probcast, the com site you mentioned?

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:57.400
&gt;&gt; MASS: Right. Okay. Now, the traditional
technology of weather forecasting is dependent

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:04.260
upon numerical simulation. And so, [INDISTINCT]
work is we get all the information from the

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:10.580
entire planet, okay, then we will have to
create a 3-dimensional description of the

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:15.020
atmosphere, then we run our models, which
are called the primitive equations. These

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:30.480
are the equations that describe the basic
physics of the atmosphere and we're able to

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:37.290
then use that to simulate into the future,
okay? So the traditional way of forecasting

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:44.260
was to do it once. The best shot of what you
think the initial state is, the best model,

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:53.060
you forecast into the future, okay? We call
that deterministic forecasting. And that's

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:59.830
where everything is kind of dependent upon
right now. But that is completely dishonest

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:04.170
in a way, because there's all kind of uncertainties
there, right? Uncertainties in the initial

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:09.090
state, there's uncertainties in the model.
For Jeff Renard or some TV guy to say, "The

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:14.720
temperature three days from now is going to
be exactly that temperature is ridiculous."

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:20.330
There is always uncertainty. The new way of
forecasting, the way that's going to dominate

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:28.670
the century is probabilistic forecasting.
And the way it works is, you don't do one

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:38.450
computer simulation. You do 50, you do 100,
you do 200, each slightly different, each

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:46.040
reasonable differently. So you'll have a multitude
of forecast and you can use those multitudes

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:53.930
of forecasting to get an idea of probabilities.
A gross example is, if half the simulation

00:38:53.930 --> 00:39:07.150
say it's going to rain and the half of it
says it won't rain, then you have, you know,

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:13.840
it's 50 percent, okay? Now, probcast takes
it one step farther. We now have a collection

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:27.800
of these forecasts. We call this the sum of
forecasts. It does statistical post-processing

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:34.910
to optimize the probabilistic forecast versus,
you know--maybe one of those computer models

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:42.760
are not as good as the other one recently.
It will weigh that one less. Anyway, it can

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.650
massage statistically to produce a statistical
forecast that's optimal. And that's what the

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:49.011
probcast--probcast stands for probability
forecast. And so, that's the--this is the

00:39:49.011 --> 00:40:05.410
first example of that kind of information
available on the Website. We've also tried

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:23.940
to make it so it's successful to people. I
mean, you're in that business, too, to start

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:37.520
to get complex information still in the way
people can--could get something out of. So

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.510
that's what probcast is. Other questions.
Yes.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:44.060
&gt;&gt; It seems like it's going to be interesting
to see some postmortems on--when the forecast

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:49.730
are grossly well. You say that occasionally,
very occasionally. I wonder if you go back

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:55.391
and say, hey, we were saying, you know, Sunday
is going to be great and Monday is going to

00:40:55.391 --> 00:41:05.530
be raining, and it's the opposite or...
&gt;&gt; MASS: Oh, we do a lot of that. I mean,

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:15.300
we do that both in case studies, we have verification.
There are different complex verification systems

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:18.620
that are running on these forecasting systems.
So that is really important guidance that

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:23.010
helps improve the system. That's why they've
gotten so much better. So there is a very

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:27.100
active process to do that. You learn a tremendous
amount where things go wrong.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.100
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; MASS: Okay.

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:32.630
&gt;&gt; Which I enjoyed very much like you.
&gt;&gt; MASS: So explain why things went wrong?

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:44.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No. I'm saying I think that would
be interesting for people to say, hey, [INDISTINCT],

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:50.120
like here's what's in the wrong analysis.
&gt;&gt; MASS: Right. And things go wrong, but they

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:54.000
got less road than they're used to. Yes?
&gt;&gt; The different Website and different TV

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.280
stations have different forecasts for the
future. You use the same model to do the meteorologist

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:03.170
[INDISTINCT] but different models themselves
they share. How do they pick the kind of forecast...?

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:14.010
&gt;&gt; MASS: Right. Well, you know, one of the
skills of a meteorologist is we have many

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:28.290
different computer models and we have to decide
which ones we believe or don't believe or

00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:34.200
whatever. TV stations, they tend to be--there's
differences, but they tend not to be very

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:41.300
large. In fact, I teach 101 and I had for
twice I've had my students write down all

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:49.560
the forecasts from different TV stations,
and then to evaluate them. And what I found,

00:42:49.560 --> 00:43:06.250
there was no statistically significant difference
between their 0 to 48 hour forecast. They

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:22.880
might get--they start with the service forecast
and they tweak it a little bit, but they don't

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:33.060
really tweak it very far. Where the difference
is to develop are on the longer term, like

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:48.230
the 5 to 10 days once. And, quite frankly,
God knows where some of them get that stuff,

00:43:48.230 --> 00:44:02.850
yeah? But there is very little scale. I mean,
what you got to keep in mind is a good weather

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:06.550
consumer, is that forecasts are really good
for the first two days and it decreases in

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:15.330
scale. By the time you get to three or four,
it's going down. Four or five, it's getting

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:28.840
kind of marginal. And then, by the time it
gets to seventh day, the scale is dropping

00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:36.160
rapidly. So I wouldn't take those very seriously.
Yes.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:40.960
&gt;&gt; What do you think about the very local
measurement of forecasting [INDISTINCT] with

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:48.460
those, that they have people, like, in weather
stations? I mean, are you familiar with that?

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:53.840
&gt;&gt; MASS: Oh yeah, oh yeah, very much so. Well,
one of the great revolutions in our field

00:44:53.840 --> 00:45:01.780
is the availability of a multitude of surface
substations everywhere. [INDISTINCT] example

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:12.260
of that. I mean, right now, in my department,
in real time, I get 72 different telemeter

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:15.610
networks, including the weather underground.
What we get in Washington State alone, I think,

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:33.310
approximately 4000 observations per hour,
from all the networks. And so, the weather--you

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:39.840
know, weather undergrounds made that possible
that you can get weather instruments pretty

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:49.930
cheap, that the interface of the Internet
or, you know, [INDISTINCT] with them, and

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:55.330
so everybody is putting their weather observations
online. The only problem is the quality. Yes,

00:45:55.330 --> 00:46:01.840
a lot of people don't know where to put their
weather observations or they, you know, there's

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:06.710
issues about where the placement, and--but
some of the [INDISTINCT] are very good. So

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:10.960
it's a good thing. Yes.
&gt;&gt; As opposed to the [INDISTINCT] sensors

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:18.980
that are on the ground, I've heard years back
that one of the [INDISTINCT] is there's really

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:40.730
not a lot of sensors around in the oceans
so we'd only have data about the Pacific.

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:46.980
&gt;&gt; MASS: Right. So the forecast scale is less
in the East Coast. And one of the reasons

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:53.480
is, you know, we have the Pacific out there
where there's less observations. But that's

00:46:53.480 --> 00:47:03.760
less of a problem than it used to be because
of satellite assets. You know, I wasn't half

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:09.190
joking when I was talking about Star Trek,
you know, when they go around a new planet,

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:14.400
you know, depending how old you are, whether
it's Data or Mr. Spock, or whoever you want

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.180
to think about here, you know, they go to
a planet, they scan the planet, right? We're

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:20.150
doing that now. We have a multitude of satellites
up there that are 3-dimensionally probing

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:26.000
the planet getting information, including
over the oceans. And so that has radically

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.890
improved our ability to know what's happening
out over the Pacific. And because of that,

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:34.270
the forecasts have gotten much better. One
proof of that is that the weather forecast

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:35.611
in the Southern Hemisphere have now become
almost as good as Northern Hemisphere. That

00:47:35.611 --> 00:47:41.630
was never true before. And most of the Southern
Hemisphere is ocean, it's the fact our satellites

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:45.700
can see what's happening 3-dimensionally,
you know, over the oceans. Now, it gives you

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:50.720
the ability to forecast much better there
and here. Now, one thing I've been pushing

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:56.620
forward is a radar on the coast, and we're
going to get that in two years. That could

00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:03.280
give us more information because we can't
see the details of stuff from a satellite.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:11.380
The weather radar can look hundreds of miles
offshore and be able to see that. So we're

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:18.180
still not as good as--well off as East Coast,
but it's not that much different now. Yes?

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:24.020
&gt;&gt; There's much forecasting done outside of
the government on a daily basis or is mostly

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.840
the weather servers cause a little bit of
[INDISTINCT]?

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:30.860
&gt;&gt; MASS: Well, the weather service is responsible
for the forecasting and warnings, but the

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:35.360
private sector is really, you know, coming
into the forecasting business. In fact, some

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:38.214
students of mine started a company called
3Tier, which is located downtown Seattle,

00:48:38.214 --> 00:48:40.950
and they're the number one wind energy prediction
company in the United States now, and they

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:45.600
run computer models themselves, bring data,
and so they do a lot of the forecasting stuff,

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:49.920
but this is for, you know, one application.
So the private sector is moving into that

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.880
now.
&gt;&gt; Are the government also proprietary or

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:54.400
they...?
&gt;&gt; MASS: No. None of these things are proprietary.

00:48:54.400 --> 00:49:01.590
They're all open. I mean, I run a numerical
weather prediction in my office and I run

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:04.610
the different models. Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Are the insurance company starting take

00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:08.140
into account long-term forecasting, change
in development, that kind of stuff into setting

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:11.550
insurance rates for...?
&gt;&gt; MASS: I know they're thinking about it.

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:18.310
They show up at the meetings. They have been
hiring students. We had a number of our students

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:24.200
at UW Atmospheric Science department, which
I'm in, who have been hired by insurance companies.

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:30.570
I haven't debriefed them carefully in what
they're doing over there, but the implication

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:35.360
is they're thinking about it at least.
&gt;&gt; That's kind of what I expected to see first

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:39.450
thing, becoming a driver for people changing,
climate change behavior or credit mitigating

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:42.500
some change behavior as the insurance companies
start to push it forward.

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:47.280
&gt;&gt; MASS: That's funny, insurance companies.
I got a call from the City Seattle. They want

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:51.750
to spend a quarter of a billion dollars into
drainage pipes. What's [INDISTINCT] should

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:55.640
they be? These pipes are going to last three
quarters of a century.

00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:59.470
&gt;&gt; But bigger.
&gt;&gt; MASS: Well, that's true, but it costs a

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:06.200
lot of money, okay? But they had spent tens
of millions into those extra for the big size,

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:10.640
you know. What is the global warming research
indicates? Because that's--there's all kinds

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.900
of industries. Yeah?
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT]

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:19.400
&gt;&gt; MASS: Well, how much do you know? I mean,
the first place to go is the weather service

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:24.320
because they--I mean, the people know what
they're doing. So that would be the first

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:32.380
place I would go to. And in fact, you can
click on them on spots, so I think that's

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:37.510
probably where I would start. If you could
interpret the data yourself, then there's

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:43.440
all kinds of places to look for satellite
imagery, radar, whatever, the models, yeah,

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:47.450
even our sites.
&gt;&gt; Speaking about forecasts, did you predict

00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:53.500
that strange, sort of, counterclockwise rotation
that happened over at the North Cascade during

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:57.240
the heat wave? Is that part of the model?
&gt;&gt; MASS: Strange counterclockwise rotation?

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.940
&gt;&gt; There was a tremendous amount of thunderstorms
going on the area.

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:08.760
&gt;&gt; MASS: Oh, yeah. Oh no, the model said that.
Yeah. I mean, there was a trough and the thunders

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:15.420
and the convection was coming around and,
yeah, the days before, you know, with the

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:23.651
big day. And in fact, that had a big effect
on us here. One of the unusual aspects of

00:51:23.651 --> 00:51:29.080
that heat wave was how humid the air was.
You may have noticed that, right? The dew

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:34.900
points were very high. And so, what I did
with my high-resolution computer models, I

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:39.880
did the trajectories to find where did that
air come from that was so humid. It turns

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:43.660
out they started over the lower slopes of
the forest of British Columbia. So you had

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:47.860
all those thunderstorms dropping rain, so
it's very moist, and the air would ride over

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:51.100
it and pick up the moisture and came into
us. That's where it came from. Yes?

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:54.890
&gt;&gt; What's sort of the system do you run your
models on?

00:51:54.890 --> 00:52:00.330
&gt;&gt; MASS: We run on large Linux clusters. So
it's generally--my favorite purchase are these

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:04.140
Duo Quad-core, you know.
&gt;&gt; As you know, we also run on large...

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:08.960
&gt;&gt; MASS: I've heard of that, but I have a
feeling you got a lot more than I got. But,

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:12.290
anyway, so I have clusters of these machines.
I have personally--I have maybe approximately

00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:19.280
600 processors, you know. And the codes I
use--so the model I use now mostly is a WRF

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:24.530
model, weather research and forecasting model.
That paralyzes very, very well. And so, I

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:29.310
typically run that on several hundred processors
to do, you know, we do the real times--we

00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:36.230
have it on the Web, you can see our forecast.
And so that's kind of the hardware we use.

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:39.790
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Explain why the prevailing winds are just

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:45.940
from the--you know, we get it from north in
the summer or from the south...

00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:50.840
&gt;&gt; MASS: Right. Sure. Well, during the summer
time, high pressure builds up in the Eastern

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:57.800
Pacific because of the subtropical inter-cyclone
in the north. And so, when that--see, I think,

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:03.810
it was high pushing up here. I have it on
my head. I don't know if I can communicate

00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:12.500
it. And so the air goes around the high, like,
of this, and so we're on this side of it,

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:18.620
and so the air is coming from the north like
that. So it's because that high pushes up.

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:23.600
During the winter time, low pressure gets
setup over the East Pacific and the flood

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:31.380
of air comes around the other way, comes from
the south with that. I mean, I can try it

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:35.750
in other ways, but it's due to the large scale
flow changes. Yes, sir?

00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:38.150
&gt;&gt; [INDISTINCT] with climate changes, how
far away we can go [INDISTINCT]?

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:41.180
&gt;&gt; MASS: Well, in terms of climate change
or...?

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:45.250
&gt;&gt; Not climate change, but with the general
[INDISTINCT].

00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:54.420
&gt;&gt; MASS: So what are you looking to do? You
want to--I mean, is it just to know what's

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:58.920
going on or the forecasting?
&gt;&gt; Just to know what's going on.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:04.520
&gt;&gt; MASS: Yeah. Well, I mean to know what's
going on we have all these observations of

00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:12.570
the surface. And so, you can, you know, in
our Website, we plot them all out regularly

00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:18.750
so you can see that. The computer models are
not running--are not of high resolution operationally

00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:24.600
could do that right now, but it will. Just
give it another three to five years. I will

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:31.200
be running our computer models at one kilometer
grid spacing. But right now, I run it at four

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:35.530
kilometer good spacing. But that will be changing,
yeah, width scaled by computer power. Yes?

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:41.600
&gt;&gt; You were saying about the big factor in
our local weather stations [INDISTINCT], how

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:47.250
much do you, sort of, these smaller lakes
and bodies of water [INDISTINCT]?

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:56.140
&gt;&gt; MASS: Well, they have an effect if you're
right next to them, but they don't have a

00:54:56.140 --> 00:55:04.190
big effect, you know, sort of regionally.
I mean, the big regional bodies like, you

00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:13.760
know, Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound,
that affects the regional area. So the small

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:18.710
you are, you know, the more localized the
effects are. You mean, your house is right

00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:22.640
next to it, yeah, it will affect you. Okay.
Any other questions? Yeah?

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:26.010
&gt;&gt; You said you're working with the four kilometers?
&gt;&gt; MASS: That's the highest resolution I'm

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:27.010
running on operationally.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [INDISTINCT]?

00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:31.130
&gt;&gt; MASS: No. The way we run it--the typical
way to run it is nesting. We have a large

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:37.630
domain with over 36 medium [INDISTINCT] to
12 and 4 over the area. And there are other

00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:44.770
approaches that there is all kinds of adapt-type
grid models, which are under development right

00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:50.230
now, that will adapt so you have more resolution
we needed. And, in fact, the next generation

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:53.550
of models is going to be much more like that.
But right now, we use, basically, we cascaded

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:55.590
and use aesthetic grid spacing.
&gt;&gt; What [INDISTINCT]?

00:55:55.590 --> 00:56:00.460
&gt;&gt; MASS: I think the big revolution is this
going probabilistic. In fact, this is only

00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:04.660
[INDISTINCT] business because we have these
massive amounts of information, much more

00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:09.310
information that we've had before, is probability
stuff, okay? I mean, we could tell you what's

00:56:09.310 --> 00:56:14.060
the probability the temperature will be over
65 over 67. You know, it was the probability

00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:19.590
you'll have between these amount and that
amount of rainfall. Of all these information,

00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:25.950
what people wanted, how you communicate it,
how do you communicate uncertainty, right?

00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:31.100
So that is the big, grand challenge for us,
is to create probabilistic information, find

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:35.060
ways of communicating it to people in a useful
way. So that's the grand challenge, I think,

00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:37.760
right now.
&gt;&gt; So if you can do one kilometer right now,

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:41.990
what do you think will be practical [INDISTINCT]?
Will we see better weather forecast in the

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:48.080
news or would these be overwhelming data?
&gt;&gt; MASS: Well, and, again, that's how, you

00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:55.050
know, how do you show it? Like for instance,
our computer models right now don't really

00:56:55.050 --> 00:57:02.160
have like Washington, you know, and they don't
have the details of Puget Sound. It's all

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:13.250
wrong, okay? So if we get high resolution,
we gain the ability to forecast those details.

00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:19.360
And then the question is how we communicate
it. It's going to have to be over the Web,

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:33.400
I mean, or for some other media. That's why
the TV weather guys are in trouble, because

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:47.200
how much can you communicate in a two and
a half minute broadcast. You can get all these

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:58.360
details. So you have to use the Web or some
of the electronics, somewhere that's adoptive

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:11.030
for people in their location to get their
weather donation across. So this is much in

00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:17.110
your area as it is in my area. Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Sounds like a business opportunity.

00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:21.870
&gt;&gt; MASS: Yeah. Go ahead.
&gt;&gt; First, [INDISTINCT] or they're lucky they

00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:36.510
have, like, the media today?
&gt;&gt; MASS: Oh, students take it very seriously.

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:43.420
Well, I mean, you don't--anything would take
it too seriously. I mean, I can argue that

00:58:43.420 --> 00:59:01.430
there have been some over height amongst some
people. So, you know, at UW, believe me, it

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:06.980
is taken seriously. Yeah, students take it
seriously. Yes?

00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:27.280
&gt;&gt; So you're saying that the kind of [INDISTINCT]?
&gt;&gt; MASS: Yeah, it decreases [INDISTINCT].

00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:35.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so for your [INDISTINCT] can go out
like 100 years, like, what do you think the

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:51.730
air [INDISTINCT]?
&gt;&gt; MASS: Right. That is one of

00:59:51.730 --> 01:00:02.970
the most frequently asked questions I get,
and especially people on the right hand--the

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:35.610
right side. I don't mean the right side being
right. How can we possibly forecast 50 to

01:00:35.610 --> 01:01:00.100
100 years ahead of time while we can't do
it a week ahead? Is that an interesting question?

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:19.010
Now, what's the answer? There's two answers.
One answer is we're not trying to do the same

01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:32.230
thing. When we're trying to do a weather forecast,
we're just trying to say, the temperature

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:59.490
at Seattle is going to be this exact temperature,
the low pressure center is going to be exactly

01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:15.570
there, right?
At this time, we don't do that with climate.

01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:57.160
On climate, we would say, what's the average
temperature going to be over a decade, okay?

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:12.020
So we're not trying to that specificity. The
other thing is

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:59.930
the atmosphere is so strongly forced by the
boundary conditions, by

01:03:59.930 --> 01:04:34.590
the sun's radiation coming in

01:04:34.590 --> 01:05:23.470
and the infrared going out. Now, actually,
it really constrains what the atmosphere can

01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:57.090
be doing out 50 or 100 years from now. So
if we know how much Greenhouse gas there is,

01:05:57.090 --> 01:06:05.060
which is uncertain in itself, we can't give
you a pretty useful answer. There will be

01:06:05.060 --> 01:07:00.630
uncertainties there, but it's still a useful
answer. So that's the hand-waving answer to

01:07:00.630 --> 01:08:45.580
that thing.

01:08:45.580 --> 01:10:42.560
I think we can give you
something useful, okay? Out

01:10:42.560 --> 01:40:56.130
of time? Okay. Cut.
