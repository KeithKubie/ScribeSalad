00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:03.690
The Pearson product-moment correlation measures the strength of relationship

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.340
between any two variables, but there can be lots

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.204
of other types of relationships. Even other ones that

00:00:09.204 --> 00:00:12.520
are monotonic, either increasing or decreasing. So we also

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.650
have measures of monotonic relationships, such as a rank

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.270
correlation measures like Spearman. We can assign Spearman to

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.380
the method parameter and calculate the correlation that way.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.210
Here we have a different test statistic called ρ,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.830
and notice how our value is slightly different as well.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.400
You can learn more about the assumptions and uses of the

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.810
different methods in the instructor notes. From these last couple

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.980
correlation videos, the main point I want to make here is that

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.150
single number coefficients like this are useful, but they are

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.640
not a grid substitute for looking at a scatter plot and

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.743
computing conditional summaries like we did earlier. We have a

00:00:46.743 --> 00:00:50.400
richer understanding by looking at such plots like this one for

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.853
friend_count and age.
