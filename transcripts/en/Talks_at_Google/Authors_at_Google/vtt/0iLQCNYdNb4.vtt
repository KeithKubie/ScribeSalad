00:00:06.188 --> 00:00:08.705
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.705 --> 00:00:11.060
PETER FADER: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.910
Wonderful to see all of
you, mostly unfamiliar

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.460
faces, a few familiar ones.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.270
And that's great.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.790
It's just really nice to see
a lot of-- not people saying,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.220
oh, it's him again.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.220
A lot of people for
whom some of these ideas

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.170
and certainly the
content of our new book

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.760
is going to be fresh and new.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.200
So I want to put it all
into context for you.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.940
And then we're all
going to dive in.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.604
So we think about marketing.

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:36.770
We think about what people
say about it, what people

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.800
do about it, and it's this.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.370
And it's very troubling,
because so much--

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.150
when we talk about marketing,
we talk about the stuff

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.680
that marketers do.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.090
We obsess over action.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.590
OK.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.440
It's just all these tactical
kinds of things out there.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.250
But very often lost
in the conversation

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.080
is who we do it to, or I'd
rather say who we do it with.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.879
It's almost an afterthought.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.790
We have all of these shiny
objects, many of which

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.590
were invented and promoted
right through this company here.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.170
And we're just out
there playing with toys.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.170
And I always found that
very troubling for kind

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.810
of obvious reasons as
well as some subtle ones,

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.990
that we really want to
spend a little bit more time

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.640
thinking about them.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.590
And that motivated the first
book that I wrote back in 2012.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.840
And it was really
nice to get people

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.530
to focus a little bit more
on the whole customer thing.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.150
And it was a very nice success.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.260
We sold over 30,000
copies of it.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.210
But even then, it
didn't quite do the job.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.310
You see the problem is
that too many people would

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.930
read the title.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.550
They wouldn't read the subtitle.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.680
They'd read the title
and they'd say ah ha.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.620
I know exactly what
you're talking about.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.320
And I fully agree.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.710
It's all about this.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.630
We put the customer at the
center of everything we do.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.900
And that just kills
me, because that's not

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.130
what we're talking about.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.520
And maybe it's my fault for
choosing a really bad title,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.352
but it's really less
about the customer

00:02:13.352 --> 00:02:14.810
and it's more about
an appreciation

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.000
of this wide variety
of customers,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.940
and which ones are the ones
we really do want to focus on.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.840
So again, the book was a nice
way to start the conversation.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.900
But I spent so much of my time
talking about what I don't

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.150
mean by customer centricity.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.370
And one thing I
surely don't mean

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.680
is that the customer
is always right

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.300
and we will do anything for you.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.130
We're going to hire
an army of ninjas

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.920
to make sure that
every need you have

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.074
is met, every problem
you have is solved.

00:02:42.074 --> 00:02:43.490
That's not what
I'm talking about.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.448
But I'm also not talking
about the opposite end

00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:48.270
of the spectrum, which is we
got the customers we want.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.730
We got the customers
we don't want.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.730
Let's get rid of them.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.970
Life will be much easier.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.470
OK.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.574
That has problems too.

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:55.490
And again I don't want
to go into the details.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.650
If you want, you can
pick up the old book.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.920
And then maybe the main
point, and the whole reason

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.770
I wrote the book to go back
to the research that I do,

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.090
is to get people--

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.000
to get companies to stop
focusing on the past

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.820
and spend a little bit more
time obsessing over the future.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.680
So instead of focusing on
historic profitability,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.140
let's think about this idea
of customer lifetime value.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.120
And is it fair to say
that every one of you,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.460
whether you're working
with these models or not,

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.860
at least has those
letters, whether they're

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.826
CLV or LTV as part
of your vocabulary?

00:03:27.826 --> 00:03:30.200
You know, you're at least
conversant with the [? bait? ?]

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.940
That by itself is a
really great thing.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.870
So part of it is overcoming
myths and misconceptions

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.700
about what we mean by
customer centricity.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.160
And part of it is we just
didn't go far enough with it.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.590
That book was all
about definition.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.010
It was all about motivation.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.850
It was all about aspiration.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.590
It was just laying out just a
vision of what the world could

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.200
look like if we had a magic
wand and you could wave it

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.580
over each customer's head.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.880
But it kind of stopped
short of specifics.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.610
And so that's really
where we want to go.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.300
So how do we really
do this stuff?

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.060
How do we communicate it
internally, externally?

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.760
And how do we demonstrate that
it's actually worthwhile or is

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.070
it just another marketing flavor
of the month kind of thing

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.980
and it too will pass?

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.084
We don't believe that at all.

00:04:15.084 --> 00:04:17.000
And so we really wanted
to find ways to really

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.200
move this conversation
forward, again

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.560
not just in terms of
definitions and motivations,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.570
but in terms of actions.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.210
And so Sarah Toms
enters the picture,

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.380
because she and I developed
this really great customer

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.449
centricity simulation.

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.990
A lot of you have done some kind
of business simulation game.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.480
We have the product.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.224
And let's figure
out with the product

00:04:37.224 --> 00:04:39.140
and which segments are
we going to sell it to,

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.120
and how much money we're
going to spend on the product.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.911
And it gets back to
all that marketing mix,

00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:44.431
4 Ps tactical kind of stuff.

00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:46.430
Well, how about a simulation
where it's your job

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.340
to grow as profitable a
customer base as possible?

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.870
The product is secondary.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.670
The customers are primary.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.630
So that really helped.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.750
That started to move
the conversation along.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.390
But there's still a
lot of room to go.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.530
We're trying every
possible thing,

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.979
but we just need broader and
deeper adoption across firms.

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.520
And look at all the
different reasons

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.680
why people start to
think about this stuff.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.850
Is it, hey, we can make more
money if we have our CLV magic

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.520
wand and we allocate our
resources appropriately,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.940
or is it, hey, nothing else
is working for us, and out

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.080
of sheer desperation, what
the hell, we'll try that too?

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.750
Whatever the reason,
we need to find a way.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.230
And we need to find a
metaphor to try to get

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.940
people board with this stuff.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.640
And so all the time
I'm just thinking

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.790
about tools, and
models, and simulations,

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.020
and stuff like that.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.860
Sarah Toms enters the picture
literally and figuratively

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.430
to give us a really nice
way to take the conversation

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.237
to a higher level.

00:05:47.237 --> 00:05:48.070
SARAH TOMS: Exactly.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.290
So when Pete and I were
writing this book together,

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.140
a lot of our conversation
was about the call to action

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.590
that we wanted to generate
around customer centricity.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.040
And when you think about this
opportunity and desperation

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.980
that really is mounting in
the marketing and sales field,

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.910
it reminded me of what
happened in the mid '90s

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.390
in software development.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.980
So I entered the tech
field in the mid '90s,

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.570
the dawn of dot-com, a
really, really wonderful time

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.750
to be an entrepreneur.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.340
I started my first tech company
and, like most entrepreneurs

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.350
entering technology
at the time, was

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:30.120
incredibly excited and
ready for the challenge.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.150
The problem was,
in reality, when

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.670
I started working
with my clients,

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.560
is that the first thing
I would be asked for

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.020
is a lot of documentation.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.820
I was following the
waterfall process

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.440
like I was being told to.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.670
My tech team was really not
able to deliver in the same way

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.190
and to the objectives
of what we were

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.330
trying to do as a business.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.920
And one of the problems
with technology at the time

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.280
was we were following
old processes that were

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.690
quite literally decades old.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.190
They were not fast.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.870
They were not agile.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.730
And they were really
being dictated to us

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.090
by bureaucracies such as the
US government who, at the time,

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.030
was the largest
developer of software.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.600
So a great example of this
when the Space Shuttle went

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.670
into the stratosphere
in 1982, it

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.270
had technology on board that was
quite literally from the '60s.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:25.670
Software took sometimes between
six and two decades to deliver.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.870
And what that led to was the
software development crisis

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.070
in the 1990s.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.010
So this is where hardware,
PCs were sitting on desktops.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.680
They were moving into homes.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.830
And software quite
literally could not keep up.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.290
So what we saw here is this
timeline where there were

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.980
a few rogue software
development teams who were like,

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.720
there's got to be a better way.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.324
They were probably
looking at Deming

00:07:49.324 --> 00:07:50.990
and what he was doing
with the iterative

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.480
processes in quality assurance
and in manufacturing,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.660
which was more of an
iterative approach, a more

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.250
lightweight approach.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.720
And what really
started to happen

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.000
with these pioneers
in technology

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.210
was they decided that it was
time to all come together

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.880
to draw a line in the
sand, or the snow,

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.380
because they all came together
in Snowbird, Utah, in 2001,

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.660
and they decided to
declare their independence

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.240
from the old ways
of doing software.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.160
And here you have
the Agile Manifesto,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.350
which was written in 2001.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.050
Now it's kind of quirky.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.050
And this is still the
website today, by the way.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:29.570
It looks still
very 1996 or 2001.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.659
They wrote a clear
definition for a vision,

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:36.980
and what needed to be done
in software in particular,

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.520
and what was the way
forward for how to develop,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.650
a way that would
be lean, a way that

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.140
would bring the
customer or the user

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.740
to the center of the design, a
way that was more iterative so

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.947
that they could course correct,
and, most importantly, so

00:08:51.947 --> 00:08:53.780
that they could communicate
with one another

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:57.480
and also with the business
stakeholders who software

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.150
was being developed for.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.199
And this was an amazing
time for all of us

00:09:02.199 --> 00:09:03.740
who were in software
at the time when

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.120
we saw this manifesto
come to life

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.730
and when we started to
see it being adopted.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.460
So stupid question really.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.390
Did agile work?

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.420
You guys are all looking at me
like, of course, it did, Sarah.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.110
So here's some study
information from a Gartner study

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.670
and other global
studies that have

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.610
been done on agile in 2018.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.540
No surprise here.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.990
97% of organizations have
adopted even a small amount

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.510
of agile within
their organization.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.330
What we really love-- what Pete
and I are really excited about

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.660
is this down here--

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:39.090
is that it's no longer just a
software process or approach.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.370
It's now being adopted
by financial teams,

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.840
by middle management teams.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.660
It's been adopted as
a way by lean startup.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.340
It's been adopted as a way
forward to deliver great stuff.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.540
It is product centric.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.650
I will admit that as well.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:56.340
And of course, I had to put
some Google search results.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.730
Also in these Gartner
studies, when agile projects

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.940
are implemented, they're
three times more successful.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.910
For complex projects, six
times more successful.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:10.090
So clearly this was
the right way to go.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.630
What you see here with
these adoption curves

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.752
since the 1900s,
and, if any of you

00:10:15.752 --> 00:10:18.210
have been in a marketing class
or in a business class, what

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.050
you're seeing is
they're speeding up.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.880
Adoption is faster.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.430
Right here is where
the manifesto happened.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.690
And for a lot of you, you're
probably thinking, well,

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.880
it's just processing
power is better.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.280
We're getting better at tech.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.080
But what I actually
believe, somebody

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.110
who's been in the technology
sphere now for over 20 years,

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.550
is it's really been this shift
in how we create technology

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.550
together.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.610
And I believe that
the Agile Manifesto

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.910
was that sort of ignition
point, that it was that tipping

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.850
point that allowed us
to be able to support

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.850
the innovation and now the
adoption that has gone along

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.320
with it.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.040
PETER FADER: So let's
take that real story

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.190
and now use it as a metaphor
for a kind of the data analytics

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.650
customer centricity
thing, because right now,

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.510
a lot of companies
believe they're

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.440
on the verge of
another tipping point,

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.900
because we have so much data.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.730
We have so much computing power.

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.920
We have so much
analytical capabilities

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.500
that we're just going to
combine all this stuff together

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.350
and money is just going to
come raining down from the sky.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.690
We're going to see the same
kind of just breakthrough

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.570
in terms of success, not
in terms of hard goods

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:29.310
or services, but in terms
of just our analytical

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:31.950
and customer centric smarts.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.631
Well, that's not
going to happen.

00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:35.380
And I've really learned
that the hard way,

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.930
because, again, for years,
and years, and years,

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:39.780
I've been going to companies and
saying, here is the CLV model.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.280
Please use it.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.320
And not only is it hard
to get adoption on it,

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.340
but even when companies
would adopt it,

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.730
so how do we make money on it?

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:51.000
So I really believe it's
less about the ingredients

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.640
and more about the process.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.590
And so staying
with this metaphor,

00:11:55.590 --> 00:12:00.480
we're talking about how do we
make that process go better.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.400
And so we've had all
these conversations

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.140
very often around
the sim and so on.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.570
And so how do we get that
overall call to action?

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.250
And of course, it's
up to Sarah Toms

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.625
to come up with
the right answer.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.350
Let's create our own manifesto.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.610
And so I'm very pleased--

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:22.120
very, very pleased to present
for the very first time

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.470
to an audience here in the US--

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.465
are you ready for it?

00:12:25.465 --> 00:12:26.395
Drumroll, please.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.080
Good enough.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.800
The customer
centricity manifesto.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.530
So literally taking a
page out of their book,

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.050
making it just a
little bit prettier,

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.800
and basically coming up with
an organizing set of principles

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.731
and then underlying specific
tactical practices, which

00:12:47.731 --> 00:12:49.480
is what we're going
to talk about with you

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.900
this afternoon, to say
let's all agree on this.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.460
Let's make this happen.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.810
And let's figure out both how
to get buy-in internally as well

00:12:58.810 --> 00:12:59.850
as externally.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.730
So we set up a bunch of time.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.430
And I'm being super
honest with you.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.400
We basically had this sim.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.680
We put together the basic
software manual just

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.270
to help people play the game.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.810
We said, that's not enough.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.730
We want to help them
play the game smarter.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.896
And again, we realized it
was more than just saying,

00:13:15.896 --> 00:13:17.420
here's how you calculate CLV.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.780
It was more about the
mindset that you're

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.237
going to take on when you
approach this kind of exercise,

00:13:22.237 --> 00:13:24.070
whether it's simulated
or whether it's real.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.960
If you're interested,
you can go to

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.920
customercentricitymanifesto.org,
sign the manifesto,

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.420
show that you agree,
spread the gospel about it.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.840
And that's what we want to
talk about is to basically take

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.660
each one of these four
principles over here

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.790
and just bring it to life.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.040
So let's start with this
first one over here, the idea

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.590
that we're going to
really celebrate customer

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:49.210
heterogeneity over averages.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.940
So when you start
thinking about, OK,

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.692
all right, all right,
I got you, customers

00:13:53.692 --> 00:13:55.900
are different from each
other, what immediately comes

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.920
to mind is that pain and
suffering that you went through

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.260
in your introductory
statistics course,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.570
where that professor-- and
pretty much every professor

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.820
since then-- said, everything
follows a normal distribution.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.300
And so stands to reason,
that would be the same thing

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.150
with your customers.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.219
You're going to get this
nice, symmetric mix.

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:14.260
You've got the good ones.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.680
You've got the not-so-good ones.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.567
You've got this big
lump in the middle.

00:14:17.567 --> 00:14:19.150
And depending on
just how it's shaped,

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.233
you might say, you know,
there's so many over here

00:14:21.233 --> 00:14:24.110
that we really can
focus on the average.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:27.640
Well, the problem is
this never happens.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.300
That's just not true.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.880
And it's something that I've
known for quite some time.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.150
But it really,
really crystallized

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.800
through my first
startup company,

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.170
called Zodiac, that some of
you might be familiar with.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.950
Don't Google it now,
because it's gone.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.290
I'll tell you why.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.194
And basically what
we were doing is

00:14:43.194 --> 00:14:45.235
we were working with lots
of different companies,

00:14:45.235 --> 00:14:47.680
a wonderful variety of
companies-- products

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.190
and services, B2B and B2C,
domestic and international,

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.720
big and small.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.350
And we'd just calculate the
CLVs and say, here you go.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.120
Now go make money.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.280
And the distribution
of CLVs that we'd see

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.860
would pretty much
always look like this--

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.070
very much not normal.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:07.000
And it's not only
that it's not normal,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.210
but it also gives you a lot of
specific advice and direction,

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.330
like who are these
customers over here?

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.560
What makes them different
from everybody else?

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.890
And how can we find
more like them?

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:20.450
That's what customer
centricity is all about.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.690
And so recognizing the
nature of this distribution

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.540
is really critical to kind of
drive you in that direction

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.850
and hopefully motivate you to
look for this kind of stuff

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.420
and then, of course, act on it.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.920
The bottom line on
the Zodiac thing,

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.000
for those of you who don't know,
is just a couple of months ago,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.020
we actually sold
the company to Nike.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.510
And now they're doing just
amazing, wonderful things

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:41.726
with CLV.

00:15:41.726 --> 00:15:43.600
Again, a company that
used to be very product

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.780
centric, but now doing
just incredible things

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.420
by understanding their customers
and doing all the stuff

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.680
that we're talking about here.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.450
Got a really nice story for you.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.220
It's more than
just distributions.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.600
It's more than just math.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.020
It's about, how do we get other
people to celebrate customer

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.220
heterogeneity?

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.700
Did some work with a small, B2B
manufacturer down in Norfolk,

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.780
Virginia-- so a very
different kind of company

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.240
than a lot of companies that
you would think about when

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.000
we're talking about CLV.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.844
And the CEO found
it very frustrating

00:16:13.844 --> 00:16:15.760
that after I had this
session and get everyone

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.060
all juiced up and jazzed up
about customer centricity,

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.040
that he'd listen to
the conversations that

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.710
were taking place a day,
a week, a month later.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:28.190
And everyone was still
talking about the customer,

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:29.190
or the average customer.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:30.000
He found it frustrating.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.140
And he said, tell you what.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.470
This is what we're going to do.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.801
So he put a fish bowl right
there in the company lunch

00:16:35.801 --> 00:16:36.300
room.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.365
And he said, I want
all of you to listen.

00:16:38.365 --> 00:16:39.990
I want all of you to
police each other.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.200
And any time you hear
a colleague refer

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.106
to the customer in
a singular manner,

00:16:46.106 --> 00:16:48.480
and they're not referring to
a singular customer, anytime

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.010
you hear people just
talk about the customer,

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.050
the average customer,
you call them on it.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.760
You say, I got you.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.140
And they have to put a
dollar in the fish bowl.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.070
And it was a really fun
way to get people to really

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.410
think about this one
idea all the time--

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.700
nothing about tactical
execution, just the mindset.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.859
And in no time at all,
they had a fish bowl

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:11.839
filled with dollars, very
visible for everyone to see.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:15.329
And at the end of the quarter or
whenever it was, the CEO said,

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:16.290
you know what?

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.540
We're going to have a party
now, using all that money.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.522
And what is it that
we're going to celebrate?

00:17:21.522 --> 00:17:24.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.089
PETER FADER: Customer
heterogeneity.

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:27.730
So it comes full
circle like that.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.250
And it's just a
clever little way.

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.160
I want everyone to go out there
and buy a fish bowl right now,

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.236
for yourself or
for your clients.

00:17:35.236 --> 00:17:36.610
But it's just a
clever little way

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:39.790
to say, again, it's not
just about geeky math stuff.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.790
It's about figuring out how
to get that message across.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:44.590
That's our principle number one.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.000
Let me hand things
back to Sarah.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.080
Let's keep on going.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.460
SARAH TOMS: OK, so from
customer heterogeneity,

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:55.360
principle number two is
cross-functional uses of CLV

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.320
over siloed applications.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.110
So when Pete and I set
out to write this book,

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.745
it was really, really
important to us

00:18:01.745 --> 00:18:03.490
that we didn't, again,
create something

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:06.940
that's just going to sit
right in the marketing silo.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.970
This is something that we
need to ignite conversations

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.340
across the functional areas.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.930
It's why when you
delve into the book,

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.774
we have parts where we're
talking about how you engage

00:18:16.774 --> 00:18:18.190
with your technology
teams and you

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.430
talk about data, how you work
with finance, how you work

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.260
with the other areas
to really start

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.010
to get that conversation going,
like Pete's last example,

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:30.100
talking about making sure that
folks aren't thinking just

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.820
about the customer.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.820
So what I want to do here
is just share a couple

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.560
of really interesting examples.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.810
These are not examples in the
book-- brand new for you folks.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.270
Batteries Plus Bulbs--
no prizes if you

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:44.380
can guess what they sell.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.540
So they have been--

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.220
they are here in
the United States.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:53.770
They are 700 stores.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:58.690
And they are just a pretty
usual, hard goods, brick

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:00.670
and mortar selling--

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:02.370
what do you think?

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:03.280
Batteries and bulbs.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:03.780
Exactly.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.770
Good job guys.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.950
So what I like about
this example-- and Pete

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:12.690
and I both know the former
head chief customer analytics

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.910
gentleman-- and he
has shared with us

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.570
some incredible evolution
of the use of CLV

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.770
within their company.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:20.940
So they started small.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.680
They started experimental.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.434
And it's now grown into being
a cross-functional experience

00:19:26.434 --> 00:19:28.350
for them when they think
about their business,

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.891
when they think
about their customers

00:19:29.891 --> 00:19:32.550
and how they engage with their
customers in different ways

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:34.244
based on CLV.

00:19:34.244 --> 00:19:35.910
Higher value customers
are going to want

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.118
to be engaged with differently
than their lower value

00:19:38.118 --> 00:19:40.150
customers, for example.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.120
So when they have
their customers

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.770
coming to them
through their website,

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.590
through their call
centers, through retail,

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:50.550
they have ways of capturing
that behavioral data,

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:54.540
so for example, using
a Natural Language

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.870
API that's collecting all
of this behavioral data

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.454
about their customers.

00:19:59.454 --> 00:20:00.870
And they know which
ones are going

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.540
to behave a certain way
are more likely to have

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.880
higher value, versus
which ones are behaving

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.720
a certain way are going to have
lower and middle tiered value.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.930
And all that gets pumped
up every single day

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.700
into Salesforce.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:19.410
And by the next day,
they've created lists sorted

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.420
by CLV for their sales force.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.390
Those are now target lists
that they can go after.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.670
And then they cycle
back the performance

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:30.060
of those lists, back
to those various areas.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.430
And they improve on those
algorithms all the time.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:35.190
So it's a nice
iterative process, where

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.790
they're really leveraging CLV.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.350
And not just that-- the company
has been very successful.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.580
They're constantly expanding.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.790
They're looking at mom and pop
shops that they can acquire.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.730
And they use CLV for that.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.980
That's one of their
key indicators for,

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.360
where are they going to go?

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.860
Which store are
they going to buy?

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:56.250
Which store are they
going to put in?

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.170
Second really cool example--

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.710
a little bit more exciting,
maybe, for some of you,

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:05.040
than batteries and bulbs
is Electronic Arts.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.070
So gaming company--
we do actually

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:12.180
speak about their origin story
as far as customer centricity.

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.000
They are very, very mature
in the customer centricity

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.350
space, as far as how
they are leveraging CLV.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.790
Their data analytics
teams are actually

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.150
embedded into their
gaming studios,

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:25.500
so that when they
do game launches,

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.740
they're feeding back that
game data and those CLV

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.700
data, real time, to
the studio developers

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:35.280
and letting them know, were you
successful with this feature?

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.890
Were you successful with
this game, et cetera?

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.980
So last year in November,
they had "Command and Conquer,

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.777
Rivals" was just launched.

00:21:42.777 --> 00:21:44.610
And they knew that they
didn't know anything

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:48.950
about really their customer
base when they launched.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.830
And so their advertising
looked like this.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.740
So this was November 2018.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.840
You'll notice that we
have a pretty good gender

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.160
representation.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.350
They're playing around
with some imagery as far

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:02.762
as some of the different
weaponry, et cetera.

00:22:02.762 --> 00:22:04.470
Fast forward one
month-- they're starting

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:07.710
to collect initial customer
data and information.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.110
By December 2018,
they've started

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:12.570
to make some small
adaptations to that.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.670
You can see it here.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:16.470
And then by December 2018--

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:20.970
and then-- sorry-- by January
2019, they realized something.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.310
They realized that who
was bubbling to the top

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:27.180
as far as CLV were teenage
boys in North America.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:32.010
So you'll see here, women
really have fallen out

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.200
of being represented
in their ads.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.540
You'll also see that there's
a lot more left-to-right,

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.081
because of the
left-to-right reading,

00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:40.580
where the call to action
is, et cetera, et cetera.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.830
So this is another great
example of acquisition

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:47.570
where CLV is being leveraged
to help guide the way.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:50.490
PETER FADER: But
sometimes the best example

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.280
is not just getting smarter
about which kinds of customers

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.140
to acquire, and how
much to spend to do so,

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.435
and where to find them.

00:22:56.435 --> 00:22:58.560
But it's what do we do with
the existing customers?

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:03.000
Because this has been a bit of
a mess for a lot of companies,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.646
because companies know what
to do with those existing

00:23:05.646 --> 00:23:07.020
customers when it
comes to trying

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.610
to make them more valuable.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:12.300
And they'll ask those two
great American questions,

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.160
which you all know so well.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.540
Do you want fries with that?

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.400
And do you want to supersize it?

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.920
Which of course, we're
using as accurate but kind

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.760
of cutesy versions
or proxies for--

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.035
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:24.035 --> 00:23:25.410
PETER FADER: What's
that top one?

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.390
AUDIENCE: Customer
cross-selling.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.100
PETER FADER: Well, got to
be careful about it, right?

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.930
The top one is going
to be cross-selling.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.700
People who buy
this also buy that.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.830
And the bottom one
will be upselling.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:36.500
And the problem
today is that this

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.140
is how we fatten up our
customers, whether it's

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.590
what they're eating or what
we're presenting to them.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.840
And that's all companies know.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.850
And so we're taking
all of this technology

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.220
just to figure out how to
cross-sell and upsell better,

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.815
faster, more effectively.

00:23:51.815 --> 00:23:54.950
And we're thinking, can't
we do better than that?

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:57.710
Can't we come up with
just different ways

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.050
of growing the
value of customers

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:03.110
or growing the value of the
customer base, outside of just

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:06.450
doing old-school stuff a
little bit differently?

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:09.830
So we took a step back and
rethought about these kinds

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.680
of tactics, through the
lens, through the mindset

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.260
of customer centricity.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.250
And we came up with
two dimensions.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:17.900
They're kind of
obvious in hindsight.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.608
But they're just not--
they don't show up

00:24:19.608 --> 00:24:20.740
a lot in practice.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.290
The first dimension would
be, which kinds of customers

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:29.180
are we talking about
either making more valuable

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.670
or just holding onto?

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.940
As Sarah has said, and
as it's entirely obvious,

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.580
the kinds of tactics
we use should

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.420
vary based on
whether we're talking

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.110
about really valuable
customers or so-so ones.

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:45.020
That should be explicitly
taken into account, not just

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.390
to say which kind of
cross-sell message

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:51.080
we're going to be using for you,
but what kind of overall tactic

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.370
we should be deploying.

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.100
Different kinds of tactics for
different kinds of customers--

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.190
that's number one.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:00.320
Number two, when it comes to
retention and development,

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.257
you get the basic idea of the
right way, which is development

00:25:04.257 --> 00:25:05.840
is let's take those
existing customers

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.100
and make them more valuable.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:09.840
Retention is let's hold
onto the customers we have.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.780
But there's a lot of
crossover, especially

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.240
in the tactical execution
of those things, where

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.950
they start to blur together.

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:18.920
We want to break it apart and
make it more explicit about,

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.580
what kind of strategic objective
do we really have in mind?

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:26.540
Are we playing offense or
are we playing defense,

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.590
and again, for which
kinds of customers?

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.620
So if you take these
two dimensions,

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.710
you get what every marketing
professor is contractually

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:35.830
obligated to share with you--

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.602
a two-by-two matrix.

00:25:38.602 --> 00:25:40.310
And so basically,
we're trying to come up

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.680
with an overall
organizing framework

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.540
that, again, from the
customer-centric standpoint,

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.780
we ask the question,
which kind of tactic

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.880
are we going to
use, at which time,

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.670
for which kinds of
strategic objective

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.260
and for which
kinds of customers?

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.410
And I'm not to take you
through the whole thing.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.030
But we just want to
bring clarity, not only

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.980
to which tactic are
you going to use when,

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.650
but even, what do we exactly
mean by these different kinds

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:04.710
of tactics?

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:08.270
So just as one example,
there's one area over here--

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:10.070
the idea of premium offerings.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.020
You've got these
high value customers.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.780
Don't give them a buy
nine, get one free thing.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:15.440
I mean, really?

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.790
Can't you do better than that?

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:19.130
These are the people
who, for whatever reason,

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:21.590
very strongly identify with you.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:23.040
They like the products you sell.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.581
They like the way
that you sell them.

00:26:24.581 --> 00:26:26.750
They resonate with the
brand, with the people.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:28.686
For a variety of reasons,
these are the folks

00:26:28.686 --> 00:26:31.310
who are going to go through the
gates of hell to stay with you.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:32.427
And you know what?

00:26:32.427 --> 00:26:34.760
They don't mind going even
deeper into the relationship.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.990
They don't mind
paying more-- not

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:37.156
that you want to gouge them.

00:26:37.156 --> 00:26:39.080
You don't want to
risk the relationship.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.110
But lots of opportunities,
starting with some of the real

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:45.230
well-known ones, like
LinkedIn Premium--

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.320
so how many of you are
LinkedIn Premium folks?

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.410
Raise your hand proudly if
you're a LinkedIn Prem--

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.570
this is my point, OK?

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:55.790
It is a premium service.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.490
It is not for everybody, OK?

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:01.450
But for those one or two
people who put their hands up,

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:03.300
LinkedIn means a great
deal to you, right?

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.300
And so there's lots of
other companies out there

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.500
that have been a little
bit too shy to do this.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.510
(PRETENDS TO COUGH) Twitter.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.350
Just don't you think
our president would

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:14.930
pay a premium to kind of--

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:16.680
I'm just saying.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.410
And I'm not joking about that.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:21.060
There's a lot of people
out there, myself included,

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.930
who actually would happily
pay whatever it would be-- $7,

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:26.060
$8 a month--

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.640
to get extra
value-added services

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.470
that maybe they couldn't
justify offering to everybody.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.280
A recent example
would be Lululemon.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.980
Lululemon recently
announced what the press is

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.230
calling a new loyalty program.

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.720
But it has a little
twist to it, because you

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.030
have to pay a bunch of money
upfront to be part of it.

00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:45.800
That's not a loyalty program.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.640
That's a premium service.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.780
So let's bring clarity to
what label we're using,

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.970
on which tactic, and at
what time we're using it.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:56.390
And I'm not going to go into
the rest of the details here.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:56.990
Read the book.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:59.670
Page 44-- it's all right there.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:01.641
But really, using
this as the lens

00:28:01.641 --> 00:28:03.890
to look at a lot of the
tactical things that companies

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:04.550
are doing--

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:07.370
customer experience, and
so many other things that

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:08.810
are going on out there--

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:09.800
where does it fit?

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.270
And does it make sense
to use it or not?

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.120
So that's just
giving you the tip

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.420
of the iceberg on a broad
variety of different kinds

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.000
of applications of
all the CLV stuff,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.480
that it's going to be more
than just your standard kinds

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.040
of how much should we pay
for the customer thing.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.520
There's much more to say.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.560
Point number thre--
this one over here--

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.545
we want companies to
choose their metrics very,

00:28:31.545 --> 00:28:32.170
very carefully.

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:34.360
See, the problem
is very often, even

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.210
companies that are kind of
data-driven and metric-oriented

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:38.800
are choosing the
metrics that reflect

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.360
their strategic
orientation, which

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.200
means they're very much focused
on, well, volume and cost.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.960
And a really good example that
might be surprising to some

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.460
of you is this one over here.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.980
People love this one over here.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.660
So let's look at the world's
most valuable brands, right?

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:58.369
And I can show this
with pride over here,

00:28:58.369 --> 00:29:00.868
because you know that Google
is towards the top of the list.

00:29:00.868 --> 00:29:01.910
And people just like it.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:04.330
I could just leave this up
here for the rest of our time.

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:06.650
You could just stare
at it quite happily.

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:09.750
But I actually have a
bunch of concerns about it.

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.372
I think they're very
serious concerns.

00:29:11.372 --> 00:29:12.830
And I think that
companies are just

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.210
obsessing over
this kind of thing

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.190
because it's shiny and cool.

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:19.230
But it's not aligned with
customer-centric thinking.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:20.960
Now, having said
that, I'm not throwing

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.250
branding under the bus.

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:23.910
Branding's still
really important.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:24.860
And that's what I
want to do here.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.526
I want to talk both
about what are the--

00:29:26.526 --> 00:29:28.400
how should we be
thinking about metrics,

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.640
and what is the role of
branding in the customer-centric

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.580
enterprise?

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.060
So what are some of my concerns
about this idea of brand

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:35.930
equity?

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:39.110
Number one, I think there's a
bit of a backwards causality

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.310
thing going on.

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:44.460
Google was not near the top of
the list back in the late '90s.

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.940
It wasn't until it became
a behemoth company,

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.020
and then, oh-- then
everyone knows the brand.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.420
It's top of mind--

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:51.729
oh, lots of brand equity there.

00:29:51.729 --> 00:29:53.270
So I think a lot of
that brand equity

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:56.870
really just reflects volume,
just the overall size

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:58.070
of the company.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.670
You don't see anyone
showing to you,

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:03.110
here's a chart of the companies
with the highest average

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:04.362
customer lifetime value.

00:30:04.362 --> 00:30:05.320
You don't see that one.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.970
And that is what I want
to start to talk about,

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.550
to put those kinds of
metrics front and center.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.960
And secondly is this
point over here.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.960
Can we really
measure brand equity

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.270
with that kind of precision?

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:17.570
You can go back to that slide.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:18.986
And you see that
they're measuring

00:30:18.986 --> 00:30:21.800
the value of the Google brand
or Apple or whomever else

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.200
with six significant figures.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:28.040
I defy you to find a single
chief financial officer

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.380
on the planet who would
say, yeah, I buy that.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:33.530
I mean, we'll all
agree that the Google

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:35.370
brand is incredibly valuable.

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:37.940
We'll all agree that the brand
and everything that it stands

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.165
for could well be worth
on the order of hundreds

00:30:41.165 --> 00:30:43.040
of millions of dollars--
hundreds of billions

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.010
of dollars.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:47.720
But could we really specify it
to six or seven decimal places?

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.257
I don't think so.

00:30:49.257 --> 00:30:51.090
So we have a couple of
objectives over here,

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.340
which is to try to come up
with metrics that we really

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.614
can trust, that we really can
share across the organization,

00:30:56.614 --> 00:30:59.030
instead of just a bunch of
marketers flattering themselves

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:02.930
with it, but also reflect more
about customer equity instead

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:04.160
of brand equity.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.920
In my first book,
I had a picture

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.000
that looked kind of like this.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.152
And it basically said, customer
equity is not for everybody.

00:31:12.152 --> 00:31:13.610
There are some
companies where it's

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:14.776
going to be hard to measure.

00:31:14.776 --> 00:31:16.460
It's going to be
hard to leverage it.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.710
And there's going to be other
companies out there that

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:20.750
are just great at
building terrific brands.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:21.750
Good for them.

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:22.250
That's fine.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:22.850
Let them be.

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:25.130
They don't have to do the
customer-centric thing.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.740
But as time goes by, as I
have these conversations

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.300
with lots and lots
of executives,

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.580
I'm kind of changing
my tune on it,

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:35.840
because I've come to realize
that a lot of the things

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.900
that on the surface could
lead to a really strong brand,

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:42.760
but don't necessarily show
up in customer equity--

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.340
I don't believe it.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.610
What are the kinds of things?

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.750
Oh, we can go out there, and
we can hire great employees.

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:51.630
We can get special tax
breaks and other privileges

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:54.480
from government-- things
that don't necessarily

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.970
show up immediately as
more customers buying

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:58.860
more stuff at higher margins.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.470
But if you think about it
over the long run view,

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:05.220
which is what we like
to have, so what if you

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.570
can hire better employees?

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:07.470
Big deal.

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:09.030
Good for you.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:13.680
Unless those employees can help
you bring in more customers who

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.570
will buy more often
at higher margins,

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:18.640
there's no equity in it.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.400
So pretty much all
of the things that I

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:26.220
used to say belong over here
really are subsumed by this.

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.930
And so the picture
we have in the book

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:31.520
now looks a little
bit more like this.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.450
And so there's a couple of
important points about it.

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:36.600
Number one, that
customer equity is

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.000
going to be potentially
larger, that it's

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.580
going to subsume all of those
elements of brand equity

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.580
and just a lot of the
boring transactional stuff.

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:47.844
Number two, there could still
be some aspects of brand equity

00:32:47.844 --> 00:32:48.760
that we don't pick up.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.860
It's just not going
to be that much.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:51.443
It's not going to
be that substantial.

00:32:51.443 --> 00:32:55.020
But important-- number
three is that a huge chunk

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:59.380
of the customer equity will
be associated with the brand.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.130
Having an awesome
brand will enable

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:06.000
you to acquire better customers
a little bit more cheaply.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.520
It will enable you to hold
onto them a little bit longer,

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.940
with lower costs to
keep them around.

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:16.710
So branding absolutely
helps maintain and magnify

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:18.950
that customer equity.

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:21.470
It's just that you can't
measure it directly.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:24.110
It's just folded into
all of the stuff that

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:27.560
shows up in lifetime value.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:30.320
And so a lot of people
read my first book

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:34.340
and took me as a brand hater,
that he's against branding.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.740
No, no, no, no, no.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:41.090
I'm just concerned about brand
measurement and the podium

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.320
that we put it on.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:46.840
And so the happy middle
ground that I and that Sarah

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.250
have found is this over here.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:52.040
It's that, as I said,
branding is super hard

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.250
to measure by itself.

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:54.740
And in many cases,
it's super hard

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.530
to see the specific
effects that it will

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.550
have on different customers.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.720
So let's not try to do
all of that measurement.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.150
It's just going
to make us cuckoo.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:07.430
But it does show
up in so many ways.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:09.020
And those are important ways.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.750
And so the metaphor that
we like to use over here

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.929
is that branding is really the
lubrication for the customer

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:16.429
centricity engine.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:19.280
You can't do the customer
centric thing as well as

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.380
possible unless
you have branding

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.610
that's going to help
you do acquisition,

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:27.159
retention,
development, employees,

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:29.179
and all that stuff a lot better.

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:30.460
So it's important.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.730
You need to invest in it.

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:34.280
It's much harder to measure
the ROI on those investments

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.070
than it might be for some
direct marketing campaign

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.194
or something like that.

00:34:38.194 --> 00:34:39.860
You need to run a lot
of experimentation

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.370
to figure it out.

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:43.280
But so it's still there.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.209
But it's just an overall
component of customer equity.

00:34:46.209 --> 00:34:48.500
We just want to change the
way that people are thinking

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.207
about those kinds of metrics
and a few other metrics, too,

00:34:51.207 --> 00:34:52.790
that are worth talking
about, some I'm

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.800
sure that you're
quite familiar with.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.270
SARAH TOMS: Definitely.

00:34:56.270 --> 00:35:00.110
So I want to recognize
the fact that it's not

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:02.690
a new idea, thinking
about your customers

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:05.100
and different-- that
they perform differently,

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.500
that they work differently.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.660
This actually was first--

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.510
from modern times, anyway--

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.210
launched in this book
by Frederick Reichheld.

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:16.610
So he's a Bain consultant--
principal at Bain--

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.250
and he wrote this book in 1996.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.440
And it's called "The
Loyalty Effect."

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.060
And what he wanted
to do in this book

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:26.930
is explain that
there's a mechanism.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.810
There's a way that
customers behave.

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:32.750
And really, instead of trying
to push as much product

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:36.910
blindly to as many faceless,
nameless customers,

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.830
what you should be
doing is looking

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.870
at the behaviors
of your customers,

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:44.300
learning what those
are, and then working

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.856
to really reduce the friction
in that relationship.

00:35:47.856 --> 00:35:49.730
And what happens when
you reduce the friction

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:51.980
in the relationship, especially
with your higher value

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:55.304
customers, is you
grow their value.

00:35:55.304 --> 00:35:56.720
And when you grow
their value, you

00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:01.040
reduce the cost that they cost
you to have as their customers.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:06.080
And as you reduce the costs,
you have this virtuous cycle

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.040
start to happen, where
the next thing you know,

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.680
they see you as a
trusted advisor.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.180
And they're going
to start referring

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.020
other customers to you.

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.040
So in this book,
Reichheld really

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:19.760
was aiming to just describe
that this mechanism exists.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.710
It's different for different
types of customers.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:26.000
And it was really that
first seed of an idea

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.430
that I think was going
to eventually lead

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:31.032
to customer centricity.

00:36:31.032 --> 00:36:32.490
So in his first
book, he was really

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:37.210
aiming to explain the
nature of customers.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:39.600
And then fast forward
to 2006, and he

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.235
released this book,
"The Ultimate Question."

00:36:42.235 --> 00:36:43.860
And what he was
driving at in this book

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.810
was really understanding
how to measure that.

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:49.770
And so I'm sure you'll
not be surprised to see

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:53.630
the measurement being
net promoter score.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:56.390
So I know that there are
probably a lot of detractors

00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:57.835
in here as far as NPS goes.

00:36:57.835 --> 00:36:59.210
There definitely
are some haters,

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:01.170
and we want to recognize that.

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:04.250
But the reason Pete and I liked
this was this was first time--

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:06.170
NPS really was one
of the first times

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:10.670
that it elevated this idea
of customer differences

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:15.900
in sort of our business sense.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:19.730
So let's look at NPS through
a customer-centric lens.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:22.610
So some of the reasons
Pete and I like NPS--

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:26.840
number one, it celebrates
customer heterogeneity.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:30.437
Number two, it gives an elite
status to the promoters.

00:37:30.437 --> 00:37:32.270
So in the equation, the
promoters definitely

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:34.170
have an elite status.

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:35.880
Third, it's simple.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.760
It's an easy way to
have a conversation

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.880
about your different customers.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:45.170
And it's an easy way to evaluate
them, and slice and dice,

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:47.150
and look at them across
different segments

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.120
to really understand
your customers more.

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:55.220
Now again, we recognize that NPS
has been implemented blindly.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:57.950
Pete and I would probably
complain about things

00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:00.650
like it's been
implemented too narrowly.

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:04.650
There are ways that it could
be looked at beyond referral.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:07.100
And really the biggest
problem with NPS

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:10.650
is it doesn't take
into account value.

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:13.055
So it's missing a key
component of that relationship

00:38:13.055 --> 00:38:13.805
with the customer.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:19.290
PETER FADER: So NPS is a great
step in the right direction.

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:23.220
And really, understanding the
interplay between NPS and CLV

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.730
is a great area of research
that's going on right now.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:29.220
But it really does
get to this idea

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.720
that, OK, it's one
thing to come up

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.730
with the right
metrics that reflect

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:35.200
customer-centric practices.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.020
But it's a whole other
thing to figure out

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.390
how to get them out there,
so people believe you

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:42.090
that you really are
doing this kind of stuff

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:42.940
and doing it well.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:43.980
And you know what?

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:46.770
We understand that maybe you're
not maximizing your profits

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:47.790
this quarter.

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:50.160
But by doing the
right things in terms

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:53.340
of customer centricity, that
it's going to be so well worth

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.910
it in the long run.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.240
So let me just go
through this fourth point

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:01.080
with a very interesting and
very contemporary case study.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.700
You all know Wayfair--

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.810
online furniture company.

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.290
It's another good news
and bad news story.

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:11.170
First, from Wayfair's
perspective, the good news.

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:13.560
Look at those revenue numbers--

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:17.240
everyone's dream come true,
that hockey stick convex curve,

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.810
revenues through the roof.

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:23.850
My concern, going back
to point number three,

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:26.290
is that this just
reflects overall volume.

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:28.770
I want to know more about the
quality of those revenues.

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:30.060
Instead of just saying
how many dollars

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.010
are flowing in the door,
I want to understand

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:35.160
the nature of the customers who
are bringing in those dollars.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:37.620
I mean, you have to
believe that a sale

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.800
to a new, unproven
customer is going

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:43.260
to be different in terms
of lifetime value enhanced

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.740
than the fourth sale to someone
who's been around with you

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:47.730
before.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:49.680
So let's peel that apart.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.140
And one of the problems
is, with most companies,

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.510
it's just impossible to do so.

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:57.090
How would you be able to
take all of this revenue

00:39:57.090 --> 00:40:00.480
and decompose it into the CLVs?

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.420
Well, one of the things that
I give Wayfair a lot of credit

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.000
for is that they make it easy.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.640
So if you look at their
own financial statements--

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.540
this is a paper that I
wrote with Dan McCarthy.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:14.090
We're basically using
data from Wayfair

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:16.020
and from another
company, overstock.com,

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.809
that you might know,
that also reveals

00:40:17.809 --> 00:40:19.350
a lot of really
interesting metrics--

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.110
the right kinds of metrics
that external stakeholders want

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.060
to see and should demand to see.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.480
Well, here's their data.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.600
So in addition to
giving us revenues--

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:28.600
OK, fine.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.410
That's not surprising-- they
give us a lot more metrics,

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:35.320
like how many customers
did we add this quarter?

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.690
OK, that's not that surprising.

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:38.940
A lot of companies will
give us that kind of metric.

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.410
But again, it's not required.

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:43.170
Accounting Standards Boards
don't say anything about that.

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:46.110
Some companies just voluntarily
choose to put that out there.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.120
This might help you
understand us better.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.150
But it's the other two metrics
that really make them unique.

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:52.750
You can see them right here.

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:56.290
One of them is QTO,
Quarterly Total Orders.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:58.980
They are telling us how
many orders are being placed

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.350
on their website every quarter.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:02.224
This is all public data.

00:41:02.224 --> 00:41:03.390
And the last one over here--

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:04.145
AAU.

00:41:04.145 --> 00:41:05.520
I bet you can
guess what that is.

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.195
What is AAU?

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.850
Annual Active Users.

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:15.460
Again, I take your
silence as a sign

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.730
that we have a long
way to go here.

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:21.100
We really want to make
these kinds of metrics part

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.945
of the everyday vocabulary.

00:41:22.945 --> 00:41:24.820
And we're not just
waiting for some companies

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.520
to charitably provide them to
us for reasons I don't even

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.310
understand, but for
investors, for analysts,

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:33.250
for marketing professionals
to demand them,

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:36.860
so we can really understand
how those dollars are working.

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.260
Here's the cool part about it.

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.520
You give me these metrics.

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.061
Or you can give them
to Dan McCarthy.

00:41:41.061 --> 00:41:42.670
This was part of
his dissertation.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:45.430
And I can peel back
the onion and look

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:47.920
at the nature of
heterogeneity of this company,

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:53.210
almost as accurately as if I had
the raw transaction log data.

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:54.340
Now for Wayfair, I don't.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.440
And they're not going
to give it to me.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.106
They don't like me
very much over there.

00:41:57.106 --> 00:41:57.991
You'll see why.

00:41:57.991 --> 00:42:00.490
But that's what we're going to
do is instead of just saying,

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:02.500
here's revenue
today, this is what

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.210
revenue is going to
be tomorrow, we're

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:05.770
going to peel it all back.

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:07.630
And let's understand
the components--

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:10.070
the customer-centric
components of revenue.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:14.140
So let's forecast how many
customers will we acquire?

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.720
How long will those
customers stay with us?

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.660
How many transactions will
they make over that horizon?

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:22.360
And how valuable will
those transactions be?

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.260
I hope you agree with
me on two things.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.010
Number one, those would be
really good things to know.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:29.200
Again, as an outside
evaluator of the firm,

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.500
you got to tell me that.

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:34.620
And number two, if you add all
that stuff up, that's revenue.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.950
So we're going to come at
revenue from the bottom up.

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:39.286
So we're going to take all
of this data in these columns

00:42:39.286 --> 00:42:41.410
that you see over here,
and we're going to model it

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:43.530
through May of 2017.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:45.340
And we're going to
show how well we can

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.052
capture all of these patterns.

00:42:47.052 --> 00:42:48.760
So here is how many
customer we've added.

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.900
Here's the total orders.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.160
Down here is revenue.

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.840
But I want to
emphasize that we're

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:55.060
not modeling revenue directly.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.160
That's what the people
on Wall Street do.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.960
We're modeling--
here we go again--

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.370
how many customers are
we going to acquire,

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:02.080
how long are they're going to
stay, how many transactions are

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.580
they going to make, how valuable
will those transactions be,

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:06.370
and then combining it
all together to say,

00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:08.730
that's what we think revenue is.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:11.069
OK, so we're deriving this.

00:43:11.069 --> 00:43:12.360
We're not modeling it directly.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.026
And we're doing a
pretty good job of it.

00:43:14.026 --> 00:43:16.330
Gives you a good feeling
in the belly that we could

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:18.760
take this curve-- we can take
these underlying components

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.880
and project them
out into the future.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:22.840
And we can project
them out pretty far.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.048
And then we could do a little
bit of accounting stuff

00:43:25.048 --> 00:43:27.166
to turn it into an overall
corporate valuation.

00:43:27.166 --> 00:43:28.540
So that's what
we're going to do.

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.820
So on the next slide, I
want to point out two things

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.350
before I dazzle you with it.

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:35.260
Number one, we're going to
start with this curve over here.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:36.760
We're going to say,
all right, look.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.920
We've captured revenue
through May of 2017.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:39.839
Let's go beyond it.

00:43:39.839 --> 00:43:42.130
So you're going to see that
curve all compressed and 50

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:43.620
years to the right of it--

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.500
50 projected years.

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.520
Number two, we recognize that
not all models are perfect.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.175
It's just that some
suck less than others.

00:43:51.175 --> 00:43:52.550
And so we're going
to acknowledge

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:54.758
that there could be errors
in each one of our models.

00:43:54.758 --> 00:43:56.380
So we allow for each
one of our curves

00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:57.600
to be slightly different.

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.600
So I'm going to show you
several hundred-- maybe

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.290
several thousand-- different
trajectories that Wayfair's

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:04.240
revenue could take on.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.100
And here it is.

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:09.220
There's the revenues
through middle of 2017.

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:11.060
And there's a very bleak future.

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.630
We give this company a lot
of credit for its successes

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:16.000
to date and for the
metrics that they share.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.860
But it is not a pretty picture.

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:20.800
Their acquisitions are growing
too fast and too expensively.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.860
They're acquiring a lot
of very bad customers.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.500
And they're not-- they haven't
established enough of a base

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:30.160
of repeat buying that when
acquisitions level off,

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.870
which they will do--

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.459
they must.

00:44:34.459 --> 00:44:37.000
Usually what happens with most
companies is when acquisitions

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.460
peak, there's enough
established base

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.240
of ongoing repeat buying that
you don't even notice it.

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.930
I mean, did any
of you notice when

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:45.680
Amazon's acquisitions peaked?

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.220
Nah, because the repeat
buying was so high

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:49.360
that it was all good.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.660
This company will crash.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:54.320
It might crash this year, as
some retail experts are saying.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.310
It might crash in--

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:55.851
I don't know.

00:44:55.851 --> 00:44:57.800
Our best guess is
sometime in the mid 2020s.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.710
I don't know.

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:02.630
But they're just imbalanced
in their allocations.

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:04.830
And, well, let's take
each one of these numbers

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:06.410
and turn it into a valuation.

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:08.150
Here we go.

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:12.410
In May of 2017, the company
was trading for $65 a share.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:16.120
We come up with a mean
stock price of $10.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.990
And we're right.

00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:21.130
Well, time will tell.

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:24.580
Interesting to see that this
simple academic paper had quite

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:28.000
an impact on the stock price.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.450
In September of 2017, the stock
was trading in the mid $80s.

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:33.126
The day the paper
came out, Wayfair

00:45:33.126 --> 00:45:34.750
had the biggest drop
in its stock price

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:36.010
in a couple of years.

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:37.886
And it just kind of kept
on going from there.

00:45:37.886 --> 00:45:39.843
And it's just really
interesting to see the way

00:45:39.843 --> 00:45:42.490
that people picked up on
it, including our own Philly

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:43.984
guy, Jim Cramer.

00:45:43.984 --> 00:45:44.650
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:47.320
- say, the [INAUDIBLE]----
he's really into this one--

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.756
struck again when he tweeted
his support of an academic paper

00:45:50.756 --> 00:45:52.880
published by professors at
Emory and the University

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.690
of Pennsylvania, calling it
the smartest piece ever written

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:57.100
on Wayfair.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.830
It did the job, causing Wayfair
to plunge from $83 to $70

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:01.080
as of today.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.660
What was so devastating about
a high level academic paper?

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.410
The professors tried
to come up with a way

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:08.800
to pin a value on Wayfair's
current and future customers,

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.060
based on how many--

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:13.690
on how much they make from these
customers versus how much they

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:14.760
spend to acquire them.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.649
[END PLAYBACK]

00:46:16.649 --> 00:46:18.690
PETER FADER: Let's think
about this for a second.

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:20.690
Let me just kind of
tone it down, Jim.

00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:21.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:24.420
The professors said
that they're going

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:26.190
to figure out the
value of the company

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:28.860
by looking at the
value of the customers

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.720
and the cost of acquisition.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.849
What's your reaction to that?

00:46:33.849 --> 00:46:35.640
I'll tell you what your
reaction should be.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:38.770
Your reaction should be, duh.

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:41.050
That's how every company
should be valued.

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:43.740
Instead of just looking
at this almost meaningless

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:45.930
overall revenue stream,
let's decompose it

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:47.540
into the stuff that
really matters,

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:49.980
that really reflects what
this company is all about,

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.520
and build it up from there.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:53.228
And so that's the kind
of thing that I've

00:46:53.228 --> 00:46:55.470
been really pushing, both--

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:58.350
primarily as a way just to
make the customer-centric thing

00:46:58.350 --> 00:46:59.200
happen.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.661
But here's my new startup.

00:47:00.661 --> 00:47:03.160
If you're interested in this--
and I'm not here to sell it--

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.826
but if you're interested in some
of these ideas about how we can

00:47:05.826 --> 00:47:08.220
revolutionize finance through
customer-based corporate

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:09.090
valuation--

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:11.640
to basically take these
principles of customer

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:14.940
centricity and bring them to
a very different audience,

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:18.090
to get the CFO and the VP of
investor relations on board

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:20.520
as well, to say, tell me
more about those methods.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:22.800
And hey, you guys
in marketing, you

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.600
might want to see
these models over here.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.220
They're kind of interesting.

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:28.770
That's the conversation
that I want to create--

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:30.250
and so far, so good.

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:32.890
And I hope it's been so far,
so good for all of you as well.

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:37.140
Those are our four principles
of our customer centricity

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:37.839
manifesto.

00:47:37.839 --> 00:47:39.630
Let me hand it over to
Sarah to wrap it up.

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:41.450
And we'd love to get
some questions from you.

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:42.283
SARAH TOMS: Awesome.

00:47:42.283 --> 00:47:43.230
Thanks, Pete.

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:45.690
OK, so beyond the
manifesto-- just

00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:48.660
some quick, quick
takeaways for you.

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:51.262
So we'd like you to join the
customer centricity revolution.

00:47:51.262 --> 00:47:52.470
That's why we wrote the book.

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:53.678
We hope you'll read the book.

00:47:53.678 --> 00:47:56.070
It's really little,
easy to carry around

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:58.830
in your pocket, and
a nice quick read.

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:01.180
But really, our goal
was, like I said,

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:05.580
is to distill these ideas and
provide that call to action,

00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:08.160
and not be in that
academic sphere--

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:11.970
although it is grounded in
academic research and also

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:13.410
business research--

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:16.020
but to give a clear
roadmap for how

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:19.630
to implement customer
centricity in your organization.

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:23.690
Second, we'd love you
to sign the manifesto.

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:26.630
Third, integrating the
essential frameworks

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:29.360
that Pete and I have been
talking about here today, also

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.260
in the book.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.370
Also if you google
Pete Fader, of course,

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:35.190
there are plenty of
other pieces where

00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:38.810
he's providing advice that would
be incredibly useful for you

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:42.740
to follow into your
everyday business practice.

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:45.200
The one thing that I
found really interesting

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.940
in this journey of
customer centricity--

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:48.920
I've had the
opportunity to interview

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:51.154
a lot of folks in
the business world

00:48:51.154 --> 00:48:52.820
when we were putting
the book together--

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.830
Pete and I are writing
articles, currently--

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:57.080
also putting this
presentation together,

00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.510
is every single
organization that I've

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:02.690
spoken to who are now mature
in customer centricity,

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:04.430
they all started small.

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:06.590
They all started with
teeny tiny experiments.

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:09.380
Often it was actually middle
managers or data scientists

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.210
who had an inkling that
something wasn't quite right.

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:17.360
And there was ways to define
and fine tune their strategies

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.400
around customer lifetime value.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:22.670
When I talked to the folks
over at the LA Dodgers,

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:25.190
they actually made a lot of
mistakes for a number of years

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:27.830
when they were trying
to experiment with CLV.

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:30.680
But those mistakes really
have helped them now

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:34.920
where they are with their
use of CLV in their business.

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:36.230
So it's really interesting.

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:39.320
And this is-- a key point
is living it, experimenting.

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.930
Our call to action in the
book is quite literally

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:45.710
diving in and just
start getting to work.

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:47.710
And then last but not least--

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:50.690
so I lead the simulation
team at the Wharton School.

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:53.960
The simulations really hold
a tremendous amount of power.

00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.060
They provide folks
with an opportunity

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:57.590
to roll up their sleeves.

00:49:57.590 --> 00:49:59.960
Think about something
like a simulation--

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.420
a way to bring your
teams together and really

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:05.660
experience what
it's like, becoming

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:07.580
familiar with
customer centricity,

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.110
and laying out that roadmap.

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:15.290
And so when Pete and I reflect
on where we've come from

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:18.710
and where we're
going, we really hope

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:21.260
that something
like our manifesto

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:23.700
is going to remove
this question mark.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.720
And we are going to
see customer lifetime

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:31.560
value become a common metric
in every single business.

00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:36.000
And it will become a way to
really drive strategy forward.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.810
So I want to thank
everybody for coming today.

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:40.654
Do you have any
closing remarks, Pete?

00:50:40.654 --> 00:50:41.320
PETER FADER: No.

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:42.370
We'd love to get your
questions and comments, though.

00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:44.161
SARAH TOMS: We would
love to get questions.

00:50:44.161 --> 00:50:44.782
Yes, we would.

00:50:44.782 --> 00:50:45.573
PETER FADER: Great.

00:50:45.573 --> 00:50:47.988
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:51.820
All right.

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:54.070
We've got a couple
of microphones here.

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:56.090
What do y'all think?

00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:56.810
Please.

00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:57.450
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:50:57.450 --> 00:50:59.300
That was a very, very
interesting approach.

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:00.300
We really appreciate it.

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:01.370
I do have a question.

00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:04.800
You mentioned the customer
centricity components

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.700
of revenue.

00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:08.500
Any advice that you
can give us in terms

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:11.027
of how to lead
those conversations

00:51:11.027 --> 00:51:12.610
with the customers,
given that we have

00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:14.800
so many variety of them,
and their business models

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:15.790
are very different?

00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:18.010
What would be a couple
of key questions

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:22.150
that we can ask our clients
to identify those components

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:23.630
for their business models?

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:24.380
PETER FADER: Sure.

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:27.670
I really have to say that
moving the conversation

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:30.190
over too early-- starting the
conversation with the folks

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:33.220
in finance and then kind
of backing into marketing

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:36.700
has been incredible, to get
that kind of a broad buy-in,

00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:40.060
and especially from an audience
that's not as afraid of models

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:41.570
and forecasts and so on.

00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:43.220
So here's the question.

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.330
Do you want to know what
your company is worth?

00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:48.940
I mean, it's as simple as that.

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:52.570
Most of the time, we're working
with private equity firms,

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:55.180
late-stage VCs, who are
looking at a company they

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:56.350
want to acquire.

00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:58.120
But it becomes
really interesting

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.104
when we're looking at a company,
and they just know internally

00:52:01.104 --> 00:52:03.520
that they're really worth a
lot more than the market seems

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.480
to be saying.

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:07.619
And they can't quite come up
with that rationale for it.

00:52:07.619 --> 00:52:09.160
So they'll turn to
us to say, so what

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:12.440
are we really worth in terms
of the value of our customers?

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.192
So they can come up
with the number--

00:52:14.192 --> 00:52:16.150
hopefully higher than
what Wall Street thinks--

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:18.580
and then make a whole
big deal about it,

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:22.047
not only that the number is
higher, but to explain why--

00:52:22.047 --> 00:52:24.130
that we've actually been
acquiring more customers.

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:25.780
They're staying around
longer than you think.

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.370
And again, that
translates directly

00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:30.170
into the marketing and other
operational kinds of issues.

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:33.970
So I really think that sometimes
starting on the finance side

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:36.310
or maybe doing that at least
in parallel while you're

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:40.270
doing the less unusual,
but still difficult,

00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:41.747
marketing tactics--

00:52:41.747 --> 00:52:43.330
but bringing it all
together, I think,

00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:47.696
is a very, very convincing way
to say that this stuff's real.

00:52:47.696 --> 00:52:50.026
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Peter.

00:52:50.026 --> 00:52:53.288
SARAH TOMS: Any other questions?

00:52:53.288 --> 00:52:55.780
PETER FADER: Look, I'm in
teaching mode right now.

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:57.260
I will cold call.

00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:57.760
So--

00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.670
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:59.503
PETER FADER: Please.

00:52:59.503 --> 00:53:02.430
AUDIENCE: So I think if there
was the anti-book for this,

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:04.060
it would be "How Brands Grow."

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:04.560
Are you--

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:05.740
PETER FADER: Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:06.490
AUDIENCE: So yeah.

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:08.574
So could you reconcile
those two areas of thought?

00:53:08.574 --> 00:53:09.364
PETER FADER: I can.

00:53:09.364 --> 00:53:12.000
And of course, I can get into
a pretty technical explanation

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:12.650
of it.

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:14.179
But I won't.

00:53:14.179 --> 00:53:16.345
If you don't know "How
Brands Grow," by Byron Sharp,

00:53:16.345 --> 00:53:18.347
I actually highly
recommend it, because--

00:53:18.347 --> 00:53:20.680
he doesn't talk about the
models or anything like that--

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.221
but the models that
I'm talking about

00:53:22.221 --> 00:53:24.967
are very, very, very
similar to the models

00:53:24.967 --> 00:53:26.800
that are underlying a
lot of his principles.

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.700
So I actually agree with
most of what he's saying.

00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.590
I agree with the
idea that when you

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:33.900
have that incremental
dollar to spend,

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:36.210
Byron Sharp says,
grow your base.

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:38.460
You must have more buyers.

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.530
I agree, but for a
different reason.

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:42.970
I say, let's focus
more on acquisition.

00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:45.232
Let's go out there and find
more valuable customers

00:53:45.232 --> 00:53:47.190
and not worry so much
about trying to fatten up

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:48.160
the ones that we have.

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:50.220
So it's actually a lot
of alignment with it.

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:51.780
Now there are some differences.

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.940
And I have the ultimate
love-hate relationship

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:57.010
with Byron Sharp.

00:53:57.010 --> 00:54:01.650
And just to kind of summarize
the biggest difference,

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:03.960
the CLV distribution
that I showed--

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:06.870
the fact that we got this tail
of people out there that sticks

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:07.370
out--

00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:09.744
I was going to say, like a
sore thumb, but a very healthy

00:54:09.744 --> 00:54:11.230
thumb--

00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:12.780
he doesn't really
believe in that.

00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:16.050
He believes that-- it's not so--

00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:18.390
he believes in
heterogeneity, but not

00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:21.480
that there's as
much of a skew to it

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:23.830
as we see in the actual data.

00:54:23.830 --> 00:54:26.940
So a lot of my career has been
taking the kinds of models

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:30.420
that Byron Sharp and other
folks have been building,

00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:32.880
and then adding slight
little bells and whistles

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:36.520
to them to capture reality
a little bit better.

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:39.240
So the basic fundamental
principles-- double jeopardy,

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.470
all that kind of stuff--

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:41.520
holds.

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.140
But there's actually more to it.

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:45.660
And then it leads to
other kinds of advice.

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.120
So we're actually-- it
might seem surprising.

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.260
And I don't blame you
for thinking that way.

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:51.330
But there's a surprising
amount of alignment there.

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:51.720
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:52.110
Thank you.

00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:54.651
PETER FADER: And I will even
say that as we were pulling this

00:54:54.651 --> 00:54:57.609
together and I was trying to
get Sarah into this world, one

00:54:57.609 --> 00:55:00.150
of the early things that I did--
maybe one of the first books

00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:02.917
I pulled off the shelf
was that red-covered book.

00:55:02.917 --> 00:55:04.375
Say, you got to
read this one, too.

00:55:04.375 --> 00:55:04.850
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:05.530
Thank you.

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:06.730
SARAH TOMS: Thank you.

00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:08.250
So we have a
question here from--

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:09.060
I'm not sure where.

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:10.450
But I'll read it.

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:13.950
"Is CLV reserved to
relatively large companies

00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:16.620
with a lot of
resources, or is it

00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:18.420
applicable to small
companies as well?"

00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:20.550
So Pete, do you want to
take a stab, or you want--

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:21.400
PETER FADER: Go for it first.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.025
SARAH TOMS: OK.

00:55:22.025 --> 00:55:23.460
All right.

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:27.480
So what we think here is that
these are universal principles,

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:28.860
for sure.

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:32.100
When you're thinking
about your customers,

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:34.290
it's also-- one thing you
have to be worried about

00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:35.940
is the over-investment, right?

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:38.940
So if you're over-investing in
customers that really aren't

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:41.910
worth it, that's something that
will happen to you regardless

00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:43.544
of the size of your company.

00:55:43.544 --> 00:55:45.210
The other thing that
we work really hard

00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:47.040
at in the book-- in
fact we've structured

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:49.081
the book in such a way
that we're talking-- we're

00:55:49.081 --> 00:55:52.350
trying to train your eye to
look at acquisition, retention,

00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:55.940
development, and
then understand time.

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:57.840
There's a time
component to that--

00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:59.800
where you are in the
maturity of your company,

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:01.560
whether you're large
or small, and how

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:03.130
that changes your tactics.

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:04.860
We're talking
about being nimble,

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.840
about experimenting
like I said before,

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.850
about testing your hypotheses.

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:10.530
And these are
principles, especially

00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:13.140
in the era of data
that we're in,

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:15.362
that are applicable whether
you're large or small.

00:56:15.362 --> 00:56:17.820
PETER FADER: And let me just
add to that, because in an era

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:21.150
where everyday we're talking
about the retail apocalypse

00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:23.790
and all this kind of thing, I'm
actually very hopeful about it.

00:56:23.790 --> 00:56:27.250
And I think that the future
rises from the small companies.

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:29.980
Those digitally-native,
direct-to-consumer companies,

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:33.540
many of which are
right around here--

00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:36.750
I don't want to say that they're
textbook customer centricity

00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:37.457
examples.

00:56:37.457 --> 00:56:39.790
But they're are a heck of a
lot better than their older,

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:41.670
bigger, slower brethren.

00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:44.310
And so again, implicitly
or explicitly,

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:46.380
they're starting to embrace
a lot of these ideas.

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:49.020
They're starting to tag and
track customers, calculate CLVs

00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:51.810
a lot earlier than
traditional companies would.

00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:53.992
And what's happening is
those big old companies

00:56:53.992 --> 00:56:55.950
are starting to take them
a lot more seriously.

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:58.560
Instead of dismissing them as
a passing fad or just a little

00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:00.052
teeny tiny niche,
they're saying,

00:57:00.052 --> 00:57:01.260
we can learn a lot from them.

00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:01.950
You know what?

00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:05.010
Let's hire some of them to
start running our marketing

00:57:05.010 --> 00:57:06.430
or our whole company.

00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:08.250
So I think a lot
of these ideas are

00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:10.120
kind of working their way up.

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:14.101
And sometimes it's the little
companies leading the way.

00:57:14.101 --> 00:57:14.600
Rodney.

00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:15.391
AUDIENCE: Hey, hey.

00:57:15.391 --> 00:57:16.050
Hi.

00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:19.030
Thank you guys both for today.

00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:21.780
Kind of related to
that last point--

00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:23.730
is there a certain threshold--

00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:25.210
not so much size of company--

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:28.110
but maybe threshold
of data that you need?

00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:33.420
So for instance, do you need
5,000 customers or 5 million?

00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:35.140
Do you need two
years, three years,

00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:36.870
or five years of
transaction data

00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:38.820
to actually make
that model work?

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:39.840
What's the thresholds?

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:41.625
Because that will
definitely tell us.

00:57:41.625 --> 00:57:43.740
It may be a small company
growing very rapidly.

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:46.500
But then you hit a certain
threshold of customers,

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.720
but you don't have enough
years or enough data

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.190
to actually make the model work.

00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:51.321
Any thoughts or comments?

00:57:51.321 --> 00:57:52.320
PETER FADER: Absolutely.

00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:54.805
I sort of almost implicitly
answered the question

00:57:54.805 --> 00:57:56.830
when I was talking about
the kinds of companies

00:57:56.830 --> 00:57:58.420
that we work with on
customer-based corporate

00:57:58.420 --> 00:57:58.920
valuation.

00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:00.940
I said, late-stage VCs.

00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:03.010
You can't really do it
at the early stages,

00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:05.050
for exactly the reasons
you pointed out,

00:58:05.050 --> 00:58:07.000
that you don't have
enough customers to really

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.240
see or estimate that
full CLV distribution.

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.820
And in terms of the length
of the runway that you need,

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:14.620
it's kind of
interesting that I don't

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:16.570
need a long runway of data.

00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:17.810
I need enough customers.

00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:19.510
But I don't need a
long amount of time

00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:21.020
in order to estimate
these models.

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:23.170
But I still don't
really trust them

00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:25.250
until I have about
two or three years.

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:26.710
And why is that?

00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:29.162
Because one of the issues
that we haven't spoken about--

00:58:29.162 --> 00:58:30.870
but we make a big deal
about in the book,

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:32.745
and I can't say enough
about it in practice--

00:58:32.745 --> 00:58:34.390
are cohorts of customers.

00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:37.900
We always run these models for
a given group of customers,

00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:40.090
generally who we acquired
at the same time.

00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:42.880
And the issue is that the
cohorts are not all created

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:44.766
equal, and that as
we go over time--

00:58:44.766 --> 00:58:47.140
so we get that first cohort
of customers we acquired soon

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:48.370
after we were founded--

00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:50.870
they tend to be much
better customers.

00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:53.440
And so we don't want to just
calculate CLVs on them and say,

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:55.150
we're an amazing company.

00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:56.920
Let's raise some more capital.

00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:01.270
So we need enough time to see a
bunch of the different cohorts.

00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:03.910
We have to play connect
the dots across them.

00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:06.670
We've got to watch them start
to stabilize a little bit,

00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:08.800
so we can anticipate
what the subsequent

00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:12.022
and the steady state, mature
cohorts are going to look like.

00:59:12.022 --> 00:59:13.480
So yes, we do need
enough customers

00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:14.950
to see the heterogeneity.

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:18.610
We do need enough of a runway to
see the cross-cohort dynamics.

00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:21.910
And obviously, we do need
enough cleanliness of data

00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:24.140
to trust those results
in the first place.

00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:27.040
Sometimes these models
that I endorse--

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:29.140
sometimes they're too
good, that they'll

00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:31.870
work really well even when
you put in crappy data.

00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:34.750
And it gives you this false
sense of security about it.

00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:38.164
So all the issues you raised
are right on the money.

00:59:38.164 --> 00:59:39.580
And with that in
mind, I recognize

00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:43.000
that most companies aren't born
to do customer centricity right

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:43.890
out of the gate.

00:59:43.890 --> 00:59:46.490
They're going to be born
around a particular product.

00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:49.120
We just want them to
look ahead and start

00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:50.620
doing all that
tagging and tracking,

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.810
because two, three years
later, maybe it's time

00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:54.470
to do that pivot towards it.

00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:55.990
But it's going to
take some time.

00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.290
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:59:56.290 --> 00:59:56.890
Thank you.

00:59:56.890 --> 00:59:58.690
PETER FADER: Sure thing.

00:59:58.690 --> 01:00:00.780
We don't want to hold
people hostage here.

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:04.630
See if there's time for
any other pressing issues.

01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:07.860
If not, you got our
contact info over here.

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:12.630
And we are absolutely delighted
to keep the conversation going.

01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:15.100
As I said before, this
really is the first time

01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:16.790
that we've presented
this content.

01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:18.730
The book's only been
out for a few weeks.

01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:21.930
So we're very much open, not
only to questions but feedback.

01:00:21.930 --> 01:00:25.540
And just tell us how we can
spread the gospel of customer

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:28.450
centricity and how we can help
you do it more effectively as

01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:29.390
well.

01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:30.920
So with that, I
want to thank Neil

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.200
and the rest of
the team over here

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.991
for giving us this
opportunity, and for all

01:00:33.991 --> 01:00:35.470
of you for taking the time.

01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:38.770
And best wishes on your
customer-centric journey.

01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:41.520
