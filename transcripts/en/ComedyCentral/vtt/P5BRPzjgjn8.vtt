00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.568
I'm in Jackson, Mississippi.

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:03.703
With some amazing talent.

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:06.305
I got Marvin Hunter,
Merc William, 

00:00:06.338 --> 00:00:08.708
Rita Brent, and Ben Compton.

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:11.577
If you guys could
describe comedy

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.212
in Jackson, Mississippi
in one word,

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:14.580
what would you describe it as?

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:15.581
- I would say growing.
- Growing.

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:17.350
Because typically, you
think about Mississippi,

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:19.419
you think about fried
chicken and Morgan Freeman.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.087
You don't think about comedy.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.323
But now-- now, you can
think about comedy.

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:26.125
I love the
intimate comedy room.

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:28.461
I don't think there's a better
setting that's so close knit,

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:29.695
you feel like you know them.

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:31.264
How long have you
been doing comedy?

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:32.198
About three years now.

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:33.566
Three years.

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:35.701
Rita actually brought
me to Jackson originally.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:38.204
She seen me on YouTube,
brought me to a show

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:39.405
she was putting on.

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:40.840
Why did you grab him?
What happened?

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:42.375
To be honest, I needed
some diversity on the show.

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:43.643
And he's white.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.211
So that's why I had
to get him for that.

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:46.512
I love that.

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:48.681
Flat out honesty.

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:50.383
To be honest, I
needed a white boy.

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:51.551
- And he's funny.
- What about you?

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:52.385
How long you been doing comedy?

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:53.453
Two years now.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.821
It all happened by mistake.

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:55.655
What?

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:57.590
I have an identical
twin brother.

00:00:57.623 --> 00:00:58.558
OK.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:01.461
He moved to Memphis,
but he still had gigs.

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:05.131
And so I was like, hey, let
me host your gigs for you.

00:01:05.164 --> 00:01:07.200
Y'all did a twin switch.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.101
Literally.

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:08.701
This happened like that.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.303
They thought I was him.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:11.737
And he lives in Atlanta now.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.805
So I'm pretty sure he's
on the streets right now,

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:15.608
saying y'all gonna see
me on "Hart of the City."

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.477
I'm pretty sure
he gonna say that.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.479
What's your style
of comedy, Marvin?

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:20.513
Grumpy uncle.

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:21.647
KEVIN HART: The grumpy uncle?

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.815
Yeah, grumpy uncle.

00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:24.117
Is that what you
are in real life?

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.151
Yeah.

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:25.818
I got divorced.

00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:28.254
Heifer took everything, so--

00:01:28.287 --> 00:01:29.722
oh, yeah.

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:30.089
KEVIN HART: That's
what pissed you off?

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:31.624
Oh, yeah.

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:32.325
KEVIN HART: Angry
about everything.

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:33.292
MARVIN HUNTER: About everything.

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:34.827
About everything.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.263
We are performing at the
Next Level Experience.

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:39.198
Is there a little bit of fear
for your performance tonight?

00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:40.399
BEN COMPTON: Hell yeah.

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:42.401
I feel like in doing comedy,
you always have-- you always

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:43.503
have a fear at each show.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:44.604
Just like being
in the military.

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:46.372
I've been to war zone.

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:48.141
You step on the stage, man, in
front of people, same feeling.

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:49.042
Your skin crawls.

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:50.443
But you got to do
what you got to do.

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:53.346
I don't know if
I can compare--

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:55.314
a war to the stage.

00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:56.282
It's the same feeling.

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:57.617
It's the same anxiety.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.751
You gonna see a different
level of Kevin Hart

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:01.554
if a bullet flies past my
head, but I don't if you--

00:02:01.587 --> 00:02:04.157
if I'm gonna get
to the punch line.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.492
[inaudible]
