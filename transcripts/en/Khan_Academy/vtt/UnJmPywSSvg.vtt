00:00:00.551 --> 00:00:01.712
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.712 --> 00:00:03.639
I wanted to talk today
about a different kind

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:04.557
of irregular plural.

00:00:04.557 --> 00:00:06.635
So we've been talking
about regular plurals

00:00:06.635 --> 00:00:08.481
where you take a word and you add an S.

00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:12.103
So for example, the word dog becomes dogs.

00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:13.435
You add an S.

00:00:13.435 --> 00:00:16.050
And this is the regular plural here.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.560
But I've been talking
about the irregular plural,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.555
the plural, the multiple form of a verb

00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:26.156
that is not regular, irregular.

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:28.594
But today I figured we'd
talk about something called

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:30.245
the base plural.

00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:37.553
Which I will illustrate for
you using our friend the sheep.

00:00:37.553 --> 00:00:40.793
Now, sheep is a very strange word in that

00:00:40.793 --> 00:00:43.637
it doesn't matter whether not
there's more than one of them.

00:00:43.637 --> 00:00:46.110
The form of the word always looks the same

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.954
whether it's one sheep or two sheep.

00:00:48.954 --> 00:00:51.392
It's an irregular plural
you don't add an S to.

00:00:51.392 --> 00:00:55.152
This is called a base plural
'cause the base sheep,

00:00:55.152 --> 00:00:59.273
the thing that you would
normally add this particle S to

00:00:59.273 --> 00:01:03.232
doesn't change whether it's
singular sheep or plural sheep.

00:01:03.232 --> 00:01:06.408
So that's you know.

00:01:13.878 --> 00:01:15.846
There was one sheep...

00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:22.569
on the hill.

00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:28.362
There's a sentence.

00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:32.477
What if we put another little
baby sheep on that hill?

00:01:32.477 --> 00:01:34.393
A little lamb.

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:36.881
Well now the sentence looks like this.

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:42.360
Two sheep...

00:01:45.152 --> 00:01:46.923
on the hill.

00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:50.597
Now the only difference
between these two sentences

00:01:50.597 --> 00:01:53.233
is that there's one sheep and two sheep

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:55.868
and therefore that means that the verb

00:01:55.868 --> 00:01:58.318
changes to a plural conjugation.

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:00.199
So there was one sheep.

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:02.463
There were two sheep on the hill.

00:02:02.463 --> 00:02:04.622
But everything else
stays exactly the same.

00:02:04.622 --> 00:02:07.234
One sheep, two sheep.

00:02:07.234 --> 00:02:09.638
This is very strange, it's a base plural.

00:02:09.638 --> 00:02:13.568
So in standard English,
the form is two sheep...

00:02:16.313 --> 00:02:19.849
and not two sheeps.

00:02:23.152 --> 00:02:23.953
You see.

00:02:23.953 --> 00:02:26.472
Now, there are more words
that do behave this way.

00:02:26.472 --> 00:02:28.603
So let's go investigate.

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.357
So there are a small number of words

00:02:33.357 --> 00:02:35.795
that also behave this
way, the way sheep does,

00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:39.034
these weird sheep plurals,
these base plurals.

00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:40.358
One of them is fish.

00:02:40.358 --> 00:02:42.958
So you could say the fish
are plentiful this season,

00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:45.844
but you could also say,
you know, the fish...

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.128
is delicious.

00:02:53.918 --> 00:02:57.192
You could say the bison migrate west

00:02:57.192 --> 00:03:00.350
or you could also say
the bison migrates west

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.410
indicating a single bison, you see.

00:03:03.914 --> 00:03:05.876
Bison can be singular or plural.

00:03:05.876 --> 00:03:09.041
Fish can be singular or plural.

00:03:09.917 --> 00:03:13.156
As is so frequently the case,
there is a special exception

00:03:13.156 --> 00:03:16.000
regarding the word fishes,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.161
which you may have heard before,

00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:18.880
and fishes is a word that we would use

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.645
when we're talking
about individual species

00:03:23.916 --> 00:03:25.327
of fish.

00:03:27.481 --> 00:03:28.874
And fish is the word that we would use

00:03:28.874 --> 00:03:31.887
to refer to individual fish.

00:03:33.436 --> 00:03:36.186
So let's say your uncle Marty
is a prodigious fisherman

00:03:36.186 --> 00:03:38.359
and he catches,

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.834
he goes fly fishing one weekend,

00:03:39.834 --> 00:03:41.714
he comes back, he has 30 fish.

00:03:41.714 --> 00:03:45.327
Marty caught...

00:03:48.514 --> 00:03:51.572
30 fish.

00:03:51.572 --> 00:03:53.825
But let's say on the other hand

00:03:53.825 --> 00:03:58.189
your aunt Marta is a
prodigious marine biologist

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.948
and she studies 30
different types of fish.

00:04:01.948 --> 00:04:06.639
You would say Marta studies...

00:04:08.317 --> 00:04:10.204
30 fishes.

00:04:14.157 --> 00:04:16.676
And that doesn't mean that she
studies 30 individual fish.

00:04:16.676 --> 00:04:19.799
That means she studies 30 types of fish.

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:20.554
That's the difference.

00:04:20.554 --> 00:04:23.839
Fishes is referring to species.

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:26.916
Fish refers to individuals.

00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:28.829
That's how you'd use them in the plural.

00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:30.875
So to review,

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:35.008
there's this entire class
of words called base plurals

00:04:36.198 --> 00:04:39.356
where the word itself, the
base, doesn't take an S

00:04:39.356 --> 00:04:40.714
for the plural, it's just the same.

00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:42.920
The singular is the same as the plural.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.474
So that gives us words like sheep,

00:04:45.474 --> 00:04:47.224
fish,

00:04:47.224 --> 00:04:48.995
and bison.

00:04:50.382 --> 00:04:52.680
There aren't a ton of English
words that behave this way

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.793
where the plural is the
same as the singular.

00:04:54.793 --> 00:04:55.989
I just wanted to make you aware

00:04:55.989 --> 00:04:57.638
of some of the most common ones.

00:04:57.638 --> 00:05:00.517
There are also more
examples in the exercises.

00:05:00.517 --> 00:05:03.315
So I just wanted you to be aware of them.

00:05:03.315 --> 00:05:04.720
You can learn anything.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.085
David out.
