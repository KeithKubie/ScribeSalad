00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.070
When you, you've crushed your daily to do list,

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.300
do you then take the time to relax or do you tack the next days list?

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.610
Is that against prioritize and execute since the mission is done for the day,

4
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.410
<v 1>you know, just do more. Just keep going. Even if it's on the next day,</v>

5
00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:19.840
I keep going do more. If you have extra time,

6
00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:21.940
do whatever you can do to stay ahead.

7
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.330
And I do that pretty much until I'm brain dead. And I, I,

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.730
I can definitely work myself into, but until I'm brain dead,

9
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.340
like I can get to a point where I'm reading or I'm writing and it's just,

10
00:00:30.341 --> 00:00:32.200
it's just, it's just done. I'm done.

11
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.740
And so I just have to stop and take a break and then I'll go do something

12
00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:39.790
mindless for awhile, you know? So you know, if you, if you've got stuff to do,

13
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.510
keep hammering until you can't hammer anymore and then say, oh, okay,

14
00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:44.344
you know what?

15
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.770
I need a little breather and then take a little breather and then get back to

16
00:00:47.771 --> 00:00:52.750
it. Right now I could work 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day,

17
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.070
seven days a week, 365 days a year and,

18
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.320
and I wouldn't be able to get done the things I'm trying to get done,

19
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.290
so it's not like I'm sitting there going, oh cool, I've got a break. No.

20
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.880
All I see is all he's got is more stuff to do. You've got things to do.

21
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.700
So not a bunch of boys. You call it breaks and relaxing. That's not a,

22
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.150
not a lot of that happening right now. Now you go surfing. Is that a break?

23
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.380
Kind of. It's like a big,

24
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.070
<v 0>well it's kind of hard of the process.</v>

25
00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:22.160
It's like if you're doing five sets of 10 on the bench,

26
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.480
what are you going to do? One set of 50 no,

27
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.120
you do five sets of 10 so for a set of the 10 what do you do?

28
00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:31.430
You get a rescue to recover. That's what surfing is. That's the,

29
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.190
it's the rest between sets. That's all that is right there.

30
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:38.750
You go as part of the process track, but what would you,

31
00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:41.840
would you recommend for someone who's like a normal person?

32
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.450
<v 1>Do what? You can. Knock it out. Build up extra free time if you need a break.</v>

33
00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:50.590
Take a break. Gotcha. That's pretty crazy, right?

34
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.120
Know what I'm saying? Is Do what you can. If you need a break, take a break.

35
00:01:55.121 --> 00:01:57.130
If you need a little relaxation, take some relaxation.

36
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.880
Don't waste your time though. See, people, people do relaxing, but they do it.

37
00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:04.180
They don't even do it. Good. They don't even feel relaxed when they get done.

38
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.550
It's not productive. Relaxing. Yeah, they're, they just,

39
00:02:06.551 --> 00:02:09.640
what they did is they did something stupid for an hour.

40
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.500
They watched youtube videos for an hour. Did that help? You know, called side.

41
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.460
Go for a run, do some burpees, go surfing, go do some Jujitsu. Uh,

42
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.060
play with your kids, whatever. Do something that actually has some value.

43
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.403
The real value.

44
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.580
<v 0>Oh, but so what about, you know, [inaudible] Ohana and we're going to,</v>

45
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.110
uh, the bar. Yeah, that's not great,

46
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.600
but sometimes don't get too hammered because you're hung over the next day.

47
00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:39.240
You can't accomp you know, you can't function as good. Boom. Can't, uh,

48
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.510
your output, your productivity goes down next day.

49
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.380
You better tell everyone what pounder means. Cause not everyone knows like, oh,

50
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.340
Pahata I guess technically it means done with what you're doing.

51
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.260
Pop means done. Hahna means like do. Yeah. Um, but yeah,

52
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.360
Paul Hahn, upon finishing with what you're doing, tip,

53
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.470
it's referred to when you're finished with work. Yeah.

54
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.360
That's the way I always used it. You Go, yeah, when you finish work,

55
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.510
Paul Hahna goes, you know, whatever. It's like Miller time, you know,

56
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.760
for sure the same thing a little bit.
