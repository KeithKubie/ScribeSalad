WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The gender I was going to experience. I wanted to talk about you,

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.980
like where you are right now in your life and how you're handling this because

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.770
you've been in exile for how many years now?

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.730
<v 1>Uh, it's been more than six years now, uh, since June of 2013. Yeah,</v>

5
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.110
I mean, well actually I left. Uh, may, so what is lifelike?

6
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.610
<v 0>I mean, are you in constant hiding? I mean, what,</v>

7
00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:28.720
what are the issues like

8
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.160
<v 1>in, in the beginning, um, my, uh,</v>

9
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.110
operational security level, uh, as we would call it was, was very high. Uh,

10
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:42.440
I was concerned, uh, about being recognized.

11
00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:46.150
I was concerned about being followed. I was concerned, uh, really, uh,

12
00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:50.180
about very bad things happening to me because the government made it very clear

13
00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:53.720
that from their position I was the most wanted man in the world. Um,

14
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.370
they literally brought down, uh, the president of Bolivia, uh,

15
00:00:58.371 --> 00:01:02.060
his aircraft and would not let it depart, uh,

16
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.830
as it tried to cross the airspace of Europe, not even the United States. Uh,

17
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.790
they wouldn't let it leave until they confirmed I was not onboard. Um, so yeah,

18
00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:15.710
that, that made me a little bit nervous, but you can't live like that forever.

19
00:01:15.711 --> 00:01:19.740
And although I was as careful as I could be, um,

20
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.860
I still lived a pretty happily because I was an indoor cat to begin with.

21
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.150
Right. I've always been a technologist. I've always been a pretty nerdy. Um,

22
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:32.630
so as long as I have a screen and an internet connection, I was pretty happy.

23
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.970
Um, but, uh, in the years past, my life has become more and more open. You know,

24
00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:42.170
now I, I speak openly. I live openly. I go out, I ride the Metro,

25
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:45.530
I go to restaurants. I go, well, you know how often they recognized park.

26
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.270
So this is a funny thing is I'm almost never recognized. I'm,

27
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.680
one of those things is I don't give a Russian interviews, um,

28
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.850
because I don't want my face all over the news. Um,

29
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.350
which is nice because it just allows people to, to sort of forget about my face,

30
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.390
um, and I can, uh, go about my life. But, uh, I,

31
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.910
it's one of the weird things that I'm, I'm recognized, uh,

32
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:13.460
a couple times a year, uh,

33
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.030
even when I'm not wearing my glasses, uh,

34
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.480
in a a museum or a grocery store or something like that,

35
00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:24.920
or out on the street just by somebody who I swear like these people are, are,

36
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.930
you might've read a story about him,

37
00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:31.400
like super recognizers the people that just have a great memory for faces. Uh,

38
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
because I can be like aware in hood and like a jacket can have a scarf around my

39
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:40.400
face, like in the winter. And it like,

40
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.120
you can barely see my face and they'll come up to me and they're like,

41
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.740
are you Snowden? And I'm like, Whoa, what do you say?

42
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.060
It's pretty impressive, I'd say. Yeah, nice to meet you.

43
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.890
Um, and uh, yeah, they've, it's, I've, I've never had a negative interaction,

44
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.530
um, from being recognized, but for me, no, because I'm a privacy advocate.

45
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:05.260
Like I would, I would much rather go on recognized,

46
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:08.920
like I don't want to be a celebrity. Um,

47
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.750
but the other thing is I'll get recognized in computer stores and I think

48
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:16.180
there's just like a mental association, uh,

49
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:21.010
where people are like their brain when it's cycling through faces that are,

50
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:24.670
recognizes it's going through like the subset of nerdier people or something

51
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:28.520
like that when you're in a computer store because for whatever reason, um,

52
00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:32.830
I'm a recognized much more frequently when there's some kind of technological

53
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.220
like locus. Mmm. Mmm.

54
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.120
<v 0>So you're living freely. Did you had to learn Russian? Did you learn it?</v>

55
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.400
<v 1>Yeah, I mean, my, my, my Russian is still pretty crappy, um, to, to,</v>

56
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.180
to my great shame because all of my life,

57
00:03:48.181 --> 00:03:51.630
all of my work is primarily in English. Right. Now

58
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.690
<v 0>you've talked about returning home if you could get a fair trial.</v>

59
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.560
Is, is that a feasible thing,

60
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.180
a fair trial for someone like you? Is that such a well, is that,

61
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.250
is that even possible question?

62
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.790
<v 1>I mean, look, if, if we're being Frank, uh, I,</v>

63
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:15.030
I think all of your audience knows, uh,

64
00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:19.380
the chance of me getting a fair shake in the Eastern district of Virginia,

65
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.180
a couple miles from the headquarters of the CIA, uh, is probably pretty slim,

66
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.740
uh, because that's where they draw the jury pool front, right? Um, but,

67
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.560
uh, my objection here is on a larger, uh, principle, right?

68
00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:36.900
What happens to me is less important, right?

69
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:38.550
If I spend the rest of my life in jail,

70
00:04:38.551 --> 00:04:42.660
that that's less important than what I'm actually requiring the government to

71
00:04:42.661 --> 00:04:46.350
agree to a, which is a single thing, right? Uh, they say, face the music,

72
00:04:46.351 --> 00:04:51.300
face the music, and I'm saying, great, let's pick the song. Um, the thing is

73
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.080
the law that I've been charged under the one that all these whistleblowers,

74
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.620
I'm in charge on her, Thomas Drake, uh, Daniel Ellsberg, Chelsea Manning,

75
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.030
Daniel Hale,

76
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.500
the drone whistleblower who is in prison right now going through a trial that is

77
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:09.790
precisely similar to what I would be facing. Uh, his lawyer,

78
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.530
uh, is asking the court or, or telling the court, uh,

79
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.060
that we want to tell the jury why he did what he did. Uh,

80
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.350
that the government is violating laws, uh, government is violating human rights,

81
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.120
um, that these programs are immoral, that they're unethical. Um,

82
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.630
this is what motivated this guy to do it.

83
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.230
And the jury should be able to hear why he did what he did.

84
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:38.680
And the jury should be able to decide whether that was right or wrong.

85
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.500
And the government has responded, you know, to this whistleblower argument,

86
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:47.530
basically saying, we demand the court.

87
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:51.220
Forbid this guy from breathing the word whistleblower in court,

88
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.510
he cannot talk about what motivated him. He cannot talk about, uh,

89
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:58.730
what was revealed, why it was revealed, what the impacts and effects were.

90
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.930
And he can't talk about whether the public benefited from it or was harmed by it

91
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.660
because it doesn't matter. Now,

92
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:08.030
this might surprise a lot of people because to a lot of us,

93
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:11.930
we think that's what a jury trial is. We think that's what a fair trial is. Uh,

94
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.460
but the espionage act for the government uses against whistle blowers, uh,

95
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.510
meaning broadly here, the sources of journalism, um,

96
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.910
is fairly unique in the legal system in that it is what's called a strict

97
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.410
liability crime. A strict liability crime, uh,

98
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:33.770
is what the government considers to be basically a crime worse than murder.

99
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.210
Because if you, if you murdered somebody, like if you just, I dunno,

100
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:42.020
beat Jamie with the microphone stand right now. Um,

101
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.070
you would be able to go to the court and say it was self defense, right?

102
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.330
You F you felt threatened. You were in danger for your life,

103
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.620
even if you weren't right,

104
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.470
even though you obviously weren't even if you are on tape,

105
00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.060
you could still argue that and the jury could go you full of crap, right?

106
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.400
And they could convict you. But if you were in fact acting in self defense,

107
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.480
if the jury did in fact, believe you,

108
00:07:06.481 --> 00:07:09.930
they could take that into consideration in establishing their verdict, right?

109
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.510
Strict liability crimes forbid that the jury is not allowed,

110
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.870
uh, to consider why you committed a crime.

111
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.510
They're only allowed to consider if you committed a crime. Uh,

112
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.880
they're not allowed to consider if the murder was justified.

113
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.220
They're only allowed to consider if the murder took place.

114
00:07:29.221 --> 00:07:34.221
And the funny thing in this case is that the murder that we're talking about is

115
00:07:34.861 --> 00:07:35.820
telling the truth.

116
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:41.450
The espionage act in every case is a law the government exclusively uses against

117
00:07:44.191 --> 00:07:46.730
people who told the truth, right? Like that.

118
00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:48.810
That's what it's about in the context of journalism.

119
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.170
They don't bring the espionage act against people who lied,

120
00:07:52.171 --> 00:07:55.380
then they would use fraud or some other statute. Uh,

121
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:59.070
they say the government is arguing in the context of whistle blowing.

122
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.200
That telling a, uh,

123
00:08:01.201 --> 00:08:06.201
telling a important truth to the American people by way of a journalist is a

124
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.960
crime worse than murder. And I believe,

125
00:08:09.961 --> 00:08:14.961
and I think most Americans would agree this is fundamentally indefensibly wrong.

126
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.630
And so my whole argument with the United States government since the very

127
00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:22.320
beginning was bent, I'll be back for jury trial tomorrow,

128
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:27.530
but you have to agree to permit a whistleblower is a public interest defense.

129
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:31.110
It doesn't matter whether they are whistleblower, not a, it's just they argued,

130
00:08:31.111 --> 00:08:34.410
it's the jury that decides whether they are whistleblower or not.

131
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.010
They have to be able to consider the motivations of why someone did what they

132
00:08:38.011 --> 00:08:38.460
did.

133
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:43.460
The government says we refuse to allow that because that puts the government on

134
00:08:44.371 --> 00:08:49.080
trial and we don't trust the jury to consider those questions. Wow.

135
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:53.400
So you have had these conversations then, so this has been discussed. No,

136
00:08:53.401 --> 00:08:58.290
this is, this is from the Obama now. There's been no contact, uh, since,

137
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:00.420
since the Trump administration, uh,

138
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:03.360
because the government basically when they got to this point, they went,

139
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:06.030
we have no good argument against this. Uh,

140
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:09.540
and we will never permit this to happen. And again, I just want to make clear,

141
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:11.970
this is not a speculation.

142
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:16.971
This is not me thinking this is actively happening in the case of Daniel Hale

143
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:19.830
right now. I hope you guys can pull, uh,

144
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:24.540
a graphic for it because this story just at the papers like two or three weeks

145
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:27.540
ago, I'm saying the government is forbidding this guy from,

146
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.553
from making this argument.

147
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:33.460
<v 0>So your situ, you're seemingly in a state of limbo,</v>

148
00:09:33.461 --> 00:09:36.160
then you're, they're not actively pursuing you.

149
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.160
It seems that if you're able to move around freely, they,

150
00:09:40.161 --> 00:09:43.950
they haven't discovered where you are. You're just free to live your life. You

151
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:48.640
<v 1>well, yeah. Yeah. It's one of these things where, you know,</v>

152
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.660
whether they know where I am or whether they, uh, don't know where I am,

153
00:09:52.661 --> 00:09:55.900
where I put my head on the pillow, it doesn't matter so much. I'm in Russia.

154
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.410
Right. And we should lean into that because I think people, uh,

155
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.380
they hear Russia, particularly in the context of today's news.

156
00:10:02.381 --> 00:10:05.530
And you see like what people are saying about Tulsa Gabbert and things like

157
00:10:05.531 --> 00:10:10.420
that. Uh, any kind of a association,

158
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:15.070
any, anytime your name appears in the same sentence, same paragraph, same story.

159
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.240
Uh, as the word Russia, it's considered a negative thing. Now. Um,

160
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.060
and don't get me wrong, I've been a longtime critic of the Russian government.

161
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.330
I just actually had a major story, uh,

162
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:30.100
written about me in a Russian state news, uh, outlet called RIA.

163
00:10:30.101 --> 00:10:33.040
Novosti. Uh, you guys could, could probably pull it.

164
00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:36.460
It's only in Russian though. Um, that saying,

165
00:10:36.461 --> 00:10:41.461
because I spoke favorably about a member of the Russian opposition,

166
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.070
uh, Alexina Nevani, um,

167
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.490
which I wasn't even speaking positively about this guy who was saying, look, uh,

168
00:10:49.491 --> 00:10:52.210
I think people have a right, uh,

169
00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.600
to express their opposition in a country, uh,

170
00:10:55.601 --> 00:10:59.950
and they should be able to do that without fearing retaliation the future. Uh,

171
00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:02.890
because the background here is this, this opposition figure, uh,

172
00:11:02.891 --> 00:11:07.120
has been a long time form, uh, in the Russian administration side.

173
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.580
And, uh, they've just suddenly magically, uh,

174
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:16.300
been accused of being foreign agents or something like that. Um,

175
00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:21.040
and so everyone connected to this, which is like a big civil society body, uh,

176
00:11:21.041 --> 00:11:24.370
had their doors like simultaneously kicked down across the country and they're

177
00:11:24.371 --> 00:11:27.160
being investigated for some kind of corruption or something and it doesn't even

178
00:11:27.161 --> 00:11:30.130
matter. Um, and you know, I,

179
00:11:30.131 --> 00:11:33.280
I said I posed that just like I was tweeting, you know, um,

180
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:36.640
footage of a ballot stuffing in the Russian elections,

181
00:11:36.641 --> 00:11:40.600
just like I've criticized the Russian president by name. I've criticized, um,

182
00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.000
Russian surveillance laws, uh,

183
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:47.170
so many things again and again and again and again and again. Um, but yeah,

184
00:11:47.171 --> 00:11:51.850
so look, it does not make my life, uh, easier, uh,

185
00:11:51.851 --> 00:11:55.030
to be trapped in a country that I not choose. And people don't remember this.

186
00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:57.550
I was actually on route to Latin America, uh,

187
00:11:57.551 --> 00:12:00.520
when the U S government canceled my passport, which trapped me in Russia.

188
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:04.330
And for those who are interested, again, I wrote an entire book, uh,

189
00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:09.190
that has a lot of detail on this. Um, but, uh, yeah,

190
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:14.191
it's difficult to be a [inaudible] basically engaged in civil opposition to

191
00:12:17.071 --> 00:12:19.860
policies of the United States government at the same time as the Russian

192
00:12:19.861 --> 00:12:24.620
government. Um, and it's a, it's a hard thing, you know,

193
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.260
it's not a happy thing, but I feel like it's a necessary thing.

194
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.690
The problem is nobody wants to talk about that.

195
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.480
Nobody wants to engage in that kind of nuance. Nobody wants to consider it.

196
00:12:33.481 --> 00:12:37.590
Those kinds of conversations. Um, in the current world, people believe,

197
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:42.570
and this is actually one of the worst things that a Western media does in the

198
00:12:42.571 --> 00:12:44.610
context of discussing, uh, Russia,

199
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.450
is they create this aura of invincibility around the Russian president. They go,

200
00:12:48.451 --> 00:12:51.120
you know, this guy's calling all the shots. He's pulling all the strings.

201
00:12:51.121 --> 00:12:55.740
You know, this guy's in charge of the world. Um, and that's very useful,

202
00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.490
uh, for the Russian government broadly, uh,

203
00:12:59.491 --> 00:13:02.490
because they can then take that and replay that on their domestic media and

204
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.410
they're gonna go, look how strong we are. You know,

205
00:13:04.411 --> 00:13:05.490
the Americans are afraid of us.

206
00:13:05.491 --> 00:13:07.380
The Chinese are afraid of is that everybody's afraid of us.

207
00:13:07.381 --> 00:13:11.070
The French who are afraid of us, uh, we are strong, right?

208
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:17.160
Um, there's no question that Russia is going to be interfering in elections.

209
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:21.150
There's no question in America is going to be interfering in Russian elections,

210
00:13:21.151 --> 00:13:23.100
right? Nobody, nobody likes to talk about this. And again,

211
00:13:23.101 --> 00:13:25.020
I need to substantiate that. Now that I've said that,

212
00:13:25.021 --> 00:13:29.130
I've got an old note that I've signed a billion times. Um,

213
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:33.600
the New York times, uh, publish a story in the wake of, you know,

214
00:13:33.601 --> 00:13:35.960
this contest in 2016 election, uh,

215
00:13:35.961 --> 00:13:40.410
where they looked into the history of electoral interference, uh,

216
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.060
in Russia and the Soviet union. Um, and they found in, uh,

217
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.690
roughly 50 years, 36 different cases, uh,

218
00:13:48.691 --> 00:13:51.300
of election interference by Russia or the Soviet. It's right.

219
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.170
This is not a new thing.

220
00:13:52.171 --> 00:13:55.500
This is something that always happens because that's what intelligence services

221
00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:59.340
do. That's what they think they're being paid for, which is a sad thing,

222
00:13:59.341 --> 00:13:59.761
but it's a,

223
00:13:59.761 --> 00:14:04.761
it's a reality because we aren't wise enough to separate covert action from

224
00:14:05.491 --> 00:14:08.040
intelligence gathering. Uh,

225
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.510
but in that same study that they found 36 different cases, uh,

226
00:14:12.511 --> 00:14:16.410
by the Russians and the Soviets, they found 81 different cases, uh,

227
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.220
by the U S and this was published by a Scott Shane in the New York times and

228
00:14:20.221 --> 00:14:24.420
both, uh, the Washington post as well. But this is, this is the thing,

229
00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:29.421
like there is a way to criticize the Russian government's policies without

230
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:36.650
criticizing the Russian people who are ordinary people who just want to have a

231
00:14:37.261 --> 00:14:40.110
happy life. They just want to do better. They want the same things that you do.

232
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.230
Right? And every time people go, Oh, Russia, Russia, Russia,

233
00:14:43.231 --> 00:14:46.050
every time people go, Russia bad, every time they go, Russia's doing this,

234
00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:46.950
they go, Russia's doing that.

235
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:51.350
Russian people who have nothing to do with the government feel implicated that

236
00:14:51.351 --> 00:14:55.880
like, do you feel, uh, like you're in charge of Donald Trump? Like,

237
00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:59.780
do you want to be, uh, have Donald Trump's legacy around your neck?

238
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.680
And then people go, Oh, well, you know, you could overthrow Donald Trump.

239
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.160
You know, you could overthrow Putin. Can you really like, is that how it works?

240
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:12.710
Uh, so yeah, I mean, look, I have, uh, no affiliation.

241
00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:17.050
I have no love for the Russian government. It's not my choice to be here. Um,

242
00:15:17.051 --> 00:15:19.370
and I've made it very clear I would be happy to return home.

243
00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.660
So is there any concern that they would deny you? Visa? I mean, how,

244
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.500
how are you staying there? It's, it's a good question.

245
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:30.220
So I have a permanent residence. People think I'm under silent,

246
00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:33.650
but I'm no longer on her. It's like a, a green card now. Um,

247
00:15:33.651 --> 00:15:36.800
it's gotta be renewed every three years. So yeah, sure.

248
00:15:36.801 --> 00:15:37.970
It's possible they could kick me out.

249
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:41.030
And this was what the story I was telling you about before in Russian media was

250
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.170
they were saying, you know,

251
00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:45.380
the Russian government should take some action against me or I shouldn't be

252
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.630
welcome here or I should go home. Uh,

253
00:15:47.631 --> 00:15:50.150
because why is he criticizing the Russian government,

254
00:15:50.151 --> 00:15:53.700
right when they're the people? Is that like the Russian version of Fox news

255
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:58.580
going to have over there? I don't know enough about Russian media to tell you.

256
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.120
I think it's supposed to be more like a Reuters or associated press,

257
00:16:02.121 --> 00:16:06.890
but the hell if I know. Um, but, uh, the,

258
00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:11.600
the, the, the thing is this, what's the alternative?

259
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.740
Right? Um, yes, the Russian government could screw me,

260
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.960
but they could screw me even if I didn't say anything. Uh,

261
00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:22.550
and so should I shut up and be quiet, uh,

262
00:16:22.551 --> 00:16:26.090
in the face of things that I think are injustices, uh,

263
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.110
because it makes me safer. Well, a lot of pragmatic people would say, yeah,

264
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.110
they say you've done enough. They've said, and you've done your part. You know,

265
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.880
they say whatever, uh, be safe, live long, be happy. Um,

266
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.880
but I didn't come forward to be safe. If I wanted to be safe,

267
00:16:40.881 --> 00:16:45.260
I'd still be sitting in Hawaii making a hell of a lot of money to spy on all of

268
00:16:45.261 --> 00:16:48.350
you. Right? And nobody ever would have known about this.

269
00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:53.090
The system would've gotten worse. Uh, but the system, the world,

270
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:58.100
the future gets worse every day that we don't do something about it.

271
00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.520
Every day that we stay silent about all the injustices we see, uh,

272
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:05.120
the world gets worse. Things get worse. And yeah, it's risky. Yeah,

273
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.510
it's uncomfortable. But that's why we do it.

274
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:11.330
Because if we don't, no one else will.

275
00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:15.830
All those years I was sitting hoping for someone else to come forward and no one

276
00:17:15.831 --> 00:17:20.690
did. Right? That's cause I was waiting for hero. But there are no heroes,

277
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.250
right? There's only heroic decisions.

278
00:17:22.251 --> 00:17:26.060
You are never further than one decision away from making a difference.

279
00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.650
It doesn't matter where there's a big difference.

280
00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:29.150
Doesn't matter if it was a small difference,

281
00:17:29.151 --> 00:17:34.100
because you don't have to save the world by yourself. In fact, you can't.

282
00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.650
All you have to do is lay down one brick.

283
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:41.480
All you have to do is make things a little bit better in a small way so that

284
00:17:41.481 --> 00:17:45.410
other people can lay their brick on top of that or beside the end together,

285
00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.560
step by step, day by day, year by year,

286
00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:53.310
we build foundation of something better, but yet it's not going to be safe,

287
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:58.770
but it doesn't matter because individually it's, it's not,

288
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:03.300
you know, me, whoever you are,

289
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.830
that's the iron man.

290
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:09.870
I don't care if you're the biggest doomsday prepper with cans full of beans, uh,

291
00:18:09.871 --> 00:18:14.220
if the world ends, it's going to affect you. We make things better.

292
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.720
We become safe together. Right? Collectively, that is our strength.

293
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.840
That is the power of civilization. That is the power that shapes the future.

294
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.670
Because even if you make life great for you, you're going to die someday.

295
00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:31.440
You're going to be forgotten. Someday your cans of beans are going to rot.

296
00:18:31.441 --> 00:18:36.240
Some day you can make things safe or uh,

297
00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:38.160
you can be more careful, right?

298
00:18:38.161 --> 00:18:40.980
You can be more clever and there's nothing wrong with that.

299
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.390
But at the end of the day,

300
00:18:42.391 --> 00:18:46.350
you have to recognize if you're trying to eliminate all risks from your life,

301
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.270
what you're actually doing is eliminating all possibility from your life.

302
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.830
You're trying to collapse the universe of outcomes, uh,

303
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.470
such that what you've lost is freedom.

304
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.550
You've lost the ability to act because you are afraid. That's abuse.

305
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.320
That's what got us into this mess. That's a beautiful way to put it.

306
