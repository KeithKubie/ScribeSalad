you are in the Library of Congress.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.190
Has anyone been to the
Library of Congress before?

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.790
&gt;&gt;KAREN JAFFE: A few of you, great.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.090
Welcome back.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.720
And you're in a special
place in the Library

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.450
of Congress called the
Young Readers Center.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.490
I'm Karen Jaffe, I'm director
of the Young Readers Center.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.130
And I'm here to welcome you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.180
for something called,
"kids Euro Festival."

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.550
Here's what that is.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.480
Kids Euro, Euro stands
for European unit.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.500
Which is made up of 28
countries in Europe.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.800
Very far away.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.300
Has anybody heard of Europe?

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.600
&gt;&gt; No.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Okay. Europe is across a very big
ocean, called the Atlantic Ocean.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.730
And these 28 countries have a
festival in Washington every year

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:59.180
for children, just for children,
and they invited special performers

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.960
who come to show you things
they do in their country

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.080 position:56%
and to tell you about their country.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.900
And today the country
is called Luxemburg.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.870
And here's a map and there
are two words up there,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.290
one is the English word
and the other is the --

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.450
I think that's the French word.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.920
But they speak three
languages in Luxemburg.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.720
They speak German, French and
Luxemburgish, [inaudible].

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.570
The other language.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.640
But that's a map of where it is.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:57.580
Okay. So, I'm going to introduce
our special guest who's called the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.160
Drummond from Luxemburg.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.840
&gt;&gt; SVEN KIEFER: I'm doing nothing.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.180
Nowhere, I put my rhythm,
that's not rhythm.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.660
That's not [inaudible].

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.550
It's not [inaudible].

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.860
I was looking for my rhythm.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.260
Rhythm. Rhythm.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.510
No, no, that's still paper.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.370
It's still paper.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.360
Oh, my gosh.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.090
Is there somebody out there?

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.730
You sure, hello?

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.320
Hello? Hello?

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.160
Oh, there's somebody out there and
I do not find my rhythm, no, no.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.770
oh, no, no, no.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.310
somebody's out there.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.970
I have to take a look there.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.820
&gt;&gt; SVEN KIEFER: Hi, guys.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.210

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.510

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.490
Yes? Oh, please come near.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.790

Don't be scared, come
nearer where you will see.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.590
I wanted to show you something.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.890
Do you know what is rhythm?

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.190
&gt;&gt; Me.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.490
&gt;&gt; SVEN KIEFER: you

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.350
No, stay there, everybody
will see it.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.650
do you know rhythm?

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.950
No, no. you don't know who I am.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.860
You do not know who I am.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.540
No. your teacher doesn't
tell you where you know.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.470 position:56%
Wait. You don't know what's my name.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.770
you know my name.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.980
what's my name?

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.060
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.420
&gt;&gt; You don't know.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.500
Your teacher doesn't
tell you the name?

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.800
good job, huh?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.100
Wow, I'm Drummond [inaudible].

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.710
Say hi, Drummond [inaudible]
one time.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.010
Good, okay.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.890 position:56%
Let's go. I want to show you rhythm.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.210
Did you teacher show
you the rhythm one time?

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.510
No. oh, my god, what
did you do there.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.580
Wow, no rhythm at all?

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.980
Nothing? Wow.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.280
But, you see my golden tent?

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.360
Yeah. I think you see that.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.000
So, that's for the teachers now,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.920
when I bring something
out you have to clap.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.870
Do you know how to clap actually?

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.320
Yeah, you know how it works.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.040
Oh, great, good, wow.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.240
I do know where I put my rhythm.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.300 position:56%
That's not rhythm that's stupid box.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.010
No, no, no, no, no.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.250
still. Now, for this
you don't have to clap,

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.800 position:56%
but I wanted to show rhythm, rhythm.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.660
Because rhythm is something
really fantastic.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.440
Rhythm? I think there's
nothing inside, yeah?

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:12.110
I don't know where I put that.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.920 position:56%
Maybe the seat on the bum on rhythm.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.580
Check underneath under
your bum, is there rhythm?

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.880
No. what's here?

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.180

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.480
and there.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.780
Do you have rhythm underneath?

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.100
No. everybody, check it one time.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.050
Good morning, Victoria,
do we have rhythm?

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.680
No. Why? And grownups
people sit there.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.980
Great great.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.280
It's for everybody.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.210
Every act to move your bum

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.810
Oh, you no you do.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.110

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.290
No, no rhythm.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.080
Yeah, you smiling, I'm

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.450
There's no rhythm.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:44.750
Check that please.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.050
Check everybody.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.350
No rhythm.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.840
You sure? Okay, don't move.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.210
What's going on.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.510
The rhythm?

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.450
No. take picture for Facebook.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.050
Oh, my god.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.700
no rhythm at all huh?

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.110
Oh, we didn't check there?

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.620
Is there some rhythm underneath?

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.630
No. maybe I didn't check the bag.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.780
I forgot to check the bag.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.520
Because rhythm is something
[inaudible] This is something.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.680
Don't feel bad.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.020
It's getting boring
with all this paper.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.970
But, oh, my god.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.720
No, no, no, no, no, don't
do it, behind the red line.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.640
Stay behind the red line.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.060
Oh. This is not rhythm.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.770
What's that, you know that?

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.340
It's a piece of a coconut.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.530
Did you show a coconut before?

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.610
No. These teachers,
look at [inaudible].

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.250
It's a coconut.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:53.940
But it's not rhythm.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:59.820
No, no. I would say, okay,
we cannot see a rhythm.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.080
Maybe we can smell it.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.680
does everybody have a nose?

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.310
&gt;&gt; SVEN KIEFER: Everybody,
you're sure?

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.910
Is it clean?

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.120
Yeah. A little bit.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.350
Trying to get a good smell.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.060
[sniffing] somebody smell
something like rhythm.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.360
[kids chattering inaudibly]
You smell the rhythm?

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.860
I do not smell the rhythm.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.160
Do it again.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.460
I come over here.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.290
Let's do it again.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.560
[sniffing] I smell a fart, huh?

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.860
Oh, my god.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.060
oh. But it's not rhythm.

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:41.080
So, I would say, you cannot
see it, you cannot smell it,

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.450
maybe we can listen to it.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.170
You have ears like me?

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.470
That's right.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.770
You know the bubble game?

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.170
&gt;&gt; SVEN KIEFER: I hear nothing.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.930
Nothing at all.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:06.480
So, rhythm, nothing to see,
nothing to smell, nothing --

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.110
I know a game help
us find the rhythm.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:13.780
Please, Congress of Library,
everybody stand up now.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.310
so, be behind the red line.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.610
Go a little bit back.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.910
A little bit in the back.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.210
Everybody needs a little
bit of space.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.510
You need more space.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.810

Okay. you know what is a freeze?

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.700
When you make freeze you make
a cool movement and you stay

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.310
and you don't move anymore.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:28.610
You are frozen, okay.

This farmer came out one
day and he was very angry,

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:29.560
and he was so angry
he came with a saw

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:34.300

cut off the tree.

he made a hole inside.

a big hole inside.
