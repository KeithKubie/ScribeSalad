00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.140
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Good
afternoon and welcome

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.620
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.390
I am Grant Harris.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.440
I am chief of the
European Division.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.120
We are glad you are here for
this event entitled "Words,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.090
Images, and Music: A Dialogue
on Torquato Tasso and the Arts"

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.570
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.890
We sponsor this event in
partnership with the Embassy

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.210
of Italy and the Italian
Cultural Institute here

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.870
in Washington.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.390
Within the Library of Congress,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.280
the European Division
is co-sponsoring

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.730
with the Music Division
and the Rare Book

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.940
and Special Collections
Division,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.840
both of which have provided
really interesting treasures

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.830
that we were able to show
between 2:00 and 3:00 today.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.990
We wish we could keep
them longer, but they have

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.460
to get back to their divisions.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.820
Also co-sponsoring with us is
the Library's John W. Kluge

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.260
Center, which is just in
the rooms next door here.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.890
They've graciously
let us use this room.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.220
We would also like to thank
our wonderful speakers,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.010
Dr. Laura Benedetti of
Georgetown University,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.580
who is originally from
the Abruzzo Region

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.340
in Italy, in central Italy.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.870
And Dr. Peter Lukehart of
the Center for Advanced Study

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.240
in the Visual Arts at the
National Gallery of Art,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.600
a well-known art historian
both in D.C. and abroad.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.060
Today's event celebrates
the birth

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.780
of the Italian Renaissance
author Torquato Tasso,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.420
who was born on March 11 in
1544 in the town of Sorrento

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.610
on the Gulf of Naples.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.380
He was the author
of the epic poem--

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.730
and I'm saying this in English
because I don't have the Italian

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.250
for this or was this in Latin
when it was first written?

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.550
In Italian, okay.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.730
"Jerusalem Delivered,"
that's one

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.030
of the renderings in English.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.090
That's not the only rendering,
but "Jerusalem Delivered."

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.090
Published in 1581, a work based

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.540
on the history of
the First Crusade.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.740
The Library's collections
hold at least 760 items

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.810
in various formats
concerning Torquato Tasso,

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.940
and a good number are English
translations of his main works,

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.210
published in Britain and
in the United States.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.800
We hope you have a pleasant
time at the library today,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.080
and please come back
to use the collections.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.510
The collections really are rich.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.340
The Italian collections
are really incredible here.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.070
Please turn off your cell
phones and recording devices

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.420
for the duration of the program.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.090
Be aware that this
is being recorded

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.450
as a Library of Congress
webcast.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.530
It's not live streaming, but
someday, many weeks from now,

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.950
it will be made available
on our webpages.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.720
And I now give the floor to
our specialist for Italy,

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.030
Lucia Wolf, who has
organized this event today.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.600
It's got lots of moving parts
with all the great items

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.030
that we were able
to show earlier.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.000
Let me say also that
some people have asked

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.610
if those items will
be on display

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.460
in some way in the future.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.780
And there will be at
least a list and Lucia,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.360
I'll let you talk about
this, and you'll mention

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.950
that when you're up here, okay?

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.250
Well, thank you for being here.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.510
I give you Lucia Wolf.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.730
[ Applause ]

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.690
&gt;&gt; Lucia Wolf: So
I won't be long

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.660
because they are
the protagonists.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.700
[laughter] And I'll
cut to the chase.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.790
I had a longer, but
thank you for being here

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.200
for this wonderful occasion.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.130
I thought hosting an event

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.290
to celebrate Torquato Tasso's
birth month would be as good

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.600
as any other occasion
to introduce one

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.650
of the greatest Italian
Renaissance writers

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.400
in our Italian program
repertoire

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.290
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:31.810
And I will mention what Grant
was referring to at the end,

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.590
but before going any further, I
want to thank all my colleagues

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.440
who have made this event
possible and have beared

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.470
with me during the
preparation of this event.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.370
You all know who you are.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.400
And most importantly, I
would like to thank the chief

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.330
of the European Division,
Grant Harris.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.410
Finally, I want to
thank my husband.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.710
Maybe he's here.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.780
Okay. But -- [laughter]
That's okay.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.870
He put up with a lot of
long extra hours of work,

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.580
so I decided to say
thank you to him.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.210
I will not go over the
Library's collections too much,

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.640
because Grant has said most of
what we needed to know today

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.390
about the holdings
for Torquato Tasso.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.580
But I would like to point
out that there are more

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.490
than 400,000 items in
our Italian collections,

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.350
and they are growing at the rate

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.780
of 6,000 new acquisitions
per year.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.720
So it is a very, very
large collection.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.860
If you are interested
in learning more

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.510
about the Italian collections,

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.510
please pick up a card,
my business cards.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.580
Leave an e-mail if you
prefer and don't hesitate

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.780
to contact me, and I will give
you the best orientation I can.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.600
[laughing] I'm still
exploring the collections.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.630
I mean 400,000 items
are quite a few.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.200
We will do many programs
to allow for that also.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.410
These are occasions
for me, by the way,

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.230
to really discover
the collections

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.820
and share what the
bounty we have with you.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.980
So let us move on
to our speakers,

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.220
because we had a
few logistical --

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.070
[laughing] problems
and technical that took

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.980
up some time, and we want to
give them all the time possible.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.470
Dr. Laura Benedetti has taught

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.490
and currently teaches
Italian literature

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.960
at Georgetown University.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.790
She holds a summa cum

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.570

She taught for eight
years at Harvard,

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.960
where she become the John Loeb

Humanities before joining

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.920

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.520
un percorso per la Gerusalemme
liberata," "The Tigress

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.840
in the Snow: Motherhood
and Literature

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.830
in 20th Century Italy," the
edition and English translation

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.350
of Lucrezia Marinella's

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.730
"Esortazioni alle donne e agli
altri," and most recently,

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.690
her first novel,
"Un paese di carta,"

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.510
about which we had a
very vivacious talk here

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.440
at the Library last September.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.010
And if you want to enjoy it, you
can go and watch the webcast.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.250
It's posted online.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.570
So let's move forward.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.410
She has been a guest of
honor at annual meetings

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.940

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.360
as well as the recipient

of the American Association
of Italian Studies.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:16.620
And if you want to consult Dr.
Benedetti's books, we have most

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.690
of them -- I think all of
them -- here at the Library.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:24.990
Our next guest, Dr. Peter
Lukehart, is Associate Dean

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:28.310

He received his Ph.D.

in Early Modern Europe,"
which won the Dibner Award

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.750
He has a longstanding interest

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:26.020
And please go and visit because
it is beautiful, it is amazing.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.580
I went there and I have fond
memories of Accademia di--

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.630

will soon grow to 1665.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.930
[laughter]

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.230
&gt;&gt; Lucia Wolf: Wonderful.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.530
[laughter] I loved going there.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.150
In 2015, he contributed an
essay entitled "The Practice

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.570
and Pedagogy of Drawing in
the Accademia di San Luca"

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:46.680
to the volume -- I do
not really speak German,

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.370
but Lernt Zeichnen!

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:54.380
Techniken zwischen
Kunst und Wissenschaft.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.680
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart:
Beautiful.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.980
&gt;&gt; Lucia Wolf: Okay.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.760
Did I do okay?

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.640
[laughter] The editors are Maria
Heilmann, Nino Nanobashvili,

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.860
Ulrich Pfisterer, and Tobias
Teutenberg for the exhibition

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.000
at the University of Heidelberg.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.030
And I think I got to the end.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:19.090
I wanted everybody to know what
wonderful speakers we have here

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.530
today, and this is
really a rare occasion

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.970
at the Library of Congress.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.770
Please enjoy.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:32.040
[ Applause ]

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.340
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti:
Thank you very much, Lucia,

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.390
for your kind introduction
and for all of your hard work

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.180
to make this event possible.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:39.920
And thanks -- I also want

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.090
to extend my thanks
to all our sponsors.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:48.360
I also want to of course
thank Peter Lukehart,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.230
who was a brilliant
partner in this adventure.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.050
And I also want to
remember Alberto Manai,

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.700
the former director of the
Italian Cultural Institute,

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:00.280
who first introduced
us to one another

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.900
and who was a very
strong supporter

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.320
of this kind of collaboration.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.350
And of course, thank you
to all of you for deciding

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.470
to spend this Friday
afternoon with us.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:10.770
Thank you.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:14.910
I'm particularly pleased to
see some of my students here.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.770
I know how hard it is
to leave our campus.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.690
[laughter] So thank you, I
appreciate your being here.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:25.810
And I recommend to all of you
to get close to the screens,

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.760
because the screens are not very
big and we are going to be --

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.280
I will be quoting passages.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.930
Peter will be going through
the details of some images.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:38.010
So please find a good spot.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.930
This is a dialogue between
literature and the arts,

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.540
so Peter and I thought it
would be very appropriate

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:50.070
that our presentations
themselves were a dialogue.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:52.720
So instead of having two
separate presentations,

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.700
we had one single
presentation and we'll go back

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.360
and forth discussing
features and episodes

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.850
of "Jerusalem Delivered."

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.410
We also thought that,
unfortunately,

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:09.610
Tasso doesn't quite enjoy
the same name recognition

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:13.720
as some other Italian writers
such as Dante or Machiavelli,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:19.560
so we thought to make this event
accessible to anybody interested

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.940
in the subject matter,

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:27.340
regardless of their previous
exposure to the poet.

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.110
Anyway, chances are that
if you go to museums

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:35.410
or if you enjoy music, chances
are you have indeed been exposed

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.710
to Tasso.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:42.330
A few years ago, a journalist
from the Washington Post,

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:47.280
Philip Kennicott wrote
a very beautiful article

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.540
on "Torquato Tasso, a Poet
Both Obscure and Ubiquitous."

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.390
And he said precisely, if
you had been to a museum

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.220
or to a concert of
Italian madrigals,

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.150
you know Tasso's
characters well,

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.420
even if you had never heard of
the poet whose former fame is

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:04.300
as astonishing as
his current oblivion.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.520
[laughter] And to give you
an amusing example, I think,

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:12.680
of this phenomenon,
I chose a brochure

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:17.270
that the Baltimore Museum of
Art created to illustrate one

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:22.170
of its masterpieces from
the Rinaldo and Armida.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.960
The Baltimore Museum of
Art put together a brochure

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:30.380
to foster appreciation
of art in children,

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.640
and so the children recognize
the various characters.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.280
And there, at the bottom,
you can see it says

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.230
that the painting was
inspired by a poem

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.300
that was popular in the 1600s.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.600
It tells the story from
the time of the Crusades.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.860
Well, that poem is precisely
the "Gerusalemme liberata,"

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.230
or "Jerusalem Delivered,"
Tasso's masterpiece.

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:57.500
So there you have it, Tasso is
surreptitiously entering the

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:02.630
minds of innocent children
visiting the Baltimore Museum

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.930
of Art.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.270
[laughter] Anyway,
it is kind of ironic

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.470
that Tasso would be
remembered mainly

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.950
for beautiful love episodes,
such as Rinaldo and Armida

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.620
because that is precisely
what they wanted to avoid.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:17.260
[laughter] In fact, Tasso
wrote after the rediscovery

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:25.940
of Aristotle's poetics, when the
idea of the unity of the time

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.690
and space that Aristotle
had described

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.970
in Greek tragedy had
become essential,

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.940
even in the making
of [inaudible] poem.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:42.940
And so Tasso wrote that
his poem not only had unity

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.500
of [inaudible] is the
story of the First Crusade,

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.220
but also unity of
agent, he said.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.340
There is one main character,
the Christian [inaudible]

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:57.630
with Goffredo at its head
and Rinaldo as it's right.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.500
So essentially this is what
"Jerusalem Delivered" is,

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.820
is a poem about the story of --

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:08.500
it's a fictional account
of the First Crusade.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.710
So there's a very strong
tension towards the goal.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.000
The first [inaudible] and
again, perhaps if you want

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.870
to come a little closer to
the screen, the first octet

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:26.320
of the second line mentions
the great tomb of the Savior,

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:31.140
so the final goal
of the mission,

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.680
and the epilogue --
[pause] -- sorry.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.520
I'll be using Anthony Esolen's
beautiful translation throughout

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.700
the presentation.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.630
And the epilogue also
mentions the very last line

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.650
of the great tomb.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:50.630
So Jerusalem is the goal.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:54.550
Jerusalem as both a
concrete place, a city,

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:59.230
but also the promise
of civil happiness

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.800
and a symbol of eternal bliss.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.430
So not an easy thing to
capture when painters tried

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:11.640
to give the representation
of this idea.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.940
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart:
Thank you.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.870
Okay. Well, before
I begin my remarks,

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:23.100
I wanted to say a very warm
and deep thanks are necessary

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.860
for Lucia Wolf who helped
to organize this event,

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.740
and to my partner Laura.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:31.020
This is, in a lot of
ways, a dream come true,

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:33.040
to be able to work
with a dear colleague

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.800
who knows so much about Tasso.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.870
In the first glimpse
of Jerusalem

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.170
and Bernardo Castellos'
illustrations

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:48.300
for the 1590 Bartoli edition,
we see a bustling port

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.010
with anachronistic ships.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:56.950
In the second canto, Castellos
represents Jerusalem as a kind

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.780
of medieval walled city, more
in keeping with the hill towns

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.980
of Italy than anything
in the Holy Land.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.920
He is consistent, however,

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.490
in always depicting a centrally
planned church that must stand

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.730
for the church of
the Holy Sepulchre,

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.590
which is no longer
free-standing as it was

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:18.070
and as is often depicted here

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.900
in a 16th century
hand-colored engraving.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.520
But rather, it's now enmeshed
in the walls of previous

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.190
and subsequent periods
of building.

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:29.070
What Castello has more
accurately communicated is

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.050
that Jerusalem is a walled city

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:34.260
and that the Holy sepulchre is
a polygonal temple surmounted

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.560
by a large dome.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.900
And we'll see that
over and over again.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.630
Similarly, the trees
and plantings

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.540
in the surrounding landscapes
are not palms, acacias,

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.290
cypresses, and cedars, but
the deciduous varieties found

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.590
in Europe.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:52.170
This holds true for
Castello's contemporaries,

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:56.290
such as Sisto Badalocchio,
here in a scene from "Erminia."

00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:00.410
We'll come back to this later,
but I wanted to emphasize here

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:05.240
that whereas Castello
indicates a pastoral scene

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.300
with the simplest of
elements, a rustic wooden fence

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.280
with a clear view
of Jerusalem behind.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:15.810
Guercino provides
instead a vast landscape,

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:20.010
quite apart from the city, with
all manner of flora and fauna.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:25.260
Again, of a type found more
in Italy than the Holy Land.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.900
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti:
Beautiful.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.200
Well, the road to Jerusalem
is long though, and if we read

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.730
that first stanza more closely,

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.010
we realize that there
is a problem.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.920
There is the effort that
Goffredo, the leader,

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:46.190
has to make in order to bring
together his compagni errare,

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:49.870
or wandering companions
or straying men.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:52.860
Errare is a very
powerful word in Italian

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.000
that conveys two
notions that I'll express

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.500
by two different
verbs in English.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:02.090
Errare means both
to wander, to roam,

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:06.640
but also to be mistaken,
to be wrong, to err.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.910
So in other words, a special
deviation from the path

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:14.620
that leads to Jerusalem
entails a more perversion.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.920
But there is more.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:23.000
Not only were Goffredo's
companions wandering off,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.420
but also the narrator
presents himself as a

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:31.200
"peregrino errante," so
a wanderer gone astray.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.590
And I would say not
only the characters

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:37.390
and the narrator are
always on the verge

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:43.080
of losing the right path, but
the poem itself, that it seems

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.400
on the verge of becoming
a different kind of poem,

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.170
a love poem, according to Tasso.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:52.720
And this becomes
already very clear

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.650
in the first episode we're going
to discuss, the episode called

00:20:58.650 --> 00:20:59.950
"Olindo and Sofronia."

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.320
The story is quite
complex, so I'm going

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.160
to try resume it in a few words.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.160
Aladine, the terrible
ruler of Jerusalem,

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.600
suspects that the Christians
have stolen a sacred image

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.350
and threatens to kill them all.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:19.310
Sofronia, a very modest
Christian woman, accuses herself

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:23.520
of the test in order to
spare the other Christians.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:28.070
So she's sent to the stake, and
this is a very important detail

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:32.420
for our purposes, her veil
is taken away from her.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.720
But at this point, Olindo,

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:39.420
who has been secretly loving
Sofronia, accuses himself

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.850
of the offense, at which
point Aladine gets really mad

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:46.610
and says, well, then I'm
going to kill both of them.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:51.030
So they are taken to the stake
and they are tied back to back,

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:54.210
at which point, Olindo
starts this lament.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.840
And I hope you can
read the translation.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.160
I'll read the Italian.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:48.070
[ Reading in Italian ]

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.930
There are already so
many characteristics

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:53.530
of Tasso's poetry
in this passage.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.540
First, I'll say the
Baroque tendency

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.540
to turn the metaphorical
into the literal.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:04.250
So the bonds that Olindo hoped
would tie him and Sofronia --

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.590
the metaphorical
bonds of love --

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.240
are turned into the
very harsh ropes

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.910
that are literally
tying them together.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:16.610
The fire that Olindo hoped
would enflame both hearts turns

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:21.110
into the very real fire that
is about to kill both of them.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.410
So there is that.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.260
There is also Olindo's
frustrated eroticism,

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:29.150
which I think is very clear
in the last passage I read.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:34.100
And there is Tasso's passion
for contrast and opposition.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:38.660
In fact, Sofronia, when Sofronia
speaks, he uses a completely --

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.180
she -- she uses a
completely different tone,

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:46.120
and basically tells Olindo
to stop thinking about lips

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.750
and breasts and all of that.

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.920
[laughter] And to
repent and turn his heart

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:56.530
over to eternal life that
they are about to achieve.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.760
And I would say also
that this is an example,

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.810
this episode is an example of
Tasso's musical sensibility.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:08.280
Because you really can imagine
this on a stage or as an opera.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:13.210
Because first, you have Olindo,
the lad broke his sorrows

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:17.300
in this cry, so a
very high voice.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.960
And Sofronia, who
replies tenderly

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.930
with words of good advice.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.970
And then you have the
choir that joins in,

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.430
but even the choir is
divided into groups.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:31.870
You have the Muslims, here the
crowd of pagans raised a cry,

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.150
so they are very moved by
the fate of the two lovers,

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:38.390
or the two martyrs almost.

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:40.530
And the Christians
were a little afraid

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:43.440
by the difficult
situation, so they quietly

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.170
and low, the Christians wept.

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:49.070
So even there, you have
two different tombs.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:53.070
And finally, you even have
the effect of the audience.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.800
A something, who can
say what, unusual, soft,

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.360
into the hard heart
of their ruler crept.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.490
"Un non so che d'inusitato,"
who can say what.

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:04.970
Je ne sais pas quoi, which
is really Torquato Tasso's

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:10.100
trademark, and is a really
very prominent in this passage.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.680
I should say, I should add that
the episode has a happy ending

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.350
because Clorinda, the Muslim
warrior woman, arrives

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.800
and she senses, she
understands that Olindo

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.230
and Sofronia are innocent.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:26.300
She convinces Aladine
to release them.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.870
And so the two can get married,
which is excellent for Olindo,

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.290
not so great for Sofronia.

00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:37.560
[laughter] In fact, the last
line says she will not scorn

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.990
to spend her life with
Olindo, which is not exactly,

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:43.290
you know, a warm [inaudible].

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:44.770
[laughter]

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:46.890
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart:
Well, we'll see the way

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:48.770
that the artists interpret this.

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:51.120
[laughter] I think
they warm her up.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.220
[ Laughter ]

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.320
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti:
Oh, yeah, you're right.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.620
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart: Okay.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.700
So this scene provides, in a
nutshell, the principle themes

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.630
of "Jerusalem Iiberata," but
the Christian maiden, Sofronia,

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.250
and the Christian soldier,
Olinda, who loves her,

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.750
have sacrificed themselves.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.290
Sofronia, in order to protect
her people from Aladino's wrath,

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:17.150
and Olindo in order to
protect his paramour.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:20.580
The leader of the Muslim
forces, Aladino, instead orders,

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.290
as we've just heard, both of
them to be burned at the stake.

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:27.560
And just at the moment
when the fires are lit

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.290
and all seems lost, Clorinda,
the fearless Muslim warrior --

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.500
and I'm going to be using the
word Muslim because I don't want

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.780
to have quite the
sense of antagonism

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.430
that is inherent
in Tasso himself.

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:43.450
I don't want to start
range wars over that.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:46.710
[laughter] In any case,
so that's my vocabulary.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.930
And she will intervene
and spares them.

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:53.530
In the earliest illustrated
edition by Bernardo Castello,

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:55.670
and here -- is Diane
DeGrazia still here?

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.710
I'm going to just make
a shout-out to her.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:00.620
She was one of my earliest
mentors and knows so much

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.720
about these prints, and I still
go back to her work all the time

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:08.010
for information about the
prints of the Carracci.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:14.230
In any case, in this first
edition that had engravings both

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:17.760
by Giacomo Franco and
Agostino Carracci.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.240
In this image preceding the
second canto, Castello focuses

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.110
on Goffredo and his troops
and their encampment.

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:28.200
By contrast, the scene of the
near martyrdoms of Sofronia

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:32.680
and Olindo is relegated to
a small corner of the plaza.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.910
Do we see that?

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.430
Let me see.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.020
It's not coming out.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.920
It's in the walled area.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.220
There's a very faint --

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.690
I'm sorry, kind of
an oval around it.

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.260
Can you see that in
the upper right corner?

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:51.370
That's how tiny it is, what's
going on in the background.

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.490
Okay? [laughter] One could
easily overlook this section,

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:56.770
and I did myself the
first time I looked at it,

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:59.320
which is shown here
as a lesser episode

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.430
within the greater narrative.

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.170
If you look carefully, however,
you see that Castello does

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.650
in fact illustrate the
very moment when Olindo

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.640
and Sofronia are at the stake.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:13.030
The fire's lit and Clorinda
appears in the nick of time.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:17.900
In the third canto, however,
Castello chose instead

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.020
to highlight the first
violent encounter

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.550
between Clorinda and Tancred.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:24.020
And you see her here with
her shield over her head.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.910
She's a little bit to
the left of center.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:33.150
So their first meeting
in battle is here.

00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:36.320
As Laura has explained,
Tasso describes the loss

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.840
of Sofronia's veil and
thus, of her defenses

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.060
against the false charge
of the theft of the icon.

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:45.360
Most artists, from Castello
to Cochin which was also

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.470
in the little exhibition
out here, shows Sofronia

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.540
as modestly dressed,
but lacking a veil.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.870
Thus, I was surprised to
find the Neapolitan painter,

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:59.030
Mattia Preti, depicted
both Sofronia

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:04.190
And Olindo completely nude here
in the version at the Getty,

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.940
and utterly humiliated
and defenseless

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:10.390
until Clorinda arrives
majestically on her steed

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:13.020
to interrupt the
lighting of the pyre.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.820
A moment that could
have ended in martyrdom

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:18.800
and sacrifice turns
instead to one of salvation.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.770
And rather than being consumed
by the flames, as proto-martyrs

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:26.780
to the cede of Jerusalem,
Olindo and Sofronia will be free

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.540
to enjoy the flames of passion.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:34.170
So I think maybe Olindo got
his wish here at this time.

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.320
[laughter] The sensual
and emotional intensity

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:42.150
of Preti's painting falls away
in the print from Didot edition,

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:43.800
illustrated by Cochin.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.050
And I'm putting them side by
side, where the forlorn Olindo

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:50.850
and Sofronia are fully dressed
in what could be confused

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:53.630
with 18th century
pastoral shepherd costumes.

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:55.690
[laughter]

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.730
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti: This is
all very beautiful, of course,

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:01.250
but one may wonder
whether an episode

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:04.550
like this really should have
a place in the Christian act

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:07.400
that Tasso is trying to build.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.730
And when Tasso started
circulating the manuscript,

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:12.960
the readers were puzzled.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.830
They thought that the episode
was introduced too early

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.130
in the poem.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:18.430
It's only the second canto.

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.790
They thought it did not
have any link whatsoever

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:22.090
with the main action.

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:25.060
They thought it was too lyrical

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:27.230
and too sensual,
as we have seen.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:28.570
And they thought that the end

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.220
and the happy conjugal
ending was contrived.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:37.350
And so Tasso himself, in his
letters, he goes back and forth

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:40.390
between defending his creation

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:43.030
and acknowledging its
flaws and its limits.

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:47.330
In the meantime, he
becomes a little restless.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:50.830
Perhaps his mental health
starts to disappear a bit.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:53.660
And for reasons that are
not completely clear,

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.410
he is imprisoned in an asylum.

00:30:55.410 --> 00:31:01.170
And here, you can see the
rendering of Eugene Delacroix,

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:08.010
"Tasso in the Asylum" from 1839.

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:13.770
Tasso was imprisoned in 1579,

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:19.900
and he will not regain his
freedom until seven years later.

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:24.020
And when it becomes clear that
Tasso would stay in the asylum

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.860
for a while, the people who
had this manuscript decided

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.550
to publish it against his will.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.050
And Tasso never endorsed
any of the editions

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:36.580
of "Jerusalem Delivered"
that came out.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:39.340
In fact, for the rest of his
life, he continued to work

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:44.430
on the poem, trying to
get his poem the shape

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.560
that he really thought was
fitted for a Christian epic.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:53.370
And in 1593, so two years before
his death, he finally published

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:57.550
"Jerusalem Conquered,"
"Gerusalemme conquistata."

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:58.850
I'm making the English title

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:02.890
up because it's never been
translated into English.

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:05.900
This, Tasso wrote, is the poem

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.750
for which I want
to be remembered.

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.530
This is the heavenly Jerusalem,

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:13.350
while "Jerusalem Delivered"
is the earthly Jerusalem.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:17.430
And Tasso died in 1595, so only
two years after the publication

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:19.150
of "Gerusalemme conquistata."

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:24.130
And perhaps he was spared the
last insult, the realization

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:25.930
that the poem for
which he wanted

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:29.340
to be remembered will
never manage to replace

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.250
"Jerusalem Delivered"
in the hearts

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:37.750
and the minds of this public.

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:40.580
So the editorial history

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.360
of "Jerusalem Delivered"
is quite complex.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.660
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart:
Thank you.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.170
Having fought with censors for
years, as we've just learned,

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:58.690
upon the reluctant publication
of "Gerusalemme" in 1581,

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:01.040
Tasso had a best
seller on his hands.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.820
Not only was his epic poem
immediately famous and printed

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.350
in multiple editions,

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:08.360
it had been published
during his lifetime

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.660
with various commentaries,

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.130
and soon thereafter,
with illustrations.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.560
It was analogous to
getting a movie deal

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.180
for an early modern author.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.250
The illustrated editions
both acknowledged

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:20.600
and expanded the
author's renown.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.230
At the same time, Tasso's
"Gerusalemme" become the subject

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:28.010
of withering criticism from his
contemporaries, most damningly

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:31.100
from the members of the Academia
della Crusca in Florence.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.850
I am illustrating
here one of the books

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:37.440
from the pro-Tasso camp
by Lorenzo Giacomini,

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.270
a member of the Academia
degli Alterati.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:44.130
But even Galileo weighed
in on this matter of the

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:47.990
"Gerusalemme," but
he was against Tasso.

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.880
And yet this critical
discussion, however unsettling

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:54.430
to the poet, also served
to trumpet his fame.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:58.280
We also witness the
significance of Tasso's success

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.330
in the jealousy of other poets,
who hoped, usually vainly,

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:06.250
to embark on a similar
course toward fame.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:10.720
Tasso's contemporary, Gabriello
Chiabrera, for example,

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.660
wrote to the artist Bernardo
Castello, who sent him a copy

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:18.510
of the 1590 edition
of the "Gerusalemme"

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:20.770
that he had illustrated,
as we've now been looking

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:26.250
at many times, and expressed
these co-mingled ideas.

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.930
"For the gift of
the "Gerusalemme,"

00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:30.870
I offer infinite thanks,

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:35.040
for I see in the book excellent
figures of poetry and painting.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:38.170
I, who have great affection
for Tasso, hold this book

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:41.140
in my hands at every
hour, thus at every hour,

00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:44.420
I will be in the presence of
your affection and your genius.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:48.580
But about your compliments
for my Amedeide,

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.740
I thank you for the sweet
inducement to write poetry.

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.750
Nonetheless, I could not
hope to accomplish it,

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:59.890
nor even could I hope to achieve
such honor, or more precisely,

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:03.310
I could not accept it,
being that I am, by nature,

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:06.100
an enemy of presumption."

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.680
Evidently, however, Chiabrera
got over his aversion

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.110
to presumption, for
about a decade later,

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:17.210
he wrote to Castello to ask for
a frontispiece for the Amedeide.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:21.320
And to discuss, or can
be surprised at all,

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.900
the details for illustrations
of his epic poem

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.550
that was published in 1620.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:29.530
These anecdotes point
to the fact that Tasso's

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.540
"Gerusalemme" was a text
believed by literatti

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.250
and artists from the
moment of its publication,

00:35:35.250 --> 00:35:39.450
second to an important
cultural reality of the period.

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:43.640
Poets and painters had occasion
to correspond and relatedly

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:47.420
that poets and painters took
inspiration from one another.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.790
Further, the special
relationships that existed

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:52.830
between artists, including
musicians, as we'll see,

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.950
an poets, often result in
some of the most interesting

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.850
and influential collaborations
in our shared culture.

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:04.480
Such was the case for Castello,
who was introduced to Tasso

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:10.520
in 1576, after "Gerusalemme"
had been completed as a text,

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.870
but before it was
ever published.

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:18.580
In May 1586, Tasso wrote a
letter that Castello had --

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.360
in his letter, that Castello
had passed through Ferrara

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.160
on his way back from
Venice and left with him --

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.350
that is, with Tasso --
a series of drawings.

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:29.850
We see some of Castello's
drawings here.

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:32.480
I'm not sure they were ever
the same ones that were

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.110
in Tasso's hands, but
they're from the right period.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:38.550
Relating to my poem, as he said.

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:40.380
Though it is doubtful,
as I said,

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:42.600
these are the exact drawings,

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.650
they show that there's
a cordial friendship

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.420
between the artist and the poet.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:50.240
More importantly, these
exchanges cemented the decision

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:54.040
to have Castello's drawings
included in a new luxury edition

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.890
of the "Gerusalemme,"
published by Bartoli in 1590.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:01.070
We do not have detailed
critical responses from Tasso,

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:03.380
but in a letter from
their mutual friend,

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:07.190
Donangelo Grillo --
Angelo, that is, sorry.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:11.190
The poet spoke frankly about
the process of co-creation.

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:12.490
And I'm quoting here.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:15.250
"With regards to my book, I
have not changed my opinion.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.610
It would not be necessary to
change many of the figures

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.440
by Castello, who is faster
at creating the drawings

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.150
than I am at dealing with them.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:24.650
Nonetheless, his drawing
must be similar to the idea

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:26.700
that I have envisioned for it."

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.630
So he really wanted there to
be some kind of consonances.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:34.320
I think this is an interesting
kind of irony in the fact

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.700
that he's simultaneously not
wanting it to be published,

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.520
but wanting to have his
hands in whatever comes out,

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.040
maybe a new story
to be told later.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.500
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti:
Yes, yes.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.800
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart:
Although there is a slight sense

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.850
of reprimand in Tasso's
statement

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:51.030
because Castello is getting
ahead of him, by and large,

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:53.090
he liked the figures and
the artist's conception

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:54.780
of the scenes to be illustrated.

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.170
The existence of these
fragmentary notes suggest

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.450
that Tasso and Castello
conducted a frequent

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:02.190
and candid correspondence,
now lost.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:05.210
The above letter bespeaks
an intimate collaboration

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:08.100
between the poet and the
artist that began in earnest

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.520
around 1586 and continued
at least

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:14.010
through the publication in 1590.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:15.930
Furthermore, it points
to the centrality

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.520
of the Genoise literary
and artistic culture

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:22.320
in the publication of the
early editions of Tasso.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.710
For it was in Genoa, too,
that the physician illiterato,

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:29.480
named Giulio Guastavini,
wrote his anotatsioni,

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.720
that is his commentaries on
the "Gerusalemme," which helped

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.420
to redirect the argument
about Tasso's place

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.480
in the literary pantheon
from that of a rival

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:43.260
to his contemporary ariosto, to
that of a rival of the ancients,

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.500
that of Homer and Virgil.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:50.170
Together, Castello, Guastavini,
and the publisher, Bartoli,

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.650
increased Tasso's fame
throughout Europe.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:56.980
On a recent trip to Genoa,
I had the opportunity

00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:01.070
to examine two examples of the
first edition, one of which

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:04.800
from canto quinto,
has a little dingbat,

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.140
and that's why the
arrow is there.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:09.680
At the end you'll see
in pen next to it.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:15.520
And so canto quinto and
canto quinto are reversed.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.950
So this must be from one
of the very earliest,

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:21.810
earliest editions, before
it was in its final form.

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:25.640
And as we see here,
the images are flipped.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.400
The sharp details
and the rich ink

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.450
of the advanced copy gives some
sense of the original appearance

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:32.750
of these illustrations.

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.460
And it's just in
pristine condition.

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:38.390
I recommend your going there.

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:42.210
Washington too, as you've seen
in the exhibition, is fortunate

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:46.260
to have an outstanding
exemplar of the first edition

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:49.840
in the Library of Congress'
Rosenwald collection.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:53.120
In addition to the outstanding
quality of the text and images,

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.970
to which we will make frequent
reference in the course

00:39:56.970 --> 00:40:00.630
of our dialogue, the Rosenwald
edition is ruled throughout.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.760
I wanted you to see this.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.360
It's very interesting
and I'd be happy

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.220
to hear what people
think about it.

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:10.120
Close looking at the lines of
the ruling and those of the text

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:14.060
and prints suggest to me that
they were intended as guides

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.470
for the printing process.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:20.390
And if this is true, this would
make the Rosenwald volume also

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:23.010
one of the earliest in
the succession of copies

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:25.110
that proceeded the release

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:28.460
of "Gerusalemme" to
a reading public.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.750
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti:
In order to move

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:39.060
from the earthly
Jerusalem to the celestial,

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.480
heavenly Jerusalem,
Tasso was merciless

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:45.150
in eliminating the episodes
that had been very successful,

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:48.700
but they did not correspond
to his idea of the form.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:54.650
And so Olinda and Sofronia
is one of those episodes,

00:40:54.650 --> 00:41:00.200
so in this [inaudible] just
eliminated it from his poem.

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:05.210
[laughter] Which is too bad,
because also Sofronia is one

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:10.740
of the very few Christian
women in "Jerusalem Delivered."

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.420
This is a striking
feature of the poem.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:18.000
The two different sides
are differentiated,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.600
not only in terms of
religion, but also of gender.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.770
Apart from Sofronia in
"Jerusalem Delivered,"

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:30.630
there is only another minor
female character, Guilepe,

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:34.280
was also led to the theme
of marriage, and that's it.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.850
Apart from that, it's
exclusively a male only.

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:45.460
On the contrary, women are some
of the most important characters

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:51.690
on the Muslim side or the
pagan side, as Tasso said,

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:54.420
which creates a very
strong attraction

00:41:54.420 --> 00:42:01.290
between the two groups, and
many vital areas, many episodes

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:06.200
in which the rules of
love, the laws of love,

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:10.000
prevail over the laws of war.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.180
And so it's very
interesting, you know,

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:15.320
how these two groups
are differentiated also

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.620
in visual terms.

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:17.920
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart:
Absolutely, right.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.450
Which is what I will
be talking about next.

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.720
Beginning again in these images
with the Bartoli edition,

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.980
Castello made several easily
identifiable differences

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.290
between the Muslim and
Christian soldiers.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:33.400
In the vast Cecil B.
DeMille panoramas that we see

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.540
of the battlefield, Castello
clearly marks the Muslim

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:40.190
soldiers as wearing turbans,
carrying rectangular shields,

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.970
usually with a crescent moon,

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:45.460
and occasionally bearing
a large moustache.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:47.930
The Christians are shown
with heavy metal helmets

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:51.640
and metal armor in the form of
cuirass, with shoulder guards

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:55.060
or at least a breast plate
protecting their thighs

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:59.090
in an ancient style
leather skirt.

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:01.440
Their legs and knees
are otherwise bear,

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.840
and on their feet, they
wear Roman style breeves.

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.820
In doing a bit of
research on armor,

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:09.670
I learned that during
the First Crusade,

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:13.180
soldiers would more
typically have worn chainmail.

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:17.850
Plate armor was only
introduced in the 13th century.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:21.010
So for both the poorly
protected Muslim troops

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:23.430
and the Christian
three-quarter covered soldiers,

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:25.930
anachronisms abound.

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:27.620
Also imprecisions.

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:29.930
However, Castello succeeds
in allowing the viewer

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:31.550
to scan the armies and figure

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:35.140
out which side they
represent very quickly.

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:38.800
The women are sometimes
shown in full armor.

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.590
Here we see Clarinda and
Armida in different sides.

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:45.960
But at other times, they wear
long, flowing skirts and gowns,

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:50.470
as we'll see soon enough with
our discussion of Armida.

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:53.850
These anomalies could be seen
as either breaches of decorum

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:57.780
or verisimilitude and
the Aristotelian unities,

00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:02.030
or as necessary visual evidence
that discloses identity in order

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:07.070
to preserve the greater
integrity of the narrative.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:10.410
There's another film version
by Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia,

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:16.760
I wanted to share with you, in
this wonderful poster from 1957.

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.820
This clearly, we know
exactly what we're looking at.

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:23.970
And I recommend it to you
as well worth a binge watch.

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:26.430
[laughter] In addition
to the poster,

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:29.490
there's some other
film stills online,

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:33.080
and here we see Cinecitta's
version of a swords

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.040
and sandals extravaganza.

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:39.700
The stereotypes of the Muslim
soldier need no comment.

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.820
Of course, these notions of
difference, whether gender based

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:46.240
or cultural, also implicated
both readers and viewers

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.060
in the early modern period.

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.710
The masking of the
Islamic soldiers as a vast,

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:56.590
undifferentiated army, for
instance, lessens one's empathy

00:44:56.590 --> 00:44:59.980
for the individual who
might be captured, banished,

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:01.280
or worse, slaughtered.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:06.550
And many times, people are said
to be torn to pieces or cut

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:08.920
to pieces in the narrative.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.900
Equally interesting, as Laura
has pointed out, is that women

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.200
in the "Gerusalemme" tend to
be the characters who best

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:20.650
and most effectively disguise
themselves in order to cross

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:25.650
over between religions,
cultures, and amorous pursuits.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.420
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti: Yes.

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:32.620
As an example of the love
that unites members of the --

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:36.380
or at least tries
to unite members

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:39.380
of the two opposite groups,
we may look no further

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:43.030
than the episode of
Erminia among the shepherds.

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:47.830
Erminia is a Muslim queen who
had been captured by Tancredi,

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:50.440
a Christian knight,
and later released.

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:53.600
But only literally
released, as Tasso says,

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:56.970
because metaphorically, she's
still a prisoner of Tancredi,

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:59.840
because she has fallen
in love with him.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.310
And so although she's now
safe within Jerusalem,

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:06.550
she longs to be with
Tancredi, so she ventures out.

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:10.980
But in order to venture out, she
needs to steal Clorinda's armor,

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:12.410
so we see this other theme

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:17.780
of mistaken identities,
identity confusion.

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:23.670
And so she ventures out,
but two guards see her.

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:27.780
They think she's Clorinda,
and they start chasing her.

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.240
So she runs away,
she gallops away,

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.910
and then when she's finally
exhausted, she dismounts

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:36.050
from the horse and
she falls asleep.

00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:40.810
And when she wakes up, she
wakes up in a different poem.

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:43.830
[laughter] And as
this passage again --

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:47.510
I hope you can read
the translation.

00:46:47.510 --> 00:47:25.040
[ Reading in Italian ]

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:28.050
So notice that, first of all,

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:32.400
now Erminia reveals
her true identity.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.590
She's not a warrior,
she's a woman.

00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:40.850
But notice also that the
landscape around Jerusalem,

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:44.600
that had been described by
Tasso, is a desert, essentially,

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.520
now becomes the setting
for a [inaudible].

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:51.130
It is literally a different
poem with the shepherds

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:54.660
who play and sing tunes.

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.920
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart: That's
a great segue, thank you.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.810
[laughter] And as mentioned
earlier, and just now,

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:04.460
pastoral landscapes became one
of the most believed settings

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:07.440
for 17th century
artists and litterati.

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.930
Thus, the episode of Erminia

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:13.610
and the shepherds is a
frequent subject from Tasso

00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:15.460
in prints and paintings.

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:18.490
In addition to the leafy
and abundant landscapes,

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:20.690
artists were drawn to
Tasso's description

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:22.330
of two compelling themes,

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:24.270
the sound of the
children playing pipes

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:25.990
that attracted Erminia
in the first place

00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:29.510
to the shepherds' home and the
quick succession of emotions

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:33.300
that the young boys and
their father experience

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:34.600
when they first see her.

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.940
You'll see, it's very
minimally understandable,

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:39.580
but if you know the poem,

00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:41.860
you understand there's a
little [inaudible] moment here

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:43.950
where they're scared,
they don't know.

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:45.720
They think she is a warrior.

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:49.300
Okay? And at this point,

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:55.040
her identity is completely
hidden beneath Clorinda's armor

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:57.840
and they are sore afraid.

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.260
The minute that Erminia
removes her helmet, however,

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:03.760
the shepherds are put at ease,
and then entreat her to remain

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.900
with them, and she's tempted.

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.320
This scene finds
many interpreters,

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:15.270
including Geurchino -- [pause]
Sisto Badalocchio, and others.

00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:19.590
I wanted to make certain that
you would at least be introduced

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:22.810
to this clever reimagining
of this scene

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:26.800
by the Florentine artist Santi
di Tito, as a family portrait.

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:30.170
Here, the mother is Erminia,
the father is the shepherd,

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:33.020
and the three children
are the pipers.

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:36.210
Further, I wanted to bring to
your attention something closer

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:38.890
at hand, at the National
Gallery of Art.

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:42.080
We are fortunate to have two
grand 18th century canvases

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.750
from a Venetian palace
painted by the brothers Antonio

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:50.400
and Gian Francesco Guardi,
one depicting Erminia

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.500
and the shepherds
and the other Carlo

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.960
and Ubaldo encounter the sirens
while searching for Rinaldo,

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.580
a scene that we'll
come up to next.

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:04.530
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti:
Erminia has [inaudible].

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:09.460
Erminia was one of Tasso's
most original creations,

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:10.760
starting with the name.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.060
Tasso invented the name Erminia.

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:19.010
And yet, as you can
imagine, when Tasso went back

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:22.520
to his poem, he thought
that there was no place

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:26.350
for this [inaudible]
interlude the Christian epoch,

00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:31.870
so also Erminia disappears.

00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:37.160
However, some other episodes
were too tightly embedded

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.540
in the poem.

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:39.960
They were, in fact,
not episodes,

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:44.700
but full-fledged stories, and
could not easily be eliminated.

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:50.080
And one of the most famous is
the story of Rinaldo and Armida.

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:55.030
Armida is a Muslim
enchantress who manages

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:59.550
to distract many Christians
from their mission.

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:04.030
She's in fact, I would claim,
Goffredo's real antagonist,

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:09.330
because Goffredo represents
a centripetal force

00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:14.210
that binds the army together and
propels it towards Jerusalem,

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:17.630
while Armida embodies
the opposite principle,

00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:21.380
multiplicity, variety,
a centripetal force

00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:23.960
that encourages the soldiers

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:27.840
who follow their instinct
instead of their duty.

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:32.110
And Armida is very close
to celebrating her triumph

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:37.320
when Rinaldo -- so the imaginary
ancestor of the [inaudible]

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:42.220
through which Tasso writes,
as well as the right arm

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:45.110
of the Christian
army in Tasso's view

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:49.780
of the single agent in his poem.

00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:54.940
Rinaldo is asleep and is
about to be killed by Armida.

00:51:54.940 --> 00:52:00.670
And then Armida makes
the fatal mistake.

00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:03.180
She looks at Rinaldo.

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:07.040
Rinaldo's so beautiful, and
she falls in love with him.

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.590
And the last two lines say

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:12.430
"e'n su la vaga fronte pende
omai si che par Narciso al

00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:15.000
fonte," like Narcissus
at the pool,

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.170
she hung upon his lovely face.

00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:18.820
So already from the
very beginning,

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:23.860
this is a very strong
narcissistic element in the love

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:29.680
between Armida and Rinaldo.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:30.980
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart:
Thank you.

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:32.710
Laura has set the
stage beautifully

00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:37.150
for Nicolas Poussin's
"Rinaldo and Armida."

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:39.930
In his book on Poussin,
"The Poetics of Painting,"

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:43.080
Jonathan Unglaub offers
a penetrating analysis

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:45.190
of the artist's interpretation.

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:47.190
He calls our attention
to the sparseness

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:51.760
of the barren landscape and the
single fervor of Eros or Cupid,

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.070
rather than having
an army of puttee

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:56.040
that many other artists
would do.

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.290
The better to focus our
attention on the moment

00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:03.250
when love, literally love,
love as amour, love as Cupid,

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:08.780
restrains Armida from plunging
her dagger into Rinaldo's chest.

00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:13.700
Only love, he says, has the
power to disarm hostility.

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:19.080
Just so, Armida's hatred
transforms into intense love,

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.020
which is communicated
both in the interruption

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:24.290
of her murderous plot, and
in the intensity of her gaze,

00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:27.240
squarely locked,
on Rinaldo's face.

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:32.010
In the next scene,
also by Poussin,

00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:35.690
the smitten Armida prepares to
take the sleeping Rinaldo back

00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:39.080
to her enchanted island
and one of the few versions

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.860
to show the actual transport.

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:42.840
I'm leading us through
the narrative here.

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:46.460
This is by Domenico Fiasella,
one of my favorites from Genoa,

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:51.350
who depicts Armida's flying
chariot laden with flowers.

00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:53.650
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti:
Oh, this is beautiful.

00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:57.920
And so, in fact, Armida
decides to take Rinaldo

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:01.860
to the isola fortunata,

00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:07.610
which are usually identified
with Canary Islands.

00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:11.520
And so she takes him there
in her beautiful garden,

00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:18.510
which is also a beautiful
building with beautiful paths.

00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:37.080
[ Reading in Italian ]

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:41.000
So the first word here
is "tondo," circular.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.760
So Armida's circular
universe is the negation

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:49.890
of Goffredo's straight
itinerary towards Jerusalem.

00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:56.880
So Armida and Rinaldo enjoy
the garden's eternal spring.

00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.180
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart: Right.

00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:00.060
Well, I think we'll
move to the --

00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:02.490
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti:
Yeah, to the next one.

00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:03.860
The garden's attempt --

00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:06.640
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart: We'll
see the gardens in a minute.

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.940
[laughter]

00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:09.240
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti:
Do not worry.

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:10.540
Do not despair.

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:14.830
[laughter] But we also see
what Rinaldo and Armida do

00:55:14.830 --> 00:55:18.200
in the garden, and
among other things,

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:21.590
they perform complex
love rituals.

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:27.900
In particular, the scene of the
mirror, where Armida takes care

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:32.740
of her hair and she looks
at herself in the mirror,

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:37.510
and Rinaldo helps her.

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:58.100
[ Reading in Italian ]

00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:01.500
I must have read these
verses a hundred times

00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:07.230
and I still have problems
understanding precisely what

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:08.530
they mean, right?

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:11.420
They are so beautiful, so
musical, and yet, when you try

00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:15.820
to find exactly what this is
saying, you are in trouble.

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:17.930
And the thing, this is not --

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:22.080
it's not that Tasso's making a
mistake, but on the contrary.

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:27.200
Here, it's both representing
Armida's charm and pointing

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:31.000
at the fact that that
charm leads to confusion,

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.730
to gender confusion,
and also literally

00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:36.510
to the loss of mean [?].

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:42.510
I think this is why this
line is so problematic.

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:44.090
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart: Exactly.

00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:47.370
And we see one of the
scenes here, again,

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:52.480
from the Bartoli edition here
at the Library of Congress.

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.670
As diverting and
interesting as these parts

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:58.670
of the love story are, some
of the most fascinating

00:56:58.670 --> 00:57:00.750
from an art historical
perspective are those

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:03.400
that involve gazes
and reflections.

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:07.280
While under Armida's
spell, Rinaldo is incapable

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:09.970
of seeing himself as he is.

00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:12.270
Rather, he only perceives
himself

00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:14.540
through his reflection
in her eyes.

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:17.730
And we'll see that
better in other versions.

00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:19.860
Fight, Annibale Carracci,

00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:22.600
who understood exactly
what Tasso was trying

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.160
to say, I think.

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:28.420
[laughter] So if we had more
time, I would develop an idea

00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:32.140
of pictorial intelligence,
which I would say is equally

00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:34.480
as refined as literally
intelligence.

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:37.310
But I think he really gets it.

00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:40.630
Here, Armida's pictured as
gazing at her reflection

00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:43.940
in the mirror, while
Rinaldo stares rather vapidly

00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:45.570
into her eyes.

00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:48.070
He's no longer dressed
as a soldier.

00:57:48.070 --> 00:57:50.730
The only thing that's
left is he sword.

00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:52.200
I think we'll hear
more about that.

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:59.730
His limply placed sword,
without saying more.

00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:06.170
[laughter] And he is now a
luce cordier in her enthrall.

00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:08.030
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti: Yes.

00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:09.330
Absolutely.

00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:14.200
And this is a love that can
only blossom in a place removed

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:17.560
from war, from battle,
from the making of history.

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:25.860
But history and war enter the
garden when Carlo and Ubaldo,

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:28.940
two Christian warriors,

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:35.660
manage to fulfill their
mission, and rescue Rinaldo.

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:39.420
They take advantage of
Armida's momentary absence

00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:42.350
and present Rinaldo
with a shield.

00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:47.750
And this shield, interestingly
enough, is another mirror.

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:50.920
But as Maggie Gunsberg
has pointed out,

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:55.980
is a mirror that serves
the opposite function

00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:57.460
than Armida's mirror.

00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:01.590
So while Armida's mirror
[inaudible] narcissism

00:59:01.590 --> 00:59:09.180
and confusion, this mirror
instills guilt and awareness.

00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:13.400
In other words, by looking at
his reflection in the mirror,

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:17.780
Rinaldo sees himself
as an unwanted member

00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:20.590
of a social group, of
the Christian Army.

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:24.720
Basically, he has
recovered this new sense

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:28.660
of social expectations,
if we can say so.

00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:32.360
And indeed, the dangling
sword that fell

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:40.430
at his side is very prominent
also in Tasso's lines here.

00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:42.870
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart:
Thank you.

00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:47.900
It is not until Carlo and
Ubaldo, who have been sent

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:52.620
by Goffredo and the Christian
troops to retrieve Rinaldo,

00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:56.460
espy their commander that they
helped to reveal their leader

00:59:56.460 --> 01:00:00.080
to himself through
seeing his own reflection.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:04.140
And here, from a Florentine
anonymous fresco cycle.

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:05.440
But do you see?

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.830
It's one of the rare,
rare versions

01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:10.310
where they show the actual
moment of the reflective shield,

01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:12.640
which is supposed to have
like a diamond-like surface.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.940
Am I right about that?

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:15.770
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti:
Yeah, absolutely.

01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:17.680
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart:
And this weapon,

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.360
a much more masculine one,

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.080
the polished diamond
surface of the shield.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:25.120
And in that moment, Rinaldo
awakens to his true appearance

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:28.320
and at once vows to
leave Armida's island.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:32.240
To return briefly to the
version by Annibale Carraci.

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:36.750
Do you see in the background
Carlo and Ubaldo with the shield

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:38.740
that glints just a
little bit of light,

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.630
hinting at what's to come.

01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:43.620
It's again, just --

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:44.920
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti: Yeah.

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.220
It's fascinating
how painters tend

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:50.850
to represent various
moments in the story, right?

01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:52.150
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart: Exactly.

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:55.220
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti:
With the different paints

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:56.530
and [inaudible].

01:00:56.530 --> 01:01:00.020
Well, as you've probably
figured out by now,

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:06.530
none of the love stories of the
"liberata" had a happy ending.

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:08.970
[laughter] This is what
Tasso himself wrote

01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:11.160
in one of his letters.

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:19.850
But no story is as tragic as the
one of Tancredi and Clorinda.

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:22.860
We have already mentioned
these two characteristics.

01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:27.100
Clorinda is the warrior woman
who encountered to rescue Olindo

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:31.650
and Sofronia, while Tancredi
is the Christian soldier

01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:33.350
who Erminia loved.

01:01:33.350 --> 01:01:37.050
But Tancredi did
not love Erminia

01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:40.370
because he loved Clorinda.

01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:46.090
He loved Clorinda simply because
he had seen her once by a stream

01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:47.390
without her helmet on.

01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:50.640
[laughter] And yet, fallen
madly in love with her.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.120
And it's a love that
becomes an obsession.

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.420
They have very few --
in fact, you mentioned,

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:00.580
one of the few encounters

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:04.640
in battle they had
before canto twelve,

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:10.800
which is really their canto, the
canto of Tancredi and Clorinda.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.600
Canto twelve begins with an ero
note, like Virgil, notes errata.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.150
So it was night time,
it was night time,

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:21.560
which seems a Meredith
chronological remark,

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.850
but actually introduces one
of the main protagonists

01:02:24.850 --> 01:02:31.320
of the canto, the knight which
generates confusion, darkness,

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.830
and tragedy for
misunderstandings.

01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:39.330
Clorinda is within
Jerusalem and she's restless.

01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:44.320
She thinks that she should go
outside the wall of Jerusalem

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:50.200
to set on fire a war
machine, a mobile tower,

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:54.080
that the Christians have used
quite successfully to date.

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:59.350
But in order to go out
unnoticed, she decides not

01:02:59.350 --> 01:03:07.510
to wear her usual armor,
and she dons a dark armor.

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:22.230
[ Reading in Italian ]

01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:25.240
"An omen full of
fear," [inaudible].

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.900
So there seems to be something
strange about Armida --

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:30.510
sorry, about Clorinda's armor.

01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:35.770
And her servant, Arsete,
who has taken care of her

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:39.170
since she was a baby, decides
that this is the right time

01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:41.980
to tell Clorinda her real story.

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:45.350
The real story's quite
complex, but the main points are

01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:50.360
that Clorinda was born in
Ethiopia, and she was born

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.460
from Christian parents.

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:56.520
And then, through a complex set
of circumstances, her mother had

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.620
to entrust her to Arsete.

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:03.450
Arsete had raised her as Muslim.

01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:07.060
And he had neglected
to baptize her

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:10.580
as Clorinda's mom
had recommended.

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:14.100
But now, Arsete just had
a dream and in the dream,

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:17.880
St. George has appeared
and has urged him

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.150
to baptize Clorinda
before it is too late.

01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:24.470
And this is the story that
Arsete tells Clorinda,

01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:26.730
but Clorinda decides,
nevertheless, that she wants

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:33.380
to -- that she believes in her
fate and decides to venture

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:36.240
out to complete this mission.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.620
And in fact, she goes out,
she sets the tower on fire.

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:42.830
Then she tries to get
back into Jerusalem,

01:04:42.830 --> 01:04:47.790
but the door is locked
at the wrong time.

01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:51.590
And this is what Tasso
expresses beautifully, I think,

01:04:51.590 --> 01:04:55.020
with this octet, which begins,
"Aperta e l'Aurea porta,"

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:56.380
so the golden gate is open.

01:04:56.380 --> 01:05:01.140
And then it ends
with the door is --

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.510
"e chiusa a poi la porta..."

01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:03.980
[reading in Italian]
The door is swung to.

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:06.090
Clorinda is shut out.

01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:11.010
And the following octet starts
by emphasizing the same concept.

01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:13.830
[in Italian] Shut alone is she.

01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:22.110
So she's really in this no
man's or no woman's land,

01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:27.330
where she's among enemies,
although those enemies,

01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:32.230
she has just learned,
are really the group

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:35.980
to which she belongs by birth.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:39.900
Yet, it's night time, so
Clorinda hopes that thanks

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:43.250
to her disguise, she'll
be able to go unnoticed.

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:50.260
And in fact, she almost manages,
but Tancredi manages to see her.

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:53.420
And Tancredi makes
a tragic mistake.

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:56.410
"Solo Tancredi avien che
lei conosca," of this,

01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:59.810
it chanced that the one man
[inaudible] was Tancred.

01:05:59.810 --> 01:06:03.320
"Conosca," Tasso says, which
is a very ambiguous verb.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:08.070
In modern Italian, the
difference between conoce,

01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:11.750
so to meet for the first time,
and the Greek "gignosko,"

01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:14.030
to recognize, is very clear.

01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:16.620
But this was not the
case in the 16th century,

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:20.460
where conoce could mean
either thing, you know,

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:21.800
convey either meaning.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:24.710
So for a moment,
the reader thinks

01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:27.610
that Tancredi recognized
Clorinda,

01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:31.620
but what follows makes clear
that that's not at all the case.

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:35.590
In fact, Tancredi thinks
that Clorinda is a man,

01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:40.140
and he follows her and
challenges her to a dual.

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:42.940
And this "Va girando
colei l'alpestre cima,"

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:46.320
she sought some other gate to
enter town, is the beginning

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:50.700
of Monteverdi's cCombattimento
that you'll discuss later on.

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:58.820
So they begin this furious fight
that has some really tragic

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:02.670
and almost disturbing
undertones, where the language

01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:06.010
of love and the language
of war coincide.

01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:07.810
For instance, this passage.

01:07:07.810 --> 01:07:18.080
[ Reading in Italian ]

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.220
So for a tragic perversion,

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:23.940
what should have been a
lover's embrace is transferred

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:27.080
into a man and his deadly grip.

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:31.650
So they fight throughout the
night, but as the sun rises

01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:35.100
from the east, Tancredi
formulates a request.

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:37.260
He says, you know,
it's really a shame

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:39.490
that we don't know
each other's name.

01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:40.790
Who are you?

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:44.510
And this is a very
common request

01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:45.810
in [inaudible] literature,

01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:49.010
but the reader can
perceive a tragic urgency

01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:51.920
and a tragic irony in request.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.810
His problem is precisely
that he doesn't know the name

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:59.820
of his mysterious opponent.

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:04.410
But Clorinda refuses
to reveal her identity,

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:06.770
and the fight resumes.

01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:14.840
And Clorinda is wounded to
death and she's about to die.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.640
And as she -- sorry.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:22.260
As she is about to die,
she formulates a request.

01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:30.590
She asks that she be baptized.

01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:33.700
So she asks to be baptized.

01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:38.440
At which point, Tancredi
goes to a nearby stream,

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:45.160
fills his helmet with water, and
goes back to the dying warrior.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:48.700
And as you can see here,

01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:56.530
he has almost a premonition
while he's trying

01:08:56.530 --> 01:09:00.870
to free the warrior's
face from the helmet.

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:06.510
[reading in Italian] And then
there is the tragic revelation.

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:15.110
[ Reading in Italian ]

01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:20.510
And notice how these last
lines with their staccato --

01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:23.650
with their rapid
succession of short,

01:09:23.650 --> 01:09:28.260
essential sentences
conveys the change

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:31.810
in perspective in Tancredi.

01:09:31.810 --> 01:09:35.190
Because after that point,
Tancredi has been fighting,

01:09:35.190 --> 01:09:36.820
running, and chasing ghosts,

01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:41.940
but only now he realizes
what he has really done.

01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:45.900
So Tancredi and Clorinda,

01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:52.140
probably the most
tragic creation in the

01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:53.620
"Jerusalem Delivered."

01:09:53.620 --> 01:10:00.340
An episode that is at the same
time coherent as a narration

01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:02.970
and skillful as a
work of poetry.

01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:08.900
Tasso uses a number of
poetic devices, alteration,

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:12.650
[inaudible], assonance,
and broad dichotomies,

01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:17.070
male and female, death and
salvation, night and day

01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:19.540
to tell a suspenseful story.

01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:20.940
But the thing that the --

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:26.210
the real reason for the enduring
success of these episodes lies

01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:29.510
in its universal scene.

01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:32.920
Tancredi's problem
is that he fails

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:36.690
to recognize his beloved
until it is too late.

01:10:36.690 --> 01:10:42.470
This is the trend that units the
different stages of the episode

01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:44.730
from that first ironic
[in Italian], of this,

01:10:44.730 --> 01:10:50.060
it chanced that the one
man aware was Tancred,

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:53.290
to the tragic revelation,
[in Italian].

01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:59.830
Notice that the verbs are the
same, conocere [inaudible].

01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:04.540
Perhaps in the translation,
that is lost a bit.

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:06.350
But those are the same
verbs that Tasso uses.

01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:15.580
So therefore, the real theme
of the episode is the failure

01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:22.430
to acknowledge, recognize,
understand, embrace [inaudible],

01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:25.640
a theme that resonates
throughout the century

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.320
and for all of us.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:31.080
And to think, this is
the reason why Tancredi

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:34.540
and Clorinda would continue to
strike each other as warriors

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:38.190
and miss each other
as lovers in the works

01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:42.200
of many painters and
composers, right?

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:45.800
Because it's an extremely
successful episode.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.180
&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart:
Absolutely.

01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:51.520
As we'll see, and interpreted
in many different ways,

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.990
or different aspects
are highlighted.

01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:56.360
Throughout this dialogue,
I've been concentrating

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.970
on the early graphic
representations of Gerusalemme

01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:02.710
because they were most often
the first ones produced,

01:12:02.710 --> 01:12:05.100
and in many ways,
the most influential

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.170
to the artists who followed.

01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:08.620
Not only did a significant
number

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.750
of artists own the
illustrated editions of Tasso,

01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:14.280
which provided rich
visual material,

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.140
they were undoubtedly
respond to the argumente

01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:19.990
and the privileging of
the particular scenes

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:22.940
by the commentators
and the illustrators.

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:25.170
Among the first of
the painted responses

01:12:25.170 --> 01:12:28.860
to Tasso is a powerfully
foreshortened view

01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:33.430
of the conversion of Clorinda
by Domenico Tintoretto.

01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:35.670
Having fought through the
entire night, Tancredi

01:12:35.670 --> 01:12:39.720
and Clorinda are seen just as
dawn breaks in the background.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:42.710
Tintoretto augmented
the terrestrial light

01:12:42.710 --> 01:12:44.910
with a dazzling, heavenly vision

01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:48.710
of two seraphim accompanying
the dove of the Holy Ghost.

01:12:48.710 --> 01:12:51.330
Any of you who know
scenes of Baptism

01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:56.720
of Christ often see the
same kinds of images.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.870
This divine apparition serves
as a kind of exclamation point

01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:03.890
to the counter-reformation
themes that adhere

01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:07.650
to Tasso's epic, though they
are not specifically described

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:08.950
by him.

01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:11.820
Together, the angles in
breaking dawn, turn the carpet

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.960
of plants a golden hue.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:16.670
The raking angles of the
figures draw our attention

01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:19.790
to the subtle details
of Tasso's verses.

01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:23.110
Clorinda's ashen face, and
these are Tasso's words,

01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:27.250
"like violets mixed with
lilies, and her mortal wound,

01:13:27.250 --> 01:13:30.720
from whence blood has stained
her blouse," on one hand,

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:34.100
and the swiftly running
Tancred -- note for instance,

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.760
his extended left leg --

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:39.070
who arrives with the
water for baptism

01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:42.980
at the precise moment
she's about to expire.

01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:48.440
By contrast, Sisto Badalocchio
orients the scene parallel

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.150
to the picture plane
and draws the viewer

01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:51.710
in with a brilliant light

01:13:51.710 --> 01:13:55.380
that bathes Clorinda's
bare and bloodied chest.

01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:58.280
Although we can again see
dawn breaking in the distance,

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:01.660
Clorinda, having declared her
conversion and receiving baptism

01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:03.970
from the hand of
Tancred, herself appears

01:14:03.970 --> 01:14:07.090
to be a source emanating light.

01:14:07.090 --> 01:14:08.930
There is no heavenly apparition.

01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:13.230
Rather, a more naturalistic
or in the words of the period,

01:14:13.230 --> 01:14:17.190
"verisimile," kind
of interpretation.

01:14:17.190 --> 01:14:20.750
Yet this internally generated
light beatifies Clorinda,

01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:24.930
who looks more like a martyred
saint than a dying war heroine.

01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:27.610
Similarly, Badalocchio
sets his narrative

01:14:27.610 --> 01:14:30.810
in a verdant landscape far
from the walls of Jerusalem,

01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:34.030
which we barely glimpse
in the background.

01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:35.330
In the same -- excuse me.

01:14:35.330 --> 01:14:36.630
At the same time,

01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:40.150
the counter-reformatory message
is balanced by the tender class

01:14:40.150 --> 01:14:43.440
of Tancredi and Clorinda's
proper left hands

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.850
and the ambiguity
of their gazes.

01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:48.790
Whereas Tancred concentrates
on the act of baptism,

01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:53.270
Clorinda looks lovingly
at him, not toward heaven.

01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:55.060
The balance of sacred
and profane

01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:56.770
in Badalocchio's
painting is pushed

01:14:56.770 --> 01:15:02.850
to its most contumacious extreme
in Giovanni Bilivert's version,

01:15:02.850 --> 01:15:06.530
in which Clorinda has
lost not only her helmet,

01:15:06.530 --> 01:15:08.510
but every shred of clothing.

01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:11.040
[ Laughter ]

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.340
I wanted to add to that.

01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:18.060
In the cinematic version, again
from our 1957 extravaganza,

01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:21.480
we see the exhausted warriors
helmetless and sprawled

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:24.530
on the bank of a river,
but with no visible wounds

01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:27.590
or even a drop of sweat.

01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:29.800
[laughter] I'd like
to turn now to one

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:33.080
of the grandest early
responses to Tasso's epic,

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:36.330
which was found not in
Italy, but in France.

01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:39.670
Though the patron was the
Italian-born Marie d'Medici,

01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:43.760
who married Henri Quatre,
Henry the Fourth, in 1600.

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:46.310
In the Cabinet de la
Reine at Fontainbleau,

01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:51.410
Marie commissioned Ambroise
Dubois to paint a suite

01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:55.490
of canvases on themes
taken from Gerusalemme.

01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:57.210
Not surprisingly, all

01:15:57.210 --> 01:16:00.220
of the episodes concerned
female protagonists.

01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:03.630
Clorinda, Sofronia, and
from Heliodorus' novel,

01:16:03.630 --> 01:16:07.230
an Ethiopian story that
focuses on Chariclea.

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:10.420
And some of you may
know Joaneath Spicer

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:11.720
at the Walters Art Museum.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:17.670
She's written about
Chariclea and Clorinda

01:16:17.670 --> 01:16:20.320
as Ethiopian princesses.

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:23.480
Foremost among these large
scale paintings is the combat

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.750
of Tancredi and Clorinda,
here we see it,

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:30.080
which bears comparison to the
composition of Domenico Mona

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:32.520
in his drawing from
the third canto.

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:34.250
Instead of the non-violent
meeting,

01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:37.090
Dubois has chosen
the heat of battle,

01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:40.000
where the two ill-fated lovers,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.080
unknown to one another despite
being only clad with armor

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.650
and wearing helmets that
reveal their faces --

01:16:45.650 --> 01:16:48.030
[laughter] -- I know,
it's crazy.

01:16:48.030 --> 01:16:50.360
You have to suspend
a lot of disbelief.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:54.740
[laughing] They're about
to wield their swords.

01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:58.680
Since this is a painting cycle
and not an illustrated book,

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:03.380
the artist and patron freely
select which cantos to highlight

01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:05.980
and which ancillary
scenes to depict.

01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:08.500
Here we find not only
the combattimento,

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:11.270
but also the rarely
represented scenes of the birth

01:17:11.270 --> 01:17:13.120
of Clorinda, which is lost.

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:14.770
But this one is here.

01:17:14.770 --> 01:17:17.320
"Tancredi and Clorinda
at the Fountain,"

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.920
which is what you described
as a stream, here interpreted

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.980
by Dubois as a fountain.

01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:25.530
The moment that Tancred's
love first blossoms, here.

01:17:25.530 --> 01:17:28.940
Clorinda seems rather
indifferent up to the very end,

01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:36.380
from the first canto, the 46
to 47, and to Tancred in front

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:38.100
of the walls of Jerusalem.

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:42.190
And I wanted to show
next, a very rare scene,

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:45.700
but it was mentioned by Laura,
of Clorinda before Arsete.

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:50.050
This in another drawing
by Domenico Mona -- yes.

01:17:50.050 --> 01:17:57.110
And in this one is the moment
of the telling of the long tale

01:17:57.110 --> 01:18:00.410
of how she's connected
to her Christian family,

01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:05.200
including in some people's
imaginations, Prester John.

01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:09.800
So it really has
far-reaching meaning.

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:13.690
This is the complete cycle,
the one I've been looking

01:18:13.690 --> 01:18:16.980
at with Dubois, of
the encounters

01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:18.350
between Tancredi and Clorinda.

01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:20.790
And I bring it to your
attention for its relevance

01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:22.740
to Monteverdi's Combattimento,

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.550
as there is nothing
comparable in Italian art.

01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:27.680
But if Monteverdi's
intervention is more

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:30.520
like a musical [inaudible]
into text,

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:34.620
Dubois' is a visual
concordance in which every scene

01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:38.310
where Tancredi and Clorinda
appear is brought to life.

01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:42.720
Unlike Dubois' cycle,
Monteverdi drew his entire text

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:49.070
from the 12th canto, octaves
52 to 62 and 64 to 68.

01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:50.910
In addition to allowing
the composer

01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:54.520
to maintain Aristotle's unities
of time, space, and action,

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:57.130
the selections of three
episodes -- excuse me --

01:18:57.130 --> 01:19:00.520
of these episodes, provided
a strongly pro-Christian,

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:02.820
anti-Turk or anti-Muslim message

01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:05.550
for the Venetian audience
gathered for a performance

01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:09.780
of the Combattimento in the
palace of Girolamo Mocenigo,

01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:13.210
who was the provveditore
of the Venetian state.

01:19:13.210 --> 01:19:17.900
And this was during Lent,
carnival season, of 1624.

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:21.110
Tasso's fertile poetry
offers many opportunities

01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:22.780
to artists and composers.

01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:26.400
They saw different things or
inflected different actions

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.020
and emotions within
the same text.

01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.970
For example, Monteverdi's
"Libereto"

01:19:30.970 --> 01:19:34.990
for the Combattimento omits the
final scene of the transport

01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:40.450
of Clorinda to the Christian
camp, which is in Castello.

01:19:40.450 --> 01:19:43.080
He emphasizes the
movement of the figures

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:44.810
from one field to the -- oops.

01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:50.260
Sorry, I need to go one more.

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:54.240
There. To the next.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:57.350
And closely following
Tasso's text.

01:19:57.350 --> 01:20:00.850
Monteverdi chooses to preserve
the Aristotilian unity of place

01:20:00.850 --> 01:20:03.140
and thus, has both the
conversion and the death

01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:06.440
of Clorinda occur
on the battlefield.

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:09.290
Monteverdi inserts a
narrator called Testo,

01:20:09.290 --> 01:20:15.410
thus the text becomes a
character in the opera and one

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:17.780
that allows both
Tancredi and Clorinda

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:19.500
to enact a choreographed battle.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.670
And we'll see a little snippet
of this at the very end.

01:20:22.670 --> 01:20:27.240
While he describes the action,
as well as two principle actors

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:31.380
and brings us into the
scene in medias res.

01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:34.490
The Combattimento was written
in what Monteverdi called

01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:38.070
"the genere rappresentativo,"
by which historians

01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:41.970
of music believe that he
meant a theatrical mode.

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:46.490
Before the original performance,
which occurred around 1624

01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:49.400
in the private residence I
mentioned, during the season

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:53.700
of Carnival, the first
audience had no clue what they

01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:55.280
would witness.

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.660
They were enjoying the
diversions of a soiree

01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:00.700
with strolling musicians
and conversation.

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:04.340
The characters entered
unexpectedly during the course

01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:05.810
of singing madrigals.

01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:09.740
Clorinda in armor, followed by
Tancred on a "cavallo Mariano."

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:11.160
Let me explain.

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:13.910
This term has variously
been interpreted as a kind

01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:17.060
of capirosoned hobby horse
emblazoned with symbols

01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:19.150
of the Virgin Mary, or possibly,

01:21:19.150 --> 01:21:23.460
as a typo for a cavallo
marino, or sea horse.

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:26.310
Personally, I would love
for it to be the latter.

01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:29.680
[laughter] A sea horse would
make the setting for the opera

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:32.230
in a Venetian palace
all that more --

01:21:32.230 --> 01:21:35.380
much more marvelous
and of the period.

01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:38.540
Monteverdi's own description
in his 8th Book of Madrigals

01:21:38.540 --> 01:21:41.690
of love and war speaks
volumes about his intentions

01:21:41.690 --> 01:21:45.560
and the reception of
the first performance.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.980
They will perform --
these are his words --

01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:51.840
steps and gestures in the
way expressed by the oration,

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.960
nothing more, nothing less.

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:56.900
Observing diligently those
measures, flows, and steps,

01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:59.400
and the instrumentalists
will follow

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:02.250
and perform sounds
excited and soft.

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:06.000
In Italian, "Suane et
cher tati et mali."

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.520
And Testo, delivering the
words in measure in such a way

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:14.200
that the three actions come to
unite in a unified imitation.

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:17.600
Clorinda will speak when
appropriate, Testo, silent,

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.810
and similarly, Tancredi.

01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:23.310
The instruments, that is, four
violi del braccio, soprano,

01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:25.140
alto, tenor, and bass.

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:28.680
And a contrabasso da
gamba, which is the continuo

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:31.700
with a harpsichord, should
be played in imitation

01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:33.950
of the passions of the oration.

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:37.390
Testo's voice should be clear,
firm, and with good delivery,

01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:39.600
somewhat distanced
from the instruments,

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.140
so that the oration may
be better understood.

01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:44.160
He must not remake -- or, sorry.

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:47.890
He must not remake "gorghe ne
trilli" which, I don't know

01:22:47.890 --> 01:22:49.190
if we have any music
historians here,

01:22:49.190 --> 01:22:52.330
but those are ornamentations
from the period.

01:22:52.330 --> 01:22:54.950
So it's supposed
to be very limited,

01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:57.360
unadorned music for
the most part.

01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.420
For the rest, he will
deliver words according

01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:01.580
to the passions of the oration.

01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:05.410
And in this manner, now 12 years
ago, was performed in the palace

01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:08.220
of the most illustrious
and most excellent Senor

01:23:08.220 --> 01:23:10.330
Girolamo Mocenigo.

01:23:10.330 --> 01:23:12.750
My particular lord,
with all refinement,

01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:16.930
given that he is a knight of
excellent and delicate taste.

01:23:16.930 --> 01:23:20.390
And in Carnival time, since
it was an evening pastime,

01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:23.790
in the presence of all the
nobility, who remained moved

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:26.450
by the emotion of
compassion in such a way

01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:29.830
as almost to let forth tears.

01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:33.040
And the audience applauded
it for being a song

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:38.080
of a kind never before heard.

01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:40.730
Monteverdi's Combattimento
introduced many noveta,

01:23:40.730 --> 01:23:43.200
or novelties, to
music performance.

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:46.580
It is said to be the first
instance of the use of pizzicato

01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:48.260
and tremolo in the strings,

01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:51.140
which together added more
agitation and excitement

01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:53.140
to the singing in
what he called the

01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:56.550
"conchitato ," or
aroused manner.

01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:58.910
In fact, the instrumentalists

01:23:58.910 --> 01:24:01.560
and the singers often act
independently of one another.

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.120
There is much more to
be said, of course,

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:06.040
about Monteverdi's
great achievements

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:08.940
in this rarely performed
opera, but I don't want

01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:11.520
to defer your pleasure
much longer.

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:14.470
The presentation of the video
will make things clearer

01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:17.330
than any exegesis
could hope to do.

01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:20.120
So in closing, it's
important to remember

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.260
that the first performance came

01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:25.540
as a complete surprise
to all in attendance.

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:29.230
Perhaps these two reimaginings
of the Combattimento,

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:32.090
one from the 17th century that
we looked at just a minute ago,

01:24:32.090 --> 01:24:35.660
Bilivert, and one
from the 21st century,

01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:37.620
will serve a similar purpose.

01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:40.580
Here, President Obama
is Tancred.

01:24:40.580 --> 01:24:45.030
The unidentified woman, maybe
it's Hillary, is Clorinda.

01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:51.020
And the Secret Service
man is Testo.

01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:54.010
[laughter] Badalocchio's
version that we've been looking

01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:56.410
at will be our final one.

01:24:56.410 --> 01:25:00.550
Talking, laughing, dancing,
and certainly gambling,

01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:04.280
Monteverdi drew the
raucous guest

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:06.920
into a single focused activity.

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:09.680
In keeping with the poetic
and artistic conventions

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:10.980
of the period,

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:14.860
the rappresentazione played
shamelessly on the effetti

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:19.560
or the effects and
emotions of the spectators.

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:22.040
The problem for Monteverdi
was communicating sympathy

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:25.140
for the protagonist when
they have so few lines.

01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:28.770
Thus, the character of Testo
is charged with filling in all

01:25:28.770 --> 01:25:31.590
of the details of action
and narrative tissue.

01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:34.150
Meanwhile, the instrumentalists
are heightening emotions

01:25:34.150 --> 01:25:36.120
and painting sound pictures

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:38.950
that provide a physical
setting for the actors.

01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:42.040
When Clorinda, newly
baptized, draws her last breath

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:48.290
and sees heaven opening before
her, the audience is expected

01:25:48.290 --> 01:25:50.370
to be overcome with emotion.

01:25:50.370 --> 01:25:52.920
In Tasso's treatise,
dell'arte poetica,

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:56.750
he stated that the poet's role
is to move the reader to anger,

01:25:56.750 --> 01:26:01.400
pity, or terror, to
joy or to sadness.

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:04.990
The original audience wept, not
because of Monteverdi's music

01:26:04.990 --> 01:26:08.810
and stagecraft, but
because they knew Tasso's

01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:10.850
"Gerusalemme" so well.

01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:13.910
It was the startling
re-presentation

01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:16.800
or re-representation
of Tasso's poetry

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.960
in Monteverdi's aroused mode
within a theatrical production

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:24.120
in an unexpected
palace that caused them

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.760
to experience the
epic in a new way.

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:30.580
And we hope that your encounter,
whether the first or the 21st,

01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:33.160
will now be similarly informed.

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.740
This excerpt runs just
about three minutes,

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:39.430
and I chose the 1993 production
from the Netherlands' Opera

01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:42.740
because it was performed in
costume with period musicians,

01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:45.380
as Monteverdi wanted off stage

01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:47.930
and the three principals
on stage.

01:26:47.930 --> 01:26:51.430
Testo is performed by Guy de
Maio, who sings and emotes,

01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:55.440
as Tancred, played by Maarten
Konigsberger, and Clorinda,

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:59.350
Lorna Anderson, is our Clorinda.

01:26:59.350 --> 01:27:02.910
They sing only when Tasso has
supplied them with dialogue.

01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:06.400
When they challenge each other
to fight, to war and death,

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:09.640
when Tancred begs his opponent
to name him, or in this case,

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:13.110
herself, he didn't know, only to
confess that she was responsible

01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:15.660
for burning the Christian's
war machine,

01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:18.050
further angering Tancred.

01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:20.850
The battle ensues and
finally, the recognition

01:27:20.850 --> 01:27:24.080
of the dying Clorinda, who
forgives Tancred and asks

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:25.910
for him to baptize her.

01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:29.560
Remember, as I said, and as
Laura has said, she descends

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.180
from Christian ancestors.

01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:33.120
And before she expires,

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:37.540
Tancred's interior
dialogue is voiced by Testo,

01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:40.410
stupefied as he is,
as Laura explained,

01:27:40.410 --> 01:27:43.420
mute and motionless, "Ahi vista!

01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:44.720
Ahi conoscenza!"

01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:47.460
Oh, unhappy sight,
oh woeful knowledge.

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:49.570
And at last, as she dies,

01:27:49.570 --> 01:27:53.320
she bids him farewell,
I die in peace.

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:58.860
So if I can do this
properly, now.

01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:03.350

&gt;&gt; Audience Member:
I was thinking

01:30:30.910 --> 01:30:32.620
about Mattia Preti's
version and since we know

01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:37.000
that Mattia Preti was very --

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:44.460
I mean, he had very
strong sensitivity.

01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:51.950
I wonder if he actually was
aware about that symphony,

01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:56.410
kind of sexual message
in the [inaudible].

01:30:56.410 --> 01:31:02.420
And he spent a bunch
of time in Naples

01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:04.850
and he knew a lot
of [inaudible].

01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:06.760
So what do you think?

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:15.750
I mean, this is very explicit,
you know, sensual scene.

01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:22.650
[inaudible] So probably we can
be established between the link

01:31:22.650 --> 01:31:23.970
between the text and the
perception of the artist.

Well, I --

01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:31.770
[laughing] It's a
painting, right?

01:31:31.770 --> 01:31:33.070
Okay. Absolutely, that's
what I believe, as well.

01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:36.850
Is that he's making explicit
what is only implicit

01:31:36.850 --> 01:31:41.460
in the very racy
words that Tasso used.

01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:46.260
It's not nearly --
[laughing] as ribald

01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:49.180
as it becomes in
Preti's painting.

01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:51.060
But yet, there is
that undercurrent

01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:53.540
of sexual tension
that's in the text.

01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:55.060
And you might want to
say more about that.

01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:57.380
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti:
Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

01:31:57.380 --> 01:32:01.700
There's this kind of
transformation of Clorinda

01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:09.000
in a completely different
female model, right?

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:15.030
I mean, from the Titan and
warrior woman to the --

01:32:16.450 --> 01:32:19.670
[pause], you know,
Petrarchan ideal.

01:32:19.670 --> 01:32:25.070
In fact, the language really
mirrors Petrarca when she,

01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:30.470
in the crucial parts of the
dual and when she converts.

01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:34.120
So there is definitely an
erotization of Clorinda,

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:39.040
who had, up to that moment,
completely neglected love.

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:42.270
So it's absolutely there.

&gt;&gt; Dr. Peter Lukehart: I
was going to say though

01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:47.090
that you're linking

01:32:47.090 --> 01:32:52.850
in beautifully here both
the erotic scene of Sofronia

01:32:52.850 --> 01:32:58.660
and the very erotic scene of
Clorinda, as, you know, again,

01:32:59.830 --> 01:33:03.290
taking things from the
text and making a kind

01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:06.720
of poetic interpretation
on the basis of the artist.

01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:51.130
[ Inaudible Question ]

01:33:51.130 --> 01:33:52.430
&gt;&gt; Dr. Laura Benedetti:
Well, for Tasso,

01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:57.440
and this is already a pretext
from Francesco DeSantis

01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:02.490
that pointed out in Tasso there
are two different worlds really,

01:34:02.490 --> 01:34:05.100
what it says that
it wants to do,

01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:07.610
and what he actually
ends up doing.

01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:11.310
So in his letters,
it's very clear.

01:34:11.310 --> 01:34:14.090
He says, in my poem,
love is the instrument

01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:19.080
to [inaudible] the
audience, the devil's tool.

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:24.470
So love is there only to
be destroyed, essentially.

01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:27.950
Only to be defeated
at the end, right?

01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:34.060
And in one of the first
stanzas, he says that basically,

01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:39.210
it's poetry and love and
only the sugar coating

01:34:39.210 --> 01:34:44.890
for the bitter medicine that
the reader is going to swallow.

01:34:44.890 --> 01:34:47.630
[laughter] So essentially,
he has a moral message

01:34:47.630 --> 01:34:50.230
and love is supposed to
make it more agreeable.

01:34:50.230 --> 01:34:53.240
But at the end, what
matters is the message.

01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:56.100
That's what he says
he intends to do.

01:34:56.100 --> 01:35:01.360
But then, as we have
seen in these characters,

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:04.290
he's very convincing
when he talks about love

01:35:04.290 --> 01:35:07.940
and these characters seem
to take a life of their own.

01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:12.930
And so when he tried to, in a
way, to really limit all of that

01:35:12.930 --> 01:35:15.310
and come out with the
"Gerusalemme conquistata,"

01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:19.700
the public didn't follow that.

01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:27.010
So I -- he seems to be
championing a different,

01:35:27.010 --> 01:35:28.550
more modern way of love.

01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:34.320
Luckily for us, he actually
succeeded in expressing some

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:37.250
of the most beautiful
