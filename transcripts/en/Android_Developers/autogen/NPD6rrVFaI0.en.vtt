some say it's a bug and support light

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:38.640
some say it's a bug and support light

what's the solution or the workaround

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:40.590
what's the solution or the workaround
 

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:42.590
what's the solution or the workaround
okay so I looked into this a little bit

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600
okay so I looked into this a little bit
 

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.290
okay so I looked into this a little bit
before the show and yeah so the issue in

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:45.300
before the show and yeah so the issue in
 

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.120
before the show and yeah so the issue in
question here is specific to the support

question here is specific to the support
 

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.840
question here is specific to the support
library and exactly what it what let's

00:12:59.720 --> 00:12:59.730
loader and this is not the behavior
 

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.400

exhibited by the system frameworks and

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:03.410
exhibited by the system frameworks and
 

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.540

because of that that pretty much says

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:05.550
because of that that pretty much says
 

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.730
because of that that pretty much says
yeah this is a bug is something we need

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740
yeah this is a bug is something we need
 

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.920
yeah this is a bug is something we need
to address in the support library I'll

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:09.930
to address in the support library I'll
 

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.330
to address in the support library I'll
go ahead and make sure the team that

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:11.340
go ahead and make sure the team that
 

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.740
go ahead and make sure the team that
works on that is aware of it and will

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:12.750
works on that is aware of it and will
 

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.540
works on that is aware of it and will
try to get it fixed in there for you for

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:14.550
try to get it fixed in there for you for
 

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.670
try to get it fixed in there for you for
the next version unfortunately I'm not

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680
the next version unfortunately I'm not
 

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.040
the next version unfortunately I'm not
aware of a workaround off the top of my

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:19.050
aware of a workaround off the top of my
 

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.860
aware of a workaround off the top of my
head for this one so for now I think

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:21.870
head for this one so for now I think
 

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.600

know well there's the nuclear approach

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:48.830
know well there's the nuclear approach
 

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.890
know well there's the nuclear approach
you can you know tell users that they're

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:50.900
you can you know tell users that they're
 

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.690
you can you know tell users that they're
gonna have to write their data and some

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:52.700
gonna have to write their data and some
 

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.850

in some limited cases that actually is
okay

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:55.910
okay
 

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.640
okay
very limited most apps I think that

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:57.650
very limited most apps I think that
 

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.140
very limited most apps I think that
actually is a pretty pretty cruddy user

00:23:59.140 --> 00:23:59.150

very bad code when I was learning how to
 

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.040
very bad code when I was learning how to
use cursors and it was apparent that

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:21.050
use cursors and it was apparent that
 

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.900
use cursors and it was apparent that

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:33.650
string and then pull a substring this
 

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:37.090

you know between one and two megabytes I
 

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:40.840
you know between one and two megabytes I
would say try to pull the first half of

would say try to pull the first half of
 

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:42.820
would say try to pull the first half of
the blob as a sub string and then try to

the blob as a sub string and then try to
 

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.130
the blob as a sub string and then try to
pull the second half because a substring

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:45.140
pull the second half because a substring
 

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.100
pull the second half because a substring
larger than a megabyte would you oh if

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:08.770
might have to take the nuclear approach
 

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:12.010
might have to take the nuclear approach
but I would recommend also being sure to

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:12.020
but I would recommend also being sure to
 

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.930

trouble of for txakoli that might be
 

00:25:51.869 --> 00:25:53.060
trouble of for txakoli that might be
easier and that's probably what I'd try

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:53.070
easier and that's probably what I'd try
 

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:58.430

have a very nice API for this and then
 

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:17.749
have a very nice API for this and then
he quotes the the API link yeah this

00:26:17.749 --> 00:26:17.759
he quotes the the API link yeah this

the way to do it so in any case you know

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:15.090
the way to do it so in any case you know
 

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:16.610
the way to do it so in any case you know
you shouldn't be designing just for the

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620
you shouldn't be designing just for the
 

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.380
you shouldn't be designing just for the

the system bar regardless I actually
interpreted the question is there being

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320
interpreted the question is there being
 

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.160

a hardware keyboard Oh

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:27.170
a hardware keyboard Oh
 

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:29.260
a hardware keyboard Oh
so not just not not the home button red

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:29.270
so not just not not the home button red
 

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:31.630
so not just not not the home button red

for that if there is a way it would
 

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.830
for that if there is a way it would
probably be the same one as the system

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840
probably be the same one as the system

any way anything that actually controls

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:44.390
any way anything that actually controls
 

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:49.840
any way anything that actually controls
