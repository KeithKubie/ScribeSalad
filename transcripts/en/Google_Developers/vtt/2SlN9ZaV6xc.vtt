UTTAM TRIPATHI: At
Google, we strive

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.057
to create great experiences
for our end users

00:00:06.057 --> 00:00:07.890
through the products
and apps that we build.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.334
In 2015, we found an
opportunity to do that

00:00:10.334 --> 00:00:12.750
through a scalable program
working with developer agencies

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.294
globally.

00:00:13.294 --> 00:00:15.210
JENNIFER KOHL: We work
with developer agencies

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.970
to give them access to
really interesting products

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.740
and features that
Google is working on

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.180
so that they can
incorporate them

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.490
into their applications
for their clients

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.120
and for their end users.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.495
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN:
We also trained

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:28.940
over a thousand developers on
various Google technologies

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.648
and were thus able to
improve the quality

00:00:30.648 --> 00:00:32.490
of the overall
developer ecosystem.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.540
Last year alone, we impacted
over 120 different apps

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.692
with a combined download
of over 100 million.

00:00:39.692 --> 00:00:42.150
GUS GOSTYLA: We're very excited
about the Google Developers

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.580
Agency Program,
which helps us match

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.300
high-quality certified
agencies with startups and also

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.420
some very large brands that may
not have the skills in-house

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.710
to deliver on the app
that they dream about.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.640
AMIT CHOPRA: We are now
able to identify and certify

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.910
agencies who have demonstrated
extreme competency in building

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.290
Android applications.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.510
So whenever a customer
comes and asks us,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.370
do you have a
partner who can build

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.440
a certain type of
application for me,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.782
I have an excellent list
that I can offer to them.

00:01:11.782 --> 00:01:13.490
PARUL SOI: These are
geoconsumer problems

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.700
that we are trying to
solve through this program.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.530
The moment we increase the
skill set of the agencies,

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.340
if they really are dealing
with cutting-edge technologies,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.570
they'd be able to solve
these problems in a much

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.654
better and productive way.

00:01:24.654 --> 00:01:26.903
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN: The Google
Developers Agency Program

00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:28.481
had such a great first year.

00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:30.980
We were able to have a positive
impact both on the apps that

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.570
went to market,
as well as having

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.910
a positive impact through
feedback on Google's

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.320
own developer products.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.130
JESSICA SCHWARTZ:
We have immensely

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.870
benefited from the
partnerships that we

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.180
have with various
developer agencies.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.700
Right from the beginning,
we've partnered very closely

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.640
with a few teams to collect
feedback that has directly

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.550
impacted our product.

00:01:49.962 --> 00:01:52.420
PARUL SOI: It is not very common
for developers, especially

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.220
in India, to have this kind
of exposure and training.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.270
For instance, when we were doing
the TechGenie spotlight series,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.325
one of the female
employees shared a story.

00:02:00.325 --> 00:02:02.540
She was a senior
developer at a company

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.340
and had gone on
a maternity leave

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.680
just as they were becoming
our partner agency.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.810
And when she came back
after close to a year,

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.270
the team she was leading
had actually learned a lot

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.604
from our program that she was
having to learn from them.

00:02:13.604 --> 00:02:15.686
UTTAM TRIPATHI: I'm quite
proud with the expansion

00:02:15.686 --> 00:02:17.570
of the program the
last couple of years,

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.140
with us working with agencies
across Europe, Americas,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.700
and Asia and working with
a common goal of creating

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.451
the best quality
experience for end users.

00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:26.033
AMIT CHOPRA: We are
definitely looking

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:28.120
at growing this into
many other regions

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.720
where we are
getting similar asks

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.910
from our partners
and our agencies

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.420
to build up this program.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.790
DAVID MCLAUGHLIN: I can't
wait to see the impact

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.400
that this year will bring and
the improvements for hundreds

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.130
of millions of mobile
users all over the world.
