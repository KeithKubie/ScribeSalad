00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.870
We're almost
halfway through 2016,

00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:06.306
or "the year of no chill"
as I've been calling it.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.475
There are already so many
high-level things going on

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.678
that seem like maybe
they'll be a global catastrophe,

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:13.313
or maybe things will go okay.

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:15.182
We don't know.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:17.551
We don't (bleep) know.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.319
(laughter)

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:21.255
Uh, let's see.
There's a presidential election.

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:23.023
Could spell the end
of America as we know it,

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:24.224
or maybe it'll be fine.

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:25.492
We don't (bleep) know.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.427
Is the environment
gonna be okay,

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:29.830
or will we all drown
in a super tsunami?

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.598
We don't (bleep) know.

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:34.001
Will the recent British vote
to leave the European Union

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.036
turn the UK
into an Orwellian nightmare?

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:38.405
-We don't (bleep) know!
-(laughter)

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.174
Maybe it'll be okay, maybe not.

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:42.943
Will the Rio Olympics be
a triumph of the human spirit,

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:47.481
or a giant human (bleep)?
We don't (bleep) know!

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:50.150
Anything right now!

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:51.952
Yeah, well, maybe
it could be okay.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:53.487
You know,
with all this uncertainty,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.257
it seems like the only rock
we have these days is The Rock,

00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:00.327
-Dwayne Johnson.
-(cheers and applause)

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.931
He is our lifeboat!

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:05.933
Everything...
everything's gonna be okay

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.201
when The Rock's around.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:08.569
Girls want to date him,

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:11.805
guys want to be him and also
want to date him. Last...

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:13.373
-(laughter and groaning)
-...Thursday,

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:16.276
he released a trailer announcing
his new YouTube channel.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.580
What a great time to get in
on this YouTube craze-- 2016.

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:23.483
-(laughter)
-I always...

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:26.920
I always like to wait till
year 11 to get in on stuff.

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:28.522
This is how much
I love The Rock.

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:30.791
I just moved him into
my top eight on Myspace.

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.193
That's how much I love The Rock.

00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:35.863
-(applause and cheering)
-Yeah.

00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:38.765
Let's take a...
let's take a look

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.767
and feel how everything's okay.

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:43.570
MALE ANNOUNCER:
<i>Once a generation</i>

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:46.640
<i>there comes an event so epic</i>

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.543
<i>that it dominates our culture.</i>

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:52.913
â™ª

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.715
(laughter)

00:01:54.748 --> 00:01:56.917
I should start
a YouTube channel.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.987
Yeah, but first,
Rock's got to clear his, um...

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.956
-his browsing history.
-(laughter)

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.459
All right. Yeah. Fine, fine.

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.661
-(applause and cheering)
-Clear it.

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:11.999
That's how (bleep) cool
The Rock is.

00:02:12.032 --> 00:02:14.568
He can make you excited
about a YouTube channel in 2016,

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.570
not to mention,
he even tossed us

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:18.205
a perfect joke set up alley-oop.

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:20.007
So, Comedians,
this is an interesting question.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.808
What embarrassing items
might you find

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:23.076
in The Rock's browser history?

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.478
Mike Phirman, go.

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:27.047
He googled "Am I Vin Diesel?"

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.516
(laughter,
applause and cheering))

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.553
-Robin Thede.
-Can you still

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.555
get pubic lice
if you're totally shaved?

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:36.223
HARDWICK:
All right.

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.325
(laughter and groaning)

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:38.425
-Greg Proops. -Can you diagnose
what The Rock is growing?
