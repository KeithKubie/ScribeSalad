for us to start from practice or moments
 

01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:28.020
for us to start from practice or moments
and that's why we did so much

01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:28.030
and that's why we did so much

that space precisely and there were

01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:57.560
that space precisely and there were
 

01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:59.590

important for us to think of a kind of
 

01:43:10.969 --> 01:43:13.810
important for us to think of a kind of

01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:29.460
and we are trying to actually understand
that with it with a complete different

01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:29.470
that with it with a complete different
 

01:55:29.470 --> 01:55:31.230
that with it with a complete different
framework that won't allow us to

01:55:31.230 --> 01:55:31.240
framework that won't allow us to
 

01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:33.360
framework that won't allow us to
understand it but I find especially

01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:33.370
understand it but I find especially
 

01:55:33.370 --> 01:55:36.810
understand it but I find especially
useful this idea of in symbols that

01:55:36.810 --> 01:55:36.820
useful this idea of in symbols that
 

01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:40.020
useful this idea of in symbols that
joint unda joint element deep disparate

01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:40.030
joint unda joint element deep disparate
 

01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:43.320
joint unda joint element deep disparate
elements right that allowed people to

01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:43.330
elements right that allowed people to
 

01:55:43.330 --> 01:55:46.170
elements right that allowed people to
hook and unhook from different spaces

01:55:46.170 --> 01:55:46.180
hook and unhook from different spaces
 

01:55:46.180 --> 01:55:50.010
hook and unhook from different spaces
and simultaneously creating different

01:55:50.010 --> 01:55:50.020
and simultaneously creating different
 

01:55:50.020 --> 01:55:52.590
and simultaneously creating different
identities so i think that the

01:55:52.590 --> 01:55:52.600
identities so i think that the
 

01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:55.620
identities so i think that the
production of difference in those spaces

01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:55.630
production of difference in those spaces
 

01:55:55.630 --> 01:56:00.720
production of difference in those spaces
it's with matters rather than trying to

01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:00.730
it's with matters rather than trying to
 

01:56:00.730 --> 01:56:04.470
it's with matters rather than trying to
understand from a more fixed theoretical

01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480
understand from a more fixed theoretical
 

01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:07.590
understand from a more fixed theoretical
point of view those issues so i think

01:56:07.590 --> 01:56:07.600
point of view those issues so i think
 

01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:09.900
point of view those issues so i think
that's that that's trillion lighting and

01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:09.910
that's that that's trillion lighting and
 

01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:11.640
that's that that's trillion lighting and
that's something that anthropology has

01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:11.650
that's something that anthropology has
 

01:56:11.650 --> 01:56:14.550
that's something that anthropology has
brought and I think that God has put it

01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560
brought and I think that God has put it
 

01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:18.420
brought and I think that God has put it
really really well into these discussion

01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:18.430
really really well into these discussion
 

01:56:18.430 --> 01:56:23.790
really really well into these discussion
these two days so yeah maybe a more

01:56:23.790 --> 01:56:23.800
these two days so yeah maybe a more
 

01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:27.270
these two days so yeah maybe a more
mobile thing right in terms of identity

01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280
mobile thing right in terms of identity
 

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.880
mobile thing right in terms of identity
in terms of creating difference etc we

01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:29.890
in terms of creating difference etc we
 

01:56:29.890 --> 01:56:32.250
in terms of creating difference etc we
will allow us or help us to start

01:56:32.250 --> 01:56:32.260
will allow us or help us to start
 

01:56:32.260 --> 01:56:38.100
will allow us or help us to start
opening up issues

01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:38.110
 

01:56:38.110 --> 01:56:51.900

the case nasim it was very interesting
 

01:56:58.780 --> 01:57:01.350
the case nasim it was very interesting
because people don't see some concept

01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:01.360
because people don't see some concept

to last two comments i mean i think

01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:12.910
to last two comments i mean i think
 

01:58:12.910 --> 01:58:14.670

the case of blossom mexico but i think

01:58:16.950 --> 01:58:16.960
the case of blossom mexico but i think
 

01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:19.830
the case of blossom mexico but i think
about mall space and very quickly

01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:19.840
about mall space and very quickly
 

01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:22.170
about mall space and very quickly
liberalized context like the kind of

01:58:22.170 --> 01:58:22.180
liberalized context like the kind of
 

01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:24.660
liberalized context like the kind of

you know transition to political

01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:27.970
you know transition to political
 

01:58:27.970 --> 01:58:29.700
you know transition to political
democracy and there the malfunctions

01:58:29.700 --> 01:58:29.710
democracy and there the malfunctions
 

01:58:29.710 --> 01:58:31.680
democracy and there the malfunctions
quite differently I would suggest and

01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:31.690
quite differently I would suggest and
 

01:58:31.690 --> 01:58:33.840
quite differently I would suggest and
obviously it's heterogeneous and we have

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:33.850
obviously it's heterogeneous and we have
 

01:58:33.850 --> 01:58:35.340
obviously it's heterogeneous and we have
to be very contextual about our

01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:35.350
to be very contextual about our
 

01:58:35.350 --> 01:58:38.700
to be very contextual about our
responses and historically base but in

01:58:38.700 --> 01:58:38.710
responses and historically base but in
 

01:58:38.710 --> 01:58:41.730
responses and historically base but in
many cases like in Ottawa and for

01:58:41.730 --> 01:58:41.740
many cases like in Ottawa and for
 

01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:43.170
many cases like in Ottawa and for
instance there's a case of a mall that

01:58:43.170 --> 01:58:43.180
instance there's a case of a mall that
 

01:58:43.180 --> 01:58:44.880
instance there's a case of a mall that
was built right on top of the torture

01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:44.890
was built right on top of the torture
 

01:58:44.890 --> 01:58:47.370
was built right on top of the torture
Center that's also the case in in many

01:58:47.370 --> 01:58:47.380
Center that's also the case in in many
 

01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:49.490
Center that's also the case in in many
places in Chile where these large

01:58:49.490 --> 01:58:49.500
places in Chile where these large
 

01:58:49.500 --> 01:58:51.209
places in Chile where these large
shopping centers will

01:58:51.209 --> 01:58:51.219
shopping centers will
 

01:58:51.219 --> 01:58:54.569
shopping centers will
function as forms of amnesia so the mall

01:58:54.569 --> 01:58:54.579
function as forms of amnesia so the mall
 

01:58:54.579 --> 01:58:58.259
function as forms of amnesia so the mall
you know and then in upper varios or

01:58:58.259 --> 01:58:58.269
you know and then in upper varios or
 

01:58:58.269 --> 01:59:00.870
you know and then in upper varios or
whatever so you get rather than this

01:59:00.870 --> 01:59:00.880
whatever so you get rather than this
 

01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:03.719
whatever so you get rather than this
kind of sedimented public expression you

01:59:03.719 --> 01:59:03.729
kind of sedimented public expression you
 

01:59:03.729 --> 01:59:06.989
kind of sedimented public expression you
get forms of kind of amnesia of erasing

01:59:06.989 --> 01:59:06.999
get forms of kind of amnesia of erasing
 

01:59:06.999 --> 01:59:09.689
get forms of kind of amnesia of erasing
the past of things that go in line with

01:59:09.689 --> 01:59:09.699
the past of things that go in line with
 

01:59:09.699 --> 01:59:11.430
the past of things that go in line with

official discourses and official
narratives and the mall becomes a site

01:59:13.799 --> 01:59:13.809
narratives and the mall becomes a site
 

01:59:13.809 --> 01:59:16.469

of this kind of celebration of economic

01:59:16.469 --> 01:59:16.479
of this kind of celebration of economic

obliterated all kinds of forms of
historical memory so I think you're

01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:22.570
historical memory so I think you're
 

01:59:22.570 --> 01:59:24.899
historical memory so I think you're
right in and I guess I wanted to point

01:59:24.899 --> 01:59:24.909
right in and I guess I wanted to point
 

01:59:24.909 --> 01:59:26.189
right in and I guess I wanted to point
out it's something else that I think is

01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:26.199
out it's something else that I think is
 

01:59:26.199 --> 01:59:29.009
out it's something else that I think is
very very important in your presentation

01:59:29.009 --> 01:59:29.019
very very important in your presentation
 

01:59:29.019 --> 01:59:31.709
very very important in your presentation
and that is the way the function of the

01:59:31.709 --> 01:59:31.719
and that is the way the function of the
 

01:59:31.719 --> 01:59:35.640
and that is the way the function of the
you know eradication of article 27 and

01:59:35.640 --> 01:59:35.650
you know eradication of article 27 and
 

01:59:35.650 --> 01:59:39.540
you know eradication of article 27 and
the helo system really served as an you

01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:39.550
the helo system really served as an you
 

01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:42.060
the helo system really served as an you
know mobile mobilizing structural factor

01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:42.070
know mobile mobilizing structural factor
 

01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:44.069
know mobile mobilizing structural factor
for populations and especially

01:59:44.069 --> 01:59:44.079
for populations and especially
 

01:59:44.079 --> 01:59:46.319
for populations and especially
indigenous peoples to be displaced and

indigenous peoples to be displaced and
 

01:59:46.329 --> 01:59:48.509
indigenous peoples to be displaced and
then come to something like Los Angeles

01:59:48.509 --> 01:59:48.519
then come to something like Los Angeles
 

01:59:48.519 --> 01:59:50.700
then come to something like Los Angeles
and what we saw was the effects of that

01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:50.710
and what we saw was the effects of that
 

01:59:50.710 --> 01:59:54.439
and what we saw was the effects of that
we're all kinds of heterogeneous

01:59:54.439 --> 01:59:54.449
we're all kinds of heterogeneous
