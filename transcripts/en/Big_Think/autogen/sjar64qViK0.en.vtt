out there and and some people have a
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.240
out there and and some people have a
little bit more commitment to that idea

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250
little bit more commitment to that idea
 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.350

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.690
I think people really want to be
adventurous with wine but you've got to

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700
adventurous with wine but you've got to
 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.340

everybody's threshold of adventurism is
 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.150
everybody's threshold of adventurism is
the same so asking a lot of questions is

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160
the same so asking a lot of questions is
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.970
the same so asking a lot of questions is
a big part of it and not only just about

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
a big part of it and not only just about
 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.490
a big part of it and not only just about
the style of wine and the you know the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500
the style of wine and the you know the
 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
the style of wine and the you know the
flavor profile of wines but I think the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
flavor profile of wines but I think the
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.540
flavor profile of wines but I think the
budget is is a big part of it too and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
budget is is a big part of it too and
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.029
budget is is a big part of it too and
it's always the awkward point in a

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
it's always the awkward point in a
 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.920
it's always the awkward point in a
discussion with a guest I think that

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930
discussion with a guest I think that
 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.299
discussion with a guest I think that
people get nervous about talking about

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309
people get nervous about talking about
 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.980
people get nervous about talking about
their price point or their budget which

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
their price point or their budget which
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.170
their price point or their budget which
is it shouldn't be that way I mean you

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180
is it shouldn't be that way I mean you
 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.570
is it shouldn't be that way I mean you
know I think that there's an old

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
know I think that there's an old
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.429
know I think that there's an old
mentality about the way some ways are

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
mentality about the way some ways are
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.929
mentality about the way some ways are
and this whole thing that they're gonna

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
and this whole thing that they're gonna
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.520
and this whole thing that they're gonna
judge you or that they're gonna try and

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530

think a good sommelier never wants to

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979
think a good sommelier never wants to
 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.170
think a good sommelier never wants to
put someone out of their comfort zone

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
put someone out of their comfort zone
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.060
put someone out of their comfort zone
with the with the wine that they're

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
with the with the wine that they're
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.100
with the with the wine that they're
gonna drink and I think being upfront

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
gonna drink and I think being upfront
 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.929
gonna drink and I think being upfront
about a budget is something that makes

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939
about a budget is something that makes
 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.090
about a budget is something that makes
our life easier because if if some of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
our life easier because if if some of
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.920

these are recommending wines we may

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930
these are recommending wines we may
 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.630
these are recommending wines we may
recommend a certain type of wine with

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
recommend a certain type of wine with
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.719
recommend a certain type of wine with
many different you know price points but

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729
many different you know price points but
 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.429
many different you know price points but
if you give a budget right from the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
if you give a budget right from the
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.760
if you give a budget right from the
beginning we can kind of go you know

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770
beginning we can kind of go you know
 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.810
beginning we can kind of go you know
horizontally within that budget and give

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
horizontally within that budget and give
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.520
horizontally within that budget and give
you a lot more great options in that in

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530
you a lot more great options in that in
 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.649
you a lot more great options in that in
that sweet spot so there's a lot of ways

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
that sweet spot so there's a lot of ways
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.910
that sweet spot so there's a lot of ways
to do it I think it's always awkward cuz

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
to do it I think it's always awkward cuz
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.630
to do it I think it's always awkward cuz
you don't know if somebody's on the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
you don't know if somebody's on the
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.219
you don't know if somebody's on the
first date and you know you don't want

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229
first date and you know you don't want
 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.480
first date and you know you don't want
to embarrass somebody you know who's

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
to embarrass somebody you know who's
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.639
to embarrass somebody you know who's
selecting the wine so I think you know

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649
selecting the wine so I think you know
 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.929
selecting the wine so I think you know
if you're looking at a wine list and you

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939
if you're looking at a wine list and you
 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.819
if you're looking at a wine list and you
can kind of point out a wine that's in a

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829
can kind of point out a wine that's in a
 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.350
can kind of point out a wine that's in a
particular price range that can be a

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360
particular price range that can be a
 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.330
particular price range that can be a
good way to indicate some way what

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
good way to indicate some way what
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.429
good way to indicate some way what
you're looking to do but I think being

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
you're looking to do but I think being
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.929
you're looking to do but I think being
comfortable with the idea of a solely a

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939
comfortable with the idea of a solely a
 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.029
comfortable with the idea of a solely a

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
and and then learning to trust them I
 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.740
and and then learning to trust them I
think is important not every simile I

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750
think is important not every simile I
 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.270
think is important not every simile I
guess is completely trustworthy but

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280
guess is completely trustworthy but
 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.890
guess is completely trustworthy but
there's more and more coming along I

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
there's more and more coming along I
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.790
there's more and more coming along I
think the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
think the
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.710
think the
the culture is changing and there's a

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720
the culture is changing and there's a
 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.160
the culture is changing and there's a
lot of opportunity to learn from someone

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170
lot of opportunity to learn from someone
 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.420
lot of opportunity to learn from someone
when you're explaining the kind of wine

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430
when you're explaining the kind of wine
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.550
when you're explaining the kind of wine
that you want to have to so many I think

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
that you want to have to so many I think
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.820
that you want to have to so many I think
remembering the kind of wine you had is

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830
remembering the kind of wine you had is
 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.960
remembering the kind of wine you had is
important I mean nowadays with

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970
important I mean nowadays with
 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.670
important I mean nowadays with
smartphones it's so easy like just

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
smartphones it's so easy like just
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.900
smartphones it's so easy like just
snapping a picture of a label and

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910
snapping a picture of a label and
 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.880
snapping a picture of a label and
keeping it on your phone it inevitably

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890
keeping it on your phone it inevitably
 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.350
keeping it on your phone it inevitably
when people are able to do that even if

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360
when people are able to do that even if
 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.700
when people are able to do that even if
I don't have that wine on the list

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710
I don't have that wine on the list
 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.230
I don't have that wine on the list
I know wines that are similar in style

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240
I know wines that are similar in style
 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.550
I know wines that are similar in style
of that so I'm really able to work

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560
of that so I'm really able to work
 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.980
of that so I'm really able to work
within that realm but remembering a

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990
within that realm but remembering a
 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.300
within that realm but remembering a
grape varietal that was in it or

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310
grape varietal that was in it or
 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.520
grape varietal that was in it or
remembering you know region it was from

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530
remembering you know region it was from
 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.290
remembering you know region it was from
that makes it easier but if that doesn't

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300
that makes it easier but if that doesn't
 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.330
that makes it easier but if that doesn't
work then being able to describe the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340
work then being able to describe the
 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.700
work then being able to describe the
flavor profiles is can be difficult and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710
flavor profiles is can be difficult and
 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.290
flavor profiles is can be difficult and
I think it's a perception thing and
