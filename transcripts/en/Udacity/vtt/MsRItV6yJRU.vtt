00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Awhile back I've told you about the Simpson's paradox and it was

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
surprising how easy it was to draw the false conclusion from data.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Today I will give you a deep insight of the common mistakes that's being made

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in interpreting statistical data by confusing correlation with causation.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'll show you example where data is correlated

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and why it's tempted to confuse correlation with causation.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So both of those are words that start with a C and very frequently I read newspaper articles

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that deeply confuse both the relationship of correlation and causation--so let's dive in.
