00:00:09.378 --> 00:00:12.940
You know, in our increasingly
interconnected world,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.115
when so many signals are
competing for our attention,

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:20.225
we are essentially flooded
by too much possibility.

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:24.316
We are overcome by
bandwidth anxiety because

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:28.350
of the sheer paradox of
choice, the paralysis,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.610
the vertigo of freedom, as
Timothy Leary says, we almost

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.920
like, can't help but suffer from
an acute affliction of FOLO,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.890
otherwise known as the
fear of missing out.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.475
And I'm reminded of a line from
the movie, "Mr. Nobody," when

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:45.865
he says, "as long
as you don't choose,

00:00:45.865 --> 00:00:48.090
everything remains possible."

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.372
And there's kind of
safety in abstaining

00:00:50.372 --> 00:00:52.940
from actually
committing to anything.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.690
As long as you don't
commit, you literally

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.920
reside in a multiverse of
infinite possibilities.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.737
You reside in a state of
quantum super position.

00:01:02.737 --> 00:01:04.195
The minute you
commit to something,

00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:07.870
when you choose one
thing, you collapse

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.270
all other possibilities and
you find yourself instead,

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.140
in the desert of
the real, that state

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.581
of potentiality, that state
before you make that commitment

00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:20.036
is a state where
anything can happen.

00:01:20.036 --> 00:01:22.260
The minute you choose
one thing, you've

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.955
effectively said no
to everything else.

00:01:24.955 --> 00:01:28.150
And there's a gnawing
anxiety in realizing

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.480
that you can't
possibly have it all.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.190
You can't possibly
mainline space and time

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.044
through the optic nerve and
have and swallow it whole.

00:01:37.044 --> 00:01:39.115
Because that whole line
from the Bible about

00:01:39.115 --> 00:01:41.115
you know, Adam taking
from the tree of knowledge

00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:42.398
and biting the apple.

00:01:42.398 --> 00:01:44.350
You know, we didn't
just bite the apple,

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.500
we swallowed it whole.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.730
We want the whole thing.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.296
And I think that's the reason
that we suffer from this,

00:01:50.296 --> 00:01:52.520
from FOLO, you know,
because it's just,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.620
it's intestinal to
who we really are

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.350
and what we really
long for, so much

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.520
more so much more than what
we're currently privy to.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.465
For that reason, I think
that agitation is actually,

00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:04.285
actually not a bad thing.

00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:07.480
You know, if we suffer
from fear of missing out,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.230
it just shows that you have
an intuition that there's

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.240
something greater.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.640
Maybe I'm romanticizing the
sort of affliction of our age,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.540
but that's certainly
what I choose to think.
