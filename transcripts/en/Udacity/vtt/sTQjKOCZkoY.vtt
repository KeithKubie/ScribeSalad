00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.130
Now it's your turn to implement getProfile in conference

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.700
API. Look for where it says TODO and then you're

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.600
going to need to add the code to get the

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.700
profile from the datastore. When you've written the code, go

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.740
ahead and run the app on local host and use

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.774
the APIs Explorer to try out the getProfile function. When

00:00:18.774 --> 00:00:22.308
you're done, go ahead and finish the code statements here.

00:00:22.308 --> 00:00:25.440
Enter the code to get the user ID, enter the

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.963
code to get the key, enter the code

00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:31.460
to get the profile entity out of the datastore.
