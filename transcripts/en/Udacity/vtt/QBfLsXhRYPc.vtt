00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
So in summary, the questions you want to ask are

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.210
how big can this be,

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.960
how much of it can we get,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.910
what's the growth rate of the market,

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.390
is the market itself declining

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.430
or is it in flux

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.500
or is it taking off?

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.200
and most importantly here

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.990
is talk to customers and the sales channel,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.470
and next important is

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.530
you can get some pretty good market size estimates by

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.550
competitive approximation

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.640
if it's an existing or resegmented market,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.370
or even if we're going to clone a market outside the US.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.300
Next important is

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.540
Wall Street Analytic Reports are great.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.480
Market research firms like Forrester and Gartner

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.070
are great,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.970
but something to keep in mind about market research

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.310
forecasts going forward.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.220
Market research data is wonderful

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.320
on the size of markets in the past,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.730
but if market researchers were great at predicting the future,

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.580
they'd actually be running hedge funds,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.480
so one of the things I don't accept from my students is,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.980
"and it's going to be a $40 billion business in the next 7 years."

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.170
Well, what's its size now?

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.380
Zero.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.819
So therefore, I just don't accept

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.580
guesses from a market research firm,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.970
unless you've actually cross validated that

00:01:08.970 --> 99:59:59.000
with some really heavy customer input from outside the building.
