00:00:30.912 --> 00:00:32.725
Blue whales are the largest animals

00:00:32.725 --> 00:00:34.644
that have ever roamed the planet.

00:00:34.644 --> 00:00:37.785
They're at least two times as big as the biggest dinosaurs,

00:00:38.954 --> 00:00:40.275
"That's big!"

00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:41.736
the length of a basketball court,

00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:44.781
and as heavy as 40 African elephants.

00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:46.579
If that's not enough to make you marvel,

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.659
here's something that will.

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.367
They're grown to this enormous size

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:54.705
by feeding exclusively on tiny shrimp-like creatures called krill

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.568
that are no bigger than your little finger.

00:01:00.568 --> 00:01:02.559
In many ways, the sheer size of krill

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.940
seems to have driven the evolution of the blue whale.

00:01:08.032 --> 00:01:10.093
See, krill are so small

00:01:10.093 --> 00:01:12.132
but are found in dense patches.

00:01:12.132 --> 00:01:13.133
For increased efficiency,

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.467
blue whales have evolved

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:15.715
to use a feeding strategy

00:01:15.715 --> 00:01:17.596
called lunge feeding.

00:01:17.596 --> 00:01:20.846
Basically, the whale accelerates towards a prey patch

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:22.900
and opens its mouth wide.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.062
To increase the capacity, its mouth expands.

00:01:26.062 --> 00:01:28.178
The special, accordion-like blubber layer

00:01:28.178 --> 00:01:30.441
that extends from its snout to its belly button

00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:32.944
enables the whale to engulf large quantities

00:01:32.944 --> 00:01:35.176
of prey-laden water.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.376
With each giant gulp,

00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:48.129
the whale takes in 125% of its body weight

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:50.300
in water and krill.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.968
The whale must then expel the water

00:01:51.968 --> 00:01:54.227
while retaining the yummy krill.

00:01:54.227 --> 00:01:56.446
To do this, it uses its baleen,

00:01:56.446 --> 00:01:58.272
the comb-like structure made of the same stuff

00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:00.884
our nails and hair are made of,

00:02:00.884 --> 00:02:02.616
and its tongue.

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.909
It's pretty crazy that the blue whale's heart

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:12.674
is as big as a small car,

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:15.139
a child could crawl through its arteries,

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:17.255
its tongue weighs as much as an elephant,

00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:20.051
but its esophagus is so small,

00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:23.263
the whale could choke on a loaf of bread.

00:02:23.263 --> 00:02:24.844
These whales are really not designed

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:27.415
to feed on anything larger than krill.

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.629
It's estimated that blue whales eat four tons of krill per day.

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:36.889
Because of the incredible design,

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.541
each dive provides the blue whale

00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:42.181
with 90 times as much energy as is used.

00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:46.937
Every mouthful of krill provides almost 480,000 calories,

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:52.160
the same amount you get from eating 1,900 hamburgers.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.680
But, why are blue whales so big?

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.186
Blue whales are considerably larger

00:02:59.186 --> 00:03:02.047
than the largest living land animal, the elephant.

00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:03.691
The heavier an animal is,

00:03:03.691 --> 00:03:06.204
the greater its relative surface area.

00:03:06.204 --> 00:03:07.519
As weight increases,

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.680
there's a point at which the legs of that animal

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.421
would simply collapse.

00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:14.263
That explains why elephants don't stand

00:03:14.263 --> 00:03:17.179
on the delicate legs of a horse.

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:19.181
They need legs shaped like stout pedestals

00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:22.341
to hold their bodies up against gravity.

00:03:25.234 --> 00:03:28.032
In water, the situation is quite different.

00:03:28.032 --> 00:03:30.705
Buoyancy counteracts the gravitational pull on the body

00:03:30.705 --> 00:03:33.243
and their great bulk is therefore partially supported

00:03:33.243 --> 00:03:35.080
by the water.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.164
So, the ocean is a great place for species

00:03:37.164 --> 00:03:39.499
that want to grow bigger.

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:42.333
The other secret to their size is their diet.

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:44.045
By evolving such a huge mouth,

00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:46.640
the whale's have specialized to catch enormous quantities

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.267
of highly abundant and nutritious prey,

00:03:49.267 --> 00:03:53.427
which provides the energy needed to grow so big.

00:03:56.063 --> 00:03:58.178
But, now maybe you're wondering

00:03:58.178 --> 00:04:00.771
why blue whales aren't any bigger?

00:04:00.771 --> 00:04:02.869
After all, the ocean sounds like nirvana

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:04.447
for any growing beast.

00:04:04.447 --> 00:04:07.179
Well, while lunge feeding may have allowed blue whales

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:08.640
to become the biggest animal

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.337
to have ever roamed the planet,

00:04:10.337 --> 00:04:13.819
by enabling them to feed efficiently in dense prey patches,

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.656
it isn't cost free.

00:04:15.656 --> 00:04:18.776
Scientists compared all the costs involved with lunge feeding

00:04:18.776 --> 00:04:21.459
to the energy gained from the krill they eat.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.832
What they found is that when the whale's body increases in size,

00:04:24.832 --> 00:04:27.375
the energy that body demands rises faster

00:04:27.375 --> 00:04:31.495
than the extra energy they get from their food.

00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:35.592
Feeding whales needs 15 times the energy required to remain still

00:04:35.592 --> 00:04:39.556
and 5 times more energy than used when swimming.

00:04:39.556 --> 00:04:40.959
Calculations show

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:44.782
that the largest a lunge feeder can grow is 33 meters,

00:04:44.782 --> 00:04:47.313
pretty much blue whale size.

00:04:47.313 --> 00:04:49.780
Turns out blue whales have a lot to thank krill for:

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.406
neat, evolutionary adaptations

00:04:51.406 --> 00:04:54.872
that would not have been possible if krill were not so small.

00:04:54.872 --> 00:04:56.924
It's incredible that these tiny creatures

00:04:56.924 --> 00:04:59.739
have allowed blue whales to really push the limits

00:04:59.739 --> 00:05:01.557
of size on our planet.

00:05:01.557 --> 00:05:03.671
Makes you wonder if that old adage,

00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:05.518
"You are what you eat,"

00:05:05.518 --> 00:05:09.131
really does apply in blue whale world.
