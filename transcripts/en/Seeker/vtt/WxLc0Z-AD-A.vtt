00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.510
What does it mean to “burn fat”.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.050
Where does it go?

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.109
Despite what Doctor Who suggests, it doesn’t
just grow legs and walk away.

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:13.380
It actually disappears into thin air!

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.290
Hey guys julia here for DNews

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.740
New year brings new resolutions.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.280
For many that means getting back to the gym.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.530
“Feel the burn!” seems to be the rallying
cry for exercise enthusiasts everywhere.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.310
And how many magazines have flashy covers
like “10 new ways to burn fat in the new

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.310
year!”.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.310
But what does that even mean?

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.310
How can you “burn fat”?

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.310
And where does it go?

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.079
When you eat too much protein or carbs your
body converts it and stores it as fat.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.180
To get your body to “burn” up these cells,
you body has to use up the immediate energy

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.550
from food, and dip into your energy reserves.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.079
In other words, you burn more calories than
you take in so you have to use your fat stores.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.399
And that adipose tissue or fat, is made up
of fat cells called adipocytes filled with

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.609
molecules called triglycerides.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.319
When you’re trying to “burn fat”, you’re
really trying to get rid of these triglycerides,

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:00.209
high levels of which are linked with heart
disease and metabolic syndrome.

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:02.819
Triglycerides are made up of glycerol and
three fatty acids.

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:06.070
In order to burn fat you have to oxidize these
molecules.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.320
Now the complete oxidization of a single Triglyceride
involves many biochemical processes and enzymes.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.520
But the process can be boiled down to a single
chemical equation.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.460
C55H104O6+78O2→55CO2+52H2O+energy
Now this may look complicated but what’s

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.960
basically happening here is that when you're
exercising you’re tapping into your fat

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.409
stores, so you are “oxidizing” or breaking
down that molecule to release carbon dioxide,

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.409
water and energy.

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.070
I bet you’re imagining that most of that
fat gets turned into energy, like your gym

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.869
teacher or personal trainer tells you.

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.149
Well they’d be wrong.

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.130
According to a study published in the British
Medical Journal most of the fat turns into

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.049
carbon dioxide and water.

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:45.079
According to their calculations, 84% of an
adipose triglyceride is given off as CO2.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:50.880
So for example if you lose 10 kg of fat, 8.4
kg is exhaled as CO2.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.670
As the lead author says, when someone burns
fat, “most of the mass is breathed out as

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.859
carbon dioxide.

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:57.429
It goes into thin air."

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.390
The rest is given off as water in some way
or another, like in urine, sweat, tears or

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.920
other bodily fluids.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.560
The authors also calculated about how much
carbon dioxide we give off on an average day.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.690
Even without hitting the treadmill, with every
breath we take, we give off 33 g of carbon

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.690
dioxide.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.690
Woohoo!

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.141
But before you get too excited about losing
all that CO2 and burning all that fat, the

00:02:17.141 --> 00:02:21.660
authors also note that a single muffin contains
20% of your daily intake of energy.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.400
A single, lousy, muffin.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400
Ugh.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.490
So a small amount of food can quickly make
all that exercise for naught.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.780
But if you do want to get more bang for your
breath, you can actually measure how much

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.370
fat you’re burning by measuring your breath.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.370
At CES this year, Seattle based company Levl
previewed one such device.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.370
It measures the amount of acetone on your
breath, which is another by-product of fat

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.370
catabolism.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.370
To measure the level of acetone, a person
breathes into a little pod, then places the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.370
pod into the device which will then display
a number 1-5 indicating the level of “fat

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.370
burning”.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.370
So if you want to stick to that new year's
resolution...take a deep breath, hit the gym

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.370
and feel the burn.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.370
Losing weight in the future will be weird.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.110
No only will your breath keep track of how
much fat you’re burning but an algorithm

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.030
will decide what you should be eating!

00:02:45.030 --> 00:03:00.340
