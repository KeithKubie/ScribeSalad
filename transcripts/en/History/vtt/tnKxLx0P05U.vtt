00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.290
- Morning, guys.

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.620
Gentlemen.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:03.960
NARRATOR: Rick Lagina
joins Craig Tester

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.960
and other members of
the Oak Island team

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.040
at the Money Pit site.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.670
Now that drilling has
begun at a second location,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.460
they are hopeful
they will soon reach

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.460
a mysterious
30-foot-wide void located

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.830
at a depth of some 170 feet
and which was identified

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.080
earlier by seismic scanning.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.330
Much talked about, 87.5.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.580
I pulled out H8 from last year.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.880
A very, you know, interesting
and important hole,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.420
and it spawned the
large diameter caisson.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.210
And today, we're very
close with that one.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.880
We're into open
ground that hasn't

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.920
had any real information on
it, you know, plus or minus

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.750
5 feet away from it.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.080
We've got a really relatively
virgin target very close

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.080
to what I think
is the Money Pit.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.500
This should be interesting.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.420
You know, considering
what came out of H8,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.330
this should be a real
hot zone for artifacts.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.750
NARRATOR: Using a
specialized sonic rig,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.420
the Choice Drilling team will
extract core samples of earth

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.380
and any objects contained within
at intervals every 10 feet.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.380
These samples will
then be transferred

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.790
into a plastic
sleeve so that they

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.420
can be carefully examined by
hand for any important clues

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.120
or possible treasure.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.460
Well, here we go.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.790
What depth, Brennan?

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.290
160.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.380
That's really gravelly,
but it's mostly limestone.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.920
You see that tan color?

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.620
That's limestone.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.620
And this silt, there's, you
know, organics in there.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.250
What is that?

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.750
That's weird.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.380
I think this is coconut fiber.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.960
That's really interesting.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.620
NARRATOR: At the Money Pit,
while searching the spoils

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.790
of the exploratory borehole
known as H7.5, Rick Lagina,

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.170
Craig Tester, and members
of the Oak Island team have

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.120
just made an amazing discovery.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.790
When you look at the
historical records,

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.000
they did find, you
know, what they believed

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.420
to be coconut fiber
in the Money Pit

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.830
when they were excavating it.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.790
So it's not beyond the
realm of possibility.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.750
Exactly.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.170
Exactly.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.750
NARRATOR: Coconut fiber
in the Money Pit, 160

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.330
feet deep below the surface?

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.170
But if so, how did it
get there, and why?

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.120
In 1804, when the Money Pit
was excavated by the Onslow

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.830
Company, searchers
reported finding

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.380
a large amount of coconut
fiber at a depth of 60 feet.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.380
Given that the nearest
coconut trees are located some

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.380
1,500 miles south
of Nova Scotia,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.040
they concluded that it had been
used to make a kind of rope

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.330
that would enable depositors to
lower something of great value

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.000
down into the shaft.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.170
Could the discovery
of coconut fiber

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.710
be an important indication
that Rick, Marty, and the team

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.670
have finally located the site
of the original Money Pit?

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.620
Cut.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.380
Look, you can see that ax.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.880
See that?

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.210
Yeah.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.380
Somebody's hit these
things with an ax.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.120
You can see the bevel of the ax.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.710
This is interesting.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.460
And what are we at again
from the top here, 1--

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.120
171.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.790
171.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.710
NARRATOR: Ax-cut wood found
approximately 170 feet deep

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.250
underground and nearly
the same depth where

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.920
recent seismic scanning
revealed a mysterious

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.670
30-foot-wide chamber?

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.670
Could the Oak Island
team have just

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.920
discovered solid evidence of
the legendary Chappell vault?

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.380
Well, we are
going to want to bag

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.750
and tag these pieces of
wood in through here.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.750
There's quite a bit of
limestone-rich material,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.380
the matrix.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.420
There's also a very
large rounded clasps.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.040
We've never seen
anything like that.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.330
And this minced-up stuff here?

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.420
That's really interesting.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.250
This has all just
collected somehow in, like--

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.750
in the corner of something
or in a crevice of something,

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.960
you know?

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.790
Otherwise, this would be mixed.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.120
You know, I wish I could make a
very firm statement whenever we

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.790
drill that, OK, we're
in this structure,

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.210
or we're in this shaft,
or we're in this wall.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.460
But we don't know
the underground.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.290
That has been proven to us
over and over and over again.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.960
At this point, we have a lot
of data, the coring samples

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.210
that we've brought
up, and from that

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.210
maybe then get an
understanding of how

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.080
these wood structures align.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.920
That's my hope.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.290
But how we pursue it,
I don't know as of yet.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.210
You have to have faith that
what you're doing is right.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.460
I mean, like all the
searchers before, I mean,

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.290
it was always the next
day, the next hole,

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.170
the next 10 feet of the shaft.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.460
If you don't believe that,
then it's time to go home.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.960
When it gets tough, I go back
to Bobby Restall's journal.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.120
We made two inches today,
and they were happy.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.330
Yeah.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.620
Yeah, we came up
dry, but we tried.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.000
Yeah.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.500
And we didn't quit,
and neither did they.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.920
Nope.
