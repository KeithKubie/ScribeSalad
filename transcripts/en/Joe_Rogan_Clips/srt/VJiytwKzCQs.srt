1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,510
Using tools,
so islands to go.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,030
Apparently they use tools like to get,
um,

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,200
like they'll stick sticks
into a ant hills to Cannes,

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,560
but they're also use rocks to break
things open or do you want to be,

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,190
I would imagine Abe's would follow suit.
I think they've,

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,420
what they're saying is they're saying
officially that they've entered into the

7
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:26,180
stone age. Oh boy. So
like if we are watching,

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,630
if you saw a human evolve from being a,

9
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:31,660
a person that you know what we,

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,240
whatever the fuck we used to look like
when they first figured out fish hooks

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,070
teaching to today, you know, there's
many, many generations of change and all,

12
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:42,770
all sorts of different shit that we
learned that we are watching literally the

13
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:47,570
birth of that separation between like
the regular chimps that are just chilling

14
00:00:47,571 --> 00:00:50,840
in the forest to the chimps that are
starting to figure out tools and weapons.

15
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,940
Like the first day we see a chimp
make a fucking spear like a sphere,

16
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,640
sharpen it up and stab another chimp

17
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,900
death. Yeah. Yeah. Same
chimps are becoming woke.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,080
Is that what's happening? Like they're
becoming an enlightened and smarter.

19
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,290
I don't think just chimps. There was
one with an orangutan. It was amazing.

20
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:13,700
I'm around town was spearfishing. Oh
No, dude, you gotta see it. It's crazy.

21
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:14,943
It's really crazy.

22
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,430
It's a beautiful photo of me walking down
the highway with like a briefcase soon.

23
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,790
I don't think it's going to be,
they're freaky man. That freaks me out.

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,670
But it is a,
so we're witnessing evolution.

25
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,410
They're learning things. And this one,
I think the issue was that this, uh,

26
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:31,780
orangutan had watched fishermen do this,

27
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,910
so he had apparently
watched some fishermen like
standing on a ledge and stab

28
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:39,760
fish. So he decided to try
to figure it out himself.

29
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,610
That makes sense. I mean, that's how all
creatures essentially, I mean, puppies,

30
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:46,040
kittens, they all learn. It's
just to be, it's to a limit.

31
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,790
They don't get past that sort of being
able to use tools to get the picture.

32
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,250
That's a wild,
it was bringing a video too,

33
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:56,390
so I thought there might've had video
of it, but, um, my dog opened his dog,

34
00:01:56,391 --> 00:02:01,210
his dog food container when I was
gone. Damn. A twist. A twist. Yes,

35
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,190
we did it.
I got to get a camera,

36
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:08,000
but I came home and that top was
twisted off in his belly was like

37
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,630
the rang Tang spear phishing.
I mean, that's crazy.

38
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,850
If you saw that in a movie, you would
say, that is fake. That is so easy.

39
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,070
That looks like a still from jungle book.
It's amazing.

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,990
It's an amazing photo photo framed.
Jimmy,

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,080
get a copy of that photo and
let's do that. That's really cool.

42
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,430
That fucker framed.
I talk about this picture all the time.

43
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,570
It's so wild. So fascinating. It
really looks like the jungle book.
