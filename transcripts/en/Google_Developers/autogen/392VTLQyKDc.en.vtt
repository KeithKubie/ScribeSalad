so you can do very very cool things do

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:40.260
so you can do very very cool things do
 

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:45.080
so you can do very very cool things do
you see though yeah which is them it's

it like very small amount of code but

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240
it like very small amount of code but

from so so we're making lots of changes
and as you saw we're removing lots of

this was this was something that we

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:12.870
this was this was something that we
 

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.540
this was this was something that we
realized last year we had way too many

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:14.550
realized last year we had way too many
 

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.250

graphs that we couldn't have humans
 

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.560
graphs that we couldn't have humans
track them anymore so we used some

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:18.570
track them anymore so we used some
 

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.030
track them anymore so we used some

actually not only detect when things get

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:24.930
actually not only detect when things get
 

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.810
actually not only detect when things get
slower but when things get faster doing

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820
slower but when things get faster doing
 

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.970

we've been working for the past six

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:51.420
we've been working for the past six
 

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.110
we've been working for the past six
months on on a new animation back in

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120
months on on a new animation back in
 

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.970
months on on a new animation back in
that's going to replace the one that

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:55.980
that's going to replace the one that
 

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.000
that's going to replace the one that
drives SVG and and also the one that

00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.010
drives SVG and and also the one that
 

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.860

exposing a new API called the web

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:02.970
exposing a new API called the web
 

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.450
exposing a new API called the web
animations API now what's cool about

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:05.460
animations API now what's cool about
 

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:11.300
animations API now what's cool about
this API is it is timeline based and it

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:11.310
this API is it is timeline based and it
 

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.970
this API is it is timeline based and it
actually so here you know we have a new

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:13.980
actually so here you know we have a new
 

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.310
actually so here you know we have a new
animation object here but you can also

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320
animation object here but you can also
 

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.050
animation object here but you can also
group them together so you can actually

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.060
group them together so you can actually
 

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.850
group them together so you can actually
create fairly complex animations that

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:19.860
create fairly complex animations that
 

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.950
create fairly complex animations that
are that are all synchronized so let me

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:21.960
are that are all synchronized so let me
 

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:27.400
are that are all synchronized so let me
show you an example of how that works

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:27.410
show you an example of how that works
 

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:32.720
show you an example of how that works
turn on the tablet here unlock it ok

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:32.730
turn on the tablet here unlock it ok
 

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.710
turn on the tablet here unlock it ok
cool so here is a simple animation here

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720
cool so here is a simple animation here
 

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.600
cool so here is a simple animation here
because you can see I'm running on a

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:38.610
because you can see I'm running on a
 

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.850
because you can see I'm running on a
table here so I've got this is actually

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:40.860
table here so I've got this is actually
 

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.790
table here so I've got this is actually
much smoother than that the problem is

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800
much smoother than that the problem is
 

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.730

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.660
curves here and you know ease in Enys
out and now of course we don't have the

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:56.670

they started by doing a polyfill and
 

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.690
they started by doing a polyfill and
that's what polymer uses them as well

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:20.700
that's what polymer uses them as well
 

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.100

we make needs a test and so whether you

00:25:38.909 --> 00:25:38.919
we make needs a test and so whether you
 

00:25:38.919 --> 00:25:40.049
we make needs a test and so whether you
write that test when we write the test

00:25:40.049 --> 00:25:40.059
write that test when we write the test
 

00:25:40.059 --> 00:25:47.190
