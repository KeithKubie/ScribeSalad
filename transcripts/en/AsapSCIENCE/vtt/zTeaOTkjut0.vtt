00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:04.979
Marijuana is one of the most popular drugs for those who drink alcohol, but are there specific benefits

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.830
Or risks when taking them together what happens to your body and brain when you're drunk and stoned at the same time?

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.199
Alcohol affects your central nervous system by changing how your neurons communicate it suppresses the excitatory

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.899
neurotransmitter glutamate and increases the inhibitory

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.438
Neurotransmitter Gaba which causes information flow to become slow making you feel less perceive less and remember less

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:33.389
Weed on the other hand contains ThC which acts on the brains Cannabinoid receptors and causes some neurons in the brain to continually fire

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.399
Removing their normal refractory period Making your imagination and thoughts magnify

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.099
But because both alcohol and weed inhibit glutamate

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.909
Transmission a key part of your learning process [their] combined use is linked to poor memory [a] study using rats found that their ability to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.489
recognize

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.169
Objects was severely impaired when they were drunk and high of course

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:59.340
Consuming both will make you feel lit and studies show that even after taking two shots the ThC levels in participants blood plasma

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.548
Doubled compared to those who were stoned, but consumed a placebo drink meaning alcohol makes you more high

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.239
Participants also felt the effects of weed more quickly and reported a better high with a better mood and other euphoric effects

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.729
Researchers believe [that] this is due to vasodilation

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.450
alcohol causes smooth muscle cells in your arteries to relax

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.500
widening of the blood vessels and an increased blood flow all of which allows more thc to cross your alveolar Sac a part of the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.509
lung where gas Exchange occurs with the blood

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.670
Ultimately the alcohol is increasing ThC absorption other research has found that smoking dope may even reduce the damage alcohol dez on your liver

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.700
When you drink ethanol is metabolized by the enzyme cytochrome

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:47.369
P450 2e1 but after excessive drinking this process causes oxidative stress making cells in the liver become fatty known as steatosis

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:55.679
Cannabidiol [a] chemical component of marijuana was found to inhibit the cycle that causes this oxidative stress on your liver protecting it from damage

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.479
But before this becomes your go-to party Duo consider that marijuana prevents vomiting

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.258
It's one of the reasons medical marijuana is prescribed to chemotherapy patients to help ease their nausea, but in the case of alcohol poisoning

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.199
Vomiting is the body's way to remove excess alcohol

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.689
so being unable to vomit poses

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.989
serious health risks

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:20.669
