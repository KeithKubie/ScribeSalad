00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:06.527
- So in Palace of Curtains, III,

00:00:06.527 --> 00:00:09.544
we did a lot of investigation
on the painting.

00:00:09.544 --> 00:00:12.586
The varnish was not
something that Magritte

00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:14.409
would have chosen for this work.

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.162
We realized that this painting

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:18.530
should not be varnished.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.269
We first very carefully test solubility,

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.228
and then I removed the dirt
with an aqueous solution,

00:00:26.228 --> 00:00:28.591
and then the varnish

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:31.510
was removed with a solvent.

00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:35.908
After the varnish
removal, we started to see

00:00:35.908 --> 00:00:38.963
how the painting became
more three-dimensional,

00:00:38.963 --> 00:00:42.724
appreciating more the
very delicate shadowing

00:00:42.724 --> 00:00:46.811
that he does on each side of the forms.

00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:49.563
And in the case of the shape on the right,

00:00:49.563 --> 00:00:51.282
he did that in reserve.

00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:54.846
He painted everything else and left that

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:59.267
ground exposed to then
draw it and paint it.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:03.250
We revealed very clearly the ground layer,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.629
which had turned yellow.

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:08.566
He actually had painted
in that, in this shape

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.782
with white paint, added
white paint to the ground,

00:01:11.782 --> 00:01:15.722
almost re-creating a white cloud.

00:01:16.253 --> 00:01:20.234
Looking at the lettering,
you can easily tell

00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:23.612
that he used a very fluid paint,

00:01:23.612 --> 00:01:26.608
and almost continuously he drew it.

00:01:26.608 --> 00:01:30.833
So we realized that
possibly he would have used

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:34.654
not only oil, but added
a different mixture

00:01:34.654 --> 00:01:37.173
of paint to make the paint very fluid.

00:01:37.173 --> 00:01:39.830
He used probably a
quarter of an inch brush.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.956
It was not a calligraphy brush.

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:44.451
If he would have used a calligraphy brush,

00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:47.854
he couldn't have, be so precise

00:01:47.854 --> 00:01:50.929
in the thickness of the letters.

00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:53.148
The other thing that became more evident

00:01:53.148 --> 00:01:57.035
with the cleaning was
that you could clearly see

00:01:57.035 --> 00:01:59.395
the pencil marks around the shapes.

00:01:59.395 --> 00:02:03.710
He actually drew the shapes
before he painted them.

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:06.068
Well, now that the conservation,

00:02:06.068 --> 00:02:07.996
the cleaning of the painting is done,

00:02:07.996 --> 00:02:09.831
all the subtleties of the painting,

00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:12.327
which were obliterated by the varnish,

00:02:12.327 --> 00:02:15.508
they are clear now and you can also

00:02:15.508 --> 00:02:20.044
appreciate more the delicate
passages of the painting.
