structure inconsistent content and more
 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.749
structure inconsistent content and more
specifically it was made to handle this

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759
specifically it was made to handle this
 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.730
specifically it was made to handle this
sort of repeated structure in some very

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740
sort of repeated structure in some very
 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.129

simple settings so as you can see here

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139
simple settings so as you can see here
 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.170

we've got our old settings screen from

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180
we've got our old settings screen from
 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.170
we've got our old settings screen from
Gingerbread and this was already kind of

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
Gingerbread and this was already kind of
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.120
Gingerbread and this was already kind of
after a lot of extensions to what

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130
after a lot of extensions to what
 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.800
after a lot of extensions to what
ListView was was meant to do

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810
ListView was was meant to do
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.529
ListView was was meant to do
and sometimes the content isn't so

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539
and sometimes the content isn't so
 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.120
and sometimes the content isn't so
consistent so you've got different view

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130
consistent so you've got different view
 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.130
consistent so you've got different view
types floating around so on and so forth

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140
types floating around so on and so forth
 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.180
types floating around so on and so forth
and we just kind of kept adding features

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190
and we just kind of kept adding features
 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.590
and we just kind of kept adding features
but the core problem that ListView meant

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600
but the core problem that ListView meant
 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.290
but the core problem that ListView meant
to solve is how do you make it fast when

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300
to solve is how do you make it fast when
 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.240
to solve is how do you make it fast when
there's a ton of items hundreds

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
there's a ton of items hundreds
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.299
there's a ton of items hundreds
thousands possibly more creating views

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
thousands possibly more creating views
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.920
thousands possibly more creating views
themselves can be really expensive

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930
themselves can be really expensive
 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.049
themselves can be really expensive
especially on old devices back in

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
especially on old devices back in
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.420
especially on old devices back in
androids early days and memory is

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
androids early days and memory is
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.729
androids early days and memory is
limited so you can't just necessarily

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739
limited so you can't just necessarily
 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.680
limited so you can't just necessarily
create tens of thousands of views and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690
create tens of thousands of views and
 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.130
create tens of thousands of views and
deal with that all at one time and the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140
deal with that all at one time and the
 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.729
deal with that all at one time and the
answer is we cheat

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739
answer is we cheat
 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.570
answer is we cheat
so with ListView we do a trick with some

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580
so with ListView we do a trick with some
 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.210
so with ListView we do a trick with some
smoke and mirrors and really anyone who

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220
smoke and mirrors and really anyone who
 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.700
smoke and mirrors and really anyone who
works on UI development has a lot in

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
works on UI development has a lot in
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.160
works on UI development has a lot in
common with stage magicians stage

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170
common with stage magicians stage
 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.270
common with stage magicians stage
magicians use misdirection and other

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280
magicians use misdirection and other
 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.880
magicians use misdirection and other
sorts of tricks on stage to make you

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890
sorts of tricks on stage to make you
 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.200
sorts of tricks on stage to make you
think that you're seeing something that

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210
think that you're seeing something that
 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.440
think that you're seeing something that
you're really not and if it looks right

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
you're really not and if it looks right
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.499
you're really not and if it looks right
it is right so I mean what what they're

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509
it is right so I mean what what they're
 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.109
it is right so I mean what what they're
seeing is the UI in terms of what the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119
seeing is the UI in terms of what the
 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.230
seeing is the UI in terms of what the
user believes so the trick that we use

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
user believes so the trick that we use
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.300
user believes so the trick that we use
is that we only create and layout the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
is that we only create and layout the
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.660
is that we only create and layout the
views that the user can see right now

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670
views that the user can see right now
 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.230
views that the user can see right now
and as the user Scrolls we continue to

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240
and as the user Scrolls we continue to
 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.670
and as the user Scrolls we continue to
layout more items the image you should

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680
layout more items the image you should
 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.069
layout more items the image you should
have in your heads right now is that bit

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079
have in your heads right now is that bit
 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.510
have in your heads right now is that bit
from wallace and gromit where you're

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
from wallace and gromit where you're
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.249
from wallace and gromit where you're
quickly laying the track in front of the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
quickly laying the track in front of the
 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.859
quickly laying the track in front of the
moving train so that's basically how

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
moving train so that's basically how
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.109
moving train so that's basically how
ListView works and in order to enable

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119
ListView works and in order to enable
 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.260
ListView works and in order to enable
this ListView uses adapter components

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270
this ListView uses adapter components
 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.090
this ListView uses adapter components
now this is a component that's provided

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100
now this is a component that's provided
 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.179
now this is a component that's provided
by the application itself and it's used

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
by the application itself and it's used
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.889
by the application itself and it's used
to create and populate the item views on

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
to create and populate the item views on
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.810
to create and populate the item views on
demand you've got this getview method in

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
demand you've got this getview method in
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.300
demand you've got this getview method in
the adapter that is used to query the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310
the adapter that is used to query the
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.339
the adapter that is used to query the
adapter for a particular view to show a

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349
adapter for a particular view to show a
 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.360
adapter for a particular view to show a
data item that corresponds to a

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370
data item that corresponds to a
 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.869
data item that corresponds to a
ocular position in the list and the

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879
ocular position in the list and the
 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.610
ocular position in the list and the
extra trick that we do there is we also

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620
extra trick that we do there is we also
 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.100
extra trick that we do there is we also
pass in a special convertview that's

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110
pass in a special convertview that's
 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.470
pass in a special convertview that's
guaranteed to be of the same item types

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480
guaranteed to be of the same item types
 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.940
guaranteed to be of the same item types
if the adapter believes that new

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950
if the adapter believes that new
 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.369
if the adapter believes that new
position to be so that you can reuse the

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379
position to be so that you can reuse the
 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.780
position to be so that you can reuse the
same view and you don't have to pay the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790
same view and you don't have to pay the
 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.949
same view and you don't have to pay the
cost of inflation again and over time we

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959
cost of inflation again and over time we
 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.600
cost of inflation again and over time we
continued adding more and more features

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610
continued adding more and more features
 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.190
continued adding more and more features
to list view because they were things

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200
to list view because they were things
 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.699
to list view because they were things
that people needed in their apps and

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709
that people needed in their apps and
 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.920
that people needed in their apps and
this question kind of came up a lot so

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930
this question kind of came up a lot so
 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.780
this question kind of came up a lot so
ListView grew feature after feature

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790
ListView grew feature after feature
 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.839
ListView grew feature after feature
after feature and you can go back and

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849
after feature and you can go back and
 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.970
after feature and you can go back and
watch this talk from i/o 2010 if you

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980
watch this talk from i/o 2010 if you
 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.360
watch this talk from i/o 2010 if you
want to see a few of them what's the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370
want to see a few of them what's the
 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.069
want to see a few of them what's the
real this is really nice you should vote

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079
real this is really nice you should vote
 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.300
real this is really nice you should vote
you I enjoyed it if you want to see a

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310
you I enjoyed it if you want to see a
 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.610
you I enjoyed it if you want to see a
some of our classic classic UIs and some

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620
some of our classic classic UIs and some
 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.300
some of our classic classic UIs and some
of that talk as well yeah it's nice but

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310
of that talk as well yeah it's nice but
 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.319
of that talk as well yeah it's nice but
really as we kept adding features to

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329
really as we kept adding features to
 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:05.940
really as we kept adding features to
ListView we kind of hit this complexity

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950
ListView we kind of hit this complexity
 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.399
ListView we kind of hit this complexity
overdraft point we had so many features

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409
overdraft point we had so many features
 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.410
overdraft point we had so many features
that kind of sort of interacted with

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420
that kind of sort of interacted with
 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.660
that kind of sort of interacted with
each other but not really all of them a

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670
each other but not really all of them a
 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.780
each other but not really all of them a
little bit one-off and it was just all

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790
little bit one-off and it was just all
 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.270
little bit one-off and it was just all
of these long tail features that led to

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280
of these long tail features that led to
 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.509
of these long tail features that led to
a lot of very strange interactions and

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519
a lot of very strange interactions and
 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.400
a lot of very strange interactions and
what that meant in practice is that

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410
what that meant in practice is that
 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.900
what that meant in practice is that
everybody wrote their apps such that

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910
everybody wrote their apps such that
 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.909
everybody wrote their apps such that
things worked how they wanted it to but

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919
things worked how they wanted it to but
 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.289
things worked how they wanted it to but
a lot of times those things were really

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299
a lot of times those things were really
 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.879
a lot of times those things were really
just kind of the result of undefined

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889
just kind of the result of undefined
 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.589
just kind of the result of undefined
behavior and listviews implementation

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599
behavior and listviews implementation
 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.369

itself and once enough apps start doing
 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.170
itself and once enough apps start doing
that then that's de facto API that we

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180
that then that's de facto API that we
 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.569
that then that's de facto API that we
have to support any small change that we

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579
have to support any small change that we
 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.009
have to support any small change that we
make to listviews behavior that might

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019

someplace else we also had a lot of

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919
someplace else we also had a lot of

duplicated functionality in the ListView

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250
duplicated functionality in the ListView
 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.610
duplicated functionality in the ListView
like ListView selections or view focus

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620
like ListView selections or view focus
 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.530
like ListView selections or view focus
which ones do we use I mean the view

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540

things like keyboard focus as you

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569
things like keyboard focus as you
 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.110
things like keyboard focus as you
navigate around but ListView had its own

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120
navigate around but ListView had its own
 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.879
navigate around but ListView had its own
completely separate idea of this in

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889
completely separate idea of this in
 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.530
completely separate idea of this in
terms of the current selection a

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540
terms of the current selection a
 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.659

what configurations that you set up and

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840
what configurations that you set up and
 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.129
what configurations that you set up and
this led to a lot of overlap and not

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139
this led to a lot of overlap and not
 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.490
this led to a lot of overlap and not
only that but it meant that when you

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500
only that but it meant that when you
 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.170
only that but it meant that when you
start using more complex views in your

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180
start using more complex views in your
 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.350
start using more complex views in your
ListView items

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360
ListView items
 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.270
ListView items
you kind of have to switch over to this

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280
you kind of have to switch over to this
 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.260
you kind of have to switch over to this
set items can focus option that disables

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270
set items can focus option that disables
 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.179
set items can focus option that disables
lists use internal selection handling

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:31.189
lists use internal selection handling
 

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:32.619
lists use internal selection handling
and lets you use the view hierarchies

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:32.629
and lets you use the view hierarchies
 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:37.240
and lets you use the view hierarchies
focus handling instead similarly we had

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250
focus handling instead similarly we had
 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.860
focus handling instead similarly we had
the same issue around item click

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870
the same issue around item click
 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.839
the same issue around item click
listeners versus view click listeners

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849
listeners versus view click listeners
 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:42.640
listeners versus view click listeners
and other sorts of general touch

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650
and other sorts of general touch
 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.520
and other sorts of general touch
handling so ListView provided this very

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530
handling so ListView provided this very
 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.980
handling so ListView provided this very
nice convenience where you could set an

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990
nice convenience where you could set an
 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.360
nice convenience where you could set an
item click listener on the ListView

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370
item click listener on the ListView
 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.399
item click listener on the ListView
itself and get clicks for anything that

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:51.409
itself and get clicks for anything that
 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:53.230
itself and get clicks for anything that
happens in that list now this makes a

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240
happens in that list now this makes a
 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.070
happens in that list now this makes a
whole lot of sense

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080
whole lot of sense
 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.230
whole lot of sense
for lists that are really uniform where

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240
for lists that are really uniform where
 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.480
for lists that are really uniform where
you have a list of items and you just

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490
you have a list of items and you just
 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.129
you have a list of items and you just
want to pick something from it kind of

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139
want to pick something from it kind of
 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.749
want to pick something from it kind of
like the pop-up menus that we have from

can also just go ahead and attach click

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:09.469
can also just go ahead and attach click
 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.439

which one was going to handle the events

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:14.629
which one was going to handle the events
 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:17.080
which one was going to handle the events
was sometimes not always clear or

was sometimes not always clear or
 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.269

intuitive so people would ask us a lot

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:19.279
intuitive so people would ask us a lot
 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.279

the answer always always ended up being
 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.939
the answer always always ended up being
it depends it was like okay well how

really kind of complicates the developer

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930
really kind of complicates the developer
 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.240

effort was that ListView animations are

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860
effort was that ListView animations are
 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.999
effort was that ListView animations are
really really difficult and the core

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009
really really difficult and the core
 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:50.800
really really difficult and the core
problem is that adapters don't tell us

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810
problem is that adapters don't tell us
 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.260
problem is that adapters don't tell us
enough to do them smart so when you

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270
enough to do them smart so when you
 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.760
enough to do them smart so when you
change an adapter you you say notify

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770
change an adapter you you say notify
 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.490
change an adapter you you say notify
data set change and the assumption is

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500
data set change and the assumption is
 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.409

anything could have changed we're not

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419
anything could have changed we're not
 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.269
anything could have changed we're not
entirely sure what and we're just going

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:04.279
entirely sure what and we're just going
 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:05.980
entirely sure what and we're just going
to go ahead and rebind all the items

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990
to go ahead and rebind all the items
 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.110

kind of intuitive but all of these had

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400
kind of intuitive but all of these had
 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.980
kind of intuitive but all of these had
some really major limitations

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990
some really major limitations
 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.559
some really major limitations
most of these had to do with again the

00:06:29.559 --> 00:06:29.569
most of these had to do with again the
 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:31.240
most of these had to do with again the
internal implementation details of

you just end up making this face at

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639
you just end up making this face at
 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:44.240
you just end up making this face at
ListView yeah look at these the regret

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.250
ListView yeah look at these the regret
 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.490
ListView yeah look at these the regret
in his face like I'm doing this way they

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500

another one of these problems that we

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660
another one of these problems that we
 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.700
another one of these problems that we
had with ListView was just this

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710
had with ListView was just this
 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.610
had with ListView was just this
duplicated functionality what isn't

duplicated functionality what isn't
 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.760
duplicated functionality what isn't
perfect hit this like yeah I guess we

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770
perfect hit this like yeah I guess we
 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.840
perfect hit this like yeah I guess we
did didn't we okay so as we moved on

smarter adapters to again the problem

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:09.880
smarter adapters to again the problem
 

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.460
smarter adapters to again the problem
with ListView adapters is that you could

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:11.470
with ListView adapters is that you could
 

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.980
with ListView adapters is that you could
say notify data set changed okay what

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:13.990
say notify data set changed okay what
 

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:15.240
say notify data set changed okay what
changed ah

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:15.250
changed ah
 

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.450
changed ah
and that was about all you knew and this

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:18.460
and that was about all you knew and this
 

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.280
and that was about all you knew and this
makes animations really difficult we'll

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:20.290
makes animations really difficult we'll
 

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:21.600
makes animations really difficult we'll
get to that a little bit further on down

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:21.610
get to that a little bit further on down
 

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.030

so recyclerview adapters tell us what

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440
so recyclerview adapters tell us what
 

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.620
so recyclerview adapters tell us what
changed not just that something changed

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:28.630
changed not just that something changed
 

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.690
changed not just that something changed
now if you're working with a data source

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:30.700
now if you're working with a data source
 

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.940
now if you're working with a data source
that doesn't provide that sort of

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:32.950
that doesn't provide that sort of
 

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:34.530
that doesn't provide that sort of
fine-grained messaging then you can

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:34.540
fine-grained messaging then you can
 

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.010
fine-grained messaging then you can
still use the old ListView style hey

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:37.020
still use the old ListView style hey
 

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.630
still use the old ListView style hey
something changed go figure it out we'll

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:39.640
something changed go figure it out we'll
 

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.070
something changed go figure it out we'll
make some best effort attempts at

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:41.080
make some best effort attempts at
 

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.990
make some best effort attempts at
dealing with it but really if you have

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:43.000
dealing with it but really if you have
 

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.450
dealing with it but really if you have
any knowledge of what the specific

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:45.460
any knowledge of what the specific
 

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.850
any knowledge of what the specific
changes in your data set are you can get

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:47.860
changes in your data set are you can get
 

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:52.380
changes in your data set are you can get
a lot better results so this also means

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:52.390
a lot better results so this also means
 

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.240
a lot better results so this also means
that we can do more efficient recycling

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.250
that we can do more efficient recycling
 

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.450
that we can do more efficient recycling
not just animations if we know that only

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:57.460
not just animations if we know that only
 

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.190
not just animations if we know that only
a particular item and the adapter

00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200
a particular item and the adapter
 

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.380
a particular item and the adapter
changed then we don't have to rebind

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:01.390
changed then we don't have to rebind
 

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.940
changed then we don't have to rebind
everything that's on the screen we only

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:02.950
everything that's on the screen we only
 

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.860
everything that's on the screen we only
have to rebind that one view and this

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:04.870
have to rebind that one view and this
 

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.150
have to rebind that one view and this
can save a lot of time in the

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160
can save a lot of time in the
 

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.450
can save a lot of time in the
measurement and layout phases of

measurement and layout phases of
 

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:14.370

how do you write recycler view not to
 

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.360
how do you write recycler view not to
repeat the same mistakes and the major

knows okay this is section title or you
could attach your custom delegate let's

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:15.930
could attach your custom delegate let's
 

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.579
could attach your custom delegate let's
say say like do not focus on this or

00:14:18.579 --> 00:14:18.589
say say like do not focus on this or

delegate API for this alright

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:28.850
delegate API for this alright
 

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:32.150
delegate API for this alright
so similar to ListView recycler view

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160
so similar to ListView recycler view
 

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.660
so similar to ListView recycler view
still relies on adapters you know a

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:35.670
still relies on adapters you know a

recycler view adapters responsibilities

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680
recycler view adapters responsibilities
 

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.949
recycler view adapters responsibilities
are again to create the view but also to

00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959
are again to create the view but also to
 

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:41.630
are again to create the view but also to
create the view holder and the view

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:41.640
create the view holder and the view
 

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.310
create the view holder and the view
holder is what we really use as the

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320
holder is what we really use as the
 

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.120
holder is what we really use as the
tracking element for recycling so when

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:47.130
tracking element for recycling so when
 

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:48.530
tracking element for recycling so when
you're binding an item you don't just

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.540
you're binding an item you don't just
 

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.790
you're binding an item you don't just
bind it to the view you bind it to the

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800
bind it to the view you bind it to the
 

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.350
bind it to the view you bind it to the
whole view holder and this is something

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360
whole view holder and this is something
 

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.690
whole view holder and this is something
that you can use as a place to stash

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:53.700
that you can use as a place to stash
 

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.470
that you can use as a place to stash
other information as well and of course

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480
other information as well and of course
 

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.970
other information as well and of course
it's the adapters responsibility to

00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:58.980
it's the adapters responsibility to
 

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.800
it's the adapters responsibility to
notify the recycler view about changes

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:00.810
notify the recycler view about changes
 

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:03.290
notify the recycler view about changes
that happen to the data set or if the

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:03.300
that happen to the data set or if the
 

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.800
that happen to the data set or if the
data is out of sync

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:07.810
 

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.800
so in contrast to ListView where you

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:10.810
so in contrast to ListView where you
 

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.439
so in contrast to ListView where you
could use this item click listener type

00:15:13.439 --> 00:15:13.449
could use this item click listener type
 

00:15:13.449 --> 00:15:15.660
could use this item click listener type
of model for things the adapter is now

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:15.670
of model for things the adapter is now
 

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.579
of model for things the adapter is now
responsible for configuring the item

00:15:17.579 --> 00:15:17.589
responsible for configuring the item
 

00:15:17.589 --> 00:15:19.889
responsible for configuring the item
interaction handling so these are all of

00:15:19.889 --> 00:15:19.899
interaction handling so these are all of
 

00:15:19.899 --> 00:15:21.720
interaction handling so these are all of
your click listeners touch listeners so

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:21.730
your click listeners touch listeners so
 

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.619
your click listeners touch listeners so
on and so forth

00:15:24.619 --> 00:15:24.629
 

00:15:24.629 --> 00:15:27.090
adapters also deal with your multiple

track of the different view holders that
 

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.170
track of the different view holders that
you may be tracking like one tip about

you may be tracking like one tip about
 

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.329
you may be tracking like one tip about
the weave types in the ListView world

00:15:39.329 --> 00:15:39.339
the weave types in the ListView world
 

00:15:39.339 --> 00:15:41.189
the weave types in the ListView world
you need to give us how many view types

00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199
you need to give us how many view types
 

00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:43.559
you need to give us how many view types
you have versus you recycle if they're

00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:43.569
you have versus you recycle if they're
 

00:15:43.569 --> 00:15:46.530
you have versus you recycle if they're
unlimited so I suggest just use our dot

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:46.540
unlimited so I suggest just use our dot

layouts whatever is the wave type and
 

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:52.499
layouts whatever is the wave type and
then your path right so your view type

00:15:52.499 --> 00:15:52.509
then your path right so your view type
 

00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:54.809
then your path right so your view type
IDs no longer need to be contiguous the

IDs no longer need to be contiguous the
 

00:15:54.819 --> 00:15:57.210
IDs no longer need to be contiguous the
way that they did with ListView so if as

way that they did with ListView so if as
 

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.559
way that they did with ListView so if as
long as you have any sort of unique

00:15:58.559 --> 00:15:58.569

identifier that you can use to identify
 

00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:02.850
identifier that you can use to identify
a view type then go ahead and use it in

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:02.860
a view type then go ahead and use it in
 

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.679
a view type then go ahead and use it in
recycler view isn't going to care so

00:16:04.679 --> 00:16:04.689
recycler view isn't going to care so
 

00:16:04.689 --> 00:16:06.179
recycler view isn't going to care so
that means that you can use this handy

00:16:06.179 --> 00:16:06.189
that means that you can use this handy
 

00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:08.460
that means that you can use this handy
trick of using the layout resource ID

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:08.470
trick of using the layout resource ID
 

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:12.540
trick of using the layout resource ID
itself and since AAPT already guarantees

itself and since AAPT already guarantees
 

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.819
itself and since AAPT already guarantees
that that ID is going to be unique it

00:16:14.819 --> 00:16:14.829
that that ID is going to be unique it
 

00:16:14.829 --> 00:16:17.400
that that ID is going to be unique it
makes a pretty good stand-in for that

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:17.410
makes a pretty good stand-in for that
 

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:22.740
makes a pretty good stand-in for that
identifier Oh went a little too fast so

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:22.750
identifier Oh went a little too fast so
 

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.240
identifier Oh went a little too fast so
the adapter also deals with things like

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:24.250
the adapter also deals with things like
 

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.730
the adapter also deals with things like
recycler recovery so we have this on

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:26.740
recycler recovery so we have this on
 

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.490
recycler recovery so we have this on
failed to recycle view concept and so

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:29.500
failed to recycle view concept and so
 

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.530
failed to recycle view concept and so
why why could something fail to recycle

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:31.540
why why could something fail to recycle
 

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.660
why why could something fail to recycle
of view well again we're trying to keep

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:33.670
of view well again we're trying to keep
 

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.579
of view well again we're trying to keep
we're trying to keep in mind that people

00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:35.589
we're trying to keep in mind that people
 

00:16:35.589 --> 00:16:37.470
we're trying to keep in mind that people
are doing more and more complex things

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:37.480
are doing more and more complex things
 

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.749
are doing more and more complex things
with their UIs and in those cases you

00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759
with their UIs and in those cases you
 

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:42.449
with their UIs and in those cases you
might start making a lot of changes to

00:16:42.449 --> 00:16:42.459
might start making a lot of changes to
 

00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:44.160
might start making a lot of changes to
your views that are very difficult to

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:44.170
your views that are very difficult to
 

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.189
your views that are very difficult to
reverse so in those cases where we know

00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:47.199
reverse so in those cases where we know
 

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:48.720
reverse so in those cases where we know
that a view has been left in kind of an

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:48.730
that a view has been left in kind of an
 

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.449
that a view has been left in kind of an
inconsistent state then we can

00:16:51.449 --> 00:16:51.459
inconsistent state then we can
 

00:16:51.459 --> 00:16:52.949
inconsistent state then we can
communicate that back and forth to the

00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959
communicate that back and forth to the
 

00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:54.990
communicate that back and forth to the
adapter so the adapter is able to sort

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000
adapter so the adapter is able to sort
 

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.329
adapter so the adapter is able to sort
of recover from a case where a view it

00:16:57.329 --> 00:16:57.339
of recover from a case where a view it
 

00:16:57.339 --> 00:17:00.720
of recover from a case where a view it
has been messed with kind of beyond the

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:00.730
has been messed with kind of beyond the
 

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.660
has been messed with kind of beyond the
normal bounds of expectation and again

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:03.670
normal bounds of expectation and again
 

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.279
normal bounds of expectation and again
we have the granular data change events

00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:05.289
we have the granular data change events
 

00:17:05.289 --> 00:17:08.340
we have the granular data change events
as added to sort of handle efficiency

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:08.350
as added to sort of handle efficiency
 

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:13.289
as added to sort of handle efficiency
and probably link performance that's

00:17:13.289 --> 00:17:13.299
and probably link performance that's
 

00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:16.860
and probably link performance that's
efficient animations yes that way all

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:16.870
efficient animations yes that way all
 

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.350
efficient animations yes that way all
right so let's deep dive into the V

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360
right so let's deep dive into the V
 

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.020
right so let's deep dive into the V
Boulder because most of

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:22.030

everybody needs to write a view holder

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:23.770
everybody needs to write a view holder
 

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.829
everybody needs to write a view holder
to use recycle vo and you spend most of

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839
to use recycle vo and you spend most of
 

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.740
to use recycle vo and you spend most of
your time there it's important to know

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:28.750
your time there it's important to know
 

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.410
your time there it's important to know
the lifecycle of a view holder so we'll

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:31.420
the lifecycle of a view holder so we'll
 

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.390
the lifecycle of a view holder so we'll
go through it what happens when they

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400
go through it what happens when they
 

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.140
go through it what happens when they
were created what are the stages so

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:37.150
were created what are the stages so
 

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.420
were created what are the stages so
while the layout measure is calculating

the layout it tells the recycle a via
okay give me the v4 position 5 so he

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:45.400
okay give me the v4 position 5 so he
 

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.220
okay give me the v4 position 5 so he
wants to get the v4 that position

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:47.230
wants to get the v4 that position

have it in the cache we will return it
 

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:57.660
have it in the cache we will return it
to the layout manager if not so we have

the case said no it's like we will tell
the ask the adapter ok what is the type

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:05.770
the ask the adapter ok what is the type
 

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.400
the ask the adapter ok what is the type
of this field and after returns it then

to create one so this is when we
 

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.310
to create one so this is when we
actually create a view holder or maybe

before so that we can rebind it later so
if the wave is not valid let's say say

we just send it to the pool and we tell

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:34.510
we just send it to the pool and we tell
 

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.780
we just send it to the pool and we tell
that after our audits there's another

wheels so it had all the views from one
 

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.150
wheels so it had all the views from one
to five let's say and that makes one it

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:51.160
to five let's say and that makes one it
 

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.860
to five let's say and that makes one it
only used eight of them and the other

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:52.870
only used eight of them and the other
 

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:54.150

so what recyclerview does is okay we

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:56.500
so what recyclerview does is okay we
 

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.170
so what recyclerview does is okay we
understand that the layout major doesn't

so but item animator may want them right

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:03.580
so but item animator may want them right

so but item animator may want them right
you may want to fade them out instead of

disappearing children it's going to make
 

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.890
disappearing children it's going to make
them children again

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:13.900
them children again
 

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.620
them children again
and I'll hide them from the layout major

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:16.630
and I'll hide them from the layout major
 

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.510
and I'll hide them from the layout major
we will go into details of this later

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:18.520
we will go into details of this later
 

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.480
we will go into details of this later
but basically the list of children from

well this is a concept that's part of
 

00:22:37.469 --> 00:22:38.869
well this is a concept that's part of
the framework not just the recyclerview

00:22:38.869 --> 00:22:38.879
the framework not just the recyclerview
 

00:22:38.879 --> 00:22:41.419
the framework not just the recyclerview
itself so for example if you have an

00:22:41.419 --> 00:22:41.429
itself so for example if you have an
 

00:22:41.429 --> 00:22:44.629
itself so for example if you have an

that the users entered and they've gone
ahead and created a selection across

ahead and created a selection across
 

00:22:47.819 --> 00:22:50.359
ahead and created a selection across
several words but maybe not others then

several words but maybe not others then
 

00:22:50.369 --> 00:22:51.739
several words but maybe not others then
that's kind of this complex interaction

00:22:51.739 --> 00:22:51.749
that's kind of this complex interaction
 

00:22:51.749 --> 00:22:54.349
that's kind of this complex interaction
that the user has created that we really

recycle this view can I recycle because
most of the time is because of

most of the time is because of
 

00:23:19.199 --> 00:23:20.809
most of the time is because of
innovations with selection you can

00:23:20.809 --> 00:23:20.819
innovations with selection you can
 

00:23:20.819 --> 00:23:23.119
innovations with selection you can
actually recover from that state the

actually recover from that state the
 

00:23:23.129 --> 00:23:25.069
actually recover from that state the
only problem is that we cannot do it

00:23:25.069 --> 00:23:25.079
only problem is that we cannot do it
 

00:23:25.079 --> 00:23:26.359
only problem is that we cannot do it
automatically because we don't know

00:23:26.359 --> 00:23:26.369
automatically because we don't know
 

00:23:26.369 --> 00:23:28.669
automatically because we don't know
what's going on so adapter can say

00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679
what's going on so adapter can say
 

00:23:28.679 --> 00:23:31.129
what's going on so adapter can say
either we call fail to recycle you can

by default it turns false so we will

00:23:50.329 --> 00:23:50.339
by default it turns false so we will

by default it turns false so we will
have to destroy the beholder so it goes

00:23:53.869 --> 00:23:53.879
have to destroy the beholder so it goes
 

00:23:53.879 --> 00:23:57.889
have to destroy the beholder so it goes
through that poof you don't want this

00:23:57.889 --> 00:23:57.899
 

00:23:57.899 --> 00:24:00.210
the moral of the story is if you're

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:00.220
the moral of the story is if you're
 

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.159
the moral of the story is if you're
innovating items don't go ahead and

00:24:02.159 --> 00:24:02.169
innovating items don't go ahead and
 

00:24:02.169 --> 00:24:05.519
innovating items don't go ahead and
create animations on mine we have the

00:24:05.519 --> 00:24:05.529
create animations on mine we have the
 

00:24:05.529 --> 00:24:07.799
create animations on mine we have the
item animator API to do these things

00:24:07.799 --> 00:24:07.809
item animator API to do these things
 

00:24:07.809 --> 00:24:10.230
item animator API to do these things
properly so use the item animator if you

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240
properly so use the item animator if you
 

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.240
properly so use the item animator if you
want to innovate at the item animated

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:12.250
want to innovate at the item animated
 

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.639
want to innovate at the item animated
receives the correct lifecycle events so

00:24:14.639 --> 00:24:14.649
receives the correct lifecycle events so
 

00:24:14.649 --> 00:24:17.070
receives the correct lifecycle events so
that we can recycle we can take care of

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.080
that we can recycle we can take care of
 

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.659
that we can recycle we can take care of
recycling those videos meant they're

00:24:18.659 --> 00:24:18.669
recycling those videos meant they're
 

00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:20.850
recycling those videos meant they're
done animating right essentially you can

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:20.860
done animating right essentially you can
 

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.169
done animating right essentially you can
forget about everything that just

00:24:22.169 --> 00:24:22.179
forget about everything that just
 

00:24:22.179 --> 00:24:23.940
forget about everything that just
happened on that slide before you as

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:23.950
happened on that slide before you as
 

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:25.320
happened on that slide before you as
long as you implement the item animator

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:25.330
long as you implement the item animator
 

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.480

interface yes if you're doing it

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:27.490
interface yes if you're doing it
 

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:28.799
interface yes if you're doing it

yourself you're on your own and you're
 

00:24:28.809 --> 00:24:29.940
yourself you're on your own and you're
gonna have to handle all of these

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:29.950
gonna have to handle all of these
 

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.159
gonna have to handle all of these
problems yourself yeah and what it's

00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:32.169
problems yourself yeah and what it's
 

00:24:32.169 --> 00:24:34.080
problems yourself yeah and what it's
like the major thing where you start

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:34.090
like the major thing where you start
 

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:36.570
like the major thing where you start
using recycle you really need to forget

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:36.580
using recycle you really need to forget
 

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.070
using recycle you really need to forget
everything you learned in this field

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080
everything you learned in this field
 

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.820
everything you learned in this field
most of them are valid but did some bits

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:41.830
most of them are valid but did some bits
 

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:43.500
most of them are valid but did some bits
that are not valid will actually hurt

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:43.510
that are not valid will actually hurt
 

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:46.560
that are not valid will actually hurt
you here so is another use case where we

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:46.570
you here so is another use case where we
 

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:49.500
you here so is another use case where we
will lose videos is cycle is like okay

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:49.510
will lose videos is cycle is like okay
 

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.440
will lose videos is cycle is like okay
I'm done with this view we try to put it

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:52.450
I'm done with this view we try to put it
 

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.500
I'm done with this view we try to put it
into the pool but pool is limited per

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:55.510
into the pool but pool is limited per
 

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:59.190
into the pool but pool is limited per
size per item type so if you have way

00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200
size per item type so if you have way
 

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.169
size per item type so if you have way
too many of those reef types in the pool

00:25:01.169 --> 00:25:01.179
too many of those reef types in the pool
 

00:25:01.179 --> 00:25:04.710
too many of those reef types in the pool
already like you know what we have no

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720
already like you know what we have no
 

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.190
already like you know what we have no
space for it throw it out so why would

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200
space for it throw it out so why would
 

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.110
space for it throw it out so why would
this happen why would we create views

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.120
this happen why would we create views
 

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.779
this happen why would we create views
that we already had a lot many of them

00:25:12.779 --> 00:25:12.789
that we already had a lot many of them
 

00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:15.330
that we already had a lot many of them
that are unused in the pool well this

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:15.340
that are unused in the pool well this
 

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:21.360
that are unused in the pool well this
usually happens if alright so if you

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:21.370
usually happens if alright so if you
 

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.669
usually happens if alright so if you
have too many older types and why would

00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679
have too many older types and why would
 

00:25:23.679 --> 00:25:25.649
have too many older types and why would
it happen is mostly because of

00:25:25.649 --> 00:25:25.659
it happen is mostly because of
 

00:25:25.659 --> 00:25:28.590
it happen is mostly because of
animations like you told us I see this

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:28.600
animations like you told us I see this

between H and I in this diagram here so
 

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.810
between H and I in this diagram here so
now we have P in the middle so no longer

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:15.820
now we have P in the middle so no longer
 

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:20.190
now we have P in the middle so no longer
sorted ignore that what happens if

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:20.200
sorted ignore that what happens if

something disappears well now we have

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:23.380
something disappears well now we have
 

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.230
something disappears well now we have
another image of a list now the

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:25.240
another image of a list now the

interesting thing here

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:26.920
interesting thing here
 

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.740
interesting thing here
oh and then of course we have the case

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:28.750
oh and then of course we have the case
 

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.720
oh and then of course we have the case
where an item simply changes and its

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:30.730
where an item simply changes and its
 

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:34.200
where an item simply changes and its
contents change in place so the

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:34.210
contents change in place so the
 

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:36.450
contents change in place so the
interesting thing in these cases is that

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:36.460
interesting thing in these cases is that
 

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.070
interesting thing in these cases is that
there's always kind of some side effects

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080
there's always kind of some side effects
 

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.160
there's always kind of some side effects
when you add and remove views so we

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:41.170
when you add and remove views so we
 

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:45.330
when you add and remove views so we
added view P here I and J got moved down

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:45.340
added view P here I and J got moved down
 

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:51.090
added view P here I and J got moved down
and K is completely gone when we remove

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:51.100
and K is completely gone when we remove
 

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:54.990
and K is completely gone when we remove
something really similar happens so we

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:55.000
something really similar happens so we
 

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.990
something really similar happens so we
remove item H ijk move but L is new on

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.000
remove item H ijk move but L is new on
 

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.210

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:03.220
screen we had to get a new view in order
 

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:07.170
screen we had to get a new view in order
to show it in that case so without extra

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:07.180
to show it in that case so without extra
 

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.760

change first and of course this is one

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:11.950
change first and of course this is one
 

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.470

of the easy cases we can just go ahead

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.480
of the easy cases we can just go ahead
 

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.630
of the easy cases we can just go ahead
and crossfade between these

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640
 

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.700
so if we're handling things this way if

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:19.710
so if we're handling things this way if
 

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:21.320
so if we're handling things this way if
an item is removed we can fade it out

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:21.330
an item is removed we can fade it out
 

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:26.060
an item is removed we can fade it out
and items added we fade it in the film

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:26.070
and items added we fade it in the film
 

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.680
and items added we fade it in the film
is just sort of moving around on screen

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:27.690
is just sort of moving around on screen
 

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.320
is just sort of moving around on screen
we can translate it and our default item

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:30.330
we can translate it and our default item
 

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:32.510
we can translate it and our default item
animation handlers can handle this no

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:32.520
animation handlers can handle this no
 

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.990
animation handlers can handle this no
problem changing we just do a simple

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000
problem changing we just do a simple
 

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.700
problem changing we just do a simple
crossfade in place and as long as we

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:37.710
crossfade in place and as long as we
 

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.320
crossfade in place and as long as we
don't have cases where that item has

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:39.330
don't have cases where that item has
 

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.420
don't have cases where that item has
changed size we're in a super easy case

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:41.430
changed size we're in a super easy case
 

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:42.980
changed size we're in a super easy case
but otherwise it just means other items

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:42.990
but otherwise it just means other items
 

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.210

around it are moving and we get into

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:44.220
around it are moving and we get into
 

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.780
around it are moving and we get into
exactly the same cases as before but can

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:47.790
exactly the same cases as before but can
 

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.850
exactly the same cases as before but can
we do better than this there's kind of a

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:49.860
we do better than this there's kind of a
 

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.550
we do better than this there's kind of a
key problem in these cases which is that

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:52.560
key problem in these cases which is that
 

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.730
key problem in these cases which is that
if all we know is that something changed

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:55.740
if all we know is that something changed
 

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.440
if all we know is that something changed
in the adapter and here's the new state

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:57.450
in the adapter and here's the new state
 

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.350
in the adapter and here's the new state
like with ListView then how do we really

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:00.360
like with ListView then how do we really
 

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.840
like with ListView then how do we really
tell the difference between an item that

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:02.850
tell the difference between an item that
 

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:04.760
tell the difference between an item that
was removed from the adapter after this

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:04.770
was removed from the adapter after this
 

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:08.720
was removed from the adapter after this

putting together these sorts of
 

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.610
putting together these sorts of
animations this is suddenly really

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:13.620
animations this is suddenly really
 

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.800
animations this is suddenly really
important similarly how do we know if

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:15.810
important similarly how do we know if

00:33:08.409 --> 00:33:08.419
very hard for layout measure to track
 

00:33:08.419 --> 00:33:10.359
very hard for layout measure to track
these things because already busy taking

00:33:10.359 --> 00:33:10.369
these things because already busy taking
 

00:33:10.369 --> 00:33:14.709
these things because already busy taking
the UI so adapter helper is to the risk

00:33:14.709 --> 00:33:14.719
the UI so adapter helper is to the risk
 

00:33:14.719 --> 00:33:17.889
the UI so adapter helper is to the risk
if so when you say notify item insert

00:33:17.889 --> 00:33:17.899
if so when you say notify item insert
 

00:33:17.899 --> 00:33:20.799
if so when you say notify item insert
the adapter we record it and we request

00:33:20.799 --> 00:33:20.809
the adapter we record it and we request
 

00:33:20.809 --> 00:33:22.479
the adapter we record it and we request
a layout we know something happen we

00:33:22.479 --> 00:33:22.489
a layout we know something happen we
 

00:33:22.489 --> 00:33:24.879
a layout we know something happen we
need to redraw that's it the only thing

00:33:24.879 --> 00:33:24.889
need to redraw that's it the only thing
 

00:33:24.889 --> 00:33:26.560
need to redraw that's it the only thing
we do is we keep the information about

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:26.570
we do is we keep the information about
 

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.649
we do is we keep the information about
it and then you as you add more notify

00:33:29.649 --> 00:33:29.659
it and then you as you add more notify
 

00:33:29.659 --> 00:33:33.339
it and then you as you add more notify
events we just keep them in a list let's

00:33:33.339 --> 00:33:33.349
events we just keep them in a list let's
 

00:33:33.349 --> 00:33:35.709
events we just keep them in a list let's
say during this moment before we

00:33:35.709 --> 00:33:35.719
say during this moment before we
 

00:33:35.719 --> 00:33:37.959
say during this moment before we
recalculate the layout but we know that

00:33:37.959 --> 00:33:37.969
recalculate the layout but we know that
 

00:33:37.969 --> 00:33:39.999
recalculate the layout but we know that
adapter contacts I've changed user

00:33:39.999 --> 00:33:40.009
adapter contacts I've changed user
 

00:33:40.009 --> 00:33:45.339
adapter contacts I've changed user
clicked on a button and you wanted to

00:33:45.339 --> 00:33:45.349
clicked on a button and you wanted to
 

00:33:45.349 --> 00:33:48.279
clicked on a button and you wanted to
get the item you co get adapter position

00:33:48.279 --> 00:33:48.289
get the item you co get adapter position
 

00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:51.969
get the item you co get adapter position
for the item at 59 which was clicked but

00:33:51.969 --> 00:33:51.979
for the item at 59 which was clicked but
 

00:33:51.979 --> 00:33:54.099
for the item at 59 which was clicked but
we know there's a new item added at

00:33:54.099 --> 00:33:54.109
we know there's a new item added at
 

00:33:54.109 --> 00:33:57.759
we know there's a new item added at
index 55 so we know that in the adapter

00:33:57.759 --> 00:33:57.769
index 55 so we know that in the adapter
 

00:33:57.769 --> 00:33:59.589
index 55 so we know that in the adapter
there's actual at position 6 so we

00:33:59.589 --> 00:33:59.599
there's actual at position 6 so we
 

00:33:59.599 --> 00:34:01.869
there's actual at position 6 so we
return you 60 so even if the weave is

00:34:01.869 --> 00:34:01.879
return you 60 so even if the weave is
 

00:34:01.879 --> 00:34:04.389
return you 60 so even if the weave is
not recalculated if you need to adapter

00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399
not recalculated if you need to adapter
 

00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:06.549
not recalculated if you need to adapter
position to go access your adapter items

00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559
position to go access your adapter items
 

00:34:06.559 --> 00:34:10.980
position to go access your adapter items
we can provide you the right position so

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:10.990
 

00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:14.079
this this simply happens by checking

00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:14.089
this this simply happens by checking
 

00:34:14.089 --> 00:34:18.039
this this simply happens by checking
what you told us before and let's say

00:34:18.039 --> 00:34:18.049
what you told us before and let's say
 

00:34:18.049 --> 00:34:21.970
what you told us before and let's say
you send more updates and I will go

00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:21.980
you send more updates and I will go
 

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.329
you send more updates and I will go
through them the request layout will be

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:25.339
through them the request layout will be
 

00:34:25.339 --> 00:34:26.769
through them the request layout will be
honored by the system will start

00:34:26.769 --> 00:34:26.779
honored by the system will start
 

00:34:26.779 --> 00:34:30.579
honored by the system will start
preparing the new layout and this time

00:34:30.579 --> 00:34:30.589
preparing the new layout and this time
 

00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:32.740
preparing the new layout and this time
the adapter is going to provide the

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:32.750
the adapter is going to provide the
 

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:36.190
the adapter is going to provide the
layout manager the fake positions so how

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.200
layout manager the fake positions so how
 

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.740
layout manager the fake positions so how
does it work what we do is when I talk

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:38.750
does it work what we do is when I talk
 

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:40.809
does it work what we do is when I talk
about like faking the adapter contents

00:34:40.809 --> 00:34:40.819
about like faking the adapter contents
 

00:34:40.819 --> 00:34:45.579
about like faking the adapter contents
is we reorder your updates first so the

00:34:45.579 --> 00:34:45.589
is we reorder your updates first so the
 

00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:47.559
is we reorder your updates first so the
idea is that everything we have to tell

00:34:47.559 --> 00:34:47.569
idea is that everything we have to tell
 

00:34:47.569 --> 00:34:49.359
idea is that everything we have to tell
to the layout manager first we tell

00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:49.369
to the layout manager first we tell
 

00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:51.490
to the layout manager first we tell
about them relate it to the predictive

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:51.500
about them relate it to the predictive
 

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:52.290
about them relate it to the predictive
layout

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:52.300
layout
 

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.000
layout
and now everything else we tell about

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.010
and now everything else we tell about
 

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:57.270
and now everything else we tell about
them later so if you look at you removed

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280
them later so if you look at you removed
 

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:02.640
them later so if you look at you removed
whiteness from 61 we know that was 65 we

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:02.650
whiteness from 61 we know that was 65 we
 

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.860
whiteness from 61 we know that was 65 we
reordered and we look at this okay I

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:04.870
reordered and we look at this okay I
 

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:07.620
reordered and we look at this okay I
actually have the item 416 so even

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:07.630
actually have the item 416 so even
 

00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:09.570
actually have the item 416 so even
though it is removed when the layout

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:09.580
though it is removed when the layout
 

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:12.210
though it is removed when the layout
page is recalculating the previous state

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:12.220

which is part of predictive animations

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:13.720
which is part of predictive animations
 

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:17.520
which is part of predictive animations
if it asks for item 60 I could provide

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:17.530
if it asks for item 60 I could provide
 

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:19.170
if it asks for item 60 I could provide
it so I don't need to tell the layout

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:19.180
it so I don't need to tell the layout
 

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.820
it so I don't need to tell the layout
major that that item has been deleted

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:20.830
major that that item has been deleted
 

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:25.020
major that that item has been deleted
from the adapter but item 61 I don't

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:25.030
from the adapter but item 61 I don't
 

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.510
from the adapter but item 61 I don't
have it so what I do is I divide that

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520
have it so what I do is I divide that
 

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.820
have it so what I do is I divide that
remove operation into two I tell the

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:29.830
remove operation into two I tell the
 

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:31.320
remove operation into two I tell the
layout major hey like before you

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:31.330
layout major hey like before you
 

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:34.230
layout major hey like before you
calculate the layout the item 61 is gone

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240
calculate the layout the item 61 is gone
 

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.080
calculate the layout the item 61 is gone
just let you know it does the pre layout

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:37.090
just let you know it does the pre layout
 

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:39.450
just let you know it does the pre layout
goes to the post layout phase that we

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:39.460
goes to the post layout phase that we
 

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.160
goes to the post layout phase that we
tell about these things like this

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:41.170
tell about these things like this
 

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:43.710
tell about these things like this
fine-grained adapter updates tells like

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720
fine-grained adapter updates tells like
 

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.740
fine-grained adapter updates tells like
enables us to fake that up the content

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:46.750
enables us to fake that up the content

stores layout major so that all it has

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:49.210
stores layout major so that all it has
 

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:51.420

to do is we ask it to lay out twice and
 

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:53.370
to do is we ask it to lay out twice and
that we predict all the rest of the

animations so a major almost doesn't
 

00:35:56.050 --> 00:36:00.720
animations so a major almost doesn't
need to know anything about that okay

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:00.730

ListView to draw dividers between items
and so we need to make sure that this

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:14.770
and so we need to make sure that this
 

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:15.960
and so we need to make sure that this
sort of functionality was still

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:15.970
sort of functionality was still
 

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:18.720
sort of functionality was still
preserved so item decorations allow you

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:18.730
preserved so item decorations allow you
 

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:20.490
preserved so item decorations allow you
to do custom drawing on the recycler

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:20.500
to do custom drawing on the recycler

just individual items within it we can
also go ahead and add offsets to view

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:30.070
also go ahead and add offsets to view
 

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:32.040

bounds again using the simple test case
of the divider you need to make sure

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:33.430
of the divider you need to make sure
 

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:34.860
of the divider you need to make sure
that you have that couple pixels of

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:34.870
that you have that couple pixels of
 

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:36.600
that you have that couple pixels of

rather than drawing necessarily over

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:38.470
rather than drawing necessarily over
 

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:41.850
rather than drawing necessarily over
under the item views and you can also

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:41.860
under the item views and you can also
 

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.470
under the item views and you can also
have multiple item decorations they

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:43.480
have multiple item decorations they
 

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.840
have multiple item decorations they
stack so these item decorations can

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:45.850
stack so these item decorations can
 

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:49.050
stack so these item decorations can
affect views again in sort of a stack

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:49.060
affect views again in sort of a stack
 

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:52.800
affect views again in sort of a stack
like manner item decorations so we can

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:52.810
like manner item decorations so we can
 

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:56.360
like manner item decorations so we can
draw items over

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:56.370
 

00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:04.640
over our list items here let's come on

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:04.650
 

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:07.460
all right so another kind of important

all right so another kind of important
 

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:09.230
all right so another kind of important
thing here is the getitem offsets this

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240
thing here is the getitem offsets this
 

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.059
thing here is the getitem offsets this
is really what lets us add space around

00:37:11.059 --> 00:37:11.069
is really what lets us add space around
 

00:37:11.069 --> 00:37:13.069
is really what lets us add space around
particular items so this can be nice if

00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079
particular items so this can be nice if
 

00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:14.930
particular items so this can be nice if
you're doing some sort of card

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:14.940
you're doing some sort of card
 

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.029
you're doing some sort of card
background around several items at once

00:37:17.029 --> 00:37:17.039
background around several items at once
 

00:37:17.039 --> 00:37:19.609
background around several items at once
so like a grouping of some sort but you

00:37:19.609 --> 00:37:19.619
so like a grouping of some sort but you
 

00:37:19.619 --> 00:37:21.940
so like a grouping of some sort but you
can also do it just on single items too

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:21.950
can also do it just on single items too
 

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:24.260
can also do it just on single items too
so we can expand the space around a

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:24.270
so we can expand the space around a
 

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:26.029
so we can expand the space around a
particular item because maybe that's an

00:37:26.029 --> 00:37:26.039
particular item because maybe that's an
 

00:37:26.039 --> 00:37:34.329
particular item because maybe that's an
area that we're going to draw in

00:37:34.329 --> 00:37:34.339
 

00:37:34.339 --> 00:37:36.819
so we get on draw which will draw

00:37:36.819 --> 00:37:36.829
so we get on draw which will draw
 

00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:39.009
so we get on draw which will draw
underneath the itemviews before we

00:37:39.009 --> 00:37:39.019
underneath the itemviews before we
 

00:37:39.019 --> 00:37:43.229
underneath the itemviews before we
actually draw the atom views themselves

00:37:43.229 --> 00:37:43.239
 

00:37:43.239 --> 00:37:45.549
which is then followed by the items

00:37:45.549 --> 00:37:45.559
which is then followed by the items
 

00:37:45.559 --> 00:37:48.609
which is then followed by the items
themselves and then we get on draw over

00:37:48.609 --> 00:37:48.619
themselves and then we get on draw over
 

00:37:48.619 --> 00:37:51.670
themselves and then we get on draw over
which allows us a chance to draw on top

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680
which allows us a chance to draw on top
 

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.009
which allows us a chance to draw on top
of the item views in case that becomes

00:37:54.009 --> 00:37:54.019
of the item views in case that becomes
 

00:37:54.019 --> 00:37:55.719
of the item views in case that becomes
relevant in your particular situation so

00:37:55.719 --> 00:37:55.729
relevant in your particular situation so
 

00:37:55.729 --> 00:37:57.579
relevant in your particular situation so
in this case we're doing we're just

00:37:57.579 --> 00:37:57.589
in this case we're doing we're just
 

00:37:57.589 --> 00:38:00.939
in this case we're doing we're just
otherwise decorating these things so you

00:38:00.939 --> 00:38:00.949
otherwise decorating these things so you
 

00:38:00.949 --> 00:38:02.620
otherwise decorating these things so you
need to be kind of careful about item

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:02.630
need to be kind of careful about item
 

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:06.130
need to be kind of careful about item
decorations though because this drawing

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:06.140

different types like we mentioned
 

00:39:21.679 --> 00:39:24.309
different types like we mentioned
earlier but the cool thing about the

can share the recycled view pool across

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:10.980
can share the recycled view pool across
 

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.730
can share the recycled view pool across
all of these in individual rows and this

what that means though as a side effect
 

00:43:12.869 --> 00:43:14.990
what that means though as a side effect
is that since items can be added or

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000
is that since items can be added or
 

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.580
is that since items can be added or
removed around it and items can move

assumptions that the position that you
 

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.849
assumptions that the position that you
were initially bound for is always going

00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:22.859
were initially bound for is always going
 

00:43:22.859 --> 00:43:24.560
were initially bound for is always going
to be the position corresponding to that

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:24.570

commonly like you have a header field

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:39.210
commonly like you have a header field
 

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:41.210
commonly like you have a header field
when we ask for the header will you

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:41.220
when we ask for the header will you
 

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.850
when we ask for the header will you
return the same one don't do it if we

something like this if we ask for you to

something like this if we ask for you to

layout positions is something we

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:05.220
layout positions is something we
 

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:09.620
layout positions is something we
previously mentioned but say real let's

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:09.630
previously mentioned but say real let's
 

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:12.410
previously mentioned but say real let's
say you moved an item at this point you

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:12.420
say you moved an item at this point you
 

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.350
say you moved an item at this point you
can see the adapter positions and layout

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:15.360
can see the adapter positions and layout
 

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.180
can see the adapter positions and layout
positions or some items are different

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:17.190
positions or some items are different
 

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:19.490
positions or some items are different
until the next layout is calculated

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:19.500
until the next layout is calculated
 

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.080
until the next layout is calculated
because they are so calculated as

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:21.090
because they are so calculated as
 

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:23.990
because they are so calculated as
synchronously so once the view system

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000

tells us or canonical refreshers are we

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040
tells us or canonical refreshers are we
 

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.580
tells us or canonical refreshers are we
refresh it now all of the items have the

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:28.590
refresh it now all of the items have the
 

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:30.590
refresh it now all of the items have the
same layout position and adapter

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:30.600
same layout position and adapter
 

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.960
same layout position and adapter
position so adapters position is very

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:32.970
position so adapters position is very
 

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:34.430
position so adapters position is very
good if you need to access your data

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440
good if you need to access your data
 

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.830
good if you need to access your data
layout positions very good if you want

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:36.840
layout positions very good if you want
 

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.840
layout positions very good if you want
to know what is above and below at the

to know what is above and below at the
 

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:41.620
to know what is above and below at the
point that user click something right

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:41.630
point that user click something right
 

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:46.760
point that user click something right
and I thank you yes
