00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.760
Let's explore another example
of a binomial distribution.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.910
Let's say I'm playing
basketball and I know I'm going

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.190
to take 10 shots in the game.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.650
So I'm going to take 10 shots.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.990
Let's say that n
is equal to 10.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.260
That's the number
of shots I take.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.690
Let's just say that every shot
I take they're independent

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.920
events and that, in general,
I have a 30% chance of

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.670
making any given basket.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.600
We're not going to get too
detailed of where I take

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.620
the basket from or are
they three pointers?

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.210
Or are they lay out?

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.860
Whatever.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.760
Every time I take a shot I have
a 30% chance of making it.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.410
So let's say the probability
of success is equal to 30%.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.280
Probability is equal to 30%.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.850
I just made that definition.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.050
Let's define a random variable,
X, like we always do.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.900
X is equal to number
of shots I make.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.330
Number of shots/baskets I make.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.900
And this one's a little bit
more interesting than the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.110
flipping a coin example because
in the flipping a coin example,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.390
heads or tails both had an
equal probability of happening.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.570
In this situation, making
a shot is less likely

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.430
than not making a shot.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.880
The not making a
shot-- let's say not.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.750
Not making a shot, that
is equal to 1 minus the

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.130
probability of making a shot,
which is equal to 70%.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.300
So there's a slight twist on
what we did before, but in some

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.220
ways this might be a more
interesting example to

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.930
your everyday life.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.680
And let's see what the
distribution looks like.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.555
And also, I'm taking more
shots now than I did before.

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:34.640
So it'll probably take a little
bit more time-- actually,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.750
this is too much.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.870
I don't want to waste
too much time.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.760
Let's say I take 6 shots.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.220
And the random variable, X, is
the number of shots I make.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.280
So let's think about how we
figure out this probability.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.030
What is the probability
that X is equal to 0?

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.410
So I make no shots at all.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.770
So I take 6 shots and
every shot I take I miss.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.400
So in order for that to happen
this event has to happen

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.340
six times in a row.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.630
So something with a 70%
probability has to happen six

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.520
times in a row, the probability
of this is 0.7-- it's 705--

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.130
times 0.7 times 0.7 times
0.7-- I'm getting confused.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:29.130
It's 0.7 times 0.7 times 0.7
times 0.7 times 0.7 times 0.7.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.410
Each of these are missing the
first shot, second shot, third

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.870
shot, and so forth and so on.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.990
And this is equal to 0.7
to the sixth power.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.990
Whatever that might be.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.010
All right, and there's
only one way to do it.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.220
I literally have to miss
every shot in order for

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.660
X to be equal to 0.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.390
What's the probability that
I make exactly 1 shot?

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.110
I might make the first one and
then miss the other ones.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.890
I might miss all of
them but the second.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.810
I might miss all of
them, but the third.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.290
So let's think about, what's
the probability of each

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.300
of those circumstances?

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.580
Let's say I make it.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.780
I'll call that a make.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.765
Too bad make and miss
both start with m.

00:03:10.765 --> 00:03:15.910
Let's see, I'll call it
point-- point and miss.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.750
So it could be like a
point and then 5 misses.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.490
it?

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.920
Could be a miss, a miss, a
miss, a point, a miss, a miss.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.490
Now you can imagine, there's
5 of these scenarios.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.330
There's actually 6
of these scenarios.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.630
The shot that I make would be
in 1 of these 6-- I don't want

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.860
to use the word bucket because
we're already using a

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.720
basketball analogy.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.750
But it can be in 1
of these 6 spots.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.670
In one of the six
shots that I take.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.790
So there's 6 of
these scenarios.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.490
What's the probability
of each of these?

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.080
This is a 30% chance
of happening.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.070
And then each of these are
70% chance of happening.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.750
So it'd be 0.3 times 0.7
times 0.7 times 0.7

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.520
times 0.7 times 0.7.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.540
This is 0.7 to the fifth.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.210
Times 0.7 to the fifth.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.580
That's the odds of
this happening.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.440
What are the odds of
this one happening?

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.860
Well, let's see.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.820
You have 0.7 times 0.7
times 0.7 times 0.3

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.570
times 0.7 times 0.7.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.910
But if you think about it,
you're still taking 0.7

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.490
times itself five times.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.380
0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 0.7.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.310
You're taking 0.7 to the fifth
power and you have to multiply

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.830
by 0.3 once as well.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.760
So no matter where you make the
shot, the chances of any of

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.320
these permutations
independently are 0.3 times

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.660
0.7 to the fifth--
whatever that is.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.690
And then how many ways
are there to do this?

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.700
Well, we just figured out.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.640
There are 6 ways to do this.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.160
You might make only
the first shot.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.910
You might make only the second
shot, only the third shot,

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.240
and so forth and so on.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.280
So the probability that X is
equal to 1-- the probability

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.350
that our random variable is
equal to 1 is equal to 6 times

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.450
0.3 times 0.7 to the fifth.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.980
And just so that we make it
clear and connect it all to the

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.160
binomial distribution, if we
were to have done the n

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.110
choose 0 here, what's the
binomial coefficient?

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.215
So in our example n is 6,
so what's 6 choose 0?

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:38.720
That's 6 factorial over
0 factorial, times 6

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.070
minus 0 factorial.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.460
6 minus 0 is just 6.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.440
So 6 factorial divided by 6
factorial, those cancel out.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.295
You're left with 1.

00:05:49.295 --> 00:05:50.880
But what's 0 factorial?

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.390
And this is one of those
bizarre definitional things in

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.150
mathematics, and I'll leave
you to think about it.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.120
And I've addressed this
is previous videos.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.420
But 0 factorial is actually--
so that it works out properly

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.720
is defined to be equal to 1.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.740
And I did that to just show
you that this is the binomial

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.890
coefficient on this term.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.900
So we just multiply it by 1.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.580
That's why I never
even brought it up.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.610
The probability of this
happening is 0.7 to the sixth.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.270
And then you multiply it times
the binomial coefficient.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.030
But there's only one way that
this can happen and that's

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.030
why this turned out to be 1.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.970
I didn't want to confuse you so
I didn't bring all that up.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.920
But we did still use the
binomial coefficient.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.550
Let's think about
it in this one.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.750
In this situation we're taking
6 shots, and we're choosing

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.740
only 1 of them to be made.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.820
What's 6 choose 1?

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:44.580
That's 6 factorial over
1 factorial, divided by

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.100
6 minus 1 factorial.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.650
That's 6 factorial divided
by-- well, 1 factorial

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:52.520
can be ignored.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.140
That's just one.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.230
Divided by 5 factorial.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.320
Well, what's that?

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.230
That's 6 times 5 times 4
times 3 times 1 divided by

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.830
5 times 4 times 3 times 1.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.890
So everything else cancels
out except for just

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.180
four of the 6's.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.430
And so that's where
we got our 6 from.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.220
We got it by reasoning,
which actually I think is

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.430
a better way to get it.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.310
But I just wanted to show you
that we're still using the

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.450
binomial coefficients.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.960
This is 6 choose 1.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.120
And then we multiply that times
the probability of any of

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.430
these permutations happening.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.580
And we figure that out
by we make 1 shot and

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.200
we miss the rest.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.850
Let's keep going.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:29.300
I think you'll get the hang
on this sooner than later.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.410
What's the probability that
you make exactly two shots?

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:38.750
So what's the probability for
any given-- let's say I miss,

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.560
miss, miss, miss, and
then I get 2 points.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.750
Or two shots.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.860
I don't want to
get too confused.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.400
Let's say they're all worth
1 point in this version of

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.360
basketball we're playing.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.850
So here, what's
the probability?

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:57.540
If 0.7 times 0.7 times 0.7
times 0.7 times 0.3 times 0.3.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.050
So this is 0.7 to the--
1, 2, 3, fourth power--

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:07.500
times 0.3 squared.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.970
That's each of these
circumstances.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:13.620
But this isn't the only way
that I can make 2 shots.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.930
essentially I can choose any
two of these shots I take to

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.470
be the ones that I make.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.280
I'm not picking it, but
the god's of probability

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.040
will pick it.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.880
So this isn't the
only circumstance.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.200
The probability of just this
circumstance, where I miss

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.700
exactly the last
2 shots is this.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.390
But if I wanted to figure out
all of the different ways that

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.350
I can make exactly 2 shots, I
would essentially say, well,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:41.450
I'm taking 6 shots and I'm
choosing 2 of them to be made.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:42.980
So how many does
that result in?

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:43.300
Let's see.

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:50.460
6 factorial over 2 factorial
6 minus 2 factorial.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.480
That is equal to-- I like
to multiply it out.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:59.030
That's 6 times 5 times 4 times
2 times 1 over 2 times 1.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:02.370
This is 4 factorial, 6
minus 2 is 4 factorial.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.725
4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:09:04.725 --> 00:09:06.450
And actually, I forgot
to write a 4 up here.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.040
6 times 5 times 3 times
3 times 2 times 1.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.700
Anyway, this cancels
out with that.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.840
The 2 and the 6 is a
3, so it becomes 15.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.700
So there are 15 possible ways
to make exactly two shots,

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.780
especially if you don't care
about the order in which-- I'm

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.380
not saying that this point and
this point, if they were

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:31.390
to happen the other way
around, it doesn't matter.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:34.290
It's kind of the
same circumstance.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.190
I made the last two shots.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.640
It doesn't say I made the
second to last shot in one

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.340
way and I made the last
shot in the other way.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.900
We're not differentiating
between, we're just saying

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.250
that we made them.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.380
So that's why there's 15
different ways to make

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.040
2 shots out of 6.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.800
And the probability of each
of those is 0.7 to the

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.000
fourth times 0.3 squared.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.610
So the probability of making
exactly 2 shots is going to be

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:10.710
6 choose 2 times 0.7 to the
fourth times 0.3 squared.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.060
And we can go on.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.650
Let's do them fast.

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:18.650
The probability that I make
exactly 3 shots by the same

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.710
logic-- well, what's the
probability that I make

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.600
exactly-- in any one of the
circumstance-- well, how many

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.320
ways can I make 3 shots?

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.760
Well, I'm taking 6
and I'm choosing 3.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.080
And then the probability of
each of those ways is, in

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.550
order to make 3 shots I'm
going to miss 3 shots.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:38.820
And then I'm going
to make 3 shots.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.550
That's straightforward enough
and we could calculate

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.900
what that is.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.800
But hopefully you know it.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.370
Let me just do it.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:51.700
So that's 6 factorial over 3
factorial times 6 minus 3

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:59.520
factorial times this part--
0.7 third time's 0.3 squared.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.400
Let's keep going and this
should actually get faster once

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.040
you-- see probability that
I make exactly 4 shots.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.230
Well, I'm taking 6 and I'm
going to make 4 of them.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.090
So I have to choose 4 out of 6.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:16.170
So if I'm making 4 shots
I missing 2 shots, so

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:17.900
there's going to be
2 shots that I miss.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.110
0.7 times 0.7.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.360
That's the probability
of a miss-- 0.7.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.320
And then I making 4 of them.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.900
So 0.3-- there's a 30% chance
of making each of them.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.940
So to make 4 it's
0.3 to the fourth.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.600
So in any one of these ways
where I make 4 shots, this

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.590
is their probability.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.080
And there are this many
ways of doing it.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:44.330
And that's equal to 6 factorial
over 4 factorial times

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.210
6 minus 4 factorial.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:52.460
And then times 0.7 squared
times 0.3 to the fourth.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.970
And if you think,
this is 2 factorial.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.850
We figured out what
that was up here.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.790
6 choose 2 was the same thing.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.040
It was 6 factorial over
2 factorial divided

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.680
by 4 factorial.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.990
It's the same thing as
this, we just switched

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.400
the 4's and the 2's.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.030
So this would also
be equal to 15.

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.260
Anyway, I'll probably do
that in the next video,

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.000
but let's just calculate
these really fast.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.370
The probability that
X is equal to 5?

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.470
I make 5 shots.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:25.110
That's 6 choose 5 times 0.7.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.640
So I'm only missing
1 shot, right?

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.070
So the probability of missing 1
is 0.7 and then I have to make

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.960
5, not necessarily in a
row-- 0.3 to the fifth.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.120
But you see, any given way
that I make exactly 5 shots,

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.240
this is the probability.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.880
And there are this many
ways, 6 choose 5 ways of

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.310
making exactly 5 shots.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.650
I could get the first 5
shots, miss the sixth.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.780
I could get the last 5 shots.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.335
I could make the first,
miss the second, et

00:12:54.335 --> 00:12:55.850
cetera and so forth.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.030
And then finally, the
probability that

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.290
X is equal to 6?

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.440
I make all of the shots.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.590
That's 6 choose 6.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.210
How many ways can I pick 6
things out of 6 choices?

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.260
And there's really
only one way.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.640
You could calculate it
by calculating that.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.380
Once again, you'll have to know
that 0 factorial is equal to 1.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.100
I have to make all 6 shots.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.370
So 0.3 to the sixth.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.020
0.3 times 0.3 times 0.3
times 0.3-- anyway, I'm

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.070
all out of time again.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.750
In the next video we're
going to graph this.
