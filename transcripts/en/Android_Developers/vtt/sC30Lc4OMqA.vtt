00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.320
The partners at TouchTen

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.840
we are brothers that really enjoy 
games ever since we were young.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.440
And so naturally 
when we come form a company,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.680
we want to work on something we really enjoy

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.760
and that is mobile games.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.000
Mobile games is a 
global competitive market.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.520
But coming back to the local market,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.440
we see strong support from the

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.080
Indonesian and Southeast Asian 
gamers towards local content.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.000
The strength that we know we have is that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.560
we are local, we are here, 
we speak the language

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.480
and we know the culture.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.960
The games that we make

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.160
have a lot of things in common

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.680
which is food.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.320
And this is a really good inspiration

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.320
to make this game, Warung Chain.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.240
Part of the insight 
that we also get is that

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.680
a lot of foodies, people who like food,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.480
also like to be able to own a shop.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.720
Our game gives that kind of simulation

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.880
where you own and manage a restaurant.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.280
Now for Warung Chain

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.680
close to 3 million people 
download the game.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.360
What Google Play has allowed us to do

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.400
What Google Play has allowed us to do

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.520
is to very easily launch our games

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.600
bring it to the gamers that like it

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.920
to gain insights and improvements 
on the game as a result.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.320
For one of our games called Dessert Chain

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.600
we just did AB testing for the app icon.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.920
More than 60% of our local users

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.680
prefer character icon to food icon.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.240
That’s super awesome feedback for us.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.000
We were very proud to submit Warung Chain

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.560
in Indonesia Game contest

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.960
the very first local 
game competition provided by Google.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.840
We got really really hyped

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.160
when the Google Play team said 
that Warung Chain is the winner.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.320
This is home to many 
vibrant local developers

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.520
as well as the young 
population that we have

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.520
which I think will be a 
market not to be ignored.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.120
In the same way that we try to 
understand our local audience

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.720
we want to bring this 
to the global audience

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.360
and to bring meaningful content to them.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.760
This goes in line with our 
company name Touch Ten

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.400
is to touch the sky

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.520
and that’s our aim.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.960
We are very proud 
to be made in Indonesia

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.560
and we want to put
Indonesia in the map

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.640
a game creator, 
not just as a game consumer.
