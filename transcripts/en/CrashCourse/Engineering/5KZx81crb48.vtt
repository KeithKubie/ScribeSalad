00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.500
We all make mistakes.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.600
In life and engineering, you’re not always
going to succeed.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.400
What’s important is that you learn from
your screw-ups and incorporate those lessons
into what you do next.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.740
Because when you don’t, the consequences
can be bad. Even deadly.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.260
To help keep us on track, we need something
that will provide a sense of morality and a set of
best practices for doing good in the world.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.360
We need ethics.
Specifically, we need engineering ethics.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:36.780
[Theme Music]

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.180
Engineering is a broad, ever-changing field.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.500
With so many different branches, it’s good
to have some common ground –

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.920
a general set of guidelines or ideas for how
the engineers of the world should go about
solving problems.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.460
One of these is safety, which we’ll talk
about more next time.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.880
The other is ethics.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:59.440
In general, ethics is a moral philosophy that tries
to deal with what’s right, what’s wrong, and what
your duty is to do good – and not do bad.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.000
Engineering ethics is essentially this same
mindset, just applied to the field of engineering.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.200
It’s the study of values, issues, and decisions
that are involved with the work of engineers.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.740
Ethics has a particular importance for
engineers because people’s lives are so
often going to be in your hands.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.180
It’s not just about remembering your manners
or being nice to your neighbor.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.380
What you create as an engineer could save
a person’s life or take it away.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.440
When you swallow a pill at the hospital, you
need to be able to trust that the people that came
up with it had your best interests in mind.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.660
When you drive over a bridge, you need to
know that the civil engineers who designed it took
the time to make it as sturdy as possible.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.260
The foods you eat – the cars you drive – the
wires in your home they all need to be designed
with ethics in mind.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.000
If you want to see how bad an engineering
failure can be, look no further than the Kansas
City Hyatt-Regency Collapse.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.640
In July of 1980, the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Kansas City,
Missouri was showing off its new multi-story atrium,
decked out with two levels of suspended walkways.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.280
These walkways were supported by beams, which
were supposed to be held up by long rods hanging
from the ceiling.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.400
To even the load and reduce the stress on
each beam, the walkways were supposed to have
a single rod extending all the way through them.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.920
But something happened between the initial
design stage and the actual building of the atrium.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.360
When the builders had some difficulty putting it
together, the system was modified to have 2 separate,
shorter rods instead of a single longer one.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:26.600
This design change meant that the upper rod had to not
only support the weight of the walkway that it held up,
but also the one below it – essentially doubling the load.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:36.140
During a party about a year after the atrium opened,
these beams failed and the two walkways collapsed,
killing 114 people and injuring 216 others.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.940
In terms of lost lives, it was one of the most
devastating structural failures in U.S. history.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.060
A lot went wrong, much of it caused by poor
oversight and bad communication.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.940
A formal review of the changed design never
happened, strength calculations were never
performed, work was subcontracted out,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.020
and the engineer on record put their seal on the
design without personally checking everything.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.240
It all could’ve been prevented, if only
they’d followed the engineer’s Code of Ethics.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.890
There are a couple of different ones out there,
but today we’ll use the Code of Ethics from the
American Society of Civil Engineers, or ASCE.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.680
Their Code of Ethics has eight distinct principles,
the first being: “Hold Safety Paramount”.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.620
This means that your chief concern as an engineer
needs to be the health and welfare of the public.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.540
The rule goes on to say that you should only
approve designs that are determined to be safe and
that conform with accepted engineering standards.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.260
The fact that there weren’t any calculations
done on the design changes to the walkway,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.460
and that the engineer on duty approved the
designs without properly checking them clearly
goes against this principle.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:41.960
That’s why the Committee of Professional Conduct that reviewed the case ruled that the engineer had violated their code and suspended them from the Society for three years.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.420
If you take a look at the rest of the Code,
you can see some other useful rules about how
engineers should approach a problem.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.940
The second rule is to “Service With Competence”,
which means that you should only work in areas
that you’re skilled in.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.580
If you’re not an electrical engineer, you
shouldn’t be messing with the wires in a
building.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.720
The third states that you should always “Issue
True Statements”.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.000
Basically, don’t lie.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.120
Then comes the need to “Act As A Faithful
Agent” for each of your employers or clients
and avoid conflicts of interest.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.760
One of your jobs shouldn’t cause you to
sabotage another.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.800
There’s also the rule of “Reputation By Merit”,
which means your reputation is built up by the work
that you do and not by unfair means.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.340
That goes hand-in-hand with the requirement
to “Uphold Professional Honor”,

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.600
where you act with integrity and have a zero tolerance
policy for bribery, fraud, or any sort of corruption.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:33.160
The 7th rule is to “Continue Professional Development,”
and it’s one of the most important for the long-term
growth of society and the engineering field.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.340
You need to not only foster your own development
as an engineer, but that of other engineers as well.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.660
You always need to report what happens, no
matter the consequences.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:47.120
And finally, the eighth rule is to “Treat
All Persons Fairly”, which is really just
a good mantra for life.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.540
Now, codes are great, but they’re not perfect.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.560
People can, and do, break the rules.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.380
And codes can’t always address every situation.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.680
They may need to be updated as society and
technology advance.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.920
So it all comes down to this: what are the
highest priorities?

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.080
If engineers are trying to create good for
the public, you need to ask “what is good”
|and “how can we prioritize good’?

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:14.280
It can’t just be consequentialism – having
the end justify the means – or you leave the door
open for some pretty big ethical gray areas.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.120
No, we need better ethics than that.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.460
One of the most influential ethical theories
to engineering has been utilitarianism.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.520
This is the belief that actions are right if
they are useful or beneficial to the majority
of people.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.120
You should try and maximize the overall good
that you can do, taking into account all of those
that will be affected by your actions.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.600
Rights ethics is also very important.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.960
Simply put, you should do your best to respect
the rights of others.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.360
Acts of respect aren’t just ideal, but
necessary, regardless of whether or not they
always maximize the overall good.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.040
In that way, you can see how ethical theories
can stack on each other.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.240
There’s also duty ethics, which is all about
respecting another person’s autonomy.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.810
This builds on rights ethics, but puts the
spotlight on your duties, rather than another
person’s rights.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.060
If you have a right to live, then I have a
duty to not market a misleading product
that could kill you.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.020
Or sign off on a new walkway design that I
haven’t checked.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.420
Applying engineering ethics is all about trying
to balance these ethical theories with whatever
situation you’re put in.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.320
It’s not always easy – or simple – but as
an engineer, you have a duty to try your best.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.540
We improve, individually and as a community,
with practice and learning from the past.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.440
Remember that Citicorp building we talked
about last episode?

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.300
The one whose pillars were in the middle of
its sides rather than at the corners?

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:35.320
Wind from the wrong angle could cause the entire
structure to fall, and no one realized until a student
pointed out the problem after it was already built.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.220
After those discoveries were made and they started
immediate repairs, did they have an obligation to
inform everyone in the building?

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.300
How about the church that was underneath it?

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.240
What about the people in the surrounding area?

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.380
Or the media?
Or the local government?

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.700
What was the proper protocol that they should
have followed?

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.420
If you pick apart this incident, you can zero in
on the ethics surrounding several of these points.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.580
To start, you need to analyze those wind loads.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.840
You need to check all of your calculations
and not simply rely on building codes,

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.040
which only set minimum requirements and aren't always
what a specific project needs.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.580
Then you should address the design changes,
which in this case was a switch from welded
connections to bolted ones.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.040
Those changes need to be considered in the
overall design and checked by everyone involved.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.730
It can’t just be a hasty decision.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:23.000
You also have your professional responsibility
to follow the codes of conduct for every chartered
institution that applies to what you’re doing.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.060
Public statements are absolutely necessary
in a situation like this.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.400
The public has a right to know what’s going
on so they can plan accordingly.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.780
If you don’t release a public statement or,
like Citicorp, put out one that’s misleading,

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.380
you’re denying people their right to ensure
their own safety and make their own educated
decisions.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.490
Finally, no matter what happens, you need
to share and contribute to the advancement
of professional knowledge.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:49.980
Concealing the Citicorp problem for over 20
years robbed everyone of decades of ethical
and engineering learning.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:54.180
That’s why even when tragedies happen, it’s
important to treat them as case-studies

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.120
on what you might learn to do differently in
the future when approaching other problems.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.500
Like if you’re going to try and go into space,
you need to know about the Space Shuttle
Challenger disaster.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.960
In 1986, a leak in one of its solid rocket
boosters ignited the main liquid fuel tank,

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.720
resulting in the loss of the vehicle and the
death of the crew.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:16.040
NASA found the cause of the disaster to be the
failure of an "O-ring" seal in the solid-fuel rocket,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:21.440
and while there were many factors that contributed
to this disaster, it was fundamentally an ethics problem.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:30.040
Sufficient testing hadn’t been done on the O-rings and NASA management didn’t listen to the concerns of some engineers, all so they could stay on their launch schedule.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.400
Who knows what would’ve happened if a better
ethical code was followed?

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.140
It could’ve still gone wrong, but maybe
it wouldn’t have.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.600
All we can do is try.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.820
And with a strong code of ethics at our side,
and the knowledge of the past at our backs,

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.560
we can make the best, most informed decisions
to ensure our designs have the best possible impact.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.160
There’s no better way to do it.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.440
Today we talked about ethics and how it can
be applied to engineering.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:57.880
We learned what a Code of Ethics is and how
it can apply to a situation like the Kansas City
Hyatt-Regency collapse.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:04.560
Then we learned about engineering ethics and
the ethical theories of utilitarianism, rights
ethics, and duty ethics.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:10.820
Finally, we brought it all together by going
back to the situation with Citicorp and analyzing
it from an ethical perspective.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.150
I’ll see you next time, when we’ll talk
all about safety.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.780
Crash Course Engineering is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios,

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:22.380
which also produces Origin of Everything,
a show that explores the history behind stuff
in our everyday life,

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:29.200
from the words we use, the pop culture we
love, the technology that get us through the day,
or the identities we give ourselves.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.510
Check it out at the link in the description.

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:38.540
Crash Course is a Complexly production and this
episode was filmed in the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney
Studio with the help of these wonderful people.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.240
