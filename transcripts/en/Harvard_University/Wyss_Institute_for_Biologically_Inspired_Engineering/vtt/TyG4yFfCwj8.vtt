00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:04.170
For a long time,
scientists,
clinicians,
and engineers

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.380
have been working
to find the next

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.424
generation medical
grade adhesive.

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:09.175
But, current methods
so far have been limited

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.052
because they're either
cytotoxic, they're rigid,

00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:13.972
they don't adhere
well to dynamically
moving surfaces.

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:16.349
So, for the most part,
surgeons have been left

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.227
with sutures and
staple-based techniques.

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:22.022
And because of their
invasive character,

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.065
they create tissue
damage, and they are

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:26.234
prone to microbial infection,

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:28.278
it can be a
poor cosmetic outcome,

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:32.198
and they are time-
intensive, which increases 
the overall cost.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:35.243
The Bioinspired Approach

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:38.621
The gel is really interesting
because it combines some

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:41.124
recent advances in hydrogel
technology

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.376
with inspiration from nature.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.670
And in this case, we turned
to the Dusky Arion slug.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.423
When it gets threatened by
a predator, they change the

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:52.260
composition of their mucus,
and it becomes extremely

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.888
adherent to the underlying
substrate.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.974
And then, they analyzed
the composition of this mucus,

00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:02.771
and they found out it's an
ionically cross-linked
polysaccharide,

00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:05.148
and covalently cross-linked
protein.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:08.651
So it creates this unique
interpenetrating network.

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:12.113
We used many of the components
within this slug slime,

00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:15.784
as inspiration to engineer
materials that behaved in
a similar way.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.787
Components of the
Tough Gel Adhesive

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:22.415
There is an adhesive layer
and then there's a
tough gel component

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:27.337
that can dissipate the energy
and this gives the unique
mechanical properties.

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:31.800
By combining these two polymer
networks, we're able to achieve
much greater deformations.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.844
The Tough Gel

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:38.640
The tough gel that we create
is about 90% water.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.810
Most of it's water, and this
material through its
dual-network,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.438
it's able to stretch up to
twenty-times its 
initial length.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.857
Which is quite interesting,
because the slug slime

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:52.862
that inspired it, can also
stretch to very high
magnitudes of deformation.

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:56.491
And that same slug slime
is about 95% water.

00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:59.452
The Adhesive Layer

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.955
There are three major
interactions that are giving

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.332
these unique
adhesion properties.

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:07.085
These are covalent interactions:

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:11.172
We add in some coupling
reagents, and do some other 
surface chemistry modifications

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:15.760
to be able to create these
strong covalent bonds
that create adhesion.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.679
And ionic interactions:

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.264
When we think about these

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:21.558
materials carrying this
net positive charge,

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:22.642
And that tissues have a

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:23.726
net negative charge,

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:24.769
we can think about

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.729
these electrostatic
interactions.

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:29.482
Similar to laundry clinging
to each other in a dryer

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:30.650
after it's been operating.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.153
And also, physical
interpenetration:

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:37.073
the physical network formation
between the tissue and adhesive.

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:41.452
Which is similar to reaching
and pulling out a telephone cord
from a bunch of tangled cords.

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:44.330
This bridging polymer
interpenetrates into the tissue,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.709
and gel networks and really
forms a lot of entanglements.

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.087
The uniqueness about this
technology is it can actually

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:55.300
work in a wet and dynamic
environment.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.387
You can adhere to surfaces
even in the presence of blood.

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:02.515
We've even tested this in the
case of a beating heart,

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:05.518
you can apply blood to the 
tissue surface, you can apply

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:09.105
the tough adhesive &amp; it adheres
very strongly to the surface.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:12.275
Manufacturing Process

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:15.278
So, the first step is to
make the tough gel.

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:18.281
We make the tough gel by
essentially dissolving

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:23.077
alginate in solution, we
purify that aliginate solution.

00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:26.039
And then, we add in some
polyacrylamide

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.249
into some syringes, we do
syringe mixing steps,

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.127
and then we inject the solutions
into some molds,

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:33.755
we can mold them into any shape
that we might be interested in.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:37.175
We can apply our adhesive
components to it,

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:39.427
and we can couple those
adhesive polymers 

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:42.680
to the surface of the gel,
which we can then 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.975
apply the composite gel
adhesive surface

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:48.770
to our wet tissue.
We apply compression

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.855
on the order of one or two
minutes,

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:54.692
and as that happens, the
adhesion energy increases
rapidly,

00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:57.362
by that time, you're
already much higher
than most commercially

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:59.656
available medical-grade
adhesives

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:03.368
We found that our tough
adhesive adheres strongly to

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:06.663
skin, cartilage, and
arteries,

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:08.915
and we also found
that it can actually

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.918
close holes in the
heart tissue,

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:13.711
and it stops
bleeding from a

00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:15.463
lesioned liver
tissue.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:17.882
I think that if we
think about
developing a vision

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:18.716
for the future of
medicine, 

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.551
I think we can think
about creating

00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:22.595
adhesive sutureless
interfaces

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.931
developing materials
that can improve

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.391
the way that tissues
heal without

00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:28.184
interfering with them
further 

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.228
is what gets me excited 
about this work,

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:32.397
as we continue to develop
this technology.
