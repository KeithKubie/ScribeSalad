Are Listening to radio lab radio lab

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,593
from

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,470
W. N. Y. S. E. N. N. P. R. Hey, I'm Jad
Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich. Yep.

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,850
This is radio lab and a today. Just
to start things off for this podcast.

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,700
All right. Let's just say
that you love an author,

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,880
but somehow the text isn't enough. Okay?

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,090
It doesn't get you close enough
to the author. So what do you do?

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,270
You know what you do,
but take off your shoes.

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,010
You take off your stocks as you stand
on the plan and the book and your whole

10
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:42,180
body. Let me, yeah, let me give
you a different flavor that,

11
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,060
hello? How about you take the tex,

12
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:48,330
give it to this guy he puts into a
computer and you turn it into data?

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,200
What do you mean? Who is that I,
this is a, My name is Ian Lancashire.

14
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:58,950
I'm a professor of English
at the University of Toronto.
Now, Ian, as he said,

15
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:01,470
is an English professor, but
he's also a computer guy, right.

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,440
Founded a computing center
with the help of IBM Canada.

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,100
And the reason he combines those two is
because he's interested in the secrets

18
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:12,360
behind the authors word and that desire.

19
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:13,760
He says to take a text,

20
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,190
spin it the data as a way to get
into that author's head. Well,

21
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:21,740
that goes back to long way. It goes back
to the fathers of the Christian Church.

22
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,290
It's the Bible. In the early Middle Ages,

23
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,010
some monks decided to make what's
called a concordance of the Bible.

24
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:34,100
And what that means is they were going
to take every single word in the Bible

25
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:38,840
and there are 960,243 of them, at
least in the King James version,

26
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,090
and they're going to list
them all alphabetically,

27
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,620
notate each time every single word was
used and the context, oh, Yay. Yes.

28
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:48,590
Imagine it. You begin
with the first, first.

29
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,800
In the beginning

30
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:58,130
you create a heading for the first word
n, and then for the second word, Duh.

31
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,960
And then for the third beginning,
every time you come across those words,

32
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:04,790
you have to write a context.

33
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,670
In genesis one verse one the
current one in the beginning,

34
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,980
genesis one per sixth
Kearns two and God said,

35
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:11,450
let there be for a minute in the myths,

36
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,770
all handwritten and at the end you n
well you end up with a a lot of pieces of

37
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:21,360
paper. So many that it, it took
those first monks, you know,

38
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,080
who decided to do this an entire
lifetime to complete it. Nowadays,

39
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,360
you know, with computers you
can be done in under 15 seconds.

40
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,900
So that all just basically sets the stage
for the story that I'm about to tell

41
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:38,920
you, it's the 1980s Ian is an
English professor, Toronto.

42
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:42,760
He's got a lab full of kids computers
and he's using them to analyze his

43
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:47,580
favorite authors, Samuel Taylor
Coleridge, TSL, IA, James Choice, Cadman,

44
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:51,480
Chaucer, Shakespeare, and he's starting
up some interesting stuff sort of,

45
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:53,890
for example, in his poetry,

46
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,970
Melton didn't use the word
because who knows why. Yeah.

47
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,223
But at a certain,

48
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,620
Ian decided to look at more modern
authors and so I turned to Agatha Christie

49
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,800
[inaudible] at the time he was doing this.

50
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,360
We're now in the nineties Agatha Christie
happened to be the most published

51
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,030
author ever. She sold a
billion books, a billion,

52
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,720
like be billion. She was
number one failing God after,

53
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:23,980
after the Bible. I think.

54
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,060
So what I did is I collected two of her
earliest novels written in the early

55
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,050
twenties fed those 200 Peter

56
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,360
and I did the third [inaudible].

57
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,860
Eventually you would add in 14 additional
books that cover 50 years of Agatha

58
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,990
Christie's writing. What does
the computer doing exactly?

59
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,290
Measuring the individual
concordance, word frequency,

60
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,010
vocabulary of the works and all the
while it's spitting out these reports.

61
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,520
And I saw the totals at the bottom.
So all this is first of all,

62
00:03:59,521 --> 00:04:01,530
a woman written needling
detective Knowles,

63
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,280
which is just amazing in and of itself.

64
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,440
Something the computer found that her
use of language was relatively consistent

65
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:11,130
and normal, uh, for the
first 72 of those books.

66
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:15,600
But something happened on book
number 73 something drastic.

67
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,730
What suddenly her use of
words, like words like thing,

68
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:24,300
anything, something, nothing.
What Ian Calls indefinite words.

69
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,990
These these words increased six times,

70
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,500
but also when the computer added up
the vocabulary size of that book,

71
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:36,120
that is how many different words
are there in the first 50,000 words.

72
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:40,800
If a text it found in this book
there were 20% fewer different words.

73
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:45,150
That is astounding. That's one
fifth of our vocabulary lost.

74
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,310
It gradually dawned on him that what he
might be seeing was the very beginning

75
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:52,050
stages of an author

76
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:53,820
mm

77
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,610
losing herself. She had
developed Alzheimer's

78
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:06,810
[inaudible].

79
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,690
I delayed publishing my
results for two years.

80
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,810
I had to to have the results analyzed
by computational linguist and a

81
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,520
statistician and in her lifetime
was she ever actually diagnosed?

82
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,800
Absolutely not. There was no diagnosis.

83
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,300
He said that some of her biographers
suspected that something was up in her

84
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,850
later years. One point parently
she cut off all of her hair.

85
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,690
She was not doing very well in
interviews as far as we know.

86
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:36,300
She was never taken to a
doctor, never got diagnosed.

87
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:39,330
I think her family closed
around her and protected her

88
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,503
[inaudible].

89
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,080
I realized that I was seeing
something about the human mind.

90
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:51,710
I was seeing the author in the text in
a way that people hadn't seen the author

91
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,850
and the texts before.

92
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,470
Um,

93
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,060
raised the question for me. And I
think this can apply to anyone. I mean,

94
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,940
we all write a bazillion emails a day.
I've got a decades worth on my computer.

95
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Does that stuff cold clues about what
will be like early warning signs?

96
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:13,530
I think it's possible. It does, yes.

97
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,170
And it's well worth doing research
about how a loss of vocabulary can be

98
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,430
determined, let's say in man's email
over five or six years. Indications are,

99
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:25,280
he says that those clues
are there. Not only that,

100
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,890
they may actually be there practically
from the beginning. Oh, Yup.

101
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,020
Yup. Very famous example is
the so-called none study. Okay.

102
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,790
The nun study actually began in 1990
and what's this is Dr Kelvin Lim.

103
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,390
He works at the University of Minnesota
and is the current director of the

104
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,130
so-called none study and this study
more than any other that we know really

105
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:53,480
makes the point about the predictive
power of the words we choose.

106
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,160
Study began with a guy named David
Snowden who wanted to look at aging over

107
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:03,140
time. So he chose nuns because he wanted
a group that was healthy. For example,

108
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:06,830
they don't smoke, they don't drink,
they all have similar lifestyles,

109
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,060
obviously haven't had children.

110
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,820
So he approached this one
particular order in Connecticut,

111
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,850
all the school sisters of Notre Dame and
he signed up just short of 700 nuns and

112
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:20,240
the only stipulation being you had
to be at least 75 years of age.

113
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,160
And so we're now 20 years in the study.

114
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:26,880
So that means the youngest of the
sisters is about 90 yeah, I think I am.

115
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:31,290
I am the youngest. And you
are 94 years old? Yes sir.

116
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,300
Not 95 not 95

117
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,160
this is sister Alberta Sheridan.
I like the way you said that.

118
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,920
Do you happen to know who the oldest
remaining sister in the study is?

119
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,260
Wait a minute now. The
one who was very today,

120
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,570
John was 101 I think she was the oldest
one in the study. Wow. In our province.

121
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:50,940
Yes. The study began,
uh, innocently enough.

122
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:55,140
She says the researchers would
show up to the convent every year,

123
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,170
give the nuns a bunch of tests.
But like mostly from memory,

124
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,290
we just questioning back and forth.
Right. And then over the years,

125
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:04,590
as the nuns passed away, which
many of them have at this point,

126
00:08:04,591 --> 00:08:09,180
they've all gone check of the
original 678 sisters. At this point,

127
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:14,181
we have approximately 40 sisters still
alive and participating in the study.

128
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,370
And I'm the only one left
here in the Wilton province.

129
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,960
And as an unsurpassed away,

130
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:22,050
the researchers had arranged it so that
they would get a small piece of their

131
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,400
brains, which they could examine
for plaques and tangles. Oh,

132
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,380
this morning we buried assister here.

133
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:32,370
I told you at the funeral was delayed a
bit because she had to be taken to the

134
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:36,990
hospital to have a portion of her
brain removed to further this study.

135
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,220
Oh, [inaudible]. Okay.

136
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:43,940
So here's why I bring this
study up because of an
accident that happened pretty

137
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:47,840
early on, the changed everything in the
study, David Snowden, the main dude,

138
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:51,050
was in the, uh, convent archives
and he was talking to the archivist.

139
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,230
Yorkville says to him, Hey, you know,
all of these nuns that you're studying,

140
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:58,440
who right now are over the of
75 I actually have the essays

141
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,780
that they wrote right when they got here.

142
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,100
And they did this roughly at about
age 18, like 60 years before.

143
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,980
Oh, yes. Oh yeah. Right. I
have a copy of it at home.

144
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,933
Thank you so much.

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,500
We actually asked to report
or Naomi Sterban to visit
sister Alberta at her home

146
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:21,501
in Connecticut today and having her
read her essay that is now 76 years old.

147
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,513
Yeah, go ahead.

148
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,713
[inaudible]

149
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,290
oh,

150
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,960
two days after the birth
of the Christ child,

151
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,410
I was brought as a belated Christmas gift
to Mr and Mrs. Albert Joseph Sheridan

152
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,160
of Providence, Rhode Island. A week later,

153
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,090
the sparkling waters of
baptism were poured over me.

154
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,770
Nicklin read all the silly stuff
that when I first entered. Why not?

155
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,700
It sounds kind of Saccharin. I
was only a teenager when I wrote,

156
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,880
but here's the thing. When the
researchers found the essays, like

157
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,630
when you just heard it was a gold
mine, there was a major, major find.

158
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,070
So the analyze the essays looking
primarily at two specific features of the

159
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:06,910
language that was contained in these
narratives that Serge, AICPA, Houma,

160
00:10:06,911 --> 00:10:10,000
he does the analysis for the
current and unsteady particular,

161
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:14,920
they looked at the notion of grammatical
complexity and a idea density.

162
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,680
What is idea density? What does
that mean? Density is, um, a,

163
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,080
um,

164
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,080
measure that looks at how many basic units
of meaning are contained in any given

165
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,380
utterance divided by the total
number of words in that utterance.

166
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,140
In other words,

167
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,050
the date of my birth is December 27th.

168
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,530
Like if you'd listen to sister
Alberta's autobiography,

169
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,620
when I was 11 years of age, my
dear mother was called to God.

170
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,660
It's the number of little discrete ideas
she's able to cram into one sentence.

171
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,720
This was to be a turning point in my life
as I had always had the odd desire to

172
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:51,080
become a sister.

173
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,740
Here's a classic example of the difference
between low and high idea density.

174
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:55,370
Here's low

175
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,370
from sister Helen. I was born in a Claire,

176
00:10:58,371 --> 00:11:01,520
Wisconsin on May 24th,

177
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,720
1913 and was baptized in same
James Church. Okay, that's low.

178
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,910
Now here's high from sister Emma.

179
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,900
It was about a half hour before midnight
between February 28th and 29th of the

180
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:19,031
leap year in 1,912 when I began to live
and to die as the third child of my

181
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:25,250
mother whose maiden name is Hilda
Hoffman and my father auto Schmidt.

182
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,310
I got to say I'm liking
the first one, Jed,

183
00:11:28,311 --> 00:11:33,311
probably you as a journalist seen the
first one as straight to the point.

184
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,010
Yeah, it's good writing. The second one
seems kind of embellished a little bit.

185
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:38,660
Yeah, but here's the punchline of all.

186
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:43,210
Well, this turns out that the people
who when they were 18 wrote in that

187
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:47,260
journalistically very precise,
low idea density sort of way.

188
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,350
Those people 60 years later, we're vastly,

189
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,330
vastly more likely to develop dementia.
In fact, based on those essays alone,

190
00:11:55,331 --> 00:12:00,331
the researchers could predict with about
85% accuracy what the nuns brains would

191
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,780
look like when they died and were
able to look at the brains. I mean,

192
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:09,280
would the brains have plaques and tangles
that you associate with Alzheimer's or

193
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:13,660
would they not? What I
mean that's just crazy

194
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,280
why it's backwards reasoning. But
we'll see you, we'll see. I'm, I'm,

195
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,140
I'm just suddenly, I'm suspicious. Here's
a man who, from what you just said,

196
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,090
has found the ones who got sick and
working backwards found certain incidences

197
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:29,190
of this, that or the other. And this, ah,

198
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,580
this is a cause that produces
this effect. No, no, no, no, no.

199
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,750
There is no cause and effect here.

200
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:38,430
These studies are demonstrating
associations, right?

201
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,080
They're not demonstrating causality.
It's a very important distinction.

202
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,430
This is just the correlation.
Okay. But you know,

203
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,540
that may be one of 190 correlations that
produce people who get Alzheimer's in

204
00:12:51,391 --> 00:12:52,890
the end. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I mean,

205
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,770
but let me argue your case actually
from a different angle. Like,

206
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,050
would this kind of linguistic
analysis actually be relevant in the,

207
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:05,340
in the age of Twitter where everything
is short and clip people Twitter only

208
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:10,320
Twitter, they might also write um,
small, short tens essays for their yeah.

209
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,570
But no, you know, man,
I guess you are right.

210
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:14,310
It's like it's mostly about
the thoughts in your head,

211
00:13:14,311 --> 00:13:17,040
not so much why you write well.
So what about Agatha Christie?

212
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,620
Was there a conclusion about
Agatha? Yeah, there was,

213
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,870
I get the Christian writing.
Elephants can remember.

214
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,810
This brings us back to
Ian Lancaster and uh,

215
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,990
that 73rd book of Agatha
Christie's that he analyzed,

216
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,490
found that her vocabulary dipped
well before he did the analysis.

217
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,560
He picked up that book and gave it a read.

218
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,410
And like most people who
read it didn't like it.

219
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,800
Initially I thought it was very
poorly written, badly plotted,

220
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:45,120
full of errors of time
of dating, terrible read.

221
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,550
Then I realized when I looked at
the title, elephants can remember,

222
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,090
he realized that maybe
Agatha Christie sensed

223
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,710
what was happening to her.

224
00:13:55,711 --> 00:14:00,540
She was responding to that truism
that elephants never forget the a,

225
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,310
the chief character is an,

226
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,700
an aging female novelist named Ariadne
who is a foil for I get the herself and

227
00:14:08,491 --> 00:14:12,750
she Ariadne is suffering from
memory loss in the story.

228
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,600
She tries to help a
detective self this crime,

229
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:21,450
but she has trouble cause she keeps
forgetting. And uh, the last, uh,

230
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,620
the last sentence in that novel
in fact, is Agatha Sang, well,

231
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:26,830
maybe it's okay now.

232
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,773
Do you remember

233
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,610
she was trying to defend herself,

234
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:38,330
defend her sense that she was forgetting
she was losing her vocabulary.

235
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,500
She was losing her language.

236
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,290
I began to see that Kristi was heroic,

237
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:50,950
still writing despite this handicap and
her willingness do that at an age of 81

238
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:59,840
82 struck me as is heroic in a way.

239
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,380
Well, I understand that
the amuse wouldn't quit,

240
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,590
but the tools all left the room. Yeah,

241
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,020
I think we should leave the room. Okay.
