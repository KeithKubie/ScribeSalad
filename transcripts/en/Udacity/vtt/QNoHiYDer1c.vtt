00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.100
The apps and games that are at
the top of the grossing charts,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.263
on any of the different
platforms stores are generally

00:00:08.263 --> 00:00:11.020
using IAP's in order
to drive that revenue.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.880
It's where the bulk of it's coming from.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.150
And there's a couple of key things
that they keep in mind when the app

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.380
developers are determining which IAP's
they should offer and how to price them.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.840
First and foremost, when choosing which
items to offer as in-app purchases,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.550
you have to make sure that the items
are content that enriches the game.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.930
I wouldn't rely on just having something
that prevents ads from being shown

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.310
or maybe just one or two variations
in graphics or things like that.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.195
It has to really be something
that stands out and

00:00:46.195 --> 00:00:51.060
takes somebody that may have never paid
and turns them into a paying user.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.490
There are a few
different forms of IAP's.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.189
This first are content, so
if you want to offer new items,

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.030
perhaps new maps, if it's a game,
that falls under content.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.700
The second is functionality, so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.330
if there's a different way to use your
app or game, perhaps a different mode.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.030
Perhaps you want to unlock
different weapons that might

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.060
dramatically change
the game play experience.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.310
That would fall under functionality.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.530
There are also services.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.821
So if you're building an app or

00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:31.641
a game where there are services that you
need to offer that aren't necessarily

00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:36.504
something that you can do really
quickly within the game itself.

00:01:36.504 --> 00:01:41.224
Perhaps there's a superior level of
support if you're offering an app that's

00:01:41.224 --> 00:01:46.420
a little bit more sophisticated, that's
another type of IAP that you can offer.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.700
Finally, there's subscriptions.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.608
If you're doing an app that functions
a bit more like a magazine or

00:01:52.608 --> 00:01:57.025
a game that requires a multiplayer
subscription in order to play online.

00:01:57.025 --> 00:01:59.130
This is where subscriptions lie.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.390
They're probably the least popular,

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.040
just because the use cases
are a little bit more limited.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.060
But they're no less valuable

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.020
than any of the other types
of IAP's that you can offer.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.720
So IAP's can be consumable,
use them once and that's it.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.890
They can be non-consumable, so something
like an additional map pack that

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.020
somebody should always have
access to is a non-consumable.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.910
There are different types of
subscriptions that you can offer,

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.620
you can offer a free subscription,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.720
an auto-renewing subscription,
a non-renewing subscription.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.720
And it really depends on what you think
people are most likely to purchase.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.410
And all of this can be tested, so

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.870
you don't have to determine right
off the bat how this is going to go.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.270
When you're selecting IAP's,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.810
it's important to select
a wide range of price points.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.960
Anything from the lowest
up to the highest.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.988
Somebody will always buy whatever
that highest point IAP is, and

00:02:55.988 --> 00:02:59.136
there's no reason to prevent
yourself from getting that revenue.

00:02:59.136 --> 00:03:02.502
Even if it might seem a little absurd
that somebody wants to spend $99 on

00:03:02.502 --> 00:03:03.470
a coin pack.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.410
There will be somebody who inevitably
wants to spend $99 on a coin pack.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.180
It's important to offer that range,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.880
all the way from the lowest to the
highest, and then a good mix in between.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.415
Amazon generally recommends at least
12 price points, I think that might

00:03:19.415 --> 00:03:23.326
be a little overkill, but somewhere in
that neighborhood is probably right.

00:03:23.326 --> 00:03:25.170
Finally, for any of your IAP's,

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.060
it's extremely important that
the non-consumables can be restored.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.010
You get a lot of backlash from the
platforms if you have all of these IAP's

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.590
that people are purchasing, yet they
can't get them back on their device.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.010
You also see a significant
user backlash there which

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.860
won't be good in the long run.
