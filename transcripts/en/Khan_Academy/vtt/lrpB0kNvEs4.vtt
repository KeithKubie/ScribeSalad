00:00:00.624 --> 00:00:02.664
- [Rosie] Hello, grammarians, hello David.

00:00:02.664 --> 00:00:03.641
- [David] Hello, Rosie!

00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:04.953
- [Rosie] So today,
we're going to talk about

00:00:04.953 --> 00:00:07.442
understatement and overstatement.

00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:09.686
- [David] And I could not be more excited.

00:00:09.686 --> 00:00:10.754
This is like the coolest thing

00:00:10.754 --> 00:00:12.115
that's happened to me all week!

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:13.020
- [Rosie] Oh my gosh.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.318
Really? (laughs)

00:00:14.318 --> 00:00:16.027
- [David] Uh, uh, uh, no.

00:00:16.027 --> 00:00:17.416
I mean, I'm excited.

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:18.648
This is a really interesting topic,

00:00:18.648 --> 00:00:21.014
but I was deliberately overstating.

00:00:21.014 --> 00:00:22.173
- [Rosie] Yeah, I mean, it's pretty cool,

00:00:22.173 --> 00:00:23.963
but that is, that does,

00:00:23.963 --> 00:00:25.435
that is a perfect example, David,

00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:27.478
of what overstatement is.

00:00:27.478 --> 00:00:29.999
So we're gonna look at a couple examples

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.725
of what writers will do sometimes to,

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:36.920
I would say, both
understatement and overstatement

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.481
really help to drive a point home.

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:42.648
We're gonna start with understatement.

00:00:44.215 --> 00:00:45.756
So David, you wanna read this sentence?

00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:46.656
- [David] Sure.

00:00:46.656 --> 00:00:48.453
"So you kidnapped my dog,

00:00:48.453 --> 00:00:50.719
"drove to New Orleans
without telling anyone,

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:52.616
"and ate the last cookie
that I was saving?

00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:55.413
"Yeah, I'm like, vaguely unhappy."

00:00:55.413 --> 00:00:56.591
(Rosie laughs softly)

00:00:56.591 --> 00:00:59.110
- [Rosie] This is a horrible
thing that just happened.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.213
So when you said, "Yeah,
I'm like vaguely unhappy,"

00:01:03.213 --> 00:01:06.230
after this huge list of horrible things

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.607
that this supposed friend has done,

00:01:08.607 --> 00:01:11.136
you know, it's clear that,

00:01:11.136 --> 00:01:15.312
that you're more than just
a little, vaguely unhappy.

00:01:15.312 --> 00:01:16.470
- [David] To be clear, grammarians,

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.613
Rosie did not do any of these things.

00:01:18.613 --> 00:01:20.071
(Rosie laughs softly)
- [Rosie] Thank you, David.

00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:22.310
- [David] This sentence
is a work of fiction.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.884
- [Rosie] Thank you for
letting me off the hook there.

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:24.791
- [David] You're welcome.

00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:28.885
So what we're trying to
express in this sentence

00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:30.984
is that this is something that should make

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:34.839
the speaker or the writer quite unhappy.

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:36.261
But what we're doing here is

00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:39.094
deliberately understating the case

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:42.615
to further drive home the point

00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:45.346
that this is actually quite serious.

00:01:45.346 --> 00:01:46.617
- [Rosie] Exactly.

00:01:46.617 --> 00:01:49.877
- [David] So, ironically,
while the writer is using

00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:53.615
minimizing language, saying,
"I am vaguely unhappy,"

00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:56.175
or, "like vaguely unhappy,"

00:01:56.175 --> 00:02:00.254
which serves to further
qualify that statement,

00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:02.030
the fact that they're saying that

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.233
after such a litany of sins,

00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:08.137
like, the cookie even, that's just ugh!

00:02:08.137 --> 00:02:12.502
Really serve to drive
home the opposite effect.

00:02:12.502 --> 00:02:16.272
So this is a textbook
example of understatement.

00:02:16.272 --> 00:02:17.105
- [Rosie] All right, so we've seen

00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:19.656
an example of understatement.

00:02:19.656 --> 00:02:23.823
Let's take a look at what an
overstatement might look like.

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:26.758
- [David] "My life is over.

00:02:26.758 --> 00:02:28.210
"I got a D on the midterm.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.336
"I am dead; I am literally a skeleton."

00:02:31.336 --> 00:02:34.357
- [Rosie] Hooo, wow. (laughs)

00:02:34.357 --> 00:02:35.940
So this is a great,

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:39.756
a great example of overstatement.

00:02:40.816 --> 00:02:43.956
- [David] So we know
this isn't true, right?

00:02:43.956 --> 00:02:46.739
Made a D on your midterm, not great.

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.191
But is it truly and actually
the end of someone's life?

00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:53.200
No, and this author,
this writer knows that,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.663
knows what they are saying,

00:02:54.663 --> 00:02:56.806
because skeletons can't write.

00:02:56.806 --> 00:02:57.995
- [Rosie] Exactly.

00:02:57.995 --> 00:03:00.963
You might have also heard of hyperbole,

00:03:00.963 --> 00:03:01.803
which is what this is.

00:03:01.803 --> 00:03:04.722
It's just like, way exaggeration.

00:03:04.722 --> 00:03:07.496
But it serves to drive
home this person's point

00:03:07.496 --> 00:03:09.541
that they feel really bad

00:03:09.541 --> 00:03:11.532
that they got a D on this midterm,

00:03:11.532 --> 00:03:14.028
and this is a very effective way

00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:16.874
of conveying to us how upset they are,

00:03:16.874 --> 00:03:19.210
even though they're not
literally a skeleton,

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.319
and they don't think they're
literally a skeleton.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.453
- [David] I think the
emotional impact of this

00:03:24.453 --> 00:03:26.749
is much more effective than it would be

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:28.537
if I just said, "I am very upset,

00:03:28.537 --> 00:03:30.742
"because I got a D on my midterm."

00:03:30.742 --> 00:03:34.440
Like, I think this is more expressive.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.960
And certainly it's not true,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.569
but I think there's an
interesting way to play

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.029
with over and understatement

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:44.184
in order to get feelings across.

00:03:44.184 --> 00:03:47.536
I think, I think there's
like, a little bit of a taboo

00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:50.536
in American English-speaking culture

00:03:51.607 --> 00:03:55.607
to too literally say the
state of your emotions,

00:03:57.947 --> 00:04:01.259
and so we've discovered
these cultural idioms,

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.768
through which we transmit emotion.

00:04:03.768 --> 00:04:07.955
So like, compare the
following two examples,

00:04:07.955 --> 00:04:09.221
delivered by Rosie.

00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:11.224
- [Rosie] 'Kay.

00:04:11.224 --> 00:04:12.641
"I'm very angry."

00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:17.291
Or, "Yeah, you could
say I'm a little upset."

00:04:19.363 --> 00:04:22.318
- [David] Now Rosie is
using understatement

00:04:22.318 --> 00:04:25.470
that I think, and I feel that the,

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.738
the statement that uses understatement

00:04:27.738 --> 00:04:30.835
actually conveys more anger,

00:04:30.835 --> 00:04:33.192
because it's more socially
acceptable in the United States

00:04:33.192 --> 00:04:37.349
to somewhat publicly
repress your emotions.

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:38.434
- [Rosie] Yeah, exactly.

00:04:38.434 --> 00:04:39.717
I mean, you could hear somebody say,

00:04:39.717 --> 00:04:42.762
"Yeah, I think I'm
pretty upset about that."

00:04:42.762 --> 00:04:45.812
And they're kinda laughing,
but they're upset.

00:04:45.812 --> 00:04:48.311
- [David] You can see
the glorious subtlety

00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:51.426
of these language techniques.

00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:56.020
And I understand, this can
make English a minefield

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.961
for people trying to learn the language,

00:04:57.961 --> 00:05:00.754
because the subtext of what you're saying,

00:05:00.754 --> 00:05:02.786
with overstatement and understatement,

00:05:02.786 --> 00:05:05.977
is more important than the text itself.

00:05:05.977 --> 00:05:07.684
- [Rosie] Exactly.

00:05:07.684 --> 00:05:09.865
- [David] It's very difficult

00:05:09.865 --> 00:05:12.235
to learn to interpret those cues.

00:05:12.235 --> 00:05:13.466
There are plenty of native speakers

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:15.138
who have trouble with it.

00:05:15.138 --> 00:05:15.971
- [Rosie] It's true.

00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:18.017
And it's just something that

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:21.206
you can keep an eye out
for when you're reading

00:05:21.206 --> 00:05:23.441
and also when you're talking to people.

00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:26.740
It may start to, you may
start to spot them more,

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.907
as you listen.

00:05:29.232 --> 00:05:31.772
- [David] And I suspect that,
if you listen and you study,

00:05:31.772 --> 00:05:35.286
I have this sneaking minute suspicion

00:05:35.286 --> 00:05:37.205
that you can learn anything.

00:05:37.205 --> 00:05:38.078
David, out.

00:05:38.078 --> 00:05:39.572
- [Rosie] Rosie, out.

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:40.922
- [David] That was awesome.

00:05:40.922 --> 00:05:42.606
- [Rosie] That was fun!
