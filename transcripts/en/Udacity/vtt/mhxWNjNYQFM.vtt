00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.157
So what happens to the brain when we learn? Actually the brain physically

00:00:04.157 --> 00:00:09.272
changes. Hebb's law states that Neurons that fire together, wire together. And

00:00:09.272 --> 00:00:13.080
that's exactly what's happening when we're learning. When you're repeatedly

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.926
engaged in a particular behavior, or your learning something. Those synaptic

00:00:16.926 --> 00:00:21.021
connections are actually growing and becoming stronger. However the opposite of

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:24.803
that is also true, meaning that if we stop using that information, or stop

00:00:24.803 --> 00:00:30.460
engaging in those behaviors. Those connections are going to weaken, that can

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.115
result in forgetting and memory loss. Here the phrase practice makes perfect is

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:39.950
actually quite relevant, in fact research shows that it takes approximately

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.925
10,000 hours of practice to become an expert. So if you wanted to be an expert

00:00:44.925 --> 00:00:49.806
piano player, you'll have to practice for about 10,000 hours. So remember that

00:00:49.806 --> 00:00:53.523
practice, use, and rehearsal, all help us to remember the things that we've

00:00:53.523 --> 00:00:55.000
learned.
