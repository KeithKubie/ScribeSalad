00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now the mean is obviously 50, 0.5100, the variance will be 25, 1000.25.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But as we divide the variance by now 10,000, we get 0.0025.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The square root of that happens to be 0.05

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and multiplying with this magic number 1.96 gives us 0.098.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The way we read this is if after a 100 coin flips we observed, perhaps empirically,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that the probability of heads is 50%, there is still an approximate Â±10% confidence interval.

00:00:43.000 --> 99:59:59.999
So we are really certain it'll fall between 40% and 60%, but in between we're not that certain.
