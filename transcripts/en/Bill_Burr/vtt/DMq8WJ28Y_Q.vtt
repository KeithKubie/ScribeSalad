00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.770
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:08.480
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
and

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.520
Ahhh,
just checking in.
Hey,

4
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.980
are you who,
what's going on?
Just checking in on you.

5
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.820
How's your Thursday afternoon going?
Oh,

6
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.220
Billy Billy Ballou.
He left Ireland.
He left Dublin before six.

7
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.470
And um,
now I'm in a,

8
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.510
I'm in London.
I've done,
I flew into a fro.

9
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.270
Yeah.
Um,

10
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.720
the typical Heathrow experiences just,

11
00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:48.721
I just don't fucking understand what the problem is with that Goddamn airport.

12
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.260
I hate that fucking airport.
I love it because I'm going to London,

13
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.030
but I hate it when I get there.
Oh,
I was flying from Dublin to London,

14
00:00:58.031 --> 00:01:02.290
which is like flying from fucking La to San Francisco,
essentially.
Nice,

15
00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:07.120
easy flight.
You're on southwest.
They're doing stand up.

16
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.050
You're waiting for it to be over.
And by the time they've finished their routine,

17
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.520
they're already landing and they've begun where there were now landing routine

18
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.650
with him,
imitate fucking c three Po and fucking Darth Vader or it,

19
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:25.120
whatever it is that those people are trying to do over there.

20
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.283
<v 0>MMM.</v>

21
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.000
<v 1>Anyways,
I guess they feel that there's a lot of nervous flyers over there.</v>

22
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.990
And for some reason,
bad standup comedy is the thing,
I guess.

23
00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:37.760
Then you're not afraid to die because you're like,
well,

24
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:40.460
at least if the plane crashes,
I don't have to hear the end of this routine.

25
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.570
Oh Bell,
that's no way to,
it's Thursday,

26
00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:47.240
man is supposed to be a happy event.
Yeah.
So anyways,

27
00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:51.170
I'm flying from Dublin and to eighth row and um,

28
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.270
everything's goes great.
Take off on time.
Land a little bit.

29
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.250
Early Gate is ready,
you know.
But I did the unforgivable,

30
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:07.080
I checked a bag,
which I never do.
I didn't want to do on this trip,
but you know,

31
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.340
my wife talked me into it.
Um,
which I'm actually glad she did.

32
00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:16.290
Once I get the bag and I unpack and actually have some of my stuff,
you know,

33
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.100
I have some options for different outfits.
Sorry.

34
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.380
Um,
so everything goes great.
And then,
you know,
I get off the plane,

35
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.780
I'm standing there,
I get the information.
Oh,

36
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.350
I don't have to go through customs because I was already fucking in Dublin or

37
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:34.500
whatever,
which I didn't think was part of the,
uh,

38
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:36.960
the whole Great Britain fucking reach.
I thought,

39
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:38.550
I would think if I was in Northern Ireland,

40
00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:42.810
if I felt food from Belfast to London,
they'd be like,
all right.

41
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:44.460
I was in the Republic of Ireland,

42
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.953
<v 0>you know,</v>

43
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.590
<v 1>I was there.
They're not part of Great Britain.
Are they are,
they're great.</v>

44
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:56.480
Britain.
Was,
was,
was,
uh,
England,
Wales,
Scotland,

45
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.150
all the wall and a Northern Ireland,
whatever.

46
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.440
Maybe because I'm in the European Union,
I don't know what the fuck it is,

47
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.910
but then I thought they did the Brexit thing,
but maybe that hasn't happened yet.

48
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.460
I don't know.
All I know is I haven't gone through,

49
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.780
I didn't have to go through customs,

50
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.010
so I was sacked and I go down to the fucking stupid carousel thing,

51
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:24.280
whatever the baggage claim and it's already turned on.
I'm like,

52
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.400
you fucking kidding me.
And I see three bags come out.

53
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.020
Then there's a little space,
little space,
little space,

54
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.900
and I see two bags coming out.
I'm like,
Holy Shit.

55
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.860
There were already unloading it.

56
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.630
So I stand there for a good five minutes and it's just those three bags,

57
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.190
little space,
little space,

58
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.340
little space that then the two bags and then they start recognizing the bag

59
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:44.560
saying,
oh,
these are just bags that were sitting here.

60
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.023
<v 0>You know,</v>

61
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.260
<v 1>five people didn't make it,</v>

62
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.590
were sold in the human trafficking and they haven't claimed their bags.

63
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.650
I Dunno what the fuck happened,
right?
Um,

64
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.980
or they went ahead of their flight or their bags got on and they did.

65
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.310
And who the fuck knows?
And I was standing there.
10 minutes goes by,

66
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.960
15 minutes goes by,

67
00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:08.040
20 minutes goes by the belts on the same fucking three bags,

68
00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:11.280
a little bit of space or the space of stood out fucking two bags.

69
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.890
And um,
I'm just like,
you know,

70
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.600
this is just every fucking,
I understand that for like 50 fucking minutes.

71
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.360
Wait for my fucking bag.
It's just like that fucking airport.

72
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.480
It just breaks shit,
goddamn spirit.

73
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.050
Cause every fucking time it's a different fuck over and see it.

74
00:04:33.051 --> 00:04:37.520
Never see it coming.
If that always happen,
I would be like,
okay,

75
00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:40.760
here's the deal.
I'm not checking a bag or if I checked the bag,
it'd be like,

76
00:04:40.761 --> 00:04:43.910
just settle in because you know it's going to be 50 minutes.
All right,

77
00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.840
go sit down,
get yourself some bangers and mash,
whatever the fuck it is.

78
00:04:47.841 --> 00:04:49.970
These people eat over here and you know,

79
00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:53.870
show up 45 minutes later and pick up your fucking bag.

80
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.950
What killed me is how everybody else just accepted it.

81
00:04:57.951 --> 00:04:59.450
And I was the only person standing there going,

82
00:04:59.451 --> 00:05:00.980
what the fuck is wrong with this airport?

83
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.230
What are they got three fucking baggage handlers

84
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.760
then we'll kill me is when they finally started unloading the bags.

85
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.970
They unload like five of them
and then,

86
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.930
and then you see people on your flight grabbing them and then there's no more

87
00:05:15.931 --> 00:05:18.180
bags for like 10 minutes.
It's like,
what the fuck happened?

88
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.690
The guy doing it just to,
just to have a fucking stroke.

89
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.530
There's nobody back there to help them.
You get like concerned.

90
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:30.613
<v 0>MMM.</v>

91
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.590
<v 1>Oh well I didn't,
wasn't concerned.
I was selfish.</v>

92
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.340
Allah gave you show was about was my bag.
So anyways,
I get my fucking bag

93
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.993
<v 0>and uh,</v>

94
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.120
<v 1>I make it over here to the hotel.
And,
uh,</v>

95
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.110
after the night before I was played the three arena in Dublin,

96
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.030
one of my favorite shows,
those fucking people are just,

97
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.990
it's like double specific to Dublin.
They like the best fucking hecklers.

98
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.470
I don't even know how,
but they made like nine 11.
Funny,

99
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.280
just in an absurd way.

100
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.380
I was on stage and I was talking about like how much the country changed,

101
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.910
you know,
since nine 11 when I said nine 11,
somebody in the crowd went,
whew.

102
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.970
You know,
and they might've been in American agreeing like,
Woo.
Yeah.

103
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.120
You know,
the country did really change after that.

104
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.300
Just kind of an obvious statement.
Now that I'm repeating it,

105
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.460
but the way they did it,
it made it seem like they were cheering on nine 11.

106
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.040
So I riffed about that.
I said,
Oh yeah,
you excited about tragedies?
Oh yeah.

107
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:41.720
I,
you know,
I've always hated skyscrapers and I just said something like that.

108
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.100
It made everybody laugh.
So then I started the joke again.
I to go,
you know,

109
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:48.570
ever since nine 11,
and then the whole crowd goes,
Woo,

110
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.140
just to be dicks,
you know,

111
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.720
so then I roll with it and I just start,

112
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.580
start every fucking joke now with some American tragedy as go,

113
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.190
yeah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
You know,
I believe that was around,
uh,

114
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.480
Pearl Harbor and then they all go,

115
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.113
<v 0>Woo.</v>

116
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.330
<v 1>Who's so fucking childish and stupid.
Right.
So after like the third one,</v>

117
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:19.100
I said,
I go,
you know what,
Ireland,

118
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.160
I really wish I knew about your fucking tragedies.
All right.

119
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.690
But I'm an American.
I don't have time to care about other countries.

120
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.370
And it was just like this little fucking stupid inside back and forth thing that

121
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:34.670
will never happen at another show.
Um,

122
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:41.520
and uh,
I dunno,
it was just the classic classic,
I dunno,

123
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:42.650
Dublin crab.

124
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.813
<v 0>MMM.</v>

125
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.510
<v 1>I had such a fucking great,
I came,
it's just such a fucking great city.</v>

126
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.650
So then I go over,
uh,

127
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.600
last night to do Royal Albert Hall and um,

128
00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.740
I don't even know how to describe it.

129
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.390
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

130
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:05.220
<v 1>Like,
uh,
I still feel like it was like,
I dreamed it,
like it didn't really,</v>

131
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.450
it went by so God damn fast.
And when you walk in there,

132
00:08:09.451 --> 00:08:10.830
if you're a fan of led Zeppelin,

133
00:08:10.831 --> 00:08:15.831
that place essentially looks the exact same as it did when you watch,

134
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.350
you know,
that concert footage,

135
00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.020
the outlet for my money,

136
00:08:22.021 --> 00:08:27.021
the best concert footage of led Zeppelin that exists just the way it looks,

137
00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:31.110
the way it's shot that film.
Um,

138
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.550
I've tried to do a standup special to,
to make it look like that.

139
00:08:35.551 --> 00:08:39.930
You just can't do it.
It's just of that,
yeah,
I guess you'd have to film it,
but,

140
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:45.450
um,
I just walked right out.
I was like,
John Bonham's fucking that,

141
00:08:45.451 --> 00:08:49.590
that maple kit he had was right fucking here.

142
00:08:49.591 --> 00:08:53.880
It was crazy.
And I remember when,
when I got announced to go out,

143
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.400
I can't remember who was that or not.
There's one word,

144
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.610
Robert plant walks off stage and grabs a joint,

145
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:02.700
smokes it and holds it up to the camera.
Like,
that's what I thought.

146
00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:03.990
It was such a fucking,

147
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.790
it was the weirdest experience walking out because I felt like I'd been there

148
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.380
already just because I've watched that concert film so many times.
And No,

149
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:15.560
I didn't get a chance to play drums because,
uh,

150
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.250
I did the show in Dublin the night before,
which I had to do,
cause,
you know,

151
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:24.420
I had to make sure,
um,
I did one show in Europe,
you know,

152
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.260
there's always that just a little bit of a different vibe.
So I had,
you know,

153
00:09:27.261 --> 00:09:30.540
that was more important,
you know,
to have a good show than the,
you know,

154
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.650
go there and hack away at the drums for like an hour.
But,
um,
believe me,

155
00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:37.320
I definitely got my money's worth.
The crowd was fucking amazing.

156
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:39.803
<v 0>MMM.</v>

157
00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.350
<v 1>And I just had this whole weird feeling the entire time I was up there.
Like,</v>

158
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.850
why am I so relaxed with the combination of,
Holy Shit,

159
00:09:48.851 --> 00:09:50.050
I'm in Royal Albert Hall

160
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.260
<v 0>and then,
you know,</v>

161
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.580
<v 1>actually fucked up a couple of jokes because I was looking at the architecture.</v>

162
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.650
I can't fucking believe I'm here.
Um,

163
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.760
my parents came out,
my wife came out for the show.

164
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.790
<v 0>MMM.</v>

165
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:12.380
<v 1>My manager and agent came out and,
uh,
it was just awesome.
It was like everybody,</v>

166
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:15.640
you know,
I,
I can't,

167
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.180
if you ever get a chance to come over here and see anything there,

168
00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.630
um,
it really is just one of those places.

169
00:10:22.631 --> 00:10:26.350
And I put some photos up on Instagram and

170
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:27.893
<v 0>MMM.</v>

171
00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.860
<v 1>Yup.
That's it.
And now,</v>

172
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.340
now Billy boy is on vacation.

173
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.560
I think I did like an hour and 15 minutes in the show and I was sitting there

174
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.630
going,
I forgot to look at my watch.
And I was like,

175
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.620
I can't tell if I've been up here for an hour and a half,
40 minutes,

176
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:51.520
a half hour or a little over an hour.
Cause I,

177
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.710
I dunno,
I don't think since Carnegie Hall,

178
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.820
there's been a couple of places that you play and you're just like,
um,

179
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.280
I shouldn't be here.
That's what you're thinking.

180
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:08.620
Just looking at how beautiful it is and then seeing like when you walk to the

181
00:11:08.631 --> 00:11:09.470
dressing room,

182
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:15.670
you can't help but look at the photos and I'm looking like everyone from Freddie

183
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:18.830
Mercury,
David Bowie,
Frank Sinatra

184
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.100
in like 1963,

185
00:11:22.101 --> 00:11:26.240
evidently the fucking Beatles and the rolling stones played there on the same

186
00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:27.074
bill,

187
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.983
<v 0>you know,</v>

188
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.670
<v 1>and then I'm walking out there going like,
hey,</v>

189
00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:37.070
you know what the fuck's up with chairs and you just,
you know,
your actress,

190
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.430
it just shrinks down either.
I was kind of the thing you had to like fight off.

191
00:11:41.431 --> 00:11:46.320
But,
um,
my agent asked me like,
after the show,

192
00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:51.000
he goes,
so what venue do you want to play next tier in London?
I was like,
ah,

193
00:11:51.001 --> 00:11:54.290
this one,
you know,

194
00:11:55.170 --> 00:12:00.160
what the fuck do you go from here?
Um,
and they're all like,
well,
you know,

195
00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:04.630
it's like booked three years out.
I'm like,
I don't give a shit.
I don't care,

196
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.930
you know?
Um,
unbelievable.

197
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:10.610
So thank you so much to everybody,
you know,

198
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.010
who came out to the show and afterwards I was able to uh,
you know,

199
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:18.020
run out there and say hello to some people,

200
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.980
signed some posters and uh,

201
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.940
I appreciate the people that hung out and were patient because like I said,

202
00:12:23.941 --> 00:12:26.500
I had a lot of family and friends back there.
You know,

203
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.340
it was sort of my pre birthday celebration.
They had a cake and shit like that,

204
00:12:30.341 --> 00:12:33.450
so I had to do that and I ran out there.
So you got tired of waiting for me.

205
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:37.270
You left.
I apologize.
But uh,
for the record I did come out,

206
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:43.120
um,
and the people there were just like ridiculously nice and you know,

207
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:44.170
there's all these people that had like,

208
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.110
I had like two or three people from Poland go and you got to do a shell in

209
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:51.370
Poland.
Um,
somebody from Romania,

210
00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:54.160
somebody from Jordan.
When I was in Dublin,
I did a show.

211
00:12:54.161 --> 00:12:59.161
There was this dude from Hong Kong told me he flew in because he saw a clip of

212
00:12:59.831 --> 00:13:01.240
me on Conan O'brien.

213
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.320
How fucking crazy as the internet,

214
00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:10.321
that's is some guy in Hong Kong watching clips of the Conan O'brien show and

215
00:13:10.901 --> 00:13:15.220
then he sees me as a guest,
Colin and makes me look good is always,

216
00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:18.370
and now he wants to come to my show.
He w he goes,

217
00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:23.290
I got tickets for the Dublin show and the London show and he was there by

218
00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:25.970
himself.
I was just like,
all right,

219
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.170
this guy's either going to stab me or this is one of the coolest people I've

220
00:13:29.171 --> 00:13:31.330
ever met in my life.
Fortunately it was the latter.

221
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.520
So,
um,
anyways,
now I'm on vacation.

222
00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.440
I'm on vacation.
Do you guys realize the next part,

223
00:13:44.441 --> 00:13:48.550
this is my last podcast in my forties,
man.

224
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:54.810
Oh,
fucking Billy.
Over the hell.
Where do do do two,
two,

225
00:13:55.410 --> 00:14:00.100
two,
um,
200 and fucking 50 on Sunday,
Sunday,
Sunday.

226
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.330
Um,
actually feel good.
You know,
I don't,

227
00:14:04.331 --> 00:14:05.980
I'm not going to fill any fucking different,

228
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:10.810
I don't think between now and Sunday,
other than when somebody says,

229
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.300
how old are you?
I don't say for,
I say fear now.
50.

230
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:23.410
Um,
that's it.
Oh,
Billy.
Billy red nuts is 50 fucking years old,

231
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:28.060
but whatever thunk it.
Um,
so anyways,

232
00:14:28.061 --> 00:14:32.140
so then we ended up hanging out.
We went out to a bar afterwards,

233
00:14:32.141 --> 00:14:36.910
only had a couple of drinks,
smoke that unbelievable cigar.
And,

234
00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.440
um,
then there was like this little casino thing that we went to.

235
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.630
Um,
me and my manager,
my agent and my lovely wife,
um,

236
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:51.660
ordered some dim sum at like fucking two in the morning and we watched a game

237
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.420
for the NBA finals.

238
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:55.710
<v 0>Uh,</v>

239
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.810
<v 1>which was a great game once again,</v>

240
00:14:57.811 --> 00:15:02.811
but it's just golden state has too many fucking too many people,

241
00:15:02.861 --> 00:15:03.700
man.
It's like,

242
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.630
<v 0>yeah,
I dunno.</v>

243
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.430
<v 1>I guess it's genius that the Nva let's these teams</v>

244
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.650
become what they are,

245
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.660
I guess with all of fucking everybody piling on because then guys like me,

246
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.670
I just watch rooting against that team.

247
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.650
<v 0>Um,
but um,
you know,</v>

248
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:29.720
it's kind of boring though,

249
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.310
<v 1>you know,
the last two years,
again,</v>

250
00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.890
VA kind of knowing at the beginning of the season,
well,
yeah,

251
00:15:34.891 --> 00:15:36.330
obviously these guys are going to win it.

252
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:37.690
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

253
00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.670
<v 1>And then they do,
I mean,
this is not even like,</v>

254
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.383
<v 0>I dunno,</v>

255
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.020
<v 1>remember that.
Do you remember that?
You know what?
I couldn't get into,</v>

256
00:15:47.021 --> 00:15:49.860
I couldn't get into the Dream Team when we went to the Olympics and they would

257
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.790
Dunkin on Ethiopians and shit.
It was just like,
it's like this is,

258
00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:58.960
it was the most boring fucking,
and they always talk about that team.

259
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.390
Well that was the way it is.

260
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:06.540
Assemblage of talent in basketball history.
Yeah.

261
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.560
Going up against probably the weakest.

262
00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.470
I would rather watch the Globetrotters play the fucking Washington generals.

263
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:20.770
They watched the Dream Team pay for play fucking Rwanda or whatever the hell we

264
00:16:21.081 --> 00:16:22.820
were doing that year.
You know what I mean?

265
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:27.880
But what was good about that was they so kicked the shit out of everybody that

266
00:16:28.581 --> 00:16:29.440
sense then

267
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:31.423
<v 0>you know</v>

268
00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:36.390
<v 1>Europe like raise the bar the way they play now and now some of the best players</v>

269
00:16:36.391 --> 00:16:39.930
in the league or from Europe,
which was unheard of when I was growing up.

270
00:16:39.931 --> 00:16:41.850
So I guess I dunno,

271
00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.880
something good will come out of this golden state warrior team

272
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.110
<v 0>that they'll just be,
I don't know,</v>

273
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.880
<v 1>all the stars will be on two teams.</v>

274
00:16:49.881 --> 00:16:54.020
They should just take the all star team in the east,
in the West.
Right.
And just,

275
00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:55.340
just have that be the league.

276
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.083
<v 0>Right.</v>

277
00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.440
<v 1>Or at least just have them go to the NBA finals and then you just get what to</v>

278
00:17:02.441 --> 00:17:03.520
watch.
Everybody try

279
00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.180
as opposed to the all star game and nobody pays any defense.

280
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:09.043
I don't fucking know.

281
00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:11.483
<v 0>MMM.</v>

282
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.393
<v 1>So anyways,</v>

283
00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:17.930
<v 0>uh,
that's it man.
I did Royal Albert Hall.</v>

284
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:19.060
Okay.

285
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.860
<v 1>Part of the history of freckles.
It's part of that.
I can't fucking believe it.</v>

286
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.120
Can't believe it.
I was saying that there's somebody,

287
00:17:27.121 --> 00:17:29.200
I say you believe fucking 26 years ago,

288
00:17:29.201 --> 00:17:32.380
you sign up for a stupid fucking open mic and it leads to this.

289
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.240
<v 0>MMM.</v>

290
00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:35.720
<v 1>Never.</v>

291
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.000
Never in my wildest dreams would I ever think I would ever sell one ticket in

292
00:17:39.001 --> 00:17:39.834
London,

293
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.253
<v 0>you know,</v>

294
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:46.690
<v 1>or any place in Europe.
Forget about getting to play that place.
So that one,</v>

295
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.330
you know,
there's ones that stay you.
Um,

296
00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:56.350
that's definitely one.
Um,

297
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.430
you know,
the nine 11 shelf that will stay with me.

298
00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.240
The absurdity of that.
The Vicar Street one that I did

299
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.250
<v 0>Dublin.
Um,</v>

300
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:14.600
<v 1>I had a great one in Oslo,
my first really good show in Europe.</v>

301
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.380
These are all the European ones that stick.

302
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.170
Germany was fun when I was teasing him about Hitler.

303
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.920
I've had so much fucking fun over here.
Um,

304
00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.660
I just got to figure out how to do these dates now that I got the Kiddo,

305
00:18:29.661 --> 00:18:34.400
but everybody's over here,
by the way.
My lovely daughter is here.

306
00:18:34.401 --> 00:18:38.990
She's such a riot.
She woke up this morning.
I'm like,
you know,
I stayed out late.

307
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:43.670
Right.
So
obviously she,

308
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.550
you know,
mia gets her up and everything.
She puts her in the bed,

309
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:50.770
she's next to me and I have my eyes closed and then she just,
I just,

310
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.300
he looks over at me.
She goes,
hi.

311
00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:57.383
<v 3>Okay.</v>

312
00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:02.830
<v 1>I start cracking up and then she left.
And that's,
that's just a,</v>

313
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.460
the greatest way ever to start the date.
Nia,
how much fun was last night?

314
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.620
<v 0>Oh,
that's great.
That's really great.
Um,</v>

315
00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.400
<v 1>what are we doing today?</v>

316
00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:15.760
We're going to go get some bangers and mash and mushy peas.

317
00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.470
<v 0>Oh yeah,
sure.
Oh,
okay.</v>

318
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:24.410
<v 1>You look beautiful.
Nini.
Thank you.
I like your dress.
Thank you.</v>

319
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.430
Um,
so what we're gonna do today,
Hey,

320
00:19:28.431 --> 00:19:32.060
if anybody lives in here,
uh,
lives around London,

321
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:37.050
if you know a place where they have good food,
uh,
please text me the dim sung.
I,

322
00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.130
she was great last night,
but,
uh,
I don't know.

323
00:19:40.131 --> 00:19:43.790
We've been kind of striking out here.
I know there has to be good food here.

324
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.840
There has to be.
Okay.
Everybody has the food network.

325
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:53.230
There has to be some food in London that's actually seasoned correctly.

326
00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:56.743
Um,

327
00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:03.350
I don't underst I just don't get it,
you know,
I mean,

328
00:20:03.351 --> 00:20:06.320
they got salt and pepper,
but after that it just goes off the rails.

329
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:10.670
That fucking guy that,
uh,
the hell's kitchen guys from here,

330
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:15.800
people from here can cook.
Where the fuck are they,
Gordon Ramsay?
Does he get,
Oh,

331
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:16.611
well,

332
00:20:16.611 --> 00:20:18.960
I don't know if I want to go to his restaurant because you know those celebrity

333
00:20:18.961 --> 00:20:22.220
chefs,
they loan their name to something.
It's hit or miss.

334
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:26.870
Some of them are involved.
Other room just like how much?
Yeah.

335
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:30.020
I don't give a shit.
Put My fucking name on it.

336
00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.773
Um,
anyways,

337
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:38.280
so tonight I'm going to try to find a place where I can watch potentially the

338
00:20:38.281 --> 00:20:42.240
Washington capitals when their first Stanley Cup,

339
00:20:42.241 --> 00:20:46.200
the bet in the league since 1974,
God bless them,

340
00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.910
have 45th season.
I really want to see a vet.

341
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:56.830
You can get a cup,
you know.
Um,
I dunno,

342
00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.600
but also,
you know,
then the other side is if Vegas comes back,
you know,

343
00:21:01.601 --> 00:21:06.580
and every Washington capitol fan just fucking hung their head because they know

344
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:11.930
if anybody could blow a fucking three one lead.
But I,
I just think this,

345
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.370
this capital's team is different.

346
00:21:13.371 --> 00:21:16.010
I'm not trying to jinx them or anything like that.
I'm just going to fucking,

347
00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:20.960
you know,
I'm not in that stupid sports jinx shit.
Okay.
This fucking team,

348
00:21:20.961 --> 00:21:25.220
like,
you know,
the coaching
that's going on here,

349
00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:31.400
you know,
they saw who the nights were and gay one and they said,
oh,

350
00:21:31.401 --> 00:21:34.880
is that I applied.
Well,
here's our adjustment to it and God dammit,

351
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:36.920
they've won the next three in a row.

352
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.180
And I really hope I get to find a place where I can watch that game.

353
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.640
Maybe I'll go back down to the casino again.

354
00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:46.013
<v 0>MMM.</v>

355
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.360
<v 1>And watch it.
But,
uh,
Oh man,</v>

356
00:21:50.361 --> 00:21:51.350
that reminds me of this time.

357
00:21:51.351 --> 00:21:56.351
I watched a patriots game when I was in Australia at a fucking casino at like

358
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:59.270
four in the morning.
I think

359
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.320
it was four in the morning the next day.

360
00:22:03.321 --> 00:22:08.150
And I was watching son was four in the morning on Monday in Australia and I was

361
00:22:08.151 --> 00:22:11.890
watching Sunday afternoon football.
It's like a 14 hour.

362
00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:15.050
I think I was watching the one o'clock game or something.
It's like a 14 hour.

363
00:22:15.051 --> 00:22:18.330
Is it a 14 hour difference?
No,
it's like that's how long the flight is,

364
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.310
is 14 hours.
I can't fucking remember.
It's something ridiculous like that.

365
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.393
<v 0>MMM.</v>

366
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.400
<v 1>So anyways,
I don't even know if I have any fucking advertising.
Um,</v>

367
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.960
yeah,
I don't know what to tell Ya.
That's it.

368
00:22:33.961 --> 00:22:36.540
It's actually sunny out here in London.

369
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:40.560
I was worried that it was going to be all fucking shitty weather.
Oh by the way,

370
00:22:40.561 --> 00:22:45.050
you know,
I ended up being like ridiculous traffic getting to the um,

371
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.680
get into the venue last night cause they were building some new hotel called the

372
00:22:49.681 --> 00:22:54.681
mandarin out here and they had some massive fire like half something like half

373
00:22:56.461 --> 00:22:58.400
the firefighters in

374
00:22:59.060 --> 00:22:59.893
<v 0>mmm.</v>

375
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:05.630
<v 1>In all of London where their fight in the fucking thing.
Thank God.
Like you know,</v>

376
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.720
the hotel wasn't a open yet,

377
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:11.480
although that wasn't what I was saying in my shelf.

378
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.220
I so upset about the fucking traffic.

379
00:23:13.221 --> 00:23:14.870
I was saying I was wishing was full of people.

380
00:23:14.871 --> 00:23:18.920
Maybe they would've been less traffic on the road.
Oh Bill.
Why would you,
why,
why,

381
00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.310
why would you say something like that?
Um,

382
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.510
so that fucking burnt down.
It's probably an insurance job.

383
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.133
<v 0>You know,</v>

384
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:31.950
<v 1>I wonder,</v>

385
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:35.910
I wonder if I can actually look that up right now on my European Internet,

386
00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.960
which is going to have all kinds of shit do they literally had an advertisement

387
00:23:39.961 --> 00:23:44.340
for fucking field hockey over here.
It's like field hockey.

388
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.410
Is that a,
that's a,
that's a sport

389
00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:54.760
like on TV sport.
I know it's a sport they got.

390
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:58.910
They just got some weird shit over here when it comes to this sports stuff.

391
00:23:58.911 --> 00:24:02.630
You know what?
Let me get some of that fucking signed in,
right?
Uh,

392
00:24:02.631 --> 00:24:06.530
you fucking so and so.
Why Fi

393
00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.210
<v 3>yeah.</v>

394
00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.390
<v 1>Into your room number and to your last name.</v>

395
00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:11.700
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

396
00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.490
<v 1>yeah.
I went to the casino last night.
They asked for my driver's license.</v>

397
00:24:14.491 --> 00:24:17.430
They want to take like a fucking picture of me,
and I was in such a good mood.

398
00:24:17.431 --> 00:24:20.430
I let them do all of that.
I'm like,
well,
I guess I mean your system now.
They go,

399
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:24.270
no,
no,
no,
we don't.
We don't,
we don't keep it.
It's like,
yeah,
you do.

400
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:30.090
You take it a fucking picture of me.
Like where,

401
00:24:30.091 --> 00:24:34.790
where does all of that go?
You know,

402
00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:36.470
I just got a fucking phone call,

403
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:41.540
a message from American Airlines saying that somebody's got my,

404
00:24:41.541 --> 00:24:46.541
a frequent flyer number and might've been trying to see where I was flying and

405
00:24:46.581 --> 00:24:50.060
blah,
blah,
blah,
and all of this bullshit.
And it's just like,

406
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:55.670
so we need you,
uh,
you know,
we need you to call us and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

407
00:24:55.671 --> 00:24:57.740
It's like,
what the fuck do I get to call you guys for?

408
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:03.530
Why don't you guys fix your fucking weak ass system?
This isn't on me.
I love,

409
00:25:03.531 --> 00:25:06.980
like when,
when like your information might have been compromised,

410
00:25:06.981 --> 00:25:10.520
you call them up and they tell you what you need to do.
It's like,
no,

411
00:25:10.521 --> 00:25:14.120
you know what you need to do?
Stop putting everything up on fucking computers.

412
00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:16.040
Go back to fucking notebooks and pens.

413
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:18.463
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

414
00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.050
<v 1>So far like the paper trail that you leave,</v>

415
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.750
it's really impossible now.

416
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.790
<v 3>Okay.</v>

417
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.820
<v 1>That's what fucking kills me about that guy that almost went to jail.</v>

418
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.000
But he sat next to Larry David at the Dodgers game.

419
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.890
It's like there was no record of that guy anywhere paying for parking,

420
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:41.540
getting a hot dog,
his cell phone.
They couldn't track it to the game.

421
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.780
You know,
he didn't go through some intersection,

422
00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:48.080
whether it was a camera with his dodger hat on going into the fucking

423
00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:54.130
Carlito's way,
Kenyon,
whatever the fucking Dodgers play.
Um,

424
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:58.370
Carlitos Canyon.
What the hell is it called?
Chavez.
Ravine.

425
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:01.640
Huh?
I don't know.

426
00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:03.440
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

427
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.250
<v 1>Anyways,
what the fuck was I looking up?
Oh,
London fire.</v>

428
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.410
So I'm going to do a bunch of touristy shit,
I think today with my parents.

429
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:16.060
Hopefully if they're up for it,
you know,

430
00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.560
I don't think I've ever seen Buckingham Palace.

431
00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.830
I liked that dude who just got married by the way.
I don't know.

432
00:26:23.831 --> 00:26:26.500
There's just something about his face.
You like this.
I,
you know,

433
00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:29.650
you can just see how much he's going to annoy the shit out his wife
accidentally.

434
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.240
Come on,
man for.
Can you fucking just for once the Internet.
Can you work for me?

435
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:39.730
London Fire Hotel Safari.

436
00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:43.150
Can't verify the identif.
Oh,
continue.
I don't give a shit.

437
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:48.840
My stuff's already been compromised.
Login.
I did log in.
Please select.

438
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.170
Do you accept the terms that we're going to take all of your shit and then call

439
00:26:52.171 --> 00:26:54.450
you later and say somebody that we don't know.
Got It.

440
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:59.670
And they're now on the dark web looking at fucking kitty porn.
All right,

441
00:26:59.671 --> 00:27:03.450
you are logged in.
Okay,
wonderful.
London.

442
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.400
So the last time I'm trying this everybody,
London fire.

443
00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:09.573
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

444
00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.890
<v 1>Bill Burns Burns it up last night at the fucking,
sorry.
Ego just kicked in</v>

445
00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.670
the London Fire Brigade.
No,
that's not what I want.

446
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.910
Fire Brigade.
That sounds like a fucking musical

447
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.020
hotel.
Fire
fucking London.

448
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.510
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

449
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.460
<v 1>All right.
Here we go.</v>

450
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:39.643
<v 3>What do we got here?</v>

451
00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:46.790
<v 1>Mandarin Oriental.
Huge blaze.
Oh Dude,</v>

452
00:27:46.791 --> 00:27:51.690
look at that fucking thing.
Sorry.
You need flash to play this.

453
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.120
Enable it in your browser out.
Go Fuck Yourself.

454
00:27:56.250 --> 00:28:01.230
Plumes of smoke a.
Look who's here.
Hi.

455
00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:06.410
Huh?
How you doing buddy?

456
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.430
She knows annotating to take him to.
Oh,
okay,
cool.

457
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:15.450
And totally be out of here so she could do that.
Okay.
You got it.
All right.

458
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:19.240
Um,
bye.

459
00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:21.723
<v 3>Okay.</v>

460
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.481
<v 1>All right.</v>

461
00:28:22.481 --> 00:28:27.130
A total of 36 hotel guests in 250 members of the hotel staff were evacuated.

462
00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:31.150
All there were fucking people in their singer.
Robbie Williams was among them.

463
00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:34.523
<v 3>Uh,</v>

464
00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:38.090
<v 1>I dunno who Robbie Williams is.
That sounds like a teen idol.</v>

465
00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.210
Even if he's old or she,
right.

466
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.730
The blaze reach or they,

467
00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:50.080
the blaze reached several floors but was quickly extinguished or those

468
00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:55.830
the London Fire Brigade set,
um,

469
00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.970
the London fire brigade,
the fire brigade,

470
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.260
not to firefighters,

471
00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.950
not the fucking Hook and ladder would've welcomed.

472
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.660
They never do the hook and lateral play anymore in the NFL.
Every one of them.

473
00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:15.120
It always seemed to work back in the day.
That's what I'm saying.
Huh?
It's like,

474
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:20.260
what,
are you going to watch the NHL hockey with me tonight?
No.
No.
Why not?

475
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:23.320
You love sports.
You just don't realize it yet.
Oh,

476
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:28.160
I'm looking for something that had to ask you about,
we hear in your podcast,
Oh,

477
00:29:28.161 --> 00:29:29.050
let me hit pause.

478
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.960
<v 3>She's going to take her around.</v>

479
00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.610
<v 1>All right.
Um,</v>

480
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:36.703
<v 3>yeah.</v>

481
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:41.560
<v 1>All right.
Sorry about that.
I'm just planning our damn here.</v>

482
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:45.580
Billows and bellows.
Robbie Williams 44 describes the drama.

483
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:49.450
I went on the balcony and looked up and there was just billows and billows of

484
00:29:49.451 --> 00:29:53.620
smoke.
I came back in from the balcony and said,

485
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:59.130
the hotel's on fire and this guy's a smart fucking so smart guy.

486
00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.780
And then the hotel's on fire and there's a lot of smoke.

487
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:09.580
But I mean,
what else would you say?
He really,

488
00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.920
he got the information out.
The hotel's on fire.

489
00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:18.590
I probably would have came back in and we'd be like,
yeah,
what the fuck is that?

490
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.500
I was,
you know,
added all these extra words and then the next thing,

491
00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:27.740
a knock at the door came and there was a bellboy there and they said,

492
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.700
get out.
I like this.
This is very,

493
00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:38.100
who's that playwright that just has really fucking choppy dialogue like that.

494
00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:41.100
Or like when you watch law and order,
you know,

495
00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.790
they have to get so much information.

496
00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:47.310
They actually time your lines when you do an episode of that show,

497
00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.690
they don't care about emotion that just like say it faster.
All right.

498
00:30:51.691 --> 00:30:53.250
Williams and his wife,

499
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.640
Ida felled 39 ran down and external fire escape to safety.

500
00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:04.050
Oh,
there's a video.
I don't need flash for that.
Oh man,
that's a beautiful hotel.

501
00:31:04.051 --> 00:31:08.900
I thought it was under construction.
Wait a minute.
Wow.

502
00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:12.790
You know what billows and bellows is smoke.

503
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.590
Well,
what started it
all right.

504
00:31:19.591 --> 00:31:24.591
Can't emphasize enough how well the evacuation operation put together now being

505
00:31:24.811 --> 00:31:29.180
moved to a nearby hotel for safety.
Well,

506
00:31:29.181 --> 00:31:34.060
who gives a fuck about you?
Ah,
you can't say that.

507
00:31:34.061 --> 00:31:37.000
This is how it is.
Every Debbie things about everybody,
you know.
Right.

508
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.720
Hotel's on fire,
shaking my head,
lol.

509
00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.500
Fuck my life.
Yolo.

510
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:54.630
And he's a guy.
Just wrote,
hope you work are okay.
Anna subtext.

511
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.230
Uh,

512
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:59.190
I'd like to comfort you slash maybe turn it into some sort of sexual activity.

513
00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:03.840
Um,
all right.

514
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:09.850
I think that's a good place to end.
Um,
all right.

515
00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:11.150
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

516
00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:14.090
<v 1>that is a good friend of mine out here in London.</v>

517
00:32:14.091 --> 00:32:18.050
Says I am now on vacation and I am going to laze about doing fuck all.

518
00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:21.410
Um,
and then that's it.

519
00:32:21.411 --> 00:32:24.530
And then I come back to La and I'm going to get this fucking hour.

520
00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:30.690
Oh Shit.
Uh,
whipped into shape and maybe do another special,
I don't know.

521
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:36.150
I don't know what I'm supposed to do in this new landscape of 15 minutes

522
00:32:36.151 --> 00:32:39.770
specials,
hour specials.
Um,

523
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:40.911
<v 4>well knows.</v>

524
00:32:40.911 --> 00:32:45.710
I got to figure out what the fucking next movies so I can keep coming over here.

525
00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:50.450
And,
uh,
having an unbelievable time.
Sorry if this podcast wasn't funny,

526
00:32:50.451 --> 00:32:53.600
I'm still kind of floating from what happened last night.

527
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:57.770
I still cannot believe I got to do that.
Um,

528
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.050
it's just,
yeah,
no words,
speeches.
They actually had me sign the book,

529
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:04.610
you know,

530
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:09.420
and they like to you to sign the guestbook at Royal Albert after you did the a

531
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:13.520
Gig.
And once again,
I can barely move.
I wrote something like that.

532
00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:17.120
Just speechless.
You know,
I,
I don't know what,
I didn't know what to say.

533
00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:18.260
So I just said,
thanks.

534
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:23.090
Thanks for letting a fucking all shit and deck jobs over here.

535
00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:27.530
Spend an hour and 50 minutes on that stage.
Can't fucking believe it.

536
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:32.390
Unbelievable.
All right.
That's it.
Enjoy the music and,
uh,

537
00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:38.530
<v 5>I'll talk to you when I'm in my fifties.
All J.</v>

538
00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:41.730
All right,
here's a couple advertisements here.
Uh,

539
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:45.690
express VPN.
You know,

540
00:33:45.691 --> 00:33:50.400
with all the news lately about data hacks and breaches,
data hacks and breaches,

541
00:33:50.401 --> 00:33:54.750
sorry,
it's hard for me not to worry about my digital privacy.
Well,

542
00:33:54.751 --> 00:33:58.380
there's an understatement.
No matter what you do online,
your prop,

543
00:33:58.410 --> 00:33:59.340
your mobile carrier,

544
00:33:59.341 --> 00:34:04.140
Internet service provider or tracking it all bastards,
Comcast,

545
00:34:04.141 --> 00:34:07.020
Verizon,
Time Warner,
the list goes on.

546
00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:10.110
These nosy bastards are trying to figure out what you're doing.

547
00:34:10.111 --> 00:34:12.780
Companies like these have a record of every single thing you do.

548
00:34:12.781 --> 00:34:16.110
Every website you visit,
every email you send,
it's ridiculous.

549
00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:21.330
So that's why I decided to take my privacy back by using express VPN.

550
00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:25.710
Is that what I did?
I wasn't aware of that these days.

551
00:34:25.711 --> 00:34:29.880
I don't use the Internet without it.
I hate when they write copy like this.

552
00:34:29.881 --> 00:34:33.750
I totally believe in this.
If this is what they're gonna do.
How about that?

553
00:34:33.751 --> 00:34:35.130
With Express Vpn,

554
00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:39.870
your Internet data is encrypted and your IP address is hidden.

555
00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:45.020
Express VPN costs less than seven bucks a month and it's rated the number one

556
00:34:45.301 --> 00:34:50.301
VPN service by tech radar and dozens of expert reviewers.

557
00:34:51.390 --> 00:34:52.860
Express VPN has easy to use.

558
00:34:52.861 --> 00:34:57.390
APPS that run seamlessly in the background of your computer,
phone and tablet.

559
00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:00.540
Turning on express VPN protection only takes the click.

560
00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:04.320
No matter what you do online,
whether you have something to hide,

561
00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:09.570
ooze or you think you're done,
that you don't express VPN is for you.
Uh,

562
00:35:09.571 --> 00:35:14.571
if you're on unsecure Wifi and wanting to keep hackers and spies from senior

563
00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.030
data,
express VPN is for you.

564
00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:22.500
Well then just watch a bunch of slap fights and motorcycle videos with me and

565
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.433
the occasional porn.

566
00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.870
And if you don't want providers like Verizon recording your entire online

567
00:35:27.871 --> 00:35:30.150

Postmates.
I use these guys as usual.

577
00:36:07.561 --> 00:36:11.520
Your stomach and the rest of your life are at war.
Um,

578
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:12.601
you need to eat,

579
00:36:12.601 --> 00:36:17.100
but you can't stop what you're doing to deal with it and not the only and the

580
00:36:17.101 --> 00:36:22.101
only things what and the only fast things that deliver are not what you want.

581
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.490
That means you don't want fast food.
Why don't these people realize I'm dumb?

582
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.590
Next,
please mention all the Tok course.

583
00:36:28.591 --> 00:36:32.610
I'm going to mention these introducing Postmates,

586
00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.480
They'll throw it right through the window.

587
00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:45.210
You don't have to talk on a phone to order.

It was kind of creepy.

592
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:08.500
You forgot to get eggs and milk,
no problem.
Craving a tasty burger.

596
00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:26.710
We got you for a limited time.

but not leastly hymns.
H I m.

604
00:37:59.081 --> 00:38:04.000
S is that hairline slowly starting to move backwards.
What did,

605
00:38:04.001 --> 00:38:08.170
how was this seven years ago?
Any bald spots yet?
Yeah,

606
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:12.340
all over my head.
How will you feel a year from now if you're,

607
00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:15.790
if it's businesses usual up there?
I asked you,

608
00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:20.440
do you want a bald spot to pop up or do you want to do something about it first,

609
00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.630
do you realize how big a vat of whatever the hell this is?

610
00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:24.573
They're gonna have to sell me.

611
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:28.030
Do you want your hairline to recede or do you want to do something about it

612
00:38:28.031 --> 00:38:32.380
first?
Why do guys turn to weird solutions or do nothing?

613
00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.990
What's called fucking being a man.
You,

614
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.860
I don't like how they're insulting me here.
Uh,

615
00:38:38.861 --> 00:38:43.270
when they can turn to medicine and science
for

616
00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:46.293

622
00:39:05.441 --> 00:39:08.800

634
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:58.450

Sorry.

635
00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:03.600
F O r h I m s.com/burr for hims.com/ [inaudible] one more time cause I said it

636
00:40:05.321 --> 00:40:08.300
the wrong way for
hymns.com/

637
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:48.260
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

638
00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:52.800
<v 5>I got sites,
subs right now I did a show in Dublin,</v>

639
00:40:52.801 --> 00:40:53.634
Ireland

640
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.720
<v 8>and</v>

641
00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:56.920
<v 5>all the crowds were great,</v>

642
00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:01.980
but I gotta tell you those fucking people in Ireland are the funniest that I

643
00:41:03.011 --> 00:41:04.270
can't even explain.

644
00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:09.370
I swear it was just something about like when I go through Great Britain and

645
00:41:09.371 --> 00:41:12.130
Ireland,
it's like Scotland and Ireland.

646
00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:16.900
They like the knuckleheads that I grew up with and when I go to London,

647
00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.480
London is like,
was,

648
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:23.970
is kind of like all the people that I met when I went to New York that were from

649
00:41:23.971 --> 00:41:27.120
Boston.
So they,
they did move away from where they were from,

650
00:41:27.121 --> 00:41:31.230
but they still brought that thing with them cause people in London are
hilarious.

651
00:41:31.231 --> 00:41:36.231
But I was doing a show Dublin on Monday night at the,

652
00:41:36.341 --> 00:41:40.640
the,
the vicar,
a vicar street theater is something just this awesome venue.

653
00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.830
And uh,
anyway,
so it was,

654
00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:47.150
it was on a Monday night and it's a really hard night to try and sell tickets

655
00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.790
and these people showed up in force

656
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:56.190
and I can't even tell you how it,
they,
they will fucking hilarious.

657
00:41:56.190 --> 00:42:01.190
Like I was on stage and there was this thing I was talking about about people

658
00:42:02.131 --> 00:42:06.120
hugging their kids and how that could,
p is a good thing,

659
00:42:06.121 --> 00:42:09.330
but if you do it too much,
you could potentially make a week or so.
I mentioned,

660
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.260
and I'll,

661
00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:15.240
I've been telling this story for like six to eight months and I've been saying

662
00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:17.550
how that,
you know,
my mother wasn't a hug,

663
00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:20.130
hug her and didn't hug us when we were kids.

664
00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:24.330
And people just listen and it's just a small detail that leads to this other

665
00:42:24.331 --> 00:42:25.680
part that I want to talk about.

666
00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.580
So I've said that line

667
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:34.280
uneventfully that's even a fucking word with,
with no,

668
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:39.310
no issue whatsoever for like six months now I'm in fucking Ireland and I just

669
00:42:41.601 --> 00:42:44.030
throw that line out there like I'm not even thinking about it and say,
yeah,

670
00:42:44.031 --> 00:42:44.481
I said,
you know,

671
00:42:44.481 --> 00:42:47.810
my mother didn't hug me when I was a kid and I'm getting ready to say the next

672
00:42:47.811 --> 00:42:51.320
sentence.
And like 15% of the crowd goes,
aw,

673
00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.580
I'm not even doing it the way they did.

674
00:42:57.581 --> 00:43:01.270
It just collectively broke my ball.

675
00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.510
It was just such the classic fucking,

676
00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:09.010
it was like that Boston Irish thing that I grew up with distilled to its purest

677
00:43:09.011 --> 00:43:13.790
form with actually real Irish people were
I,

678
00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:17.220
you'd almost have to be that a fucking understand what was behind it.

679
00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:21.000
It was like,
eee.
I opened the emotional door,

680
00:43:21.001 --> 00:43:25.530
just a crack in automatically.
It's just,

681
00:43:25.531 --> 00:43:28.820
they just bust your balls about it.
Like,
Eh,
you're fucking,
you know what I like?

682
00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:30.450
And you think they,
I think we got hugs.

683
00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.010
You're freckled can't shut the fuck up and tell the judge I can't even,
it just,

684
00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:38.700
I,
I've been trying to,
I would try to explain it to Nia.
She laughed,

685
00:43:38.701 --> 00:43:42.450
but it's still,
yeah,
you kind of had to be there and then,

686
00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.890
you know,
so I laughed at when my fucking trying to get your sympathy.

687
00:43:46.891 --> 00:43:48.240
I'm trying to get through this next part.

688
00:43:48.241 --> 00:43:50.480
You assholes and the whole crowd fucking laughs.
Yeah.

689
00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:54.900
<v 9>Is the,
when I was growing up,
uh,
you know,
my mother never hugged us.</v>

690
00:43:54.901 --> 00:43:56.910
We didn't come from a family like that.
You know what I mean?

691
00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.650
<v 10>[inaudible] island of no hugs.
I can't,
your blood in me said,</v>

692
00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:09.550
I'll fucking look at them.
That's totally what that was.

693
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:16.030
Oh,
moms did nagase the fucking,
what are you pitching a box?

694
00:44:16.031 --> 00:44:19.310
You policy for the lot of God.
Let me get through it.
All right.

695
00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:28.320
Did any fucking countries.
I've said that in and nobody says shit and then you

696
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:35.290
[inaudible] I'll
try it and it will have a drink.

697
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.770
Holy fucking God.
Damn Mary.
Yeah.
So I guess you still have bullying.

698
00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:46.903
[inaudible]

699
00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:51.760
<v 5>and then like a half hour later,</v>

700
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:57.490
what I had done when I was over there was I bought a bunch of DVDs with me.
Um,

701
00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:01.600
like just the,
uh,
basically the DVD itself,

702
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:02.950
this little paper thing.

703
00:45:02.951 --> 00:45:05.530
And I was just handing them out to people cause I'm trying to get them to show

704
00:45:05.531 --> 00:45:07.690
other people,
you know,

705
00:45:07.691 --> 00:45:10.600
when I'm out there so I can keep coming back.

706
00:45:10.601 --> 00:45:13.500
Basically trying to get them to spread the word on my comedy.

707
00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.030
And then someone's just like,
well why don't you just put it on Spotify?

708
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:18.700
You dumb fuck.
And I'm like,
yeah cause I'm old.
Alright.

709
00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:22.240
I feel like I have to bring the hard copy.
So I tell these assholes.

710
00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:28.800
Then I've given them free DVDs at the end of the show and I'm halfway through

711
00:45:28.991 --> 00:45:33.340
that spiel telling them that they're getting a free DVD.
All right.

712
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:37.240
And I'm in the middle of it and I hate this guy in the back of the cry goes,

713
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:38.890
Oh fuck off.

714
00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:48.130
I don't even think I even explained what I was doing.

715
00:45:48.131 --> 00:45:50.470
I don't know if I had gotten to the part where they were free.

716
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:52.600
I don't know what the fuck.
Oh,

717
00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:56.320
it was the fact that I was trying to once again go to a nice place where,
hey,

718
00:45:56.321 --> 00:45:58.360
you know,
I really appreciate you guys coming out.

719
00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:02.050
It's really means a lot to me and I want to keep coming back here cause I think

720
00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:04.420
you've got a great comp country or whatever.
And I just,

721
00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:08.280
just opening the door that much.
Oh fuck off.

722
00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:12.770
So I finally just looked and I went,
Jesus Christ,
they're already left.

723
00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:16.960
And I was like,
you know what?
I've played in 20,
almost 22 years as a comedian.

724
00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:22.060
I've played in front of some miserable motherfuckers,

725
00:46:22.061 --> 00:46:24.130
but you guys,
and they were already laughing,

726
00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:28.000
are the most miserable fucking cons I've ever been in.
And they loved it,

727
00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:31.660
absolutely loved it.
And,
um,

728
00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:35.650
it killed me that I couldn't go out drinking with the crowd because I had a

729
00:46:35.651 --> 00:46:39.010
fucking go a head,
an early flight.
Of course,
all the way over to Helsinki.

730
00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:43.250
Totally.
Tonight.
Like I did,
I did,
brought a bunch of DVDs and everything.

731
00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:44.990
They're complimentary.
If you guys coming up

732
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:49.030
<v 10>Nice Brown,
you said fuck off.
You don't want them.</v>

733
00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:55.540
You don't have to take one
dude.

734
00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:59.150
I gotta tell you I've been to some miserable fucking places.

735
00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:01.840
This is one of the most

736
00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:10.810
miserable.
Like just,
Hey,

737
00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.980
I've got some DVDs that complimentary fuck off.

738
00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.241
Don't you just,

739
00:47:18.241 --> 00:47:22.560
you sounded like I drove into the back of your car and I'll fire you want like

740
00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.050
get the fuck off.
Fix My pocket car,

741
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.920
giving you a Goddamn show.
[inaudible] a Guy

742
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:52.893
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

743
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.890
<v 4>I did the Kilkenny festival and uh,</v>

744
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:58.990
Kilkenny Ireland and that one,

745
00:47:58.991 --> 00:48:02.350
I don't remember Manet's on fries as much as I remember how many pints of

746
00:48:02.351 --> 00:48:04.550
Guinness I drank and this,
oh,

747
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:08.650
we got hammered and this great laugh than I had with dom.
I rera,

748
00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:13.410
me and Tom were like,
we were just like,
we were like cliff and Norman shares it,

749
00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:16.960
just walking around that city and everybody else would go to bed and we would

750
00:48:16.961 --> 00:48:20.020
still be like carousing.
Right.
So one night we're walking up,

751
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:25.070
it's like fucking at probably two in the morning on like a Sunday night.
So,

752
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.370
you know,
sleepy town,
everybody's asleep.

753
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:31.600
We're walking up these cobblestones in the fucking moonlight.
Alright.

754
00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:32.980
Like werewolves in London,
Shit.

755
00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:37.240
It had rained so they like the moonlight was glistening and we're walking up and

756
00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:40.540
it's fucking quiet as Helen were drunk and were laughing.
But try not to,

757
00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.080
you know,
wait for somebody to throw up in the shutters.
Yeah.
Hi Joe.
Hi Kate.

758
00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:44.460
My [inaudible] here.
Right.

759
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.030
And we were walking up the thing and we're trying to find a bar that's still

760
00:48:48.031 --> 00:48:52.800
open and all of a sudden we just heard these,
these,
you know,
these Irish singers.

761
00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:56.640
Okay.
What time was this?
This was like two in the morning on a Sunday night.

762
00:48:56.641 --> 00:49:00.000
So we just start following the sound of them singing.
Come up please.

763
00:49:00.001 --> 00:49:03.270
Cobblestones.
And then it sounds like the beginning of a great movie,
right?

764
00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:06.780
Came up and we come down,
we see the light on this bar and we come walking in.

765
00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:10.290
By the time we get in,
um,
you know,

766
00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.960
this guy was singing with two other people and they had gone up to the bar.

767
00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:17.460
So it was only one guy singing when we came walking in and we come walking in

768
00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:21.030
and it's just a bunch of townies sitting there way more seats than people.

769
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:25.800
A little empty,
but a small place.
And this guy's on stage just singing.

770
00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:30.790
I got myself a shady at Haiti,
Haiti,
who seeing in this fucking thing,
right?

771
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:35.020
And we're taking the bar and we look and there's this guy sitting right in front

772
00:49:35.021 --> 00:49:37.960
of the stage and dude,
he was passed out at a level.

773
00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:42.290
You'd never get this drunk and an American bar.
They'd send you home.
Dude,

774
00:49:42.291 --> 00:49:45.670
this guy,
he looks scared.
This guy was completely passed.
I'll never forget,

775
00:49:45.671 --> 00:49:50.620
he had one arm was slung over the back of the chair and then his head was just

776
00:49:50.621 --> 00:49:53.170
hanging straight down.
When you stood behind him,
he couldn't see his head.

777
00:49:53.171 --> 00:49:56.920
You just saw it like is that this is next.
So the back of his neck,

778
00:49:56.921 --> 00:49:58.270
he was just sitting there,
hang in there,

779
00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:02.560
it looked like he had gotten shot and we walked in and nobody was really
talking.

780
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:05.370
And this guy's slumped over and all we hear is that.

781
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:06.850
And everybody turns around and looks at us.

782
00:50:06.851 --> 00:50:09.300
And meanwhile that guy's in the background going,
ah,

783
00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:12.820
green alligator and a long neck or whatever.

784
00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:17.140
And he fucking Ah,
look at each other.

785
00:50:17.141 --> 00:50:20.590
And it was like one of those things where we now we can't leave.
So we are,

786
00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:23.140
we walk up to the bar and they asked,
you know,

787
00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:26.230
really thick Irish brogue what we wanted,
ordered a couple of Guinnesses.

788
00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:29.210
And I'm sitting there trying to hold it together cause I know I can't look at

789
00:50:29.211 --> 00:50:34.211
dom and I'm hearing dom starting to laugh and this guy still second and dom

790
00:50:34.851 --> 00:50:37.790
starts,
dom starts riffing,

791
00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:41.950
he starts riffing lyrics to what?
This guy singing.

792
00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.820
And he's just in my ear going,

793
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:47.870
I got my shelf of totality and he's doing this thing and do,
we started,

794
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:53.620
we started fucking laughing and we couldn't stop like to school goes.

795
00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:58.310
And the whole thing was what was keeping it going was if there's tension like in

796
00:50:58.311 --> 00:51:02.000
like in high school or middle school when the teacher goes to the next person

797
00:51:02.001 --> 00:51:06.500
who left,
yeah.
Gets fucking detention.
Like that tension makes you,

798
00:51:06.501 --> 00:51:08.190
you can't stop fucking on.
Oh yeah.

799
00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:10.660
So we knew they were looking at us and I'm getting nervous.
Like I,

800
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.650
they think we're laughing at their country and all this.

801
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:16.170
So I'm trying to be polite and not laughing all it just,
it just,
dude,

802
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:18.320
it was just fucking wave of laughing.
I remember,

803
00:51:18.321 --> 00:51:20.870
I've never seen dom like I was looking at,

804
00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:25.580
he literally like his mouth was open and he had tears.

805
00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.080
What?

806
00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:30.530
And then what was cracking me up was it looked like almost like he was crying

807
00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.020
and that what that guy was singing was making me cry.

808
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:37.820
So then there was another wave of laughs,
oh my God,
the guy's just slunched over.

809
00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:41.540
And the whole time.
And then like the bartender would look at me like,

810
00:51:41.541 --> 00:51:44.120
what the fuck are you laughing at?
And I would look over,
look away,

811
00:51:44.121 --> 00:51:48.200
and all I could look at with this guy slumped over is this guy on stage.

812
00:51:48.201 --> 00:51:48.801
And he was singing,

813
00:51:48.801 --> 00:51:52.690
he had his eyebrows up and he was hitting these fucking high notes until it was,

814
00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:55.370
it was torture.
But it was a great laugh.

815
00:51:55.371 --> 00:51:59.840
But it was that whole thing probably took all of four minutes.
But like Mike,

816
00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:03.860
Mike,
Mike,
oh,
my stomach was fucking killing me.
Oh my God.

817
00:52:03.861 --> 00:52:04.850
I would have loved to see that.

818
00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:06.800
I would have loved to somewhere in those adventures

819
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.990
<v 7>I picked up.
Oh,
that's a great story.</v>

820
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:58.483
[inaudible] [inaudible]

821
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:03.900
<v 4>hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burns the Monday morning podcast,</v>

822
00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:09.510
but June 7th,
2010 how the hell are ya?
What's going?

823
00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:12.300
Are you better?

824
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:15.220
<v 0>MMM.</v>

825
00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:17.920
<v 4>Jesus Christ.
I can't get away from that fucking oil spill.</v>

826
00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:19.670
<v 0>You know,</v>

827
00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:23.200
<v 4>try to go out to a bar.
You try to drink your troubles away.</v>

828
00:53:23.201 --> 00:53:25.980
And every time I look up,
there's some fucking burger getting picked

829
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.730
<v 5>up by scientists.
You know,
I like that when,
you know,</v>

830
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:31.080
when they pick up the bird,

831
00:53:31.081 --> 00:53:33.660
they still have to make sure that the bird doesn't like fucking bite.

832
00:53:33.661 --> 00:53:38.420
The shit out of him still was picking up a Pelican,
you know?

833
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:38.941
And he's got his,

834
00:53:38.941 --> 00:53:43.440
he's got his gardener glove and he's holding the beak shut his fucking stupid

835
00:53:43.441 --> 00:53:46.470
animals.
It's like,
dude,
I'm trying to help you,
you know,

836
00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:50.700
can't help you if you don't want help.
You know,
you dumb fuck,

837
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:55.530
look at me.
I wanted to eat you.
Would I be gingerly picking you up?

838
00:53:55.531 --> 00:54:00.500
Why you trying to bite me?
That shit you're covered in his oil.

839
00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:04.220
Alright.
You dumb fuck if you weren't such a stupid bird,
you,

840
00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:08.690
you understand the gas combustion engine,

841
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:14.210
you know?
Um,
anyways,
whatever.

842
00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:19.430
Blaming the victim here is fucking unreal,
man.
Can they just kept that shit?

843
00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:23.510
All right.
You know,
hug Dama my dual credit can,
I just can't,

844
00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.040
they just put a top on it,
you know,

845
00:54:25.041 --> 00:54:26.930
for the first time I actually looked at the spill.

846
00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:29.030
There's certain things that I just can't watch.

847
00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:31.430
The second I heard what was going on down there.

848
00:54:31.431 --> 00:54:36.431
It's like I'm not gonna Watch that shit because I have absolutely no power to,

849
00:54:36.501 --> 00:54:41.300
to stop it.
All I can do is just sit there watching it going,
fuck,

850
00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:46.180
you know,
whatever.
What are you gonna do?

851
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:50.390
What do you,
what,
what the fuck?
How the fuck do you stop it

852
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:56.750
once the loo,
I'm,
I'm Kinda handicapped this week.

853
00:54:56.750 --> 00:55:00.950
People as I had a crazy fucking weekend and,
uh,

854
00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:03.440
my broad is still sleeping in the other room,
so I'm,

855
00:55:03.441 --> 00:55:04.490
this is going to be one of those,

856
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:09.250
a medium energy podcasts of fuck you all right.
Fuck you.
Whoever.

857
00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:11.780
Just side who have just rolled your fucking eyes,
right?

858
00:55:11.781 --> 00:55:14.900
You don't have a medium energy day where you don't put in the fucking effort.

859
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:20.540
You know,
like what's his face that power forward for the fucking Lakers,

860
00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:22.430
who's full of gummy bears?

861
00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:27.140
Every other fucking game is sugar crashes and he's not worth a shit.
Are we sick?

862
00:55:27.141 --> 00:55:28.940
His name is,
uh,
not Lamar Odom.

863
00:55:28.941 --> 00:55:32.060
I always think it's Riley Odom who I believe was a guy who played for the

864
00:55:32.061 --> 00:55:35.120
fucking Broncos,
Riley ODMs.
And

865
00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:39.770
the seventies or was it haven Moses?
I Dunno.

866
00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:42.110
I Dunno where these names come through,
but I'm sick.

867
00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:46.730
You know everybody fucking talking about the Goddamn oil spill.
You know,

868
00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:49.550
acting like human beings are the fucking worst.
We're down there.

869
00:55:49.551 --> 00:55:52.120
We're trying to help these filthy animals in,
in,
in,
in,

870
00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:55.220
in the effort to help them this,
they're still attacking us.

871
00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:57.493
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

872
00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:02.370
<v 5>You know,
it's like,
dude,
I can't help you.
You know,
you have to want help.
Okay.</v>

873
00:56:02.371 --> 00:56:05.430
You gotta you gotta want to change.
You got to want to come out of the Muck,
dude.

874
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:07.253
All right.

875
00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:08.340
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

876
00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:11.060
<v 5>I've got to fucking pull you out of the sludge and cover your mouth at the same</v>

877
00:56:11.061 --> 00:56:14.660
fucking time.
What it was this,
some sort of Jujitsu,

878
00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:19.910
some animal Jujitsu.
Oh,
Jesus.
Morning Sweetheart.

879
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:23.680
What was with little deer?

880
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:27.410
<v 4>Okay.
You know,
some days when your significant other walks by,</v>

881
00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:29.740
you just know this is one of these days.
You know,

882
00:56:29.741 --> 00:56:32.050
those couple of points that I want to make in the relationship.

883
00:56:32.051 --> 00:56:34.920
I'll wait till tomorrow to try to make those points.
Wow.

884
00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:41.530
Whew.
Jesus Christ.

885
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:47.400
She looked like a fucking future hall of fame quarterback in the twilight of her

886
00:56:47.891 --> 00:56:52.130
career in the morning.
You know,
that's how she,
when she walked by Jesus Christ,

887
00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:54.340
that was such a great fucking reference.
And I butchered it.

888
00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:58.810
She looked like a future hall of Famer in the twilight.

889
00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.920
I th I think I did it backwards.
What if you pull a pit bull's tail?

890
00:57:03.390 --> 00:57:06.130
You liked that Cleo.
You're like,
I don't pull it.
I just hold onto it.

891
00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:11.900
<v 5>All right.
Get out of my face.
So I'll get you,
you're not covered in oil.</v>

892
00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:14.060
Would you try to bite me if I pulled you out?
You wouldn't,

893
00:57:14.061 --> 00:57:18.380
you'd be sitting there going,
whoa.
All right.
So anyways,
um,

894
00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:22.670
speaking of the Lakers and Celtics,
um,
this is just,

895
00:57:22.671 --> 00:57:26.960
just in fucking insane time of the year with the NBA finals and the Nhl finals

896
00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:29.030
are on at the same time,
you know,

897
00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:33.260
and women just go crazy because they are loving it.

898
00:57:33.261 --> 00:57:35.240
They're loving every second of the sports.

899
00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:41.810
My girl watches every fucking TV show then involves,

900
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:46.130
let's take the dumbest content from the stupidest state and uh,

901
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:49.700
just start documenting their family.
You know,

902
00:57:49.701 --> 00:57:54.300
and then that then the people start ramping up the stupid because the cameras

903
00:57:54.301 --> 00:57:57.070
are on.
I went in there,
she was watching something.

904
00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:01.940
They had just a bunch of dumb skanks from Jersey planning a fucking wedding in

905
00:58:01.941 --> 00:58:04.490
rather than addressing the real issue,

906
00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:08.060
which is that these people are gonna fucking procreate.

907
00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:11.990
They're actually dealing with this little shit about,
oh my God,

908
00:58:11.991 --> 00:58:13.760
I want wear chef fine.

909
00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:18.950
And all my skanky bridesmaids,
you know,

910
00:58:18.951 --> 00:58:23.240
with their scraped out uteruses from all those abortions have to wear the same

911
00:58:23.241 --> 00:58:26.210
fucking color.
I mean that's television people.
I don't think it is.

912
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:30.230
It's not television.
How do we go from Lawrence Welk to that number?

913
00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:35.330
When we had family values,
Lawrence Welk had so many morals.

914
00:58:35.331 --> 00:58:39.590
It was actually creepy.
I ban and the two and

915
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:43.550
go on Youtube and go look up the Lawrence Welk show.

916
00:58:43.551 --> 00:58:48.020
There was a dance team on there,
Bobby and Susie or something.
Just the widest,

917
00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:52.400
purest.
Um,
let's go spoon with Jesus.

918
00:58:52.401 --> 00:58:54.410
Fucking white names you could ever come up with.

919
00:58:54.411 --> 00:58:59.411
And they used to do these fees to fucking dance these stupid smiles on their

920
00:59:00.021 --> 00:59:03.480
face.
And it was just that classic little skippy.

921
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:05.650
Do skip the do all across the fucking,

922
00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:11.750
the fucking stupid dance floor,
you know?

923
00:59:12.110 --> 00:59:15.250
You know they both had fucking eating disorders as goddamn dancers.

924
00:59:15.350 --> 00:59:17.990
You got to have the body of a fucking seventh grade or your entire life.

925
00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:21.680
It's like you're 35 years old.
What do you eat?
Huh?

926
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:28.300
Fucking handful of cottage cheese before you go out the Goddamn door,
Cleo,

927
00:59:28.301 --> 00:59:30.950
get out.
Get away from me.
Come on.
You're sniffing up my feet.

928
00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:36.050
I'm trying to focus here.
Dogs are so fucking emotional.
Look at that.

929
00:59:36.051 --> 00:59:38.510
Look on your face.
You really just had a sad look on your face.

930
00:59:38.511 --> 00:59:42.100
Now you're making me feel bad.
Hmm.

931
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:48.830
Anyways,
I'm talking about the Lawrence Welk show.
I go,
look,
Dad,

932
00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:52.910
shut up.
It was just the admin system.
It was fucking horrible.

933
00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.850
Some of those shows back then.
You know,
that's,

934
00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:57.620
that's kind of like what I grew up on.
Ya know,

935
00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:01.610
I just saw those shows and I sat down and watched it for the longest time.

936
01:00:01.611 --> 01:00:05.470
That was like music to me,
you know,
and I asked for,
uh,

937
01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:09.560
I want to record,
I want to,
I wanted some music for my birthday.

938
01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.380
I don't even know what,
I didn't know what it was.
I just wanted to record,

939
01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:18.210
give me a record in the first record I was given was a sing along with Mitch and

940
01:00:18.591 --> 01:00:22.460
the gang was a Mitch Miller record.
You know,

941
01:00:23.330 --> 01:00:25.750
I always wonder why it never got laid in high school.
But you know when,

942
01:00:25.751 --> 01:00:29.240
when you're,
when you're weaned on roll out the barrel,

943
01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:34.080
oh he's,

944
01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.660
other kids are singing like fucking Aerosmith and led Zeppelin and I'm like,

945
01:00:37.661 --> 01:00:42.220
won't you come Home Bill Bailey,
won't you come home?
You love up.

946
01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:43.900
<v 12>Whoa.</v>

947
01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:49.330
<v 5>You know what kind of kid in the third grade wants to play the Banjo?</v>

948
01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.030
I didn't know any better.
I didn't know that there was electric guitar.

949
01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:56.710
I actually liked it.
Tuba fucking Mickey Finn.

950
01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:02.380
Huh?
The fucking something.
Or Robert E.
Lee.
That was like one of my favorite song.

951
01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:06.820
Ted Heath Orchestra Elks parade.
Those who might jams.

952
01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:10.780
I used to sit there and you know,

953
01:01:10.781 --> 01:01:13.720
normal kids would sit there and listen to like some fucking,

954
01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:15.881
you know,

955
01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:19.630
classic rock and then fantasize about being able to play it first of all the

956
01:01:19.631 --> 01:01:23.620
fucking hot broads in their 14th,
fifth,
fourth grade class,

957
01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.080
you know,
normal fantasies.

958
01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:30.640
I was actually thinking about playing the trumpet Solo on one o'clock.
Jump.

959
01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:34.360
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

960
01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.730
<v 5>That'll get on bill that we'll have them all lined up,
you know,</v>

961
01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.110
the extra saliva miles with their fucking braces.

962
01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:45.480
I always loved that when kids get braces.
I lucked out.

963
01:01:45.481 --> 01:01:46.770
I never had to have braces.

964
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:51.180
The kids had braces in like the give body thinking it's food for the first

965
01:01:51.181 --> 01:01:52.980
fucking two weeks trying to break it down.

966
01:01:56.250 --> 01:02:00.540
[inaudible] he kept hearing effectful um,
ugh.

967
01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:02.820
Fucking elastic bands.

968
01:02:02.821 --> 01:02:05.280
What are these fucking pussy kids have nowadays where they got that?

969
01:02:05.281 --> 01:02:07.800
He got that clear channel Shit they put in there.
Whatever the fuck it is.

970
01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:13.290
The clear I was at the fucking stuff the athletes take.
Um,

971
01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:20.010
I had a fucking,
what the fuck is he?
You know that,
that shit where

972
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.450
<v 4>it's just a plastic mouth guard.</v>

973
01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:25.440
You put it in your mouth and you don't have to go through the torture.
The kids,

974
01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:28.680
you know,
from my grade had to go through this is like really,

975
01:02:28.681 --> 01:02:31.650
that's like old school standup material.
You know,

976
01:02:31.651 --> 01:02:34.980
having to go there and get your fucking braces tightened in our right now might

977
01:02:34.981 --> 01:02:39.400
make my,
my uh,
my Mike,
Mike,
Mike,
Mike.
I might,
I might,
I might.

978
01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:42.000
Computer screen went to um,

979
01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:47.020
the save mode and what it does is it,
it,

980
01:02:47.021 --> 01:02:52.021
it puts up all the albums that I've downloaded onto my douchey fucking iPod,

981
01:02:52.171 --> 01:02:53.010
which sucks,

982
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:57.120
which breaks every six months or needs to be updated because he can't handle the

983
01:02:57.121 --> 01:03:01.020
new technology.
I haven't,
no,
I have a nice mix of music here.

984
01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:04.890
Gordon Lightfoot.
Oh,
this is some easy listening shit.

985
01:03:04.891 --> 01:03:09.600
Sting God smack.
Let me try to get some credibility.
Houses of the holy,

986
01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:12.990
one of the worst led Zepplin albums ever except for two songs.

987
01:03:12.991 --> 01:03:17.370
The rain song and fucking no quarter.
The crunch is,

988
01:03:17.371 --> 01:03:21.570
I am going to elect is one of the worst songs ever written by a great band.

989
01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:24.850
<v 0>MMM.</v>

990
01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:29.650
<v 4>Oh,
Stevie wonder,
what does that one songs in the key of a odd is a Jay z one.</v>

991
01:03:29.651 --> 01:03:32.650
I don't know why I have that.
Which one is that one?

992
01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.860
Is that the one where he was going to retire but then he didn't lamb of God the

993
01:03:35.861 --> 01:03:38.290
Romantics.
Remember that one?
What I like about you,

994
01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:43.180
when they had the red suits on red leather suits and there was nothing wrong

995
01:03:43.181 --> 01:03:45.890
with it.
Um,

996
01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.750
that one with Justin Timberlake steps on the crystal ball,
the disco ball,

997
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:55.570
cause he was bringing sexy back.
Remember that when?
Wham,

998
01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:59.530
wham,
um,
Neil young harvest moon,

999
01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:05.080
Merle Travis,
look at me.
I'm all over the fucking map.

1000
01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.950
1950s hits and highlights the nerves.

1001
01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:14.880
Any this best of brick Jeff Beck truth that album.

1002
01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:20.370
Huh?
Remember that one that had half a led Zeppelin one
Jacko Pistorious

1003
01:04:22.210 --> 01:04:26.260
<v 5>audio slate.
It's a super group.
Okay,
let's plow ahead here.
Um,</v>

1004
01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:30.100
I started to talk about Lakers,
Celtics,
and a,

1005
01:04:30.101 --> 01:04:32.390
I'm going to extend an olive branch right now.
And rather than,

1006
01:04:32.391 --> 01:04:36.490
than doing the usual and going off and that type of shit,
I want,
I want to,

1007
01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:39.160
you know,
and I'm even gonna drag in the hockey fans too.

1008
01:04:39.161 --> 01:04:42.400
I want to talk right now to fans or the Celtics,
the Lakers,

1009
01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:46.690
the Blackhawks and the flyers because,
uh,

1010
01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:50.200
I got a question because I'm having a fucking heart attack.

1011
01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:52.480
I'm aging like seven years,

1012
01:04:52.481 --> 01:04:57.481
which eat with each point that is scored or not scored in the Celtics Lakers

1013
01:04:59.291 --> 01:05:03.040
series and a,
I got to ask you,
you big sports fans out there.

1014
01:05:03.041 --> 01:05:06.100
Why do we give a fuck?

1015
01:05:08.430 --> 01:05:13.350
You know what?
It's fucking,
it's stupid.
I get it.
I get,
I mean,

1016
01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:14.120
you know you this,

1017
01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:18.580
I give a fuck so much that I'm actually jealous of people who don't give a shit.

1018
01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:24.280
Like last night after I watched the game,
like,
you know,
I felt like I got,

1019
01:05:24.281 --> 01:05:27.970
I got acquitted or something.
Like that's the level of stress.

1020
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.910
I'm just sitting there,
you know,

1021
01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:36.850
like fucking r Kelly thinking there's no way.
There's no fucking way.

1022
01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:41.830
Holy Shit.
They had video.
It looks just like you.
I know,

1023
01:05:41.831 --> 01:05:44.650
but it's not me.
You know,

1024
01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:49.120
all those years would be offended when everybody says we all look alike.

1025
01:05:49.121 --> 01:05:54.121
Now I'm saying we all look alike because I peed on a 12 year old amongst other

1026
01:05:55.271 --> 01:05:58.720
things.
Alright,
let's plow ahead here.
Um,

1027
01:06:00.070 --> 01:06:04.230
why don't we give a fuck to that.
Like I'm sitting here like this is,

1028
01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.200
this is how much I give a shit.
I know you guys are going to think this is nuts.

1029
01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:12.250
I actually had an opportunity,
some eat the last second had a ticket to the game.

1030
01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:16.030
It's a 20 minute fucking ride down the street and I turned it down.

1031
01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:21.580
I turned it down because I,
first of all,
I already went to an NBA finals game.

1032
01:06:21.581 --> 01:06:26.320
I already went.
Okay.
So I checked that off the bucket list.
I went to the Lakers,

1033
01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:29.440
Celtics actually lost Lakers,
Celtics final,

1034
01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.590
you don't if you're going to go to a final game,
that's the great thing.

1035
01:06:32.591 --> 01:06:37.360
And I went into enemy territory with my fucking Celtic shirt on and I basically

1036
01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:42.130
paid like 400 bucks or whatever the fuck to sit in the last row of the staple

1037
01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:46.660
center to every five seconds to have somebody go sale takes our beaches.

1038
01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.273
You know,

1039
01:06:51.450 --> 01:06:56.450
it's like I paid to get verbally fucking abused and to not hear the commentating

1040
01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:02.570
and all that type of shit,
but it was still awesome to be there.
But,
um,
I,
I,

1041
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:07.420
I give a fuck too much.
I want to hear the Goddamn game.

1042
01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:11.560
I don't want to sit there and have to look around fat fucks and drunks getting

1043
01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:15.280
up to get their goddamn beer and listen to their stupid shit.
I don't,

1044
01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:19.450
it's not worth,
I'm paying money to be tortured.
I don't want to do it.

1045
01:07:19.451 --> 01:07:22.150
So I actually stayed in my living room

1046
01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.930
and I watched the game on mute.

1047
01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:31.380
I can't even listen to the fucking announcers cause they drive me nuts.

1048
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:35.080
And half of it is because sometimes they say dumb shit.

1049
01:07:35.081 --> 01:07:40.081
And the other half is because I'm so psychotically into my team that I am

1050
01:07:40.451 --> 01:07:44.260
convinced that everyone in the booth hates my team,

1051
01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.840
secretly hates my fucking team.

1052
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:50.290
I actually have a debate with Paul Versey comedian,

1053
01:07:50.291 --> 01:07:53.680
right due to opens up from me.
You people in New York on the east coast,

1054
01:07:53.681 --> 01:07:58.360
you've seen them don't act like you haven't.
Um,
or even down in Atlanta.

1055
01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:00.580
Oh yeah,
the dude,
Hey,
I don't name names,

1056
01:08:00.581 --> 01:08:04.120
he may or may not have been the guy I went to fucking the master's with and bet

1057
01:08:04.121 --> 01:08:07.450
on the turtles.
But anyways,
um,

1058
01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:12.940
he's convinced that Tim McCarver hates the fucking Yankees and I'm like,
dude,

1059
01:08:12.941 --> 01:08:14.650
he hates the fucking red sox.

1060
01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:19.880
And then we just kind of came to a conclusion that,
uh,

1061
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:20.893
you know,

1062
01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:25.520
it's kind of in our head and also the Tim McCarver might kind of be a Douche a

1063
01:08:25.521 --> 01:08:29.180
little bit.
I think he likes the cardinals because that's who he played for.

1064
01:08:29.990 --> 01:08:32.780
But whatever,
I'm getting off track.
Like,
don't you wish you ever wish,

1065
01:08:32.790 --> 01:08:35.840
like sometimes you didn't give a fuck.
You know what I mean?

1066
01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.050
Like after I did my show and went down.
I mean,

1067
01:08:39.051 --> 01:08:41.840
actually after I watched the Lakers game,
I went down the street and uh,

1068
01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.060
I did stand up and a,

1069
01:08:44.061 --> 01:08:47.660
I came walking in and I was talking to some dude who was from New Hampshire.

1070
01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:52.250
So my God Celtics,
right?
He's like,
yeah,
yeah.
He goes,
they win tonight.

1071
01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:57.440
And I'm like,
you fucking Dick.
You fucking,
yeah,
they won.

1072
01:08:57.950 --> 01:08:58.761
Yeah,
they want.
Okay.

1073
01:08:58.761 --> 01:09:01.850
So now you get to have the joy that they won and you didn't have to go through

1074
01:09:01.851 --> 01:09:04.700
the fucking cardiac arrest that I went through.

1075
01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:08.680
Oh,
it's unreal.
When the Lakers start coming back,

1076
01:09:08.681 --> 01:09:11.860
I got to walk out of the fucking room.
Literally,
I walk out of the room,

1077
01:09:12.730 --> 01:09:16.120
come back in,
I peek,
peek back into the fuck am I can't fucking take it.

1078
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:20.050
It's like the oil spill.
This like this fucking thing that I want to turn out.

1079
01:09:20.051 --> 01:09:24.400
Right?
And,
and it isn't,
and there's nothing I can fucking do about it.

1080
01:09:25.180 --> 01:09:28.600
I'm just sitting there fucking helpless,
you know?

1081
01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:31.540
I don't know what I gotta do,
do I got,

1082
01:09:31.541 --> 01:09:34.720
I got going to be on like a fucking stair master like some broad while I watch

1083
01:09:34.721 --> 01:09:39.610
it to get that extra energy out.
I fucking like every like seven minutes.

1084
01:09:39.611 --> 01:09:44.611
I'll take the mute button off and I can listen to a sentence and a half before

1085
01:09:44.711 --> 01:09:48.580
van Gundy or somebody else.
All these,
these fucking guys who played the game,

1086
01:09:48.581 --> 01:09:49.391
coached the game,

1087
01:09:49.391 --> 01:09:52.570
know way more about the game and I am immediately convinced that they don't know

1088
01:09:52.571 --> 01:09:53.980
what the fuck they're talking about.

1089
01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:57.490
And I start yelling at my TV like a goddamn maniac.

1090
01:09:58.200 --> 01:09:59.033
<v 11>Okay,</v>

1091
01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.610
<v 5>I'll tell you what else fucking sucks.
That's right.</v>

1092
01:10:01.611 --> 01:10:04.790
I'm on a roll here about shit that sucks fucking,

1093
01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.550
I lived in New York like the,

1094
01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:12.100
I'm so fucking sick of living in this city that is the arch rival of that,

1095
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:14.120
of one of my teams,
you know,

1096
01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:17.810
and all day long I got to look at these fucking Laker flags flapping off the

1097
01:10:17.811 --> 01:10:22.010
side of the cars.
You know those things.
A Gay,
by the way,

1098
01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:23.780
you drive down the streets with your food,

1099
01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:25.340
<v 13>Uy</v>

1100
01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:29.090
<v 5>with your fucking team flags in the window and seeing those little clip on</v>

1101
01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:33.230
things.
Actually,
I see them and I start,
I start getting angry.

1102
01:10:33.710 --> 01:10:38.450
You know what I mean?
Like it's a fucking al Qaeda flag.
Did they have a flag?

1103
01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:43.550
You know,
what is,
what is it of them are sneaking into a pizza parlor,

1104
01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:47.600
crouching in a cave
fucking punks.

1105
01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:53.250
Um,
I just,
I,
I see them and I just want to fucking,

1106
01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:58.190
you know,
I dunno for some reason,
like,
like wire cutters.

1107
01:10:58.910 --> 01:11:03.020
I don't know why you'd need wire cutters to cut a plastic poor excuse for a

1108
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:05.750
flagpole.
I just want to snip them off.

1109
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:13.410
W what?
W really bill,
you take it to that level.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I do.

1110
01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:17.790
I don't do it,
but like,
I want to,
I want to,

1111
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.260
I would have gone to that Laker game,
uh,

1112
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:26.300
yesterday and I would've fantasized about beating the shit out of everybody in

1113
01:11:28.771 --> 01:11:33.690
my row,
you know,
and the Celtics winning by 40.

1114
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:37.410
It's not unhealthy.
It's not fucking health.
He looked at my leg,

1115
01:11:37.411 --> 01:11:39.810
my legs fucking shaking right now.
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing here.

1116
01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:43.320
So yeah.
So basically I lived,

1117
01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:46.410
I lived in New York during the height of the curse of the baby.

1118
01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:49.140
Every time I wanted to go see the red sox,

1119
01:11:49.141 --> 01:11:53.370
I had to sit and fucking Yankee stadium had people go 19 eight Jane,

1120
01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:57.690
you know,
and I got that Catholic fucking,
you know,
punish me shit.

1121
01:11:57.691 --> 01:12:01.020
So I'd show up with my red sox shit on,
you know,

1122
01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:03.090
and at that point we hadn't won in [inaudible] 86 years.

1123
01:12:03.091 --> 01:12:06.750
So all I could do was just personally attack the looks of the person,

1124
01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:09.720
you know,
make fun out of their hat,

1125
01:12:09.721 --> 01:12:13.290
looks stupid on their head or some shit like that.
And they,
they would be like,

1126
01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:17.990
what is your have to do with championships?
Nothing.
You fucking idiot.

1127
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:22.410
We haven't won in 86 years.
I got nothing here.
All you can talk about is how you,

1128
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:26.970
how,
how neatly your man tit sit on your fucking your beer belly.

1129
01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:34.550
Fine.
I don't know.
So then whatever the red sox finally went in,
I can breathe.

1130
01:12:35.690 --> 01:12:38.750
You know,
what song is that?
I can breathe again.

1131
01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:46.380
Can Pre the good one of those fucking 80 songs he thought really meant something

1132
01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:51.220
<v 2>down and down and down and down and down</v>

1133
01:12:53.230 --> 01:12:56.980
<v 5>the fuck was it?
I was a lot of reverb.
Reverb makes up for a lot.</v>

1134
01:12:56.981 --> 01:13:01.150
That's like the poor man's fucking autotune.
Um,
anyways,

1135
01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:06.100
fuck.
Am I talking about here?
Yes.
So then that shit ends,
you know,
Celtics,

1136
01:13:06.101 --> 01:13:10.570
a dead in the fucking water.
Then I the technically not even a fucking NBA team.

1137
01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:14.530
When,
when I make the decision to move out here and I move out here,

1138
01:13:15.370 --> 01:13:17.890
you don't want the most underhanded deals in the history of sport.

1139
01:13:17.891 --> 01:13:21.310
Kevin Mchale somehow decide,
we'll give you our best player for nobody.

1140
01:13:22.150 --> 01:13:24.760
Give it back to our form of fucking team that I used to play for.

1141
01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:26.710
And next thing you know where this shit,

1142
01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:32.110
and then I guy sale takes our BHS and I listened to that fucking these fucking

1143
01:13:32.111 --> 01:13:37.090
flags.
I hate it.
Why can't this business being like,
you know,
Oregon,

1144
01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:42.070
this is how much I fucking hate.
Like I'm sitting here watching the game,
right?

1145
01:13:42.430 --> 01:13:46.290
And all of a sudden I see Hillary Swank,
you know,

1146
01:13:47.710 --> 01:13:48.543
court side,

1147
01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:53.440
the worst court side and all the fucking basketball is the fucking Lakers.

1148
01:13:54.370 --> 01:13:58.060
Jesus Christ,
those people with their fucking laminated faces.

1149
01:13:59.910 --> 01:14:02.640
This is how fucking fucked up people are out here in la.

1150
01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:04.980
They get plastic surgery in their twenties

1151
01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:11.170
it's like you out of your mind you,
that's the take a picture of yourself,

1152
01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:14.830
your 20s when you get to your 50s then hand them the picture and be like,

1153
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:18.940
I want to look like that.
You know,
give him something to work off of.

1154
01:14:19.090 --> 01:14:23.830
Give these guys 30 years to fuck up other people's faces before they get to

1155
01:14:23.831 --> 01:14:28.510
yours.
Jesus Christ.
You know,
stop eating fried food.

1156
01:14:28.511 --> 01:14:30.610
Get on a fucking treadmill.
What's wrong with you?
Right?

1157
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:35.080
I'm telling you for coming,
you know,
games six,

1158
01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:40.150
you know,
like I'm going to be like,
yeah,
if it,
if there is a good six,

1159
01:14:40.151 --> 01:14:43.870
this is going to be a game six.
This is going to be a torturous fucking series.

1160
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:47.620
Um,
I am worried about the Celtics.

1161
01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:50.680
Garnette is heart and Paul Pearson hurt then fucking,
uh,

1162
01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:55.070
the van Gundy's go on their car nuts only gone up with one hand.

1163
01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:59.050
That's all I heard.
Well,
you got to use two hands for a rebound.

1164
01:14:59.051 --> 01:15:01.990
I hit fucking mute.
I'm like,
you think he doesn't fucking know that?

1165
01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:05.590
Then my buddy Paul verse,
he calls up,
he goes,
dude,
I think Arnett's heart,

1166
01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:06.970
he kept rubbing his shoulder,
right?

1167
01:15:06.971 --> 01:15:08.980
And then all of a sudden my buddy called me today.
He goes,
yeah,

1168
01:15:08.981 --> 01:15:13.610
they're saying that on the radio.
He fucked up his shoulder.
See,

1169
01:15:13.611 --> 01:15:18.230
that's why I don't listen.
Put It on fucking mute.
You know,

1170
01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:18.840
I don't,

1171
01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:23.570
I don't like how f just all these fucking people will now act like,

1172
01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.900
like the same way the Lakers won the first game,

1173
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:30.830
then all of a sudden the other Celtics fucking fished.
Right.

1174
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:34.340
And now the Celtics one out those,
the Lakers fucking [inaudible],

1175
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:40.460
they play two games.
It's one one.
It's a great fucking series so far.

1176
01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:42.920
Okay.
It's the usual fucking thing.

1177
01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:46.430
They always got to act like whatever just happened.

1178
01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:50.290
His law for the rest of the rest of fucking time.
I can't,
I it,

1179
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:52.460
it drives me fucking nuts.
But I gotta tell you this dude,

1180
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:57.170
oh a I owe Pau Gasol and apology.
All right.

1181
01:15:57.171 --> 01:15:59.150
Now I'm not going to be a deck here and be like,
well,
you know,

1182
01:15:59.590 --> 01:16:01.220
Garnette is in fucking 100% whatever.

1183
01:16:01.221 --> 01:16:03.290
That guy's going strong to the fucking hoop.

1184
01:16:03.650 --> 01:16:08.060
He is not the guy he was a two fucking years ago.

1185
01:16:08.061 --> 01:16:11.030
That guy's playing fucking great.
That's fucking baseline.

1186
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:15.950
Reverse Jamey had was the shit was the shit.

1187
01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:16.851
You see this,

1188
01:16:16.851 --> 01:16:21.851
this is a Celtics fan given pau Gasol props in the middle of the fucking series.

1189
01:16:22.011 --> 01:16:27.011
And I wish more you fucking sport cunts could act like that instead of fucking,

1190
01:16:27.861 --> 01:16:28.410
you know,

1191
01:16:28.410 --> 01:16:32.720
latch and you're hitching of the trailer of your loser life up to your fucking

1192
01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:36.200
team to the point.
So you get so into it that you can't even,

1193
01:16:36.201 --> 01:16:39.440
you can't even appreciate it.
Oh,
a fucking good play.
You know,

1194
01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.230
he's fucking red sox fans.
Fucked.
Ever cheat of really,
really

1195
01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:50.700
fucking stupid.
You know,
guys,
the Shit fucking,
you know,

1196
01:16:50.701 --> 01:16:53.790
one of the best players I've ever fucking seen.
You know,

1197
01:16:54.330 --> 01:16:57.330
the way he handles his shit on and off,
you know,
do I want the guy who went,

1198
01:16:57.331 --> 01:17:00.480
fuck no,
but am I going to sit here like an asshole?
You know,

1199
01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:04.560
and act like this dude isn't a great player or that fucking reverse jam.

1200
01:17:04.561 --> 01:17:06.030
Pau Gasol head was the shit.

1201
01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:10.220
I want to know how pau Gasol became a Laker.

1202
01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:14.670
He's a fucked up looking white dude.
If that doesn't say Celtic,

1203
01:17:14.671 --> 01:17:15.690
I don't know what does,

1204
01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:23.430
and this is really like the classic Celtics Lakers series where they've always

1205
01:17:23.431 --> 01:17:28.170
been just,
you know,
faster,
always had more talent.

1206
01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:31.320
And we've always just been,
you know,
like,
this is fucking,

1207
01:17:32.970 --> 01:17:37.140
you know,
fucking fucked up.
Look untamed.
But somehow we win.

1208
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:45.170
How many good looking Celtics have their bed?
I mean this

1209
01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.380
Larry Bird,
Dennis Johnson,
Kevin Mchale,
Kevin Mchale,

1210
01:17:54.381 --> 01:17:58.700
I guess had dreamy eyes if you're just focused on that,
but the rest of his body,

1211
01:17:59.000 --> 01:17:59.833
good Lord.

1212
01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:05.020
He looks like his fucking arms are so God damn long.

1213
01:18:05.230 --> 01:18:08.350
He looks like he would walk like that thing in the and,
and uh,

1214
01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:12.190
what was that movie with the CIC?
Crawled up out of the,
well,
was that the movie?

1215
01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:16.870
Oh is it that other movie that the,
the uh,
oh Jesus Christ.

1216
01:18:16.871 --> 01:18:20.200
One of those Japanese horror movies with that fucking thing crawls and as it

1217
01:18:20.201 --> 01:18:23.740
moves its hands,
its back legs would step over its front fucking legs.

1218
01:18:24.670 --> 01:18:26.350
Like some sort of mutant crab.

1219
01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:32.300
I Dunno,
I don't fucking know Kendrick Perkins.

1220
01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:33.880
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1221
01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.510
<v 5>I saw Kendrick Perkins,
by the way,
a lobby of this hotel about a week ago.</v>

1222
01:18:37.511 --> 01:18:41.440
That guy is a fucking mountain of a man.

1223
01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:45.460
He's a fucking mountain,
you know,

1224
01:18:45.610 --> 01:18:48.820
and to think that he looks like medium size next to Shaq,

1225
01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.800
these fucking people that ain't know.

1226
01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:54.070
If you ever get down on yourself that you never made,

1227
01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:58.030
you never made it to the professional ever stand next to a professional athlete

1228
01:18:58.270 --> 01:19:03.270
and just realize that it was game over by third grade when there's people

1229
01:19:03.581 --> 01:19:07.450
walking around with that sort of fucking bionic DNA.

1230
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:11.560
Jesus Christ.
I mean,
I can't believe I was allowed to go to gym class.

1231
01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:13.180
Pass the fucking sixth grade,

1232
01:19:15.730 --> 01:19:20.710
my pasty fucking Forrest Gump legs.
Um,
anyways,

1233
01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:25.380
so let's get back to this shit man.
White of why,
you know,
maybe,

1234
01:19:25.381 --> 01:19:28.390
maybe you guys can just answer me that.
Why the fuck do we care so much?

1235
01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:29.810
Like right now,
you know who's getting their,

1236
01:19:29.811 --> 01:19:34.811
their Goddamn fucking heart's ripped out and our aging other fans of the

1237
01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:38.150
Blackhawks in the flyers.
All right,
this,

1238
01:19:38.151 --> 01:19:42.790
this is one of these great series where somebody is finally going to have that

1239
01:19:42.791 --> 01:19:46.780
Advil lifted off their chest.
Blackhawks have in one sense,

1240
01:19:46.781 --> 01:19:50.920
61 the flyers have in one sense,
75.
Okay.

1241
01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:55.840
75 isn't as bad as 61,
but you know what the fuck.
You know,

1242
01:19:55.841 --> 01:20:00.100
I was writing on my Facebook page.
We pulled out of Vietnam in 1975.

1243
01:20:01.490 --> 01:20:06.180
All right.
There was only one kind of cheerios in 1975.

1244
01:20:06.190 --> 01:20:08.010
You understand,
we get it done.
Why am I putting

1245
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:12.420
<v 4>this in historical perspective here and can I dumb it down?</v>

1246
01:20:12.450 --> 01:20:16.050
The Rubik's cube was still about six,
seven years away.

1247
01:20:16.051 --> 01:20:20.370
People the last time the flyers wanted.
Okay,

1248
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:25.100
love you.
You just got to fucking dumb everything down.
Um,

1249
01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:28.260
friend of mine who actually runs the,
uh,

1250
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:33.330
the mm podcast page,
the uh,
the fan page,

1251
01:20:33.331 --> 01:20:37.750
the official and only fan page of the Monday morning podcast,
um,

1252
01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:41.420
who he gets exclusive,
uh,
whatever.

1253
01:20:41.421 --> 01:20:43.580
You know what I do is I do the podcast now cause I want to,

1254
01:20:43.581 --> 01:20:46.940
I want to take this podcast and next level is what I do is I do the podcast then

1255
01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:48.830
.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
You know,

1256
01:20:48.831 --> 01:20:52.280
I upload it and I sent it to the dude who runs that page and he puts all the

1257
01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:55.670
fucking,
you know,
all the references up,
all the youtube videos and everything.

1258
01:20:55.790 --> 01:21:00.290
Then we try to sync it where we,
we both fucking put it on at the same time,

1259
01:21:00.291 --> 01:21:04.980
you know,
taking it to the next level.
Totally lost.

1260
01:21:04.981 --> 01:21:08.850
Just lost my fucking train of thought here.
Um,
oh,
that's right.

1261
01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:10.050
He sent me this article.

1262
01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:15.080
This is the classic just dumbing down just pussy way that we're running this

1263
01:21:16.111 --> 01:21:19.940
country right now.
These dis p people actually I guess the,
uh,
the nationwide,
uh,

1264
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:24.480
the national spelling bee is coming up,
you know,
and everybody laughs at these,

1265
01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:27.630
these kids who go up there,
they're right at their fucking awkward years.

1266
01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:28.680
You know what I mean?

1267
01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:31.590
Where they have the nose of the adult and like the fucking teeth of a fucking

1268
01:21:31.591 --> 01:21:36.060
two year old,
you know,
12 year old.
So,
um,

1269
01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:42.570
they have in the national spelling bee in Washington DC,
they celebrate these,
uh,

1270
01:21:42.571 --> 01:21:46.620
these brainiac fucking kids that eventually will work for a corporation.

1271
01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:49.890
And without really knowing it will probably work on some device that'll Sunday

1272
01:21:49.891 --> 01:21:53.880
kill millions of people,
you know,
in other words,
the future.

1273
01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:00.440
So there's people actually they're picketing the spelling bee.

1274
01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:06.090
All right.
I had to,
I had to fucking read this to actually believe it.
Okay.

1275
01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:10.560
It says not all spellers headed for Washington DC for the National Spelling Bee

1276
01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:15.000
spelling bee on June 1st through the third think English spelling is a good

1277
01:22:15.001 --> 01:22:20.001
thing that should be celebrated with spectators and judges inside the Grand

1278
01:22:21.330 --> 01:22:22.980
Hyatt Hotel,
uh,
while,

1279
01:22:23.010 --> 01:22:26.220
while spectators and judges inside the Grand Hyatt Hotel will be pondering the

1280
01:22:26.221 --> 01:22:31.221
spellings of obscure words and admiring the efforts of contestants outside on

1281
01:22:31.381 --> 01:22:32.550
the street.
Some members of

1282
01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:37.260
the American Literacy Council and These Simplified Spelling Society,

1283
01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:40.230
Aka the SSS.

1284
01:22:40.890 --> 01:22:45.890
We'll be trying to convince Passerbuys that the English spelling is a problem

1285
01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:47.070
that needs fixing.

1286
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:52.190
Why are people so fucking dumb?
Okay.
Now that's something.

1287
01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:56.330
If you want to get support,
simplified spelling society,

1288
01:22:56.450 --> 01:23:00.680
you don't go to the fucking nationwide spelling bee with the kids.
Just learned,

1289
01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:02.200
<v 3>okay,</v>

1290
01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:05.800
<v 4>how to spell fucking rheumatoid arthritis or whatever the fuck going to ask
them.</v>

1291
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.540
Have you used it in a sentence?

1292
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:12.310
Your grandmother has rheumatoid arthritis.
Okay.

1293
01:23:12.311 --> 01:23:16.330
That was me.
Tell rheumatoid arthritis.
Isn't that two words?
Um,

1294
01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:18.840
why don't you just go to a bar?

1295
01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:19.890
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1296
01:23:19.890 --> 01:23:23.610
<v 4>You want to get names on that fucking petition.
That's who you're doing it for.</v>

1297
01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.470
The dumb fucks.

1298
01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:29.970
This is the point these people have it said like those in size side.

1299
01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.860
They may admire the efforts of the contestants,

1300
01:23:31.861 --> 01:23:36.780
but they will have signs in sandwich boards with slogans such as I'm through

1301
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:37.740
with,
through.

1302
01:23:39.090 --> 01:23:39.350
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1303
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:43.220
<v 4>In other words,
t,
h,
r,
U.
N.
T.
H.
R.
O.
U.
G.
H.
I'm through with,</v>

1304
01:23:43.221 --> 01:23:47.960
through and enough is enough spelled e,
n,
u.
F.
E,
n.
U.
F,

1305
01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:51.770
and enough is too much spelled e.
N.
O.
U.
G.
H.

1306
01:23:52.930 --> 01:23:56.870
Their aim is to alert parents,
educators,
politicians,
business people,

1307
01:23:56.871 --> 01:24:00.620
and others concerned about the unacceptable level of illiteracy,

1308
01:24:00.650 --> 01:24:05.650
illiteracy among English speakers to the fact that a prime cause for this is

1309
01:24:06.471 --> 01:24:09.500
English spelling.
Do you get it?

1310
01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:15.520
The reason why there's such a high level of illiteracy is not because we

1311
01:24:16.341 --> 01:24:19.370
constantly cut funding to the public schools,

1312
01:24:20.230 --> 01:24:25.230
not because spelling is something that's even fucking stressed by most people

1313
01:24:25.301 --> 01:24:29.230
anymore.
It's because the words are too difficult to spell.

1314
01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:32.890
One of the pickers pickers,
one of the picketers.

1315
01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:35.350
This is hilarious and I can't even fucking read.
I'm part of the problem.

1316
01:24:35.351 --> 01:24:37.900
I might sign these people's petition.
Um,

1317
01:24:37.901 --> 01:24:42.901
one of the picketers at the ALC chair in the SSS member Allen Mole from Boulder,

1318
01:24:43.901 --> 01:24:45.400
Colorado,
put it this way,

1319
01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:51.810
are odd spelling retains words like cough Bo through and though this increases

1320
01:24:53.651 --> 01:24:58.651
illiteracy and crime fix it and you fix a host of problems,

1321
01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:04.740
we want to fix it to this guy is basically saying that the reason why

1322
01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:09.560
<v 5>there's serial killers,
there's people holding up fucking Mcdonald's,</v>

1323
01:25:09.561 --> 01:25:11.000
there's purse snatchers

1324
01:25:12.610 --> 01:25:17.610
and all this type of shit is because cat is not spelled with a k.

1325
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:22.920
You know,
I mean on once side.

1326
01:25:22.921 --> 01:25:26.190
I fucking respect this guy because he actually has a cause.

1327
01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:29.430
He actually got off his couch and said,
you know what?

1328
01:25:29.431 --> 01:25:33.450
I'm going to do something about this.
This is the reverse of what I was trying.

1329
01:25:33.451 --> 01:25:37.770
Maybe that's why.
Let's get smart America bombed on my podcast.

1330
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:43.230
You know,
you guys are waiting for this sss guy to come in here,
you know,
I mean,

1331
01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:46.830
not,
not to be the classic person who goes,
what's going to happen next,

1332
01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:51.930
but what is gonna Happen Next?
Two plus two was like four,
five,
three.
You know,

1333
01:25:51.931 --> 01:25:54.030
as long as you're within one,
we'll give it to you.

1334
01:25:55.810 --> 01:25:57.910
Rounded off to the nearest right answer.

1335
01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:02.770
Learn how to fucking spell your lazy fucks.
That's pathetic.

1336
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:07.640
And I also like how to like the illiteracy illiteracy problem is it,
you know,

1337
01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:10.670
that's the reason why there's fucking crime.
You know,
La,

1338
01:26:10.690 --> 01:26:12.950
I bet those fucking bankers,
you know,

1339
01:26:12.951 --> 01:26:15.890
those bankers are literate and they're great at math.

1340
01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:18.740
They're graded fucking math where it always works out for them.

1341
01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.250
The fucking cunts.
They went till fucking Ivy League schools.

1342
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:29.460
What did I do?
Why did I taper off?
I relieve schools.
Ivy League schools.

1343
01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:33.330
They went to Ivy League fucking schools.
They went to Brown.
They went to Cornell.

1344
01:26:35.790 --> 01:26:40.500
Wentworth.
I Dunno,
that's one for you that,
that did some party fucking,

1345
01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:44.520
uh,
you know,
something that's,
you know,
what killed it?

1346
01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:49.750
What killed it was a,
was cable.
That's the best way.

1347
01:26:49.751 --> 01:26:51.090
That's what really made people dumb.

1348
01:26:52.170 --> 01:26:52.370
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1349
01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:56.780
<v 5>Cable and the Internet.
800 fucking channels.
You know,</v>

1350
01:26:56.781 --> 01:26:57.980
people used to back in the day,

1351
01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:02.780
they used to load up as something called a station wagon.
All right.
First of all,

1352
01:27:02.781 --> 01:27:06.200
everybody had like five fucking kids back in the day.
All right.

1353
01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:08.870
Which was a great thing to do.
You know,

1354
01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:12.290
cause you know a couple of them are going to be fuck ups.
Okay.

1355
01:27:12.291 --> 01:27:14.660
And you can let it go.
You can let it go.

1356
01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:18.380
That's why parents who have only one kid are so fucking over protective

1357
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:22.880
protective is because they went all in world series of poker.

1358
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:25.520
They pushed all their chips and this is their one fucking hope.

1359
01:27:25.521 --> 01:27:29.900
That kid can't be a fucking serial killer.
You have seven,
eight fucking kids.

1360
01:27:29.901 --> 01:27:34.520
You know one of them,
you know
you can handle it.

1361
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.860
You can fucking handle it.
If one of them's a phase,
the black sheep,

1362
01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:44.020
what are you going to do?
You know,
what the fuck are you going to do?

1363
01:27:44.021 --> 01:27:45.580
I mean the guy,
he's a

1364
01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:50.770
transvestite and sometimes pyromaniac.
Huh?

1365
01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:52.780
Anybody remember that line there?

1366
01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:58.200
He met a transvestite and sometimes pyromaniac the greatest line ever uttered on

1367
01:27:58.721 --> 01:28:00.070
the fucking a and e channel,

1368
01:28:00.190 --> 01:28:04.280
possibly in television history when they were talking about these ds for this

1369
01:28:04.490 --> 01:28:08.590
does serial killer tandem,
that's how they described one of the guys.

1370
01:28:09.370 --> 01:28:12.460
One of the guys was just killing somebody on his own and then he had to leave

1371
01:28:12.461 --> 01:28:13.294
town

1372
01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:16.480
<v 4>because the heat was getting too high and he went to a new town,</v>

1373
01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:20.020
hangs out some shady bar and that's where he meets his,
his,
his,

1374
01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:22.750
his serial killer partner.
You know,

1375
01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:25.630
Kinda like what Bill Gates met that other fucking nerd and they made the first

1376
01:28:25.631 --> 01:28:28.300
laptop.
These two serial killers came together

1377
01:28:30.610 --> 01:28:34.210
and to describe his partner,
the,
the fucking that Bill Curtis guy goes there.

1378
01:28:34.570 --> 01:28:37.480
He met a transvestite in sometimes pyromaniac

1379
01:28:39.850 --> 01:28:44.440
<v 5>back in the day people we had station wagons and there was a whole bunch of</v>

1380
01:28:44.441 --> 01:28:48.550
fucking kid.
He didn't have to have a fucking spell and be okay,

1381
01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:52.900
you have a spelling bee because you only have one kid and the kid can't compete

1382
01:28:52.901 --> 01:28:55.660
against himself.
You've got to go with a bunch of other fucking kids.

1383
01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:59.710
Back in the day we had station wagons and they were full of fucking kids.

1384
01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.033
All right.

1385
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:06.330
And you just did drove somewhere and on the way there,
you know

1386
01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.340
you listened to Mitch Miller Oh,

1387
01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:13.960
<v 14>[inaudible] room,</v>

1388
01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:18.410
<v 5>right?
And you fucking,
you said Shit like,
um,</v>

1389
01:29:19.170 --> 01:29:20.810
do you give,
your parents would quiz,

1390
01:29:20.811 --> 01:29:24.890
you were Ivy League schools named the capitals of stuff states,

1391
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:28.010
you know,
that's what the fuck you did.

1392
01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:32.960
And you stopped at a rest area and your dad send you in there by yourself.

1393
01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.660
There was no problem,
there was no worries.

1394
01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:42.120
And you walked in there and some guy exposes himself to you in a not a deal with

1395
01:29:43.731 --> 01:29:48.410
it.
Yeah,
just you're buried it.
He got back in the fucking car and exceed.

1396
01:29:48.610 --> 01:29:53.390
Know you're at a dairy queen,
sort of enjoying the ice cream,
but sorta not.

1397
01:29:57.470 --> 01:30:02.240
That's when America was intelligent.
Back when we used to have like five,

1398
01:30:02.241 --> 01:30:06.460
six kids and you throw them in a fucking station wagon and then you quizzed him

1399
01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:12.070
and as you drove to some poor excuse for a tourist attraction,

1400
01:30:12.710 --> 01:30:17.710
you know you go out to go look at fucking while bill Cody's fucking log cabin.

1401
01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:24.130
You know your dad be sitting there.
See them with anger,

1402
01:30:26.500 --> 01:30:30.310
left arm,
all sunburned from having it hanging out the side fucking window.

1403
01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.260
The rest of them ghost white.

1404
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:39.540
Now was it spelling tests,
quizzes and dairy queen.

1405
01:30:40.230 --> 01:30:45.230
Somewhere along the line it became OMG laughing my fucking ass off all this

1406
01:30:45.931 --> 01:30:49.920
abbreviation.
These people want to turn it into that.
Fuck that man up.

1407
01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:52.770
You pussies learn how to spell goddamn words.

1408
01:30:54.270 --> 01:30:58.020
I did it for a month.
I'm a better speller because it because of it,

1409
01:30:58.230 --> 01:31:01.590
because it I'm not,
I've already forgot.

1410
01:31:02.670 --> 01:31:04.950
I finally conquered the word restaurant though forever.

1411
01:31:04.951 --> 01:31:09.780
I couldn't remember where the you went.
It's rest and then a u.

1413
01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:14.820
which a the you came after.

1414
01:31:15.450 --> 01:31:19.980
Is it [inaudible] or restaurant?
Gretar aunt.

1415
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.210
It's a restaurant.
These fucking people would spell it.
Reg s.

1416
01:31:24.211 --> 01:31:26.910
T r a n t restaurant.

1417
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:31.230
Now know that would still be fucked up.
How do you spell rant?
Douchey.

1418
01:31:32.810 --> 01:31:36.080
You know that's restaurant.
How do I spell that?
Phonetically.

1419
01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:39.650
R E s t.

1420
01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:44.680

Restaurant.

1422
01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:50.850
Let's go to the fucking restaurant.

1423
01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:56.610
I look,
I'm getting so worked up like these guys are actually going to succeed.

1424
01:31:58.590 --> 01:31:59.423
Um,
you know,

1425
01:31:59.670 --> 01:32:02.470
it's like listen to the people down the south when they talk about the South

1426
01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:05.470
Gilner Razah Gan.
Is it,

1427
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:09.640
are you going to secede from the union?
How did that work out the first time?

1428
01:32:11.670 --> 01:32:14.050
Um,
wow.
Look at me.
What,
what is wrong with me?
All right,

1429
01:32:14.051 --> 01:32:18.620
let's get to some youtube videos for the fucking week.
Um,
for the fucking week.

1430
01:32:18.621 --> 01:32:23.320
Listen to me with my tough talk.
Um,
all right,
hang on a second.

1431
01:32:24.190 --> 01:32:28.030
I've got a couple actually really good a drum videos for you guys to watch.

1432
01:32:28.150 --> 01:32:30.580
They're actually hilarious.
Somebody sent me this on my,
uh,

1433
01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:35.940
on my Facebook and the name of this video is this drummer search.

1434
01:32:36.531 --> 01:32:41.290
This,
this drummer is at the wrong gig
and uh,

1435
01:32:41.291 --> 01:32:45.430
it's just a guy where he is fucking it.

1436
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:46.810
This guy is awesome.

1437
01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:52.860
He is performing like it's still 1986 and they are opening for like fucking

1438
01:32:54.881 --> 01:32:58.750
motley crew and he is trying to blow Tommy Lee off the stage.

1439
01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:01.390
That's the way he is performing.
And they are,

1440
01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:06.370
they're playing at like just some fucking banquet and everybody else has,

1441
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:10.780
I'm playing at a banquet energy in this mother fucker is just like,
I don't know.

1442
01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:13.620
I played drums for fucking years and I,

1443
01:33:13.621 --> 01:33:17.710
I would have to slow the video down to try and figure out how the fuck he's

1444
01:33:17.711 --> 01:33:19.570
doing.
Some of the shit

1445
01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:25.300
he does this move with his both his arms.
He looks like he's in a dryer.

1446
01:33:26.170 --> 01:33:29.750
It's the only way to describe it as fucking code is flying around.

1447
01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:33.010
And somehow he never misses a beat.
It's fucking awesome.

1448
01:33:33.130 --> 01:33:37.420
But it looks absolutely ridiculous yet awesome.
You're just check it out.

1449
01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:41.410
All right.
And you can watch all these videos if you don't want to search.
Okay,

1450
01:33:41.411 --> 01:33:44.950
I'll make it easy for you.
Just like the SSS people go to the,
uh,

1451
01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:48.900
the MM podcast.com and uh,

1452
01:33:49.930 --> 01:33:52.120
we'll have all that shit up there for you.
Here's another one.

1453
01:33:52.121 --> 01:33:56.890
Korean drummer rocks out.
Um,
this is actually from a long time ago,

1454
01:33:56.891 --> 01:34:00.790
but this guy is just fucking,
you know,
it's just what,

1455
01:34:00.791 --> 01:34:04.690
what drumming and performing is all about this guy.
He's the shit.

1456
01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:07.510
A lot of times people on the drummer,
I'm sitting behind all these drums.

1457
01:34:07.511 --> 01:34:10.210
No one's going to look at me.
This fucking guy,
you can't not look at him.

1458
01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:14.290
And they got this hot girl singing the song,
you know,

1459
01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:18.190
and he's fucking,
he's starts headbanging and these,
I think this,

1460
01:34:18.191 --> 01:34:22.300
this guy is like headbanging before people knew how to head bang.
Um,

1461
01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:26.800
and is the last thing,
uh,
you can go on youtube and our checkout,

1462
01:34:26.801 --> 01:34:30.010
because I tried to download this album,
it's the first Arrow Smith album,

1463
01:34:30.490 --> 01:34:33.250
which I haven't listened to I think in about 15 years.

1464
01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:38.290
It's such a great album.
It's the one that dream on was initially on.

1465
01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:41.740
That's only like the really the real hit off.

1466
01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:44.820
And they usually play like Mama Ken and stuff in concert,
but they're there.

1467
01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:49.570
They're so fucking,
the album is so like raw and Steven Tyler's voice,
he's,

1468
01:34:49.690 --> 01:34:51.460
he sounds so young and he's just,

1469
01:34:51.850 --> 01:34:56.560
he's right at the beginning of like a few of like his signature ways of phrasing

1470
01:34:56.561 --> 01:35:01.460
and stuff.
And,
uh,
it's just a fucking killer album.
And,

1471
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:06.170
and my favorite song on it is a song called moving out by Aerosmith.
And,

1472
01:35:06.650 --> 01:35:10.610
uh,
it's great though.
It's just the production of it and everything.

1473
01:35:10.611 --> 01:35:11.990
It's just so fucking,
like,

1474
01:35:11.991 --> 01:35:15.770
it just sounded like they scraped their last couple of fucking dimes together

1475
01:35:15.771 --> 01:35:20.090
and put it out.
Um,
and I'm actually going to go to a fucking,

1476
01:35:20.091 --> 01:35:21.530
I'm going to go to a Meebo records today.

1477
01:35:21.530 --> 01:35:23.600
I'm going to fucking buy that album because,
uh,

1478
01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:27.470
I tried to download it on iTunes and they don't have it.
Isn't that a surprise?

1479
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:32.360
Isn't that a fucking surprise?
Um,
I don't know who to blame on that one.

1480
01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:35.690
Is it Aerosmith?
Cause they're like,
well,
I don't like the production of that.

1481
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:37.610
Or we have,
you know,
our two hits.

1482
01:35:37.611 --> 01:35:41.790
I was on like 47 different ever other compilations.
I don't know what,
but I'm,

1483
01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:44.600
I'm,
I'm right now,
I'm going to put some money in those fuckers pockets,

1484
01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:49.240
download that whole album,
go out and buy it.
It's the shit.
They just to shit.

1485
01:35:50.430 --> 01:35:51.630
All right,
so where are we at here?

1486
01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:56.660
42 minutes in almost 43 minutes and I got to cover another fucking seven minutes

1487
01:35:58.440 --> 01:35:59.730
and then I can fucking,
uh,

1488
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:04.770
can upload this fucking thing and get on with my God damn day here.
Oh,

1489
01:36:04.771 --> 01:36:05.101
by the way,

1490
01:36:05.101 --> 01:36:10.101
I'm going to be a Caroline's comedy club this week with a Paul Versey opening up

1491
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:13.620
and in the middle,
young Joe to Rosa,

1492
01:36:14.250 --> 01:36:17.640
the teen idol sensation from the and Anthony Show.

1493
01:36:17.730 --> 01:36:19.620
I know a lot of you out there read teen beats,

1494
01:36:19.621 --> 01:36:23.580
so you're all up on Joe and his latest hairstyle,
but a,

1495
01:36:23.581 --> 01:36:26.100
for those of you not familiar with Joe,
um,
he has,

1496
01:36:26.101 --> 01:36:30.570
he has a wonderful spread coming out in a next next months,
uh,

1497
01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:33.420
teen beat anniversary issue where he's,
uh,
you know,

1498
01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:37.890
he's a swinging on a tire,
you know,
shirtless laying in a field,

1499
01:36:38.490 --> 01:36:43.410
very,
uh,
very Keith Partridge,
Shaun Cassidy,
sort of a photo shoot.
You know,

1500
01:36:43.411 --> 01:36:48.410
it's done a little bit ironic but a,
you know,
there's a lot of heart in it.
Um,

1501
01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:56.170
anyways.
Yeah,
I'm going to be there.
Uh,
what is it?
Thursday,
Friday,
Saturday,
uh,

1502
01:36:56.340 --> 01:37:00.220
Thursday.
June 10th is my birthday by the way.

1503
01:37:01.630 --> 01:37:03.610
Okay,
so,

1504
01:37:03.650 --> 01:37:08.200
and I'm going to spend it on the road like some lonely sailor.

1505
01:37:09.670 --> 01:37:12.850
No,
actually I don't even know why I took the Gig on my birthday.

1506
01:37:12.851 --> 01:37:17.620
I know I did because I owe the tax man.
Yeah,
the tax man.

1507
01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:21.610
I don't know how you get rich in it and I know why people fucking steal from

1508
01:37:21.611 --> 01:37:23.800
people because that's the only way to get over the hump every time.

1509
01:37:23.801 --> 01:37:26.650
I think I'm going to get over the hump and I'm like,
mom,
on fucking easy street.

1510
01:37:26.830 --> 01:37:31.780
The fucking Goddamn IRS shows up,
you know,
gives me the fucking right there.
Fred,

1511
01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:36.100
the right there.
Fred and my fucking nuts right there,
Fred.

1512
01:37:36.490 --> 01:37:40.450
I just made my dog jumps.
Sorry about that dude.
Sorry,
I dare Fred.

1513
01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:44.880
That was actually a catchphrase in my family right there,
Fred,
and what that was.

1514
01:37:45.210 --> 01:37:46.890
That was actually from a Flintstones episode,

1515
01:37:47.730 --> 01:37:51.570
Flintstones episode where Fred was trying to fucking do a,

1516
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:53.070
you guys have had that.

1517
01:37:53.070 --> 01:37:56.940
You ever just have a fucking like catchphrase and your family gets,
you know,

1518
01:37:56.941 --> 01:37:59.670
maybe you guys could send me into those.
I'll,
they'll,
I'll tell you.
One of ours,

1519
01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:03.570
one of ours,
and our family was called right there,
Fred.
Yeah.

1520
01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:06.450
Everything was going great than the two.
Gives me the fucking right there,
Fred.

1521
01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:11.220
And it was from the Flintstones and Fred,
I don't know what he's doing.

1522
01:38:11.490 --> 01:38:15.660
He was trying to impress Wilmoth that he learned how to do magic and he has this

1523
01:38:15.661 --> 01:38:19.530
egg.
Any gene does lean on a couple little dupes.
He dues and he's like,
all right,

1524
01:38:19.531 --> 01:38:22.290
well no,
where is it?
You know,
and he has his,

1525
01:38:22.291 --> 01:38:24.960
he has it like buried in his fist and she goes right there,

1526
01:38:24.961 --> 01:38:26.880
Fred and she fucking pounds.

1527
01:38:27.810 --> 01:38:32.700
She pounded his fist and broke the egg in his hand and exposed,
uh,
you know,

1528
01:38:32.701 --> 01:38:36.490
he thought he was the shit and she made an absolute fool out of him.

1529
01:38:36.970 --> 01:38:40.680
The proverbial yolk on your face,
but it was in his hand.
So that became,

1530
01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:45.660
that began enough.
They became the right there,
Fred and my family.
Anytime like,

1531
01:38:45.661 --> 01:38:48.240
you know,
you think you went in an argument,
you think?
Yeah.

1532
01:38:48.450 --> 01:38:51.720
Is there anything funnier than watching a big dog walk across hardwood floors?

1533
01:38:51.721 --> 01:38:55.080
I swear to God.
You think they're going across a minefield?
Clear.

1534
01:38:56.130 --> 01:38:56.963
What's wrong with you?

1535
01:38:58.580 --> 01:38:59.413
<v 3>Huh?</v>

1536
01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:02.770
<v 5>You don't like walking across what happened to you?</v>

1537
01:39:03.250 --> 01:39:04.660
Did you have a bad experience?

1538
01:39:05.570 --> 01:39:06.403
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1539
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:09.830
<v 5>All they have to say,
I don't have to say like the entire,

1544
01:39:29.710 --> 01:39:34.280
<v 3>you wanna go say

1545
01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:38.990
Cleo,
you want to go inside?

1546
01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:44.370
<v 15>Oh,</v>

1547
01:39:47.460 --> 01:39:50.070
<v 5>oh,
fucking awesome.
Is that if you guys don't have dogs,</v>

1548
01:39:50.071 --> 01:39:53.160
I don't know why you don't have a dog and get a breed that fucking house.

1549
01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:57.740
I make it do that every time.
That was actually just
ah,

1550
01:39:58.110 --> 01:40:02.250
it's just fucking awesome.
Um,
anyways,
let's,
let's plow ahead.

1551
01:40:02.251 --> 01:40:03.910
What the hell was it?
I was talking about catchphrases,

1552
01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:07.760
but I was going to tell you something else.
I don't know.

1553
01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:09.410
I was speaking to my dog.
You know what I,

1554
01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:11.910
the my fucking landlord found out I had a dog.

1555
01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:15.780
Neither my landlord is listening to this podcast or the,

1556
01:40:15.781 --> 01:40:19.740
or the old fuck downstairs ratted me out.
I don't know what,

1557
01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:23.550
but I let it go.
I let it go cause you know,
make,
I have my coats.

1558
01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:27.720
I don't name names and I don't yell at old people.
All right.

1559
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:32.620
I may talk shit about him on my podcast.
Hey,

1560
01:40:32.621 --> 01:40:34.630
remember that crazy lady,
that lady,

1561
01:40:34.660 --> 01:40:37.230
that crazy lady that I was telling you about my neighborhood.
Uh,

1562
01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:42.240
I was driving down the street the other day and I just saw her fucking laying on

1563
01:40:42.291 --> 01:40:45.780
the grass
screaming,

1564
01:40:45.781 --> 01:40:48.750
just fighting off like invisible.
I don't know what,

1565
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:54.340
and uh,
I like,

1566
01:40:54.341 --> 01:40:59.341
I haven't left and I don't know how long it was so fucking funny.

1567
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:03.730
I mean,
I feel bad for her and shit,
but like,
uh,

1568
01:41:04.990 --> 01:41:09.070
are you gonna stand like the street I live on is a quiet street and I'm driving

1569
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.280
down this quiet street in my hybrid,

1570
01:41:13.330 --> 01:41:16.240
which is actually even quieter.
My hybrid,

1571
01:41:16.241 --> 01:41:21.241
the fucking Bose headphones of automobiles and it's just quiet.

1572
01:41:22.451 --> 01:41:25.840
You know,
I got the windows down.
It's the perfect day.
You don't need ac,

1573
01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:30.130
you don't need the windows up.
It's just why you live in California.

1574
01:41:30.131 --> 01:41:33.880
It's just fucking awesome day.
And you know,

1575
01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:36.280
fucking blue sky,
it's just,

1576
01:41:36.281 --> 01:41:40.360
just a beautiful day and I'm just cruising down the street could just got a

1577
01:41:40.361 --> 01:41:43.740
bunch of shit done.
I'm feeling good.
And all of a sudden I just,
I just,
you know,

1578
01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:44.920
as I'm coming up on her,

1579
01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.410
I can't see her because this car's parked in the side of the road.

1580
01:41:47.890 --> 01:41:49.560
I just say this or this faint like,

1581
01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:57.980
and I'm like to the,
you know,
it was so fucking bizarre.
I was like,

1582
01:41:57.981 --> 01:41:58.940
what the fuck is that?

1583
01:41:58.941 --> 01:42:03.941
And then I just like the ends up being like this just for car gap between cars

1584
01:42:05.511 --> 01:42:07.940
parked on the side of the road and I can't see this big SUV.

1585
01:42:08.370 --> 01:42:12.800
And right when I come around the side of it,
there's this crazy lady on her back,

1586
01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:16.580
like a fucking cock roach that can't get out.
She's like,
ah,

1587
01:42:16.690 --> 01:42:19.870
just flailing in slow motion.

1588
01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:22.630
I love Fred Sanford each limb one at a time.

1589
01:42:23.380 --> 01:42:25.300
And it was just so fucking bizarre,

1590
01:42:25.301 --> 01:42:28.750
but she was so committed and she was so into it.

1591
01:42:30.150 --> 01:42:35.110
And so just fighting something off.
It was,
it was just,

1592
01:42:35.170 --> 01:42:38.350
it was fucked.
Like it was so peaceful,
so beautiful.
What a day.

1593
01:42:38.590 --> 01:42:43.590
And all of a sudden I fucking drove by and I just started fucking laughing and

1594
01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:51.710
it was like,
it was just a guilt free laugh.
That was a guilt free left.
You know,

1595
01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:55.940
I didn't feel bad.
I feel bad that she's out there,
but like,

1596
01:42:56.240 --> 01:43:01.100
I like to think that I'm mature enough to know that either way.
That's funny.

1597
01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:05.960
Bright.
Am I a bad person?
I probably am.

1598
01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:09.560
I don't know.
Well that's the podcast for this week.
Everybody.

1599
01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:12.590
I didn't get back to the way that I didn't get back to the flyers.
Uh,

1600
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:16.070
I didn't get back to,
you know,
I'm going to talk right until my phone call comes.

1601
01:43:16.071 --> 01:43:20.150
I got a phone call here at 11,
uh,
which is in four minutes.
Um,

1602
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:26.030
what was I going to say?
I fucking,
uh,
getting back to the flyers and the,

1603
01:43:26.570 --> 01:43:28.250
uh,
the Blackhawks.
Okay.

1604
01:43:28.251 --> 01:43:30.530
It's a great series you guys really should watch right now.

1605
01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:34.940
Black Hawks just went up three,
two.
They are,
they are one game away.

1606
01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:38.480
Slick live little toy.
You know,
they always do that.
Yeah.

1607
01:43:38.970 --> 01:43:42.950
Quality eight months away from the ams in the curse.
Um,

1608
01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:47.840
from ending basically 50 years of frustration for these people.

1609
01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:53.600
Okay.
And,
uh,
you know,
to the fact that they have like,
you know,

1610
01:43:53.601 --> 01:43:54.890
some of the original players,

1611
01:43:54.891 --> 01:43:57.830
they have like five people left from their fucking team that aren't even dead

1612
01:43:57.831 --> 01:44:01.100
yet from the last time that they played.
MMM.

1613
01:44:02.230 --> 01:44:03.670
I'll tell you what's awesome is Bobby Hill.

1614
01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:06.700
Bobby Hill still looks like I can't figure out if he looks like,

1615
01:44:06.701 --> 01:44:09.250
if he'd still beat the shit out of you.
He looks like the comp.

1616
01:44:09.251 --> 01:44:13.150
He's in that weird aging process where he still looks like he could beat the

1617
01:44:13.151 --> 01:44:14.050
shit out of you yet.

1618
01:44:14.051 --> 01:44:18.310
He also looks like he signed the declaration and the Declaration of
independence,

1619
01:44:18.311 --> 01:44:22.220
which would have been hilarious if I didn't fucking stutter.
God Damn it.

1620
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:26.100
I'm dumb.
Um,
so I gotta be honest with you.

1621
01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:29.070
I'm going to be happy for either a free the team.

1622
01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:33.750
It's going to be a shame that one of you guys had got to lose.
And uh,
you know,

1623
01:44:33.810 --> 01:44:38.510
I'm looking forward to more games.
Celtics,
Lakers,
uh,

1624
01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:43.140
got respect for the fucking Lakers,
man.
They're a hell of a squad.
And a,

1625
01:44:43.141 --> 01:44:45.810
I was off.
I was really off.
I've got to say it again.

1626
01:44:45.811 --> 01:44:50.640
I said Pago saw was going to get fucking raped in the NBA finals and uh,

1627
01:44:50.641 --> 01:44:55.420
I'm most impressed with him and Andrew,
uh,
buying them.
Is that his name?
Andrew.

1628
01:44:55.421 --> 01:44:59.080
I'm not a basketball guy.
I'm total bandwagon here.
I'm a fucking hockey guy.

1629
01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:03.890
Um,
for years people have been saying what the fuck this guy's going to do,

1630
01:45:03.891 --> 01:45:06.410
but he keeps hurting his knees and it seems like he's,

1631
01:45:06.411 --> 01:45:09.680
he's coming into his own and I don't know,
man.

1632
01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:13.520
It's going to be tough at the Celtic speed and it's going to be really fucking

1633
01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:18.710
impressive because,
uh,
I think they are younger and they're there quicker,

1634
01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:24.080
but we always find a way,
we find a way to win ugly.
That's what we do.

1635
01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:28.310
So we do.
What about ray ray reining in those threes?

1636
01:45:29.530 --> 01:45:31.210
You know,
and I had the whole game on mute.

1637
01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:35.200
I probably missed a lot of the excitement of listen to the crowd go crazy,

1638
01:45:35.201 --> 01:45:38.110
but I think I don't give a fuck.
That's how I have to do it so I can survive.

1639
01:45:38.770 --> 01:45:42.270
So are they have it?
That is the podcast for this week coming.
Uh,

1640
01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:44.560
come check me out of Caroline's this week in New York City.

1641
01:45:44.561 --> 01:45:47.800
Also next week I'm going to be at the Improv out here in Los Angeles,

1642
01:45:49.100 --> 01:45:53.160
Los Angles [inaudible] and uh,
I haven't put it up yet,
but I haven't.
Um,

1643
01:45:54.150 --> 01:45:58.440
for years people have been asking me to come out to San Diego and a,

1644
01:45:58.441 --> 01:46:01.290
I'm going to be at the La Jolla,
uh,
um,

1645
01:46:01.650 --> 01:46:05.400
comedy store the first weekend in August.

1646
01:46:05.490 --> 01:46:09.690
I don't have the fucking dates in front of me here.
Let me just check the map.

1647
01:46:10.590 --> 01:46:14.310
July,
August are the sixth and seventh.
I'm going to be out there.

1648
01:46:14.311 --> 01:46:16.860
So all you guys out there who've been asking me to come down there,

1649
01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:19.600
I'm finally coming down there.
I hope you show up.
Uh,

1650
01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:22.290

And as far as I know,

1651
01:46:22.450 --> 01:46:24.690

1652

my special become an out on comedy central and then you'll watch it.

1653
01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:29.850
It'd be like,
Oh wow,
that fucking guy's hilarious.

1654
01:46:29.851 --> 01:46:32.380
I'm going to come down to see him in the club and I hit you over the head with

1662
01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:53.400
[inaudible].
