but because there's so much data let me

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310

suggests we are looking at role models
 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.030
suggests we are looking at role models
and how those role models affect

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040
and how those role models affect

role models at home so it takes a family

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590
role models at home so it takes a family
 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.009
role models at home so it takes a family
and role models at the country level it

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019
and role models at the country level it
 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.710
and role models at the country level it
takes a country we operationalize role

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720
takes a country we operationalize role
 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.930

role models as working moms so I'll tell

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940
role models as working moms so I'll tell
 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.220
role models as working moms so I'll tell
you a lot more about the data in a

you a lot more about the data in a
 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.350
you a lot more about the data in a
minute but think about working moms as

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360
minute but think about working moms as

the response to this question did your

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250
the response to this question did your
 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.550
the response to this question did your
mother ever worked outside the home for

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560

paid before you were 14 years old before

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099
paid before you were 14 years old before
 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.690
paid before you were 14 years old before
you're 14 it's ever in whatever way

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700
you're 14 it's ever in whatever way
 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.690
you're 14 it's ever in whatever way
someone might interpret ever so possibly

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700
someone might interpret ever so possibly
 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.100
someone might interpret ever so possibly
someone might interpret ever as a day

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110
someone might interpret ever as a day
 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.050
someone might interpret ever as a day
but it's very unlikely but it doesn't

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060
but it's very unlikely but it doesn't
 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.420
but it's very unlikely but it doesn't
mean that your mom was a full time away

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430
mean that your mom was a full time away
 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.699
mean that your mom was a full time away
from home mom so it's like as we think

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709
from home mom so it's like as we think
 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.860
from home mom so it's like as we think
about it it's a really weak test right

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870
about it it's a really weak test right
 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.240
about it it's a really weak test right
because there's lots of variation on

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250
because there's lots of variation on
 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.430
because there's lots of variation on
this variable and very strong results

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440
this variable and very strong results
 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.099
this variable and very strong results
that I'll show you that at the country

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109
that I'll show you that at the country
 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.569
that I'll show you that at the country
level we're looking at female

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579
level we're looking at female
 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.879
level we're looking at female
parliamentarians and we tried to look at

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889
parliamentarians and we tried to look at
 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.009
parliamentarians and we tried to look at
female heads of state but it turns out

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019
female heads of state but it turns out
 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.629
female heads of state but it turns out
there's just not enough very female

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639
there's just not enough very female
 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.849
there's just not enough very female
heads of state and so we look at the

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859
heads of state and so we look at the
 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.129
heads of state and so we look at the
proportion of female parliamentarians

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139
proportion of female parliamentarians
 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.809
proportion of female parliamentarians
again before you were 14 years old so

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819
again before you were 14 years old so
 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.520
again before you were 14 years old so
averaged across your life between the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530
averaged across your life between the
 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.199
averaged across your life between the
time you are born and 14 years old

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209
time you are born and 14 years old
 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.090
time you are born and 14 years old
what's the proportion of female

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100
what's the proportion of female
 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.979
what's the proportion of female
parliamentarians in your country at that

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989
parliamentarians in your country at that
 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.740
parliamentarians in your country at that
period of time okay so so that's the

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750
period of time okay so so that's the
 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.660
period of time okay so so that's the
non-traditional gender role models of

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670
non-traditional gender role models of
 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.670
non-traditional gender role models of
the country

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680
the country
 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.789
the country
what we find is that for the

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799
what we find is that for the
 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.500
what we find is that for the
non-traditional gender role models at

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510
non-traditional gender role models at
 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.660
non-traditional gender role models at
home these improve women's outcomes in

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670
home these improve women's outcomes in
 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.039
home these improve women's outcomes in
the workplace and I'll give you lots of

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049
the workplace and I'll give you lots of
 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.640
the workplace and I'll give you lots of
details about that and they increase

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650
details about that and they increase
 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.580
details about that and they increase
men's participation at home the flip

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590
men's participation at home the flip
 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.470
men's participation at home the flip
doesn't seem to be as true so it has a

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480
doesn't seem to be as true so it has a
 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.360
doesn't seem to be as true so it has a
working mom has much less effect that's

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370
working mom has much less effect that's
 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.800
working mom has much less effect that's
what women do at home although a little

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810
what women do at home although a little
 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.580
what women do at home although a little
effect and um working moms have their

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590
effect and um working moms have their
 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.350
effect and um working moms have their
little effect on men's outcomes in that

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360
little effect on men's outcomes in that
 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.620
little effect on men's outcomes in that
work so it appears to us to be a true

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630
work so it appears to us to be a true
 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.570
work so it appears to us to be a true
role modeling effect what is it that

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580
role modeling effect what is it that
 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.219
role modeling effect what is it that
women see at home when you see working

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229
women see at home when you see working
 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.930
women see at home when you see working
mom handling things that I'll talk more

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940
mom handling things that I'll talk more
 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.240
mom handling things that I'll talk more
about this and their sons see boys have

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250
about this and their sons see boys have
 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.420
about this and their sons see boys have
much more distributed work at home and

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430
much more distributed work at home and
 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.730
much more distributed work at home and
so start to participate in that at the

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740
so start to participate in that at the
 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.790
so start to participate in that at the
country level the results are somewhat

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800
country level the results are somewhat
 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.129
country level the results are somewhat
weaker and the strongest results have to

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139
weaker and the strongest results have to
 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.960
weaker and the strongest results have to
do with what happens at home so female

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970
do with what happens at home so female
 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.909
do with what happens at home so female
parliamentarians it looks like have some

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919
parliamentarians it looks like have some
 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.249
parliamentarians it looks like have some
negative effects on workplace outcomes

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259
negative effects on workplace outcomes
 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.589
negative effects on workplace outcomes
and then I'll show you those but very

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599
and then I'll show you those but very
 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:02.600
and then I'll show you those but very
positive effects on outcomes at home so

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610
positive effects on outcomes at home so
 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.339
positive effects on outcomes at home so
again it looks like a role-model effect

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349
again it looks like a role-model effect
 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.050
again it looks like a role-model effect
but it's reasonable for men to be

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060
but it's reasonable for men to be
 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.529
but it's reasonable for men to be
participating in activities at home and

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539
participating in activities at home and
 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.360
participating in activities at home and
it's reasonable for women to be sharing

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370
it's reasonable for women to be sharing
 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.640
it's reasonable for women to be sharing
those activities as role model at the

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650
those activities as role model at the
 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.860
those activities as role model at the
country level right so that's the

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870
country level right so that's the
 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.960
country level right so that's the
overall story of what I'm going to tell

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970
overall story of what I'm going to tell
 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.420
overall story of what I'm going to tell
you at all so we were driven to this

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430
you at all so we were driven to this
 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.110
you at all so we were driven to this
research as Victoria talked about we're

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120
research as Victoria talked about we're
 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.500
research as Victoria talked about we're
really thinking about what drives the

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510
really thinking about what drives the
 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.439
really thinking about what drives the
gaps in outcomes between men and women

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449
gaps in outcomes between men and women
 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.170
gaps in outcomes between men and women
and christine lagarde last year said the

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180
and christine lagarde last year said the
 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.120
and christine lagarde last year said the
21st century poses many challenges that

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130
21st century poses many challenges that
 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.460
21st century poses many challenges that
require new way of thinking and she went

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470
require new way of thinking and she went
 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.409
require new way of thinking and she went
on to say that none are more important

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419
on to say that none are more important
 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.340
on to say that none are more important
than the economic role of women image

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350
than the economic role of women image
 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.100
than the economic role of women image
she laid out three areas where the

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110
she laid out three areas where the
 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.400
she laid out three areas where the
economic role of women needs to be

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410
economic role of women needs to be
 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.590
economic role of women needs to be
studied and changed and that is what she

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600
studied and changed and that is what she
 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.690
studied and changed and that is what she
calls a three L's learning labor and

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700
calls a three L's learning labor and
 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.600
calls a three L's learning labor and
leadership as we know from lots of

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610
leadership as we know from lots of
 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.100

recent research women's learning in the

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110
recent research women's learning in the
 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.530
recent research women's learning in the
sense of formal education it's doing

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540
sense of formal education it's doing
 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.870
sense of formal education it's doing
quite well so across the developed

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880
quite well so across the developed
 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.030
quite well so across the developed
countries women actually have more

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040
countries women actually have more
 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.380
countries women actually have more
education than men they do better in

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390
education than men they do better in
 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.510
education than men they do better in
school than men and this goes all the

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520
school than men and this goes all the
 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.150
school than men and this goes all the
way up to the postgraduate levels this

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160
way up to the postgraduate levels this
 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.250
way up to the postgraduate levels this
is much less true in the developing

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260
is much less true in the developing
 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.980
is much less true in the developing
countries so some of you have seen me

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990
countries so some of you have seen me
 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.110

present some work where we're studying

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120
present some work where we're studying
 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.600
present some work where we're studying
education outcomes for girls in Zambia

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610
education outcomes for girls in Zambia
 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.700
education outcomes for girls in Zambia
and looking at the effect of negotiation

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710
and looking at the effect of negotiation
 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.590
and looking at the effect of negotiation
training on this education outcomes in

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600
training on this education outcomes in
 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.800
training on this education outcomes in
the developing world girls still receive

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810
the developing world girls still receive
 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.710
the developing world girls still receive
much less education than boys but in the

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720
much less education than boys but in the
 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.990
much less education than boys but in the
developed countries this is flipped so

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000
developed countries this is flipped so
 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.760
developed countries this is flipped so
we're not going to look at learning from

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770
we're not going to look at learning from
 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.320
we're not going to look at learning from
a traditional perspective but rather

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330
a traditional perspective but rather
 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.360
a traditional perspective but rather
think about what learning goes on in the

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.370
think about what learning goes on in the
 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.100
think about what learning goes on in the
household so again thinking about

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110
household so again thinking about
 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.260
household so again thinking about
learning as a role model effect and then

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270
learning as a role model effect and then
 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.780
learning as a role model effect and then
we'll look at labor in terms of the

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:49.790
we'll look at labor in terms of the
 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.930
we'll look at labor in terms of the
likelihood of employment the like that

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:52.940
likelihood of employment the like that
 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.240
likelihood of employment the like that
earnings that you have relative to

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250
earnings that you have relative to
 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.710
earnings that you have relative to
everyone else in your country if

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720
everyone else in your country if
 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.480
everyone else in your country if
employed and your likelihood of

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490
employed and your likelihood of
 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.730
employed and your likelihood of
supervisory responsibilities is our

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740
supervisory responsibilities is our
 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.380
supervisory responsibilities is our
measure of leadership we also because

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.390
measure of leadership we also because
 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.710
measure of leadership we also because
much research has suggested that if we

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720
much research has suggested that if we
 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.150
much research has suggested that if we
don't change what goes on at home we're

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160
don't change what goes on at home we're
 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.890
don't change what goes on at home we're
never gonna get equal in terms of what

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:11.900
never gonna get equal in terms of what
 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.840
never gonna get equal in terms of what
goes on at work we also look at outcomes

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:13.850
goes on at work we also look at outcomes
 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.480
goes on at work we also look at outcomes
at home so rather than looking at just a

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.490
at home so rather than looking at just a
 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.390
at home so rather than looking at just a
total aggregate hours spent at home we

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400
total aggregate hours spent at home we
 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.130
total aggregate hours spent at home we
look at hours spent and hustle work and

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.140
look at hours spent and hustle work and
 

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.080
look at hours spent and hustle work and
hours spent and family care and it turns

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.090
hours spent and family care and it turns
 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.450
hours spent and family care and it turns
out that these have quite different

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:24.460
out that these have quite different
 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.280
out that these have quite different
effects on earnings so I won't talk

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:27.290
effects on earnings so I won't talk
 

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.310
effects on earnings so I won't talk
about the effects on earnings here but

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:30.320
about the effects on earnings here but
 

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.370
about the effects on earnings here but
just a quickie that how many hours you

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:33.380
just a quickie that how many hours you
 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.570
just a quickie that how many hours you
spend doing housework has a negative

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:36.580
spend doing housework has a negative
 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.490
spend doing housework has a negative
their earnings across all of the

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:38.500
their earnings across all of the
 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.040
their earnings across all of the
countries we study our spent in family

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.050
countries we study our spent in family
 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.559
countries we study our spent in family
care have either no effect or a positive

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:43.569
care have either no effect or a positive
 

00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:46.320
care have either no effect or a positive
effect on earnings and the sunset higher

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:46.330
effect on earnings and the sunset higher
 

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.450
effect on earnings and the sunset higher
earning people tend to spend more hours

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:48.460
earning people tend to spend more hours
 

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.270
earning people tend to spend more hours
and weekend in family care and that may

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.280
and weekend in family care and that may
 

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.929
and weekend in family care and that may
be because they have more hours in so if

00:07:54.929 --> 00:07:54.939
be because they have more hours in so if
 

00:07:54.939 --> 00:07:57.209
be because they have more hours in so if
we think about the differences in income

00:07:57.209 --> 00:07:57.219
we think about the differences in income
 

00:07:57.219 --> 00:08:00.209
we think about the differences in income
I mean explain this graph to you because

00:08:00.209 --> 00:08:00.219
I mean explain this graph to you because
 

00:08:00.219 --> 00:08:02.129
I mean explain this graph to you because
you'll see a few of these so I'm

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:02.139
you'll see a few of these so I'm
 

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:05.249
you'll see a few of these so I'm
studying these effects across 25

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:05.259
studying these effects across 25
 

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:07.649
studying these effects across 25
countries these are data that were

00:08:07.649 --> 00:08:07.659
countries these are data that were
 

00:08:07.659 --> 00:08:09.330
countries these are data that were
provided by the international social

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:09.340
provided by the international social
 

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.850
provided by the international social
studies program that's run out of

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:11.860
studies program that's run out of
 

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.939
studies program that's run out of
Germany the data are collected were

00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:14.949
Germany the data are collected were
 

00:08:14.949 --> 00:08:18.270
Germany the data are collected were
collected in 2002 and in 2012 and

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280
collected in 2002 and in 2012 and
 

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.010
collected in 2002 and in 2012 and
they're collected across about 31

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:20.020
they're collected across about 31
 

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.559
they're collected across about 31
countries we use the 25 countries where

00:08:22.559 --> 00:08:22.569
countries we use the 25 countries where
 

00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:24.209
countries we use the 25 countries where
all of the data that we wanted to look

00:08:24.209 --> 00:08:24.219
all of the data that we wanted to look
 

00:08:24.219 --> 00:08:29.040
all of the data that we wanted to look
at are available for each country we

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:29.050
at are available for each country we
 

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.930
at are available for each country we
look at the differences between male and

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:30.940
look at the differences between male and
 

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.069
look at the differences between male and
female in many of our variables

00:08:34.069 --> 00:08:34.079
female in many of our variables
 

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:36.120
female in many of our variables
sometimes well look at the difference

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.130
sometimes well look at the difference
 

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.769
sometimes well look at the difference
between years sometimes a look at the

00:08:37.769 --> 00:08:37.779
between years sometimes a look at the
 

00:08:37.779 --> 00:08:39.409
between years sometimes a look at the
difference between mother worked and

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:39.419
difference between mother worked and
 

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.000
difference between mother worked and
stay-at-home mom so for each country you

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.010
stay-at-home mom so for each country you
 

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.100
stay-at-home mom so for each country you
often will see two different variables

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:44.110
often will see two different variables
 

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:48.360
often will see two different variables
and then on our y-axis our y-axis is

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:48.370
and then on our y-axis our y-axis is
 

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.490
and then on our y-axis our y-axis is
always explained over here so in this y

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:50.500
always explained over here so in this y
 

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.740
always explained over here so in this y
access what we have is the standardized

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:52.750
access what we have is the standardized
 

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.380
access what we have is the standardized
in poems so it's standardized by country

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:55.390
in poems so it's standardized by country
 

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.540
in poems so it's standardized by country
by year so we take everyone who

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:57.550
by year so we take everyone who
 

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.120
by year so we take everyone who
responded to the survey in that year and

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.130
responded to the survey in that year and
 

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.829
responded to the survey in that year and
we put the mean at zero standard

00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:01.839
we put the mean at zero standard
 

00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:03.930
we put the mean at zero standard
deviation at one and what you see here

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:03.940
deviation at one and what you see here
 

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.769
deviation at one and what you see here
is that for every country for every

00:09:07.769 --> 00:09:07.779
is that for every country for every
 

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:11.800
is that for every country for every
country women may clap

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:11.810
 
 

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:17.230
 
he's got a mind for every country women

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240
he's got a mind for every country women
 

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.710
he's got a mind for every country women
make less that is it's lower so this is

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720
make less that is it's lower so this is
 

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.170
make less that is it's lower so this is
zero is right in the middle parents so

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:23.180
zero is right in the middle parents so
 

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.600
zero is right in the middle parents so
anything below zero is the status below

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:25.610
anything below zero is the status below
 

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.519
anything below zero is the status below
the mean anything above zero is above

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:27.529
the mean anything above zero is above
 

00:09:27.529 --> 00:09:30.429
the mean anything above zero is above
the mean so what we have is women in

00:09:30.429 --> 00:09:30.439
the mean so what we have is women in
 

00:09:30.439 --> 00:09:34.900
the mean so what we have is women in
every country making less than men there

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:34.910
every country making less than men there
 

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.879
every country making less than men there
are some countries where it's more even

00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:36.889
are some countries where it's more even
 

00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:40.900
are some countries where it's more even
than others so in ways that you wouldn't

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:40.910
than others so in ways that you wouldn't
 

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.999
than others so in ways that you wouldn't
be surprised we see in the Slavic

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:43.009
be surprised we see in the Slavic
 

00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:44.949
be surprised we see in the Slavic
countries we don't see women's income

00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:44.959
countries we don't see women's income
 

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.199
countries we don't see women's income
being so much lower than men's but I'm

00:09:47.199 --> 00:09:47.209
being so much lower than men's but I'm
 

00:09:47.209 --> 00:09:49.780
being so much lower than men's but I'm
sorry in the Nordic country countries

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:49.790
sorry in the Nordic country countries
 

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.420
sorry in the Nordic country countries
and we also don't see it as a very low

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:52.430
and we also don't see it as a very low
 

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.519
and we also don't see it as a very low
income country so it tends to be that in

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:54.529
income country so it tends to be that in
 

00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:55.929
income country so it tends to be that in
the real low income countries you don't

00:09:55.929 --> 00:09:55.939
the real low income countries you don't
 

00:09:55.939 --> 00:09:57.699
the real low income countries you don't
get that gap because everybody's making

00:09:57.699 --> 00:09:57.709
get that gap because everybody's making
 

00:09:57.709 --> 00:10:00.369
get that gap because everybody's making
some little so this is what we're trying

00:10:00.369 --> 00:10:00.379
some little so this is what we're trying
 

00:10:00.379 --> 00:10:02.670
some little so this is what we're trying
to explain we do know that gender

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:02.680
to explain we do know that gender
 

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.379
to explain we do know that gender
inequality so we can see between 2002

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:05.389
inequality so we can see between 2002
 

00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:07.600
inequality so we can see between 2002
and 2012 that gender inequality is

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:07.610
and 2012 that gender inequality is
 

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.670
and 2012 that gender inequality is
shrinking but is shrinking somewhat

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680
shrinking but is shrinking somewhat
 

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.629
shrinking but is shrinking somewhat
unevenly so this is that this is just

00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:13.639
unevenly so this is that this is just
 

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:19.240
unevenly so this is that this is just
for women so everything is below zero so

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:19.250
for women so everything is below zero so
 

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.769
for women so everything is below zero so
the zero line is right here so for women

00:10:23.769 --> 00:10:23.779
the zero line is right here so for women
 

00:10:23.779 --> 00:10:26.499
the zero line is right here so for women
you can see that in most countries with

00:10:26.499 --> 00:10:26.509
you can see that in most countries with
 

00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:29.100
you can see that in most countries with
a notable exception being the u.s.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:29.110
a notable exception being the u.s.
 

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.679
a notable exception being the u.s.
women's income relative to the income of

00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:32.689
women's income relative to the income of
 

00:10:32.689 --> 00:10:35.590
women's income relative to the income of
women and men is getting the gap is

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600
women and men is getting the gap is
 

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.329
women and men is getting the gap is
getting smaller

00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:38.339
 
 

00:10:38.339 --> 00:10:41.280
 
so did you see like a different

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:41.290
so did you see like a different
 

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.189
so did you see like a different
differential back of the financial

00:10:44.189 --> 00:10:44.199
differential back of the financial
 

00:10:44.199 --> 00:10:49.370
differential back of the financial
crisis

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:49.380
 
 

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.900
 
yeah so it's a great question I wish we

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:51.910
yeah so it's a great question I wish we
 

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.150
yeah so it's a great question I wish we
could the data are collected only in

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160
could the data are collected only in
 

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.790
could the data are collected only in
2002 and 2012 so for those of you who

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800
2002 and 2012 so for those of you who
 

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.670
2002 and 2012 so for those of you who
don't know is SP data it's fantastic

00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680
don't know is SP data it's fantastic
 

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.560
don't know is SP data it's fantastic
ninis that they collect data every year

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:01.570
ninis that they collect data every year
 

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.200
ninis that they collect data every year
they collected across about 30 countries

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:04.210
they collected across about 30 countries
 

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:06.360
they collected across about 30 countries
every year but what they collect every

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:06.370
every year but what they collect every
 

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.790
every year but what they collect every
year is different so they first started

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800
year is different so they first started
 

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.400
year is different so they first started
collecting the gender related data in

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:13.410
collecting the gender related data in
 

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:18.780
collecting the gender related data in
1988 I collected in 88 94 2002 and 2012

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:18.790
1988 I collected in 88 94 2002 and 2012
 

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.150
1988 I collected in 88 94 2002 and 2012
so we don't have these data infer from

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.160
so we don't have these data infer from
 

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:27.730
so we don't have these data infer from
this data source

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:27.740
 
 

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.290
 
and inequalities are also widespread in

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:32.300
and inequalities are also widespread in
 

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.300
and inequalities are also widespread in
the private sphere so you can think

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:34.310
the private sphere so you can think
 

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.860
the private sphere so you can think
about the public sphere and being the

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:35.870
about the public sphere and being the
 

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.870
about the public sphere and being the
workplace the private sphere being home

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:37.880
workplace the private sphere being home
 

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.130
workplace the private sphere being home
and what we see here are the hours the

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:42.140
and what we see here are the hours the
 

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.370
and what we see here are the hours the
hours spent weekly on household tasks

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:45.380
hours spent weekly on household tasks
 

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.380
hours spent weekly on household tasks
and this goes from zero hours to 40

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:47.390
and this goes from zero hours to 40
 

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.600
and this goes from zero hours to 40
hours a week and what you see is that

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:49.610
hours a week and what you see is that
 

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.450
hours a week and what you see is that
across all of the countries we see women

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:52.460
across all of the countries we see women
 

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.930
across all of the countries we see women
doing more work at home than men do

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:55.940
doing more work at home than men do
 

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.240
doing more work at home than men do
again in the Nordic countries this is

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:58.250
again in the Nordic countries this is
 

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.180
again in the Nordic countries this is
more equal what you also see is it tends

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:01.190
more equal what you also see is it tends
 

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.590
more equal what you also see is it tends
to be that the more developed the

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600
to be that the more developed the

is we looked at a country level and we
 

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.390
is we looked at a country level and we

many hours do women say they spend at
 

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.040
many hours do women say they spend at
home and then men were asked how many

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:28.050
home and then men were asked how many
 

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.990
home and then men were asked how many
hours does your spouse spend and then

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000
hours does your spouse spend and then
 

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.460

who is your spouse spend and what we
 

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.390
who is your spouse spend and what we
found was that women women's reports of

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:38.400
found was that women women's reports of
 

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.740
found was that women women's reports of
men's hours were roughly the same

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:39.750
men's hours were roughly the same
 

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.330
men's hours were roughly the same
they're not significantly different

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:41.340
they're not significantly different
 

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.670
they're not significantly different
men's reports of women's hours were

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680
men's reports of women's hours were
 

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.440
men's reports of women's hours were
significantly different in that women

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:45.450
significantly different in that women
 

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.180
significantly different in that women
were reporting fewer hours of men were

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:47.190
were reporting fewer hours of men were
 

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:50.690
were reporting fewer hours of men were
reporting for their spouses and I've

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:50.700
reporting for their spouses and I've
 

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.460
reporting for their spouses and I've
seen other studies that show men tend to

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:52.470
seen other studies that show men tend to
 

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.680
seen other studies that show men tend to
over report and this isn't a critique

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:54.690
over report and this isn't a critique
 

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.420
over report and this isn't a critique
this is just what the what the data

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:56.430
this is just what the what the data
 

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.090
this is just what the what the data
describes the fact that men tend to over

00:13:59.090 --> 00:13:59.100
describes the fact that men tend to over
 

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.620
describes the fact that men tend to over
report household care and that women

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:00.630
report household care and that women
 

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.210
report household care and that women
tend to underreport their household care

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:02.220
tend to underreport their household care
 

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:06.560
tend to underreport their household care
so that and there's and there's some

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:06.570
so that and there's and there's some
 

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.890
so that and there's and there's some
recent research run 2012 that compared

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:09.900
recent research run 2012 that compared
 

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.810
recent research run 2012 that compared
all of the various ways that you can

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:11.820
all of the various ways that you can
 

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.780
all of the various ways that you can
collect data about household work so

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:14.790
collect data about household work so
 

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.720
collect data about household work so
some of it self report some of its time

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:17.730
some of it self report some of its time
 

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.260
some of it self report some of its time
diaries and it tends to be that across

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:21.270
diaries and it tends to be that across
 

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.670
diaries and it tends to be that across
these methods the numbers are roughly

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680
these methods the numbers are roughly
 

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.870
these methods the numbers are roughly
the same so so it's not it's not perfect

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:25.880
the same so so it's not it's not perfect
 

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.490
the same so so it's not it's not perfect
sure but it's capturing it's pretty good

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:27.500
sure but it's capturing it's pretty good
 

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:34.660
sure but it's capturing it's pretty good
yeah puzzles information yeah great

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:34.670
yeah puzzles information yeah great
 

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.200
yeah puzzles information yeah great
question

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:35.210
question
 

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:39.550
question
so the ISSP every year tries doing does

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.560
so the ISSP every year tries doing does
 

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.550
so the ISSP every year tries doing does
pretty well a stratified random sampling

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560
pretty well a stratified random sampling
 

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.690
pretty well a stratified random sampling
at the country level

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:43.700
at the country level
 

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:47.710
at the country level
so across urban suburban rural across

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:47.720
so across urban suburban rural across
 

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.040
so across urban suburban rural across
income levels across districts and I'll

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:51.050
income levels across districts and I'll
 

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:55.330
income levels across districts and I'll
show you the numbers we have roughly in

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:55.340
show you the numbers we have roughly in
 

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.300
show you the numbers we have roughly in
countries somewhere between 500 and 1500

00:14:58.300 --> 00:14:58.310
countries somewhere between 500 and 1500
 

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.600
countries somewhere between 500 and 1500
per country so no it's not it's not a

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:01.610
per country so no it's not it's not a
 

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:06.130
per country so no it's not it's not a
great number but they try to have it be

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:06.140
great number but they try to have it be
 

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:13.020
great number but they try to have it be
a pretty stratified

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:13.030
 
 

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:17.640
 
so the thesis from which we're working

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:17.650
so the thesis from which we're working
 

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.530
so the thesis from which we're working
is that gender inequality at work cannot

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:19.540
is that gender inequality at work cannot
 

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.980
is that gender inequality at work cannot

providing non-traditional role models
 

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:56.880
providing non-traditional role models
and we explore the association between

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:56.890
and we explore the association between
 

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.920
and we explore the association between
that and outcomes in the public sphere

00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:58.930
that and outcomes in the public sphere
 

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.350
that and outcomes in the public sphere
in the private sphere so our research

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360
in the private sphere so our research
 

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.180
in the private sphere so our research
question is whether and we know this by

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:03.190
question is whether and we know this by

question is whether and we know this by
this point because I told you the answer

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:04.450
this point because I told you the answer
 

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.450
this point because I told you the answer
is on whether it affects employment

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:06.460
is on whether it affects employment

for family members so you can think
about this as our model but this model

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:18.250

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.750
their paper by saying because it seems
to have very little effect on things

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760
to have very little effect on things
 

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.850
to have very little effect on things

the public nature important yeah it's a
 

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.480
the public nature important yeah it's a
great question um so it's both a

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:01.490
great question um so it's both a
 

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.549
great question um so it's both a
question of the practicality of research

00:21:03.549 --> 00:21:03.559
question of the practicality of research
 

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:06.520
question of the practicality of research
and the visibility of the people so so

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:06.530
and the visibility of the people so so

in terms of the practicality of the
 

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.110
in terms of the practicality of the
research it's very hard to get good

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120
research it's very hard to get good
 

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.200

across these industries the other thing
 

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.409
across these industries the other thing
is it's hard to figure out what numbers

00:21:20.409 --> 00:21:20.419
is it's hard to figure out what numbers
 

00:21:20.419 --> 00:21:22.240

again no matter how depressing it is um
but but it was hard for us to come up

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:38.630
but but it was hard for us to come up
 

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:41.350

with an argument about why women CEOs

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360
with an argument about why women CEOs

with an argument about why women CEOs
somehow we're gonna make a difference

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:43.510
somehow we're gonna make a difference
 

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:48.130
somehow we're gonna make a difference
across across all of society you could

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:48.140
across across all of society you could
 

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.990
across across all of society you could
think about things like female

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000
think about things like female
 

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.090

professionals that everybody sees so

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:54.100
professionals that everybody sees so

doctors
 

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.580
doctors
but it's really hard to come up with

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:58.590
but it's really hard to come up with
 

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.980
but it's really hard to come up with
something that's as visible the other

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:00.990
something that's as visible the other
 

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:02.690
something that's as visible the other
difference between these and I think

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:02.700
difference between these and I think
 

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.030
difference between these and I think
it's enticing to your question is this

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:05.040
it's enticing to your question is this
 

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.730
it's enticing to your question is this
is much more immediate

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:07.740
is much more immediate
 

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.210
is much more immediate
alright so mayor's tend to be much

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:11.220
alright so mayor's tend to be much
 

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.000
alright so mayor's tend to be much
better known at a sort of visceral level

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:14.010
better known at a sort of visceral level
 

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:19.460
better known at a sort of visceral level
than people at the national level but

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:19.470
than people at the national level but
 

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:20.990
than people at the national level but
there's very little research out there

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000
there's very little research out there
 

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.720
there's very little research out there
even with this and and actually none

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:23.730
even with this and and actually none
 

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.610
even with this and and actually none
that I know of that looks at it in the

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:25.620
that I know of that looks at it in the
 

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:30.490
that I know of that looks at it in the
private sector

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:30.500
 
 

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:34.460
 
so the way that we think these

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:34.470
so the way that we think these
 

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.890
so the way that we think these
non-traditional role models work is that

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:36.900
non-traditional role models work is that
 

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.780
non-traditional role models work is that
they shape what people think is

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:38.790
they shape what people think is
 

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.990
they shape what people think is
appropriate behavior so if you're if you

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000
appropriate behavior so if you're if you
 

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.870
appropriate behavior so if you're if you
think about different ways of thinking

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880
think about different ways of thinking
 

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.150
think about different ways of thinking
about how gender works you can think

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:47.160
about how gender works you can think
 

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.670
about how gender works you can think
about it outside biological models you

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:49.680
about it outside biological models you
 

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.080
about it outside biological models you
can think about it as a social a

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:51.090
can think about it as a social a
 

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.660
can think about it as a social a
socialization model you can think of it

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:53.670
socialization model you can think of it
 

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.420
socialization model you can think of it
as a pure exposure based model that is

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:56.430
as a pure exposure based model that is
 

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.420
as a pure exposure based model that is
what I see I come to think about and

00:22:59.420 --> 00:22:59.430
what I see I come to think about and
 

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:03.680
what I see I come to think about and
believe as normal so that's the approach

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:03.690
believe as normal so that's the approach
 

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:10.870
believe as normal so that's the approach
we're taking here did this just change

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880
 
 

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:17.210
 
it looks very fancy so so traditional

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:17.220
it looks very fancy so so traditional
 

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.990
it looks very fancy so so traditional
gender attitudes essentially place men

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000
gender attitudes essentially place men
 

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.570
gender attitudes essentially place men
and women in separate spheres so women

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:23.580
and women in separate spheres so women
 

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.940
and women in separate spheres so women
spheres at home and men sphere is in the

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:25.950
spheres at home and men sphere is in the
 

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:28.760
spheres at home and men sphere is in the
workplace and you can contrast that to

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:28.770
workplace and you can contrast that to
 

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:31.400
workplace and you can contrast that to
more egalitarian gender well models

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:31.410
more egalitarian gender well models
 

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:34.610
more egalitarian gender well models
where women and men share the homemaking

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:34.620
where women and men share the homemaking
 

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.570
where women and men share the homemaking
and the workplace roles and of course

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:38.580
and the workplace roles and of course
 

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.670
and the workplace roles and of course
this is a continuum and there are some

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:40.680
this is a continuum and there are some
 

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.160
this is a continuum and there are some
that argue that this is actually not a

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.170
that argue that this is actually not a
 

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.080
that argue that this is actually not a
continuum at all but two separate scales

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.090
continuum at all but two separate scales
 

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.390
continuum at all but two separate scales
we're going to treat it as a continuum

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400
we're going to treat it as a continuum
 

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.460
we're going to treat it as a continuum
it's the way that it was asked and I'll

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:49.470
it's the way that it was asked and I'll
 

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.430
it's the way that it was asked and I'll
tell you a little bit more about but

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440
tell you a little bit more about but
 

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.040
tell you a little bit more about but
about the specific questions I can't

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:55.050
about the specific questions I can't
 

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:56.390
about the specific questions I can't
tell you that it's very hard to find

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400
tell you that it's very hard to find
 

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.940
tell you that it's very hard to find
cute Carty cartoons are not men and

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:10.660
 
there we go so so what we proposed is

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:10.670
there we go so so what we proposed is
 

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:12.790
there we go so so what we proposed is
that the gender role models of the

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:12.800
that the gender role models of the
 

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.140
that the gender role models of the
family are actually going to work

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:14.150
family are actually going to work
 

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:16.420
family are actually going to work
through gender cattitude we'll start

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:16.430
through gender cattitude we'll start
 

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:20.740
through gender cattitude we'll start
with that and go from there

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:20.750
 
 

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:24.700
 
these are the data I think I've talked

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:24.710
these are the data I think I've talked
 

00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:26.140
these are the data I think I've talked
about all of this these are the

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:26.150
about all of this these are the
 

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.270
about all of this these are the
countries so this goes to your question

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:28.280
countries so this goes to your question
 

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.370
countries so this goes to your question
of how many observations so it's not

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:30.380
of how many observations so it's not
 

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.830
of how many observations so it's not
because I carried out every year and a

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840
because I carried out every year and a
 

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.930
because I carried out every year and a
survey these surveys are done in person

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:34.940
survey these surveys are done in person
 

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.270
survey these surveys are done in person
in the household so the sir nays take a

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:37.280
in the household so the sir nays take a
 

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.300
in the household so the sir nays take a
couple hours and they cover lots of

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:40.310
couple hours and they cover lots of
 

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.940

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:43.260
 
in terms of employment you can see a

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:43.270
in terms of employment you can see a
 

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:45.090
in terms of employment you can see a
major difference between men and women

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:45.100

over 80% of men and not quite 70% of
women are employed again this is the

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080
women are employed again this is the

standardized income so men's income is
 

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.710
standardized income so men's income is
generally above the mean women's income

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:55.720
generally above the mean women's income
 

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.330

is generally below the mean with about

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:57.340
is generally below the mean with about
 

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.180
is generally below the mean with about
the same standard deviation in terms of

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:00.190
the same standard deviation in terms of
 

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:02.340
the same standard deviation in terms of
supervisory responsibilities again we

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:02.350
supervisory responsibilities again we
 

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:03.659
supervisory responsibilities again we
get much higher supervisory

00:27:03.659 --> 00:27:03.669
get much higher supervisory
 

00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:05.549

we've been putting in lots more hours of

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:07.720
we've been putting in lots more hours of
 

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.419
we've been putting in lots more hours of
household work and lots more hours of

00:27:09.419 --> 00:27:09.429
household work and lots more hours of
 

00:27:09.429 --> 00:27:12.149
household work and lots more hours of
care so these data are I think as you

00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159
care so these data are I think as you
 

00:27:12.159 --> 00:27:16.860
care so these data are I think as you
would expect and again men and women are

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:16.870
would expect and again men and women are
 

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.450
would expect and again men and women are
significantly different on all of these

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:18.460
significantly different on all of these
 

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.340
significantly different on all of these
so now the question is do the

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:20.350
so now the question is do the
 

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:21.690
so now the question is do the
non-traditional gender role models

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:21.700
non-traditional gender role models
 

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.880
non-traditional gender role models
matter for all of this so we'll first

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:23.890
matter for all of this so we'll first
 

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:25.710
matter for all of this so we'll first
look at gender role models in the family

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:25.720
look at gender role models in the family
 

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.549
look at gender role models in the family
and I'll use this to explain not only

00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:29.559
and I'll use this to explain not only
 

00:27:29.559 --> 00:27:31.260
and I'll use this to explain not only
the outcomes for this but essentially

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:31.270
the outcomes for this but essentially
 

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:32.970
the outcomes for this but essentially
how we looked at the data so I'll go a

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:32.980
how we looked at the data so I'll go a
 

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.260
how we looked at the data so I'll go a
little bit more slowly through this

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:34.270
little bit more slowly through this
 

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.060
little bit more slowly through this
analysis than I will through the rest of

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:36.070
analysis than I will through the rest of
 

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:38.820
analysis than I will through the rest of
the analyses to gender attitudes are

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:38.830
the analyses to gender attitudes are
 

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:42.390
the analyses to gender attitudes are
measured with these 11 questions so some

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:42.400
measured with these 11 questions so some
 

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.610
measured with these 11 questions so some
of them are sort of agree strongly

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:46.620

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:41.540
won't go into those analyses they don't
 

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:48.150
won't go into those analyses they don't
seem to say much different

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:48.160
 
 

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.360
 
so here are the gender attitudes and the

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:51.370
so here are the gender attitudes and the
 

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:55.230
so here are the gender attitudes and the
thing to notice basically is that for

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:55.240
thing to notice basically is that for
 

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.620
thing to notice basically is that for
the most part and again these are these

00:28:58.620 --> 00:28:58.630
the most part and again these are these
 

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:00.840
the most part and again these are these
are z-score sorry these are standardized

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:00.850
are z-score sorry these are standardized
 

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:02.820
are z-score sorry these are standardized
scores because it's a scale and some of

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:02.830
scores because it's a scale and some of
 

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.140
scores because it's a scale and some of
the items of the scale have different

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:04.150
the items of the scale have different
 

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:06.150
the items of the scale have different
measures I'm sorry have different scales

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:06.160
measures I'm sorry have different scales
 

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.350
measures I'm sorry have different scales
and so basically what you see is that

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360
and so basically what you see is that
 

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.230
and so basically what you see is that
women tend to be a little more

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:13.240
women tend to be a little more
 

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.360
women tend to be a little more
egalitarian so higher as more

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:15.370
egalitarian so higher as more
 

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:19.230
egalitarian so higher as more
egalitarian lower is a more traditional

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:19.240
egalitarian lower is a more traditional
 

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.210
egalitarian lower is a more traditional
women tend to be a little bit more

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:21.220
women tend to be a little bit more
 

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:25.230
women tend to be a little bit more
egalitarian than men across most of the

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.240
egalitarian than men across most of the
 

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:33.020
egalitarian than men across most of the
countries average is cross country

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:33.030
 
 

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.510
 
across all yep so it's standardized to

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:36.520
across all yep so it's standardized to
 

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.260
across all yep so it's standardized to
serve around the world

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:40.270
 
 

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:43.390
 
standardized no no I just thought income

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:43.400
standardized no no I just thought income
 

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:47.620

with the dollars yep yep so so hearing

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:50.960
with the dollars yep yep so so hearing
 

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.900
with the dollars yep yep so so hearing
the question this is across all of the

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:52.910
the question this is across all of the
 

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:56.200
the question this is across all of the
data where do these countries fall so

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:56.210
data where do these countries fall so
 

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:58.930
data where do these countries fall so
you can see for example that Norway if

00:29:58.930 --> 00:29:58.940
you can see for example that Norway if
 

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.490
you can see for example that Norway if
you look at it relative to rest of the

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:00.500
you look at it relative to rest of the
 

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.190
you look at it relative to rest of the
world is much more egalitarian and you

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200
world is much more egalitarian and you
 

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.860
world is much more egalitarian and you
can see that Mexico for example is much

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:05.870
can see that Mexico for example is much
 

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:12.080
can see that Mexico for example is much
more traditional

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:12.090
 
 

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:14.669
 
importantly if you just look at the

00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:14.679
importantly if you just look at the
 

00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:16.230
importantly if you just look at the
left-hand side of the graph if you look

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240
left-hand side of the graph if you look
 

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.180
left-hand side of the graph if you look
at male and female you can see that

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:18.190
at male and female you can see that
 

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:20.100
at male and female you can see that
females are much more egalitarian than

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:20.110
females are much more egalitarian than
 

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:23.039
females are much more egalitarian than
males this is the sample of people whose

00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:23.049
males this is the sample of people whose
 

00:30:23.049 --> 00:30:25.799
males this is the sample of people whose
moms stayed at home full-time this is

00:30:25.799 --> 00:30:25.809
moms stayed at home full-time this is
 

00:30:25.809 --> 00:30:27.419
moms stayed at home full-time this is
the sample of people whose moms were

00:30:27.419 --> 00:30:27.429
the sample of people whose moms were
 

00:30:27.429 --> 00:30:29.879
the sample of people whose moms were
employees you can see a whopping

00:30:29.879 --> 00:30:29.889
employees you can see a whopping
 

00:30:29.889 --> 00:30:34.409
employees you can see a whopping
difference here so that even for the men

00:30:34.409 --> 00:30:34.419
difference here so that even for the men
 

00:30:34.419 --> 00:30:37.259
difference here so that even for the men
if your moms employed you have more

00:30:37.259 --> 00:30:37.269
if your moms employed you have more
 

00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:39.240
if your moms employed you have more
egalitarian gender attitudes than women

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:39.250
egalitarian gender attitudes than women
 

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.310

it's a dual earner income household they
 

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:05.549
it's a dual earner income household they
may see an economic benefit from a

may see an economic benefit from a
 

00:31:05.559 --> 00:31:07.620
may see an economic benefit from a
household perspective but there's no

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:07.630
household perspective but there's no

career looking at the economics of it is

00:31:11.759 --> 00:31:11.769
career looking at the economics of it is
 

00:31:11.769 --> 00:31:13.250

that right from what you're doing yep

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:13.260
that right from what you're doing yep
 

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.490
that right from what you're doing yep
that's right

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:14.500
that's right
 

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.310
that's right
yeah there's no there's no harm no gain

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320
yeah there's no there's no harm no gain
 

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.200
yeah there's no there's no harm no gain
right

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:21.210
 
 

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:24.230
 
so you can so this is mom at home and

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240
so you can so this is mom at home and
 

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.270
so you can so this is mom at home and
not employed across the countries and

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:26.280
not employed across the countries and
 

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.830
not employed across the countries and
what you can see is that this holds true

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840
what you can see is that this holds true
 

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.130
what you can see is that this holds true
in every country so for every country if

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.140
in every country so for every country if
 

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.380
in every country so for every country if
your mom was employed before you were 14

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:33.390
your mom was employed before you were 14
 

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.780
your mom was employed before you were 14
you have more egalitarian gender

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:35.790
you have more egalitarian gender
 

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:38.000
you have more egalitarian gender
attitudes so we will control her country

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:38.010
attitudes so we will control her country
 

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:40.250
attitudes so we will control her country
level effects but this is this

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:40.260
level effects but this is this
 

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.290
level effects but this is this
essentially doesn't vary in the country

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:42.300
essentially doesn't vary in the country
 

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.500
essentially doesn't vary in the country
level so the reason I'm showing you all

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:45.510
level so the reason I'm showing you all
 

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:46.880
level so the reason I'm showing you all
these numbers is because I'm doing it

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:46.890
these numbers is because I'm doing it
 

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.630
these numbers is because I'm doing it
just once to show you what I did so that

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:49.640
just once to show you what I did so that
 

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.540
just once to show you what I did so that
so so we ran a mix we've run a mixed

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:53.550
so so we ran a mix we've run a mixed
 

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:57.220
so so we ran a mix we've run a mixed
effects model which means we control for

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:57.230
effects model which means we control for
 

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:01.220
effects model which means we control for
essentially the country level effects in

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:01.230
essentially the country level effects in
 

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:04.160
essentially the country level effects in
the country level women in Parliament so

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:04.170
the country level women in Parliament so
 

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:05.780
the country level women in Parliament so
these are random effects everything here

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:05.790
these are random effects everything here
 

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.400
these are random effects everything here
is fixed effects here the other

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:07.410

terms of gender attitudes what you can

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:14.220
terms of gender attitudes what you can
 

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.820
terms of gender attitudes what you can
see is relative to people who said they

with the exception of Jewish everybody
else is more traditional in terms of

once children come into the household so
it's not about the caring for household

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240
it's not about the caring for household
 

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.090
it's not about the caring for household
our caring for children per se but it

all of the countries gender attitudes

all of the countries gender attitudes

this goes counter to some research that

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:38.070
this goes counter to some research that
 

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:39.830
this goes counter to some research that
suggests that things are stagnating

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840

by working mom important much more
egalitarian gender attitudes so these

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:54.330
egalitarian gender attitudes so these
 

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.210
egalitarian gender attitudes so these
are the kind of analyses will run on

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.220
are the kind of analyses will run on
 

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.980
are the kind of analyses will run on
everything I won't show you the rest of

00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:57.990
everything I won't show you the rest of
 

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:02.529
everything I won't show you the rest of
the regressions

00:34:02.529 --> 00:34:02.539
 
 

00:34:02.539 --> 00:34:03.879
 
so first we're going to look at

00:34:03.879 --> 00:34:03.889
so first we're going to look at
 

00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:05.049
so first we're going to look at
employment and supervisor

00:34:05.049 --> 00:34:05.059
employment and supervisor
 

00:34:05.059 --> 00:34:07.569
employment and supervisor
responsibilities given employment so

00:34:07.569 --> 00:34:07.579
responsibilities given employment so
 

00:34:07.579 --> 00:34:09.039
responsibilities given employment so
this is the likelihood of employment the

00:34:09.039 --> 00:34:09.049
this is the likelihood of employment the
 

00:34:09.049 --> 00:34:10.690
this is the likelihood of employment the
difference between women and men and we

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:10.700
difference between women and men and we
 

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:12.430
difference between women and men and we
see that in most of the countries

00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:12.440
see that in most of the countries
 

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.619
see that in most of the countries
there's some women are less likely to be

00:34:14.619 --> 00:34:14.629
there's some women are less likely to be
 

00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:17.619
there's some women are less likely to be
employed than men again in the more

00:34:17.619 --> 00:34:17.629
employed than men again in the more
 

00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:19.899

egalitarian countries that differences

00:34:19.899 --> 00:34:19.909
egalitarian countries that differences

egalitarian countries that differences
minimize but it's still there so for all

00:34:24.849 --> 00:34:24.859
minimize but it's still there so for all
 

00:34:24.859 --> 00:34:25.930
minimize but it's still there so for all
of these what I'm going to basically

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:25.940
of these what I'm going to basically
 

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:30.190
of these what I'm going to basically
show you is just the the marginal

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.200
show you is just the the marginal
 

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.960
show you is just the the marginal
effects controlling for everything that

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:31.970
effects controlling for everything that
 

00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:33.549
effects controlling for everything that
I just talked about these are the

00:34:33.549 --> 00:34:33.559
I just talked about these are the
 

00:34:33.559 --> 00:34:35.769
I just talked about these are the
marginal effects for having been raised

00:34:35.769 --> 00:34:35.779
marginal effects for having been raised
 

00:34:35.779 --> 00:34:38.349
marginal effects for having been raised
by a working mom so what we can see is

00:34:38.349 --> 00:34:38.359
by a working mom so what we can see is
 

00:34:38.359 --> 00:34:42.879
by a working mom so what we can see is
that if we look at these so that this

00:34:42.879 --> 00:34:42.889
that if we look at these so that this
 

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:45.279
that if we look at these so that this
color really starts so this is a red

00:34:45.279 --> 00:34:45.289
color really starts so this is a red
 

00:34:45.289 --> 00:34:47.529
color really starts so this is a red
line these are females this is a blue

00:34:47.529 --> 00:34:47.539
line these are females this is a blue
 

00:34:47.539 --> 00:34:50.829
line these are females this is a blue
line these are males so for males this

00:34:50.829 --> 00:34:50.839
line these are males so for males this
 

00:34:50.839 --> 00:34:54.039
line these are males so for males this
is a non significant effect but for

00:34:54.039 --> 00:34:54.049
is a non significant effect but for
 

00:34:54.049 --> 00:34:56.139
is a non significant effect but for
females being raised by working mom

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:56.149
females being raised by working mom
 

00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:57.609
females being raised by working mom
controlling for all of those other

00:34:57.609 --> 00:34:57.619
controlling for all of those other
 

00:34:57.619 --> 00:35:00.519
controlling for all of those other
things increases your likelihood of

00:35:00.519 --> 00:35:00.529
things increases your likelihood of
 

00:35:00.529 --> 00:35:05.230
things increases your likelihood of
being employed and all these look like

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:05.240
being employed and all these look like
 

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:10.150
being employed and all these look like
steep lines the effect for some reason

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160
steep lines the effect for some reason
 

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.069
steep lines the effect for some reason
is most significant on females that the

00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079
is most significant on females that the
 

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:19.509
is most significant on females that the
vet being raised in a race at a time

00:35:19.509 --> 00:35:19.519
vet being raised in a race at a time
 

00:35:19.519 --> 00:35:21.249
vet being raised in a race at a time
where there were higher female

00:35:21.249 --> 00:35:21.259
where there were higher female
 

00:35:21.259 --> 00:35:22.839
where there were higher female
parliamentarians increases your

00:35:22.839 --> 00:35:22.849
parliamentarians increases your
 

00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:25.380
parliamentarians increases your
likelihood of employment

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:25.390
likelihood of employment
 

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:30.920
likelihood of employment
Oh even wait

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:30.930
 
 

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:36.510
 
okay so now we look for those people who

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:36.520
okay so now we look for those people who
 

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.990
okay so now we look for those people who
are employed what's the likelihood of

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000
are employed what's the likelihood of
 

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.150
are employed what's the likelihood of
supervising other people at work and

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160
supervising other people at work and
 

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.280
supervising other people at work and
again we see that women are much less

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:44.290
again we see that women are much less
 

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:46.650
again we see that women are much less
likely to supervise than men are across

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:46.660
likely to supervise than men are across
 

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:50.460
likely to supervise than men are across
across all of our countries and again

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:50.470
across all of our countries and again
 

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:52.620
across all of our countries and again
controlling for everything else but we

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:52.630
controlling for everything else but we
 

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:54.660
controlling for everything else but we
again see is that the effect of having a

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:54.670
again see is that the effect of having a
 

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.980
again see is that the effect of having a
working mom is flat for men and in

00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:57.990
working mom is flat for men and in
 

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.510
working mom is flat for men and in
significant and increasing for women so

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:00.520
significant and increasing for women so
 

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.430
significant and increasing for women so
those those who are raised by working

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:02.440
those those who are raised by working
 

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.400
those those who are raised by working
mom are much more likely to supervise

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:05.410
mom are much more likely to supervise
 

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:07.319
mom are much more likely to supervise
others at work than those who were

00:36:07.319 --> 00:36:07.329
others at work than those who were
 

00:36:07.329 --> 00:36:09.720
others at work than those who were
raised by mom who stayed at home the

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:09.730
raised by mom who stayed at home the
 

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:13.049
raised by mom who stayed at home the
effects of the female parliamentarians

00:36:13.049 --> 00:36:13.059
effects of the female parliamentarians
 

00:36:13.059 --> 00:36:17.670
effects of the female parliamentarians
is negative so that the more female

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680
is negative so that the more female
 

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.319
is negative so that the more female
parliamentarians when you were a kid the

00:36:19.319 --> 00:36:19.329
parliamentarians when you were a kid the
 

00:36:19.329 --> 00:36:20.970
parliamentarians when you were a kid the
less likely you are to supervise others

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:20.980
less likely you are to supervise others
 

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:24.380
less likely you are to supervise others
and we're trying to sort out why that is

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:24.390
and we're trying to sort out why that is
 

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:29.089
and we're trying to sort out why that is
so what we see we had this up here

00:36:29.089 --> 00:36:29.099
so what we see we had this up here
 

00:36:29.099 --> 00:36:32.150
so what we see we had this up here
gender attitudes are not meeting

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160
gender attitudes are not meeting
 

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.539
gender attitudes are not meeting
mediating these effects so I don't have

00:36:36.539 --> 00:36:36.549
mediating these effects so I don't have
 

00:36:36.549 --> 00:36:37.859
mediating these effects so I don't have
the regressions in here so I can't show

00:36:37.859 --> 00:36:37.869
the regressions in here so I can't show
 

00:36:37.869 --> 00:36:40.020
the regressions in here so I can't show
you but gender attitudes are always

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:40.030
you but gender attitudes are always
 

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:43.140
you but gender attitudes are always
significant but the effects for working

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:43.150
significant but the effects for working
 

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:44.370
significant but the effects for working
moms and the effect for female

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:44.380
moms and the effect for female
 

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:46.589
moms and the effect for female
parliamentarians stay even after you put

00:36:46.589 --> 00:36:46.599
parliamentarians stay even after you put
 

00:36:46.599 --> 00:36:49.049
parliamentarians stay even after you put
gender attitudes in there so gender

00:36:49.049 --> 00:36:49.059
gender attitudes in there so gender
 

00:36:49.059 --> 00:36:50.819
gender attitudes in there so gender
attitudes are definitely affected by

00:36:50.819 --> 00:36:50.829
attitudes are definitely affected by
 

00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:52.920
attitudes are definitely affected by
being raised by a working mom but that

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:52.930
being raised by a working mom but that
 

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.140
being raised by a working mom but that
is not the full effect it seems that

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:55.150
is not the full effect it seems that
 

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:57.539
is not the full effect it seems that
there is some kind of modeling going on

00:36:57.539 --> 00:36:57.549
there is some kind of modeling going on
 

00:36:57.549 --> 00:36:59.490
there is some kind of modeling going on
I don't just change that what I believe

00:36:59.490 --> 00:36:59.500
I don't just change that what I believe
 

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.220
I don't just change that what I believe
I change what I know and what I know to

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:02.230
I change what I know and what I know to
 

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:04.859
I change what I know and what I know to
do so there's some sort of skill based

00:37:04.859 --> 00:37:04.869
do so there's some sort of skill based
 

00:37:04.869 --> 00:37:06.190
do so there's some sort of skill based
thing that we think is

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.200
thing that we think is
 

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.020
thing that we think is
on here so there's a direct effect of

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:08.030
on here so there's a direct effect of
 

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:10.000
on here so there's a direct effect of
gender attitudes and a direct effect of

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:10.010
gender attitudes and a direct effect of
 

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:13.450
gender attitudes and a direct effect of
the gender role models now if we look at

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:13.460
the gender role models now if we look at
 

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:15.820
the gender role models now if we look at
income you've seen this number and what

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:15.830
income you've seen this number and what
 

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:17.530
income you've seen this number and what
we see is that being raised by a working

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:17.540
we see is that being raised by a working
 

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.050
we see is that being raised by a working
mom again has no effect on men's income

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:20.060
mom again has no effect on men's income
 

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:22.990
mom again has no effect on men's income
and it increases women's income this is

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:23.000
and it increases women's income this is
 

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.820
and it increases women's income this is
a little bit lower than the significance

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:24.830
a little bit lower than the significance
 

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:26.050
a little bit lower than the significance
level that we've seen on other things

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:26.060
level that we've seen on other things
 

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:30.040
level that we've seen on other things
point zero nine this effect is mediated

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:30.050
point zero nine this effect is mediated
 

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:32.920
point zero nine this effect is mediated
by gender attitudes so if you take

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:32.930
by gender attitudes so if you take
 

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:34.660
by gender attitudes so if you take
gender attitudes out of the equation

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:34.670
gender attitudes out of the equation
 

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:36.220
gender attitudes out of the equation
this is a whopping least deep effect

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:36.230
this is a whopping least deep effect
 

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.800
this is a whopping least deep effect
once you put gender attitudes in the

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:38.810
once you put gender attitudes in the
 

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:40.410
once you put gender attitudes in the
effect for working mom remains

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:40.420
effect for working mom remains
 

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.730
effect for working mom remains
insignificant but not significant at the

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:42.740

statistically significant effects so if

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:53.270
statistically significant effects so if
 

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:59.800
statistically significant effects so if
I just run it only on single single

00:37:59.800 --> 00:37:59.810
I just run it only on single single
 

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:03.670
I just run it only on single single
female head of household I can run

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680
female head of household I can run
 

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.780
female head of household I can run
whatever

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:07.790
 
 

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:12.330
 
I think that could be interesting

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:12.340
 
 

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:14.250
 
in some countries I won't have enough

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:14.260
in some countries I won't have enough
 

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.720
in some countries I won't have enough
data but I can pull out just those

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:15.730
data but I can pull out just those
 

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:21.550
data but I can pull out just those
countries that have enough data I can do

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:21.560
 
 

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:26.650
 
what's your hypothesis that's the kind

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:26.660
what's your hypothesis that's the kind
 

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:29.230
what's your hypothesis that's the kind
of thing I would wanted before I would

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:29.240
of thing I would wanted before I would
 

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.810
of thing I would wanted before I would
be careful of making a narrative and a

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:31.820
be careful of making a narrative and a
 

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.850
be careful of making a narrative and a
story before I saw if there was data

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:33.860
story before I saw if there was data
 

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.200
story before I saw if there was data
that supports there's a narrative her

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:35.210
that supports there's a narrative her
 

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:37.810
that supports there's a narrative her
story so in my mind I would try to not

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:37.820
story so in my mind I would try to not
 

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:41.260
story so in my mind I would try to not
think too much in advance on that but

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:41.270
think too much in advance on that but
 

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:42.700
think too much in advance on that but
couple effects when I think about

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:42.710
couple effects when I think about
 

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:46.390
couple effects when I think about
looking at wage data for example when we

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400
looking at wage data for example when we
 

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:49.920
looking at wage data for example when we
looked at the countries and attitudes

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:49.930
looked at the countries and attitudes
 

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:52.870
looked at the countries and attitudes
interesting to see the US as attitudes

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880
interesting to see the US as attitudes
 

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.610
interesting to see the US as attitudes
compared to other countries for example

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:54.620
compared to other countries for example
 

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:58.420
compared to other countries for example
and looking at attitudes and wages since

00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:58.430
and looking at attitudes and wages since
 

00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:59.770
and looking at attitudes and wages since
I spent a lot of my time focusing on

00:38:59.770 --> 00:38:59.780
I spent a lot of my time focusing on
 

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:03.340
I spent a lot of my time focusing on
wages we now know that every major city

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:03.350
wages we now know that every major city
 

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:04.960
wages we now know that every major city
in the US is or will be

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:04.970
in the US is or will be
 

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:08.470
in the US is or will be
majority-minority for example and what

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480
majority-minority for example and what
 

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.300
majority-minority for example and what
we also know is that single female head

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:10.310
we also know is that single female head
 

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:14.500
we also know is that single female head
of household with children is huge it's

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:14.510
of household with children is huge it's
 

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:16.960
of household with children is huge it's
for example Boston proportion of yeah

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:16.970
for example Boston proportion of yeah
 

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:20.140
for example Boston proportion of yeah
most children of Boston will grow up in

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:20.150
most children of Boston will grow up in
 

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.360
most children of Boston will grow up in
single female head of household and if

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:22.370
single female head of household and if
 

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:25.810
single female head of household and if
we're looking at what and you're saying

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:25.820
we're looking at what and you're saying
 

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:28.950
we're looking at what and you're saying
there is an effect on whether or not

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960
there is an effect on whether or not
 

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.560
there is an effect on whether or not
there's a gala tearing values well if

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:32.570
there's a gala tearing values well if
 

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.360
there's a gala tearing values well if
the woman by definition is the

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:34.370
the woman by definition is the
 

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:38.440
the woman by definition is the
breadwinner and the caretaker right then

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:38.450
breadwinner and the caretaker right then
 

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:40.180
breadwinner and the caretaker right then
in essence it's no longer about whether

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:40.190
in essence it's no longer about whether
 

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:42.070
in essence it's no longer about whether
or not it's viewed as equal it's really

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:42.080
or not it's viewed as equal it's really
 

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.130
or not it's viewed as equal it's really
viewed as only only and how can she

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:45.140
viewed as only only and how can she
 

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:48.790
viewed as only only and how can she
handle it so I think what the what what

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800
handle it so I think what the what what
 

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.090
handle it so I think what the what what
we see beyond gender attitudes is not

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:52.100
we see beyond gender attitudes is not
 

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.160
we see beyond gender attitudes is not
about beliefs in equality but rather

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:54.170
about beliefs in equality but rather
 

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:55.630
about beliefs in equality but rather
about figuring out how to

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640
about figuring out how to
 

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:58.279
about figuring out how to
alright so if your mom worked when you

00:39:58.279 --> 00:39:58.289
alright so if your mom worked when you
 

00:39:58.289 --> 00:40:00.709
alright so if your mom worked when you
were a kid you see how she does it I

00:40:00.709 --> 00:40:00.719
were a kid you see how she does it I
 

00:40:00.719 --> 00:40:01.759
were a kid you see how she does it I
know what brought it to mind as he

00:40:01.759 --> 00:40:01.769
know what brought it to mind as he
 

00:40:01.769 --> 00:40:03.259
know what brought it to mind as he
talked about skill building effects

00:40:03.259 --> 00:40:03.269
talked about skill building effects
 

00:40:03.269 --> 00:40:06.140
talked about skill building effects
right and children who grow up in

right and children who grow up in
 

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:10.390
right and children who grow up in
households I presume with one parent and

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400
households I presume with one parent and
 

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.339
households I presume with one parent and
a single female head of household to

a single female head of household to
 

00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:14.929
a single female head of household to
some extent I'm gonna presume there's

00:40:14.929 --> 00:40:14.939
some extent I'm gonna presume there's
 

00:40:14.939 --> 00:40:16.640
some extent I'm gonna presume there's
skill building and competency taking

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:16.650
skill building and competency taking
 

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:18.650
skill building and competency taking
place for the children and then you can

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:18.660
place for the children and then you can
 

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:21.559
place for the children and then you can
map it on to anecdotal things like you

00:40:21.559 --> 00:40:21.569
map it on to anecdotal things like you
 

00:40:21.569 --> 00:40:23.900
map it on to anecdotal things like you
know past two Democratic presidents have

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:23.910
know past two Democratic presidents have
 

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:26.870
know past two Democratic presidents have
both been male grow up in single female

head of household both had to develop a

head of household both had to develop a
 

00:40:29.699 --> 00:40:31.249
head of household both had to develop a
skill set where they could both be

skill set where they could both be
 

00:40:31.259 --> 00:40:32.900
skill set where they could both be
personable they could be effective in

personable they could be effective in
 

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:36.589
personable they could be effective in
school they both had some effect of

00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599
school they both had some effect of
 

00:40:36.599 --> 00:40:38.719
school they both had some effect of
idolizing the mother and therefore that

00:40:38.719 --> 00:40:38.729
idolizing the mother and therefore that
 

00:40:38.729 --> 00:40:41.329
idolizing the mother and therefore that

do we create male leaders who have a

do we create male leaders who have a

equality policy yes so that's what's

00:40:57.499 --> 00:40:57.509
equality policy yes so that's what's
 

00:40:57.509 --> 00:40:59.169
equality policy yes so that's what's
running out there my mind these

00:40:59.169 --> 00:40:59.179
running out there my mind these
 

00:40:59.179 --> 00:41:02.630
running out there my mind these
respondents mothers were single head of

respondents mothers were single head of
 

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.179
respondents mothers were single head of
household we have whether the

00:41:05.179 --> 00:41:05.189
household we have whether the
 

00:41:05.189 --> 00:41:07.189
household we have whether the
respondents are Seminole head of

00:41:07.189 --> 00:41:07.199
respondents are Seminole head of
 

00:41:07.199 --> 00:41:09.469
respondents are Seminole head of
household so I can see whether the

00:41:09.469 --> 00:41:09.479
household so I can see whether the
 

00:41:09.479 --> 00:41:11.299
household so I can see whether the
effect of being raised by working mom is

00:41:11.299 --> 00:41:11.309
effect of being raised by working mom is
 

00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:14.420
effect of being raised by working mom is
different for women who are in

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:14.430
different for women who are in
 

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:18.040

two two parents one but I can't see
 

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:29.650
two two parents one but I can't see
whether you were raised by a single mom

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:29.660
 
 

00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:32.569
 
in terms of gender any I'm sorry in

00:41:32.569 --> 00:41:32.579
in terms of gender any I'm sorry in
 

00:41:32.579 --> 00:41:34.940
in terms of gender any I'm sorry in
terms of income inequality what we see

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:34.950
terms of income inequality what we see
 

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:37.809
terms of income inequality what we see
is that for both men and for women and

00:41:37.809 --> 00:41:37.819
is that for both men and for women and
 

00:41:37.819 --> 00:41:39.890
is that for both men and for women and
the proportion of female

is associated with lower earnings and
 

00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:47.240
is associated with lower earnings and
again we're trying to figure out what

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:47.250
again we're trying to figure out what
 

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:52.819
again we're trying to figure out what
that is so what we see is again direct

00:41:52.819 --> 00:41:52.829
that is so what we see is again direct
 

00:41:52.829 --> 00:41:54.290
that is so what we see is again direct

at home for earnings only is mediated
 

00:42:13.619 --> 00:42:19.190
at home for earnings only is mediated
partially by the gender attitudes

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200
 
 

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.690
 
you couldn't quite explain about having

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:20.700
you couldn't quite explain about having
 

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.460
you couldn't quite explain about having
more female parliamentarian and lower

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:22.470
more female parliamentarian and lower
 

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:24.470
more female parliamentarian and lower
earning I mean I don't know the data for

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480
earning I mean I don't know the data for
 

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.079
earning I mean I don't know the data for
what this cohort was 14 and younger but

00:42:27.079 --> 00:42:27.089
what this cohort was 14 and younger but
 

00:42:27.089 --> 00:42:28.970
what this cohort was 14 and younger but
if you look today at the IPU data of who

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:28.980
if you look today at the IPU data of who
 

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.770
if you look today at the IPU data of who
has the highest proportions there's a

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:30.780
has the highest proportions there's a
 

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:33.109
has the highest proportions there's a
lot of really low income countries in

00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119
lot of really low income countries in
 

00:42:33.119 --> 00:42:34.609
lot of really low income countries in
there and I wonder if it's a correlation

00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:34.619
there and I wonder if it's a correlation
 

00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:37.430
there and I wonder if it's a correlation
right what exactly is the use that

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440
right what exactly is the use that
 

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:41.120
right what exactly is the use that
compared with in country or is that

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:41.130
compared with in country or is that
 

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:45.380
compared with in country or is that
comparative to the mean of yeah so what

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:45.390
comparative to the mean of yeah so what
 

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:49.400
comparative to the mean of yeah so what
we do is so we have the random effects

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:49.410
we do is so we have the random effects
 

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:51.170
we do is so we have the random effects
for country we have the random effects

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:51.180
for country we have the random effects
 

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.910
for country we have the random effects
no female parliamentarians at the

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920
no female parliamentarians at the
 

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.849
no female parliamentarians at the
country level at the current level of

country level at the current level of
 

00:42:55.859 --> 00:42:58.609
country level at the current level of
female parliamentarians and then we

00:42:58.609 --> 00:42:58.619
female parliamentarians and then we
 

00:42:58.619 --> 00:43:01.310
female parliamentarians and then we
allow individual fixed effects but

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:01.320
allow individual fixed effects but
 

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.990
allow individual fixed effects but
female parliamentarians when you were a

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:03.000
female parliamentarians when you were a
 

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.480
female parliamentarians when you were a
kid okay but there is but I completely

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:05.490
kid okay but there is but I completely
 

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:06.980
kid okay but there is but I completely
agree with you that there is something

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:06.990
agree with you that there is something
 

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:10.670
agree with you that there is something
going on it's within country or is it

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680
going on it's within country or is it
 

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.349
going on it's within country or is it
between you know it cuz it's across

00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359
between you know it cuz it's across
 

00:43:12.359 --> 00:43:15.560
between you know it cuz it's across

effects of current level of female

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:17.790
effects of current level of female
 

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:19.670
effects of current level of female
parliamentarians but I think what we

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680
parliamentarians but I think what we
 

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.930
parliamentarians but I think what we
need to do and I think this is what

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:20.940
need to do and I think this is what
 

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.310
need to do and I think this is what
you're alluding to there are more

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:22.320
you're alluding to there are more
 

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.099
you're alluding to there are more
parliamentarians or female and nations

00:43:25.099 --> 00:43:25.109
parliamentarians or female and nations
 

00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:28.910
parliamentarians or female and nations
were the barriers to entry and that this

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920
were the barriers to entry and that this
 

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.160
were the barriers to entry and that this
is so much skewed now by quotas but

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:31.170
is so much skewed now by quotas but
 

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:35.240
is so much skewed now by quotas but
where the Parliament is part-time or

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:35.250
where the Parliament is part-time or
 

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:37.490
where the Parliament is part-time or
underpaid or low status which usually

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:37.500
underpaid or low status which usually
 

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:40.790
underpaid or low status which usually
means poor economy yes I'm only gonna do

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800
means poor economy yes I'm only gonna do
 

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.650
means poor economy yes I'm only gonna do
with that and what we haven't put in yet

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660
with that and what we haven't put in yet
 

00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:46.339
with that and what we haven't put in yet
but we're going to put in essentially

00:43:46.339 --> 00:43:46.349
but we're going to put in essentially
 

00:43:46.349 --> 00:43:48.980
but we're going to put in essentially
gender inequality indeed yours

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:48.990
gender inequality indeed yours
 

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:51.380
gender inequality indeed yours
to your level so we just got all those

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:51.390
to your level so we just got all those
 

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:54.440
to your level so we just got all those
data from separate data sets so so we're

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:54.450
data from separate data sets so so we're
 

00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:55.580
data from separate data sets so so we're
trying to figure out whether we should

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:55.590
trying to figure out whether we should
 

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:58.070
trying to figure out whether we should
put gender inequality data at the time

00:43:58.070 --> 00:43:58.080
put gender inequality data at the time
 

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.650
put gender inequality data at the time
you were under 14 or in the current time

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660
you were under 14 or in the current time
 

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.870
you were under 14 or in the current time
you might try might try both but I

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880
you might try might try both but I
 

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.250
you might try might try both but I
completely agree with you that there's

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:04.260
completely agree with you that there's
 

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:06.370
completely agree with you that there's
something like that going on there

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:06.380
something like that going on there
 

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.800
something like that going on there
so if we think about gender inequality

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:09.810
so if we think about gender inequality
 

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:11.450
so if we think about gender inequality
in the private sphere we know that it's

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:11.460
in the private sphere we know that it's
 

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.790
in the private sphere we know that it's
affected by gender inequality in I'm

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800
affected by gender inequality in I'm
 

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.350
affected by gender inequality in I'm
sorry generating quality in the public

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:15.360
sorry generating quality in the public
 

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.850
sorry generating quality in the public
sphere we know it's affected by gender

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:16.860
sphere we know it's affected by gender
 

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.830
sphere we know it's affected by gender
inequality in the private sphere so

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:18.840
inequality in the private sphere so
 

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.230
inequality in the private sphere so

this as a two-level game that your

what's happening at home gender

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:32.580
what's happening at home gender

and then back again what's happening at

and then back again what's happening at
 

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:37.220
and then back again what's happening at
work gender attitudes and what's

work gender attitudes and what's
 

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:39.020
work gender attitudes and what's
happening at home and we're going to try

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:39.030
happening at home and we're going to try
 

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:41.960
happening at home and we're going to try
to tease this out and separate out work

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:41.970
to tease this out and separate out work
 

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:45.650
to tease this out and separate out work

household work has quite a bit of
 

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.760
household work has quite a bit of
research around it that the earliest

research around it that the earliest
 

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:53.060

research was based on Becker's model

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:53.070
research was based on Becker's model

their individual preferences that aren't
 

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:13.490
their individual preferences that aren't
necessarily all aligned at the household

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:13.500
necessarily all aligned at the household
 

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:16.490
necessarily all aligned at the household
level and so more recent models allow

level and so more recent models allow
 

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.279

relative resources and time availability

00:45:27.099 --> 00:45:27.109
relative resources and time availability
 

00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:30.669
relative resources and time availability
have big effects on how the allocation

00:45:30.669 --> 00:45:30.679
have big effects on how the allocation
 

00:45:30.679 --> 00:45:33.130
have big effects on how the allocation
of household work is determined and so

we have a separate paper where we're

we have a separate paper where we're
 

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:35.739
we have a separate paper where we're
looking at that as well

00:45:35.739 --> 00:45:35.749
looking at that as well
 

00:45:35.749 --> 00:45:38.739
looking at that as well
these things have relative resources and

00:45:38.739 --> 00:45:38.749
these things have relative resources and
 

00:45:38.749 --> 00:45:40.569
these things have relative resources and

also quite a bit of work that shows that

understandings of roles and so I think

00:46:16.749 --> 00:46:16.759
understandings of roles and so I think

it's a a very important place to study

00:46:20.739 --> 00:46:20.749
it's a a very important place to study
 

00:46:20.749 --> 00:46:22.539
it's a a very important place to study
even though we don't think of it

00:46:22.539 --> 00:46:22.549
even though we don't think of it
 

00:46:22.549 --> 00:46:24.640
even though we don't think of it
necessarily as a place of economic

being raised by a working mom and so

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:32.080
being raised by a working mom and so
 

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:34.320
being raised by a working mom and so
here we start to see this interactive

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:34.330
here we start to see this interactive
 

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:36.900
here we start to see this interactive
interaction effect so for women being

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:36.910
interaction effect so for women being
 

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:38.850
interaction effect so for women being
raised by working mom reduces the number

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:38.860
raised by working mom reduces the number
 

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:42.120
raised by working mom reduces the number
of hours you spend in household work it

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:42.130
of hours you spend in household work it
 

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:45.480
of hours you spend in household work it
increases the number of hours that men

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:45.490
increases the number of hours that men
 

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:49.680
increases the number of hours that men
spend in household work and these

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:49.690
spend in household work and these
 

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:52.440
spend in household work and these
effects also hold for female

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:52.450
effects also hold for female
 

00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:55.050
effects also hold for female
parliamentarians so for men who were

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:55.060
parliamentarians so for men who were
 

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:57.080
parliamentarians so for men who were
raised in countries where there were

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:57.090
raised in countries where there were
 

00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:59.580
raised in countries where there were
more female proletarians when they were

00:46:59.580 --> 00:46:59.590
more female proletarians when they were
 

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:01.320
more female proletarians when they were
kids they tend to do more hours of

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:01.330
kids they tend to do more hours of
 

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:04.200
kids they tend to do more hours of
household work women fewer hours of

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:04.210
household work women fewer hours of
 

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:09.540
household work women fewer hours of
household work caring for family members

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:09.550
household work caring for family members
 

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:11.670
household work caring for family members
is actually quite different so if you

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680
is actually quite different so if you
 

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.850
is actually quite different so if you
think about the economic explanations

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:14.860
think about the economic explanations
 

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:18.540
think about the economic explanations
they hold for housework and for care

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:18.550
they hold for housework and for care
 

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:21.000
they hold for housework and for care
work but there's very different cultural

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:21.010
work but there's very different cultural
 

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:23.400
work but there's very different cultural
expectations about caring for family

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:23.410
expectations about caring for family
 

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:25.830
expectations about caring for family
members and so we can if we think about

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:25.840
members and so we can if we think about
 

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.570
members and so we can if we think about
separating these apart we can think

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:27.580
separating these apart we can think
 

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:29.130
separating these apart we can think
about a number of reasons why we would

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:29.140
about a number of reasons why we would
 

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.560
about a number of reasons why we would
expect different effects and eat within

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:31.570
expect different effects and eat within
 

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:35.490
expect different effects and eat within
each country unlike household work hours

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:35.500
each country unlike household work hours
 

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.690
each country unlike household work hours
and family care actually increasing and

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:38.700
and family care actually increasing and
 

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:42.150
and family care actually increasing and
this this looks to be true across most

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160
this this looks to be true across most
 

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:44.070
this this looks to be true across most
of the countries that we study and this

00:47:44.070 --> 00:47:44.080
of the countries that we study and this
 

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.570
of the countries that we study and this
is in spite of the fact that there's

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:45.580
is in spite of the fact that there's
 

00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:48.480
is in spite of the fact that there's
many fewer kids per household than there

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:48.490
many fewer kids per household than there
 

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:50.280
many fewer kids per household than there
were a couple decades ago it's

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:50.290
were a couple decades ago it's
 

00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:54.110
were a couple decades ago it's
increasing Provo's women and for men and

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:54.120
increasing Provo's women and for men and
 

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.880
increasing Provo's women and for men and
the increase for men is substantially

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:56.890
the increase for men is substantially
 

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:58.860
the increase for men is substantially
bigger than the increase for women so

00:47:58.860 --> 00:47:58.870
bigger than the increase for women so
 

00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:00.090
bigger than the increase for women so
with household work it's going the

00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:00.100
with household work it's going the
 

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.830
with household work it's going the
opposite way men are doing more women

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:01.840
opposite way men are doing more women
 

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:02.070
opposite way men are doing more women
are

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:02.080
are
 

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.280
are
less and women are doing much less than

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:05.290
less and women are doing much less than
 

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:07.110
less and women are doing much less than
men are doing more but that's because we

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:07.120
men are doing more but that's because we
 

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:08.670
men are doing more but that's because we
have half that we have sort of labor

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:08.680
have half that we have sort of labor
 

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.820
have half that we have sort of labor
saving devices coming in but for house

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:11.830
saving devices coming in but for house
 

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:23.250
saving devices coming in but for house
for care both people are doing more it

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:23.260
for care both people are doing more it
 

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:26.400
for care both people are doing more it
does so so the question is how many

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:26.410
does so so the question is how many
 

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:28.260
does so so the question is how many
hours a week do you spend caring for

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:28.270
hours a week do you spend caring for
 

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:30.630
hours a week do you spend caring for
family members we cannot differentiate

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640
family members we cannot differentiate
 

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:36.630
family members we cannot differentiate
between aging parents and kids what we

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640
between aging parents and kids what we
 

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.660
between aging parents and kids what we
do is we include in the analyses I'll

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:39.670
do is we include in the analyses I'll
 

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:41.580
do is we include in the analyses I'll
show you we only include people who have

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:41.590
show you we only include people who have
 

00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:44.910
show you we only include people who have
kids at home so they may also have aging

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:44.920
kids at home so they may also have aging
 

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.550
kids at home so they may also have aging
parents but it's probably much less

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:47.560
parents but it's probably much less
 

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.020
parents but it's probably much less
likely than if we look at the host

00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:50.030
likely than if we look at the host
 

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:52.820
likely than if we look at the host
we could restrict it to an age range

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:52.830
we could restrict it to an age range
 

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:55.750
we could restrict it to an age range
sort of 40 and above that would have

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760
sort of 40 and above that would have
 

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.580
sort of 40 and above that would have
aging parents we didn't do that well he

00:48:58.580 --> 00:48:58.590
aging parents we didn't do that well he
 

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:06.370
aging parents we didn't do that well he
couldn't do that with you know

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:06.380
 
 

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:09.250

ethnographic much more qualitative

basically it wasn't like we were all

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:25.120
basically it wasn't like we were all
 

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.730
basically it wasn't like we were all
within seven years so it was like anyone

before you were a parent but if you look
 

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.680
before you were a parent but if you look
at certain linguistic constructions like

prior to being shifted into Karen Weaver

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:02.020
prior to being shifted into Karen Weaver
 

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:05.430

is it is it now that younger younger

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440
is it is it now that younger younger

children the household have to do fewer

00:51:07.590 --> 00:51:07.600
children the household have to do fewer
 

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:09.510
children the household have to do fewer
hours and those hours of accumulated

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520
hours and those hours of accumulated
 

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.460

that mother and father or that it's

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:11.470
that mother and father or that it's
 

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:15.780
that mother and father or that it's
shifted away from their labor it's a

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:15.790
shifted away from their labor it's a
 

00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:17.190
shifted away from their labor it's a
really big question it shifted away from

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200
really big question it shifted away from
 

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.180
really big question it shifted away from
housework hours so so if you take the

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:21.190
housework hours so so if you take the
 

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:22.920
housework hours so so if you take the
housework hours and the family care

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:22.930
housework hours and the family care
 

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.050
housework hours and the family care
hours and you add them together that

00:51:25.050 --> 00:51:25.060
hours and you add them together that
 

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.520
hours and you add them together that
doesn't seem to be changing very much

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:26.530
doesn't seem to be changing very much
 

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:29.760
doesn't seem to be changing very much
and so what you'll see is what

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:29.770
and so what you'll see is what
 

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:32.400
and so what you'll see is what
washing machines and refrigerators yeah

00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:32.410
washing machines and refrigerators yeah
 

00:51:32.410 --> 00:51:35.040
washing machines and refrigerators yeah
yeah so and it's a part of the reason

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:35.050
yeah so and it's a part of the reason
 

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:37.470
yeah so and it's a part of the reason
that mothers used to say go outside to

00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:37.480
that mothers used to say go outside to
 

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:40.980
that mothers used to say go outside to
play was that they were really busy and

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:40.990
play was that they were really busy and
 

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:44.790
play was that they were really busy and
and they didn't have Trader Joe's

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:44.800
and they didn't have Trader Joe's
 

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:48.390
and they didn't have Trader Joe's
so so it was a very different allocation

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400
so so it was a very different allocation
 

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:52.680
so so it was a very different allocation
of time so so what we see is that being

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:52.690
of time so so what we see is that being
 

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:54.300
of time so so what we see is that being
raised by a working mother equally

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:54.310
raised by a working mother equally
 

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:57.690
raised by a working mother equally
increases women's and men's hours spent

00:51:57.690 --> 00:51:57.700
increases women's and men's hours spent
 

00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:59.070
increases women's and men's hours spent
in family care

00:51:59.070 --> 00:51:59.080
in family care
 

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.680
in family care
so unlike allocation of household work

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:01.690
so unlike allocation of household work
 

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:04.500
so unlike allocation of household work
we're being raised by a working mom made

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:04.510
we're being raised by a working mom made
 

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:07.290
we're being raised by a working mom made
nurse or taught women how to do less

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:07.300
nurse or taught women how to do less
 

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:09.210
nurse or taught women how to do less
housework and hit men how to do more

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:09.220
housework and hit men how to do more
 

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.610
housework and hit men how to do more
housework being raised by a working mom

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:11.620
housework being raised by a working mom
 

00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:14.070
housework being raised by a working mom
increases both men's and women's time

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:14.080
increases both men's and women's time
 

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:15.950
increases both men's and women's time
that they spend with their kids

00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960
that they spend with their kids
 

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:18.990
that they spend with their kids
interestingly gender attitudes are not

00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:19.000
interestingly gender attitudes are not
 

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.030
interestingly gender attitudes are not
related and you can think about this as

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040
related and you can think about this as
 

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.430
related and you can think about this as
sort of reasonable the more traditional

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440
sort of reasonable the more traditional
 

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.470
sort of reasonable the more traditional
people think that that's their role

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:25.480
people think that that's their role
 

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.850
people think that that's their role
they're supposed to be parents of the

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:26.860
they're supposed to be parents of the
 

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.860
they're supposed to be parents of the
more egalitarian people think you know

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:28.870
more egalitarian people think you know
 

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:30.570
more egalitarian people think you know
oh I should be spending time with my

00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:30.580
oh I should be spending time with my
 

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:36.860
oh I should be spending time with my
kids so that I can teach them how to be

00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:39.990
 
so what you see is nothing for gender

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000
so what you see is nothing for gender
 

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.270
so what you see is nothing for gender
attitudes and positive for both men and

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:42.280
attitudes and positive for both men and
 

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.610
attitudes and positive for both men and
women in terms of a working mom in terms

parliamentarians tend to spend more time

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:04.880
 
so what we see is not a median and model

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:04.890
so what we see is not a median and model
 

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:07.150
so what we see is not a median and model
but rather an attitude model of

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.160
but rather an attitude model of
 

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:09.530
but rather an attitude model of
non-traditional gender role models and

so in some ways you could think about

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640
so in some ways you could think about
 

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:50.359
so in some ways you could think about
this as a good news good news story so

reducing gender gaps but it does look
like being raised by a working mom is

work decreases women's so the gaps here

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:16.410
work decreases women's so the gaps here
 

00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:18.470

are reduced in the gaps here reduced by

gender role models at the country level
 

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:25.880

when we think about outcomes at home
 

00:54:34.430 --> 00:55:05.850
when we think about outcomes at home
mostly for men but for women as well

00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:17.760

so we haven't so we we actually
 

00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.830
so we haven't so we we actually
discussed doing this but because we have

people in here up to sixty years old so
 

00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:31.109

we would have to go back to the media

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:34.630
we would have to go back to the media
 

00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:37.190

to go back 60 years media collect it

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:41.230
to go back 60 years media collect it
 

00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:42.980
to go back 60 years media collect it
every year so that's probably

00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:42.990
every year so that's probably
 

00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:46.770
every year so that's probably
impractical but I think what we can do

00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:46.780
impractical but I think what we can do
 

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:48.630
impractical but I think what we can do
is go in and put in the women's

00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640
is go in and put in the women's

is go in and put in the women's

question and we have it it's a little

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960
question and we have it it's a little

bit spotty in some countries when you go

00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:07.330
bit spotty in some countries when you go
 

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:11.010
bit spotty in some countries when you go
back prior to World War two it's

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:11.020
back prior to World War two it's
 

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:13.980
back prior to World War two it's
especially spotty for obvious reasons in

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:13.990
especially spotty for obvious reasons in
 

00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:15.720

the post Soviet bloc countries because

00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:15.730
the post Soviet bloc countries because
 

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:18.180
the post Soviet bloc countries because
they weren't countries if they weren't

they weren't countries if they weren't
 

00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:20.070
they weren't countries if they weren't
countries until much later and so we

00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:20.080
countries until much later and so we
 

00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:23.130
countries until much later and so we
don't have perfect data for it but we'll

00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:23.140
don't have perfect data for it but we'll
 

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:26.130
don't have perfect data for it but we'll
run tests with as many controls as we

00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:26.140
run tests with as many controls as we
 

00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.870

can to try to get out that because

can to try to get out that because

you're absolutely right but just having

00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:31.000
you're absolutely right but just having
 

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.849
you're absolutely right but just having
women a parliament doesn't mean

00:56:32.849 --> 00:56:32.859
women a parliament doesn't mean
 

00:56:32.859 --> 00:56:34.710

you does a positive thing by society

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720
you does a positive thing by society
 

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.329
you does a positive thing by society
need to somehow figure out how to get

need to somehow figure out how to get

I was wondering if you might want to

00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:41.630
I was wondering if you might want to
 

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:43.420
I was wondering if you might want to
look at how these effects and mechanisms

00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:43.430
look at how these effects and mechanisms
 

00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:45.210
look at how these effects and mechanisms
my

00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:45.220

different hospital levels as I imagine

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:47.170
different hospital levels as I imagine
 

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:50.270
different hospital levels as I imagine
would be willing to say perhaps

00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280
would be willing to say perhaps
 

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:52.610
would be willing to say perhaps
maybe to do a case study and what these

00:56:52.610 --> 00:56:52.620
maybe to do a case study and what these
 

00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.980
maybe to do a case study and what these
look like a different income levels and

00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:54.990
look like a different income levels and
 

00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:57.790
look like a different income levels and
also like let those

00:56:57.790 --> 00:56:57.800
also like let those
 

00:56:57.800 --> 00:57:03.160
also like let those
yes so so we do have people are calling

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:03.170
yes so so we do have people are calling
 

00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:04.990
yes so so we do have people are calling
babies and broomsticks but people tell

00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000
babies and broomsticks but people tell
 

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:11.340
babies and broomsticks but people tell
me that makes me think about witches

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:11.350
 
 

00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:16.600
 
presentation paper but what we what we

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:16.610
presentation paper but what we what we
 

00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:19.510
presentation paper but what we what we
do in that is interact working mom with

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520
do in that is interact working mom with
 

00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:22.150
do in that is interact working mom with
income and with hours worked and and

00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160
income and with hours worked and and
 

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:26.050

you're absolutely right it also tends to

00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:26.060
you're absolutely right it also tends to
 

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:27.910
you're absolutely right it also tends to
vary by the type of country that we're

00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920
vary by the type of country that we're
 

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.280
vary by the type of country that we're
in so in those analyses what we do is we

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:30.290
in so in those analyses what we do is we
 

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:32.770
in so in those analyses what we do is we
look at the gender attitudes at the

00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:32.780
look at the gender attitudes at the
 

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:33.670
look at the gender attitudes at the
national level

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680
national level
 

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.760

both the absolute level and the change

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:36.770
both the absolute level and the change
 

00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:40.420
both the absolute level and the change
over time and it looks like in the more

00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:40.430
over time and it looks like in the more
 

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:43.000
over time and it looks like in the more
egalitarian countries the effect of

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:43.010
egalitarian countries the effect of
 

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:45.520
egalitarian countries the effect of
having a working mom doesn't it's

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:45.530
having a working mom doesn't it's
 

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:47.650
having a working mom doesn't it's
basically just about ours and income

00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:47.660
basically just about ours and income
 

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.870
basically just about ours and income
it's not about that interacting with

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:49.880
it's not about that interacting with
 

00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:52.810
it's not about that interacting with
working moms but when you get into what

00:57:52.810 --> 00:57:52.820
working moms but when you get into what
 

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:54.700
working moms but when you get into what
we call the stagnating moderates that

00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:54.710
we call the stagnating moderates that
 

00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:56.980
we call the stagnating moderates that
feels like the US for example and the

00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:56.990
feels like the US for example and the
 

00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:59.410
feels like the US for example and the
stagnating conservatives on countries

00:57:59.410 --> 00:57:59.420
stagnating conservatives on countries
 

00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:02.200
stagnating conservatives on countries
like Mexico what you see is that being

00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:02.210
like Mexico what you see is that being
 

00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:03.950
like Mexico what you see is that being
raised by working mom as a signature

00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960
raised by working mom as a signature
 

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:06.740
raised by working mom as a signature
interaction with income and hours worked

00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:06.750
interaction with income and hours worked
 

00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:08.900
interaction with income and hours worked
and this is on what happens at home so

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:08.910
and this is on what happens at home so
 

00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:14.360
and this is on what happens at home so
so your intuition is right what we would

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:14.370
so your intuition is right what we would
 

00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:17.030
so your intuition is right what we would
love to be able to look at maybe this

00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040
love to be able to look at maybe this
 

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.970
love to be able to look at maybe this
isn't quite a new question is the income

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:19.980
isn't quite a new question is the income
 

00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:21.020
isn't quite a new question is the income
of the household in which you were

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:21.030
of the household in which you were
 

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:25.610
of the household in which you were
raised so with my co-author Maya

00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:25.620
raised so with my co-author Maya
 

00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:30.320

Castro we are we started a big study in

00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:30.330
Castro we are we started a big study in
 

00:58:30.330 --> 00:58:32.870
Castro we are we started a big study in
Mexico Mexico is a huge outlier here

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880
Mexico Mexico is a huge outlier here
 

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.220
Mexico Mexico is a huge outlier here
it's an outlier on a whole bunch of

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:34.230
it's an outlier on a whole bunch of
 

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:35.630
it's an outlier on a whole bunch of
dimensions it's very very conservative

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640
dimensions it's very very conservative
 

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:37.730
dimensions it's very very conservative
it's one of the few countries where

00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:37.740
it's one of the few countries where
 

00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:39.440
it's one of the few countries where
women's gender attitudes are more

00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:39.450
women's gender attitudes are more
 

00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:41.620
women's gender attitudes are more
conservative than men's gender attitudes

00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:41.630
conservative than men's gender attitudes
 

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:44.720
conservative than men's gender attitudes
it's one of the few countries where at

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:44.730
it's one of the few countries where at
 

00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:47.660
it's one of the few countries where at
both hours spent in household work and

00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:47.670
both hours spent in household work and
 

00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:50.710
both hours spent in household work and
hours spent in family care are very high

00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720
hours spent in family care are very high
 

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:54.050
hours spent in family care are very high
and so we're working with 10 companies

00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:54.060
and so we're working with 10 companies
 

00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:56.270
and so we're working with 10 companies
in Mexico to try to see the extent to

00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280
in Mexico to try to see the extent to
 

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.760
in Mexico to try to see the extent to
which what happens at work can affect

00:58:58.760 --> 00:58:58.770
which what happens at work can affect
 

00:58:58.770 --> 00:59:02.000
which what happens at work can affect
what happens at home and their we're

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:02.010
what happens at home and their we're
 

00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:04.430
what happens at home and their we're
able to look more closely first of all

00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440
able to look more closely first of all
 

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:06.260
able to look more closely first of all
at interactions with individual level

00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:06.270
at interactions with individual level
 

00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:09.920
at interactions with individual level
income and we're able we asked questions

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:09.930
income and we're able we asked questions
 

00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:11.450
income and we're able we asked questions
about the household in which you were

00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:11.460
about the household in which you were
 

00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:12.170
about the household in which you were
raised

00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.180
raised
 

00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:14.810
raised
so how conservative was it was it of

00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:14.820
so how conservative was it was it of
 

00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:16.970
so how conservative was it was it of
digesting a mom what was your we have

00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:16.980
digesting a mom what was your we have
 

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:19.150
digesting a mom what was your we have
these sort of status

00:59:19.150 --> 00:59:19.160
these sort of status
 

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.920
these sort of status
sooner some things and we don't have

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:20.930
sooner some things and we don't have
 

00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:32.250
sooner some things and we don't have
those

00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:32.260
 
 

00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:35.730
 
yeah it's also Mexico's interesting

00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:35.740
yeah it's also Mexico's interesting
 

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:37.650
yeah it's also Mexico's interesting
along with a few other countries there

00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:37.660
along with a few other countries there
 

00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:40.170
along with a few other countries there
are some fairly low income countries the

00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:40.180
are some fairly low income countries the
 

00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:41.280
are some fairly low income countries the
Philippines is one of these for example

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:41.290
Philippines is one of these for example
 

00:59:41.290 --> 00:59:44.550
Philippines is one of these for example
where you don't have to be very high

00:59:44.550 --> 00:59:44.560
where you don't have to be very high
 

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:47.430
where you don't have to be very high
income to have lots of help at home so

00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440
income to have lots of help at home so
 

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:51.660
income to have lots of help at home so
so in Mexico once you're just barely

00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:51.670
so in Mexico once you're just barely
 

00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:53.730
so in Mexico once you're just barely
above the poverty level then you start

00:59:53.730 --> 00:59:53.740
above the poverty level then you start
 

00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:56.310
above the poverty level then you start
having household help and so we're

00:59:56.310 --> 00:59:56.320
having household help and so we're
 

00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:57.840
having household help and so we're
trying to disentangle the role of that

00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:57.850
trying to disentangle the role of that
 

00:59:57.850 --> 01:00:04.230
trying to disentangle the role of that
as well yeah on that - same thing one of

01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240
as well yeah on that - same thing one of
 

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.430
as well yeah on that - same thing one of
the things that strikes me is that

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440
the things that strikes me is that
 

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.920
the things that strikes me is that
actually these

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:08.930
 
 

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:11.450
 
institutions across countries yeah and I

01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:11.460
institutions across countries yeah and I
 

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.610
institutions across countries yeah and I
support literature and mail welfare

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:13.620
support literature and mail welfare
 

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.660
support literature and mail welfare
state breadwinner state that's what it's

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:17.670
state breadwinner state that's what it's
 

01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:19.970
state breadwinner state that's what it's
called down kind of the welfare order

01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:19.980
called down kind of the welfare order
 

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:23.030
called down kind of the welfare order
that place is their child care isn't

01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040

01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400
hours of time kids spent in school yeah
 

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:31.340
hours of time kids spent in school yeah
when do they come home in other words is

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:31.350
when do they come home in other words is
 

01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:34.820
when do they come home in other words is
they decide to organize in such a

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:34.830
they decide to organize in such a
 

01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:36.980
they decide to organize in such a
fashion to make women's labor force

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:36.990
fashion to make women's labor force
 

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:39.890

Corelli it's such a nice natural

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:46.290
Corelli it's such a nice natural
 

01:00:46.290 --> 01:00:49.160
Corelli it's such a nice natural
experiment I hadn't looked at what was

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:49.170
experiment I hadn't looked at what was
 

01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:51.380
experiment I hadn't looked at what was
in place in the Western ways place the

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:51.390
in place in the Western ways place the
 

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:54.440
in place in the Western ways place the
East which had vast amount of child care

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:54.450
East which had vast amount of child care
 

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:56.990
East which had vast amount of child care
writers also women working with such a

01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000
writers also women working with such a
 

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.820
writers also women working with such a
normal thing

01:00:59.820 --> 01:00:59.830
normal thing
 

01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:01.920
normal thing
so I mean it just strikes me out that

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:01.930
so I mean it just strikes me out that
 

01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:04.080
so I mean it just strikes me out that
that should matter that would be a

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:04.090
that should matter that would be a
 

01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:06.180
that should matter that would be a
an interesting way to get at these very

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:06.190
an interesting way to get at these very
 

01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:10.519
an interesting way to get at these very
mistresses

01:01:10.519 --> 01:01:10.529
 
 

01:01:10.529 --> 01:01:12.929
 
so these are the types of data we're

01:01:12.929 --> 01:01:12.939
so these are the types of data we're
 

01:01:12.939 --> 01:01:14.699
so these are the types of data we're
trying to collect you can't collect them

01:01:14.699 --> 01:01:14.709
trying to collect you can't collect them
 

01:01:14.709 --> 01:01:18.089
trying to collect you can't collect them
from the post-soviet yes because yes

01:01:18.089 --> 01:01:18.099
from the post-soviet yes because yes
 

01:01:18.099 --> 01:01:20.640
from the post-soviet yes because yes
right because they didn't collect data

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:20.650
right because they didn't collect data
 

01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:22.709
right because they didn't collect data
at that level one of the things you're

01:01:22.709 --> 01:01:22.719
at that level one of the things you're
 

01:01:22.719 --> 01:01:24.839
at that level one of the things you're
talking about and this is this was

01:01:24.839 --> 01:01:24.849
talking about and this is this was
 

01:01:24.849 --> 01:01:27.269
talking about and this is this was
striking in fact I I went back to the

01:01:27.269 --> 01:01:27.279
striking in fact I I went back to the
 

01:01:27.279 --> 01:01:28.739
striking in fact I I went back to the
day of like these can't be right

01:01:28.739 --> 01:01:28.749
day of like these can't be right
 

01:01:28.749 --> 01:01:32.189
day of like these can't be right
so so we have the proportion of women

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:32.199
so so we have the proportion of women
 

01:01:32.199 --> 01:01:34.049
so so we have the proportion of women
who were currently working because we

01:01:34.049 --> 01:01:34.059
who were currently working because we
 

01:01:34.059 --> 01:01:35.429
who were currently working because we
have this data and we have the

01:01:35.429 --> 01:01:35.439
have this data and we have the
 

01:01:35.439 --> 01:01:37.079
have this data and we have the
proportion of people who report that

01:01:37.079 --> 01:01:37.089
proportion of people who report that
 

01:01:37.089 --> 01:01:39.479
proportion of people who report that
their mothers were working and in these

01:01:39.479 --> 01:01:39.489
their mothers were working and in these
 

01:01:39.489 --> 01:01:41.819
their mothers were working and in these
Soviet bloc countries way higher

01:01:41.819 --> 01:01:41.829
Soviet bloc countries way higher
 

01:01:41.829 --> 01:01:43.289
Soviet bloc countries way higher
proportions reported that their mom's

01:01:43.289 --> 01:01:43.299
proportions reported that their mom's
 

01:01:43.299 --> 01:01:45.299
proportions reported that their mom's
working than currently work which for me

01:01:45.299 --> 01:01:45.309
working than currently work which for me
 

01:01:45.309 --> 01:01:47.099
working than currently work which for me
is a flag right how can that be you know

01:01:47.099 --> 01:01:47.109
is a flag right how can that be you know
 

01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:49.199
is a flag right how can that be you know
but it's true almost all of those

01:01:49.199 --> 01:01:49.209
but it's true almost all of those
 

01:01:49.209 --> 01:01:51.839
but it's true almost all of those
countries and so it looked like that

01:01:51.839 --> 01:01:51.849
countries and so it looked like that
 

01:01:51.849 --> 01:01:54.660
countries and so it looked like that
should be that could be a boundary

01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:54.670
should be that could be a boundary
 

01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:56.309
should be that could be a boundary
condition for these effects it doesn't

01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319
condition for these effects it doesn't
 

01:01:56.319 --> 01:01:58.229
condition for these effects it doesn't
appear to be but I agree with you there

01:01:58.229 --> 01:01:58.239
appear to be but I agree with you there
 

01:01:58.239 --> 01:02:00.419
appear to be but I agree with you there
was some really interesting and there's

01:02:00.419 --> 01:02:00.429
was some really interesting and there's
 

01:02:00.429 --> 01:02:02.279
was some really interesting and there's
not that much data on them we don't have

01:02:02.279 --> 01:02:02.289
not that much data on them we don't have
 

01:02:02.289 --> 01:02:04.349
not that much data on them we don't have
that much data on them either but it

01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:04.359
that much data on them either but it
 

01:02:04.359 --> 01:02:05.549
that much data on them either but it
would be interesting to pull them out

01:02:05.549 --> 01:02:05.559
would be interesting to pull them out
 

01:02:05.559 --> 01:02:07.680
would be interesting to pull them out
let them look at them separately

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:07.690
let them look at them separately
 

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:10.710
let them look at them separately
they tend to be like me in those babies

01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:10.720

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.020
they tend to be like me in those babies
of broomsticks they tempt a cluster in

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:13.030
of broomsticks they tempt a cluster in
 

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:17.099
of broomsticks they tempt a cluster in
the stagnating conservatives so they're

01:02:17.099 --> 01:02:17.109
the stagnating conservatives so they're
 

01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:19.079
the stagnating conservatives so they're
changing very slowly the one country

01:02:19.079 --> 01:02:19.089
changing very slowly the one country
 

01:02:19.089 --> 01:02:22.559
changing very slowly the one country
which is bizarrely different than the

01:02:22.559 --> 01:02:22.569
which is bizarrely different than the
 

01:02:22.569 --> 01:02:25.680
which is bizarrely different than the

rest of Slovenia he's looked that's the
beauty is like the Nordic country it's

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:27.910
beauty is like the Nordic country it's
 

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:30.930
beauty is like the Nordic country it's
just I have the Slovenian friend who's

01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:30.940
just I have the Slovenian friend who's
 

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:34.800
just I have the Slovenian friend who's
like this power woman she's the TV

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:34.810
like this power woman she's the TV
 

01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:53.410
like this power woman she's the TV
broadcaster and

01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:53.420
 
 

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:55.420
 
I wish we did we don't have it if you

01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:55.430
I wish we did we don't have it if you
 

01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:58.050
I wish we did we don't have it if you
know of any data sets that look at that

01:02:58.050 --> 01:02:58.060
know of any data sets that look at that
 

01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:59.890
know of any data sets that look at that
internationally I would love to see you

01:02:59.890 --> 01:02:59.900
internationally I would love to see you
 

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:03.400
internationally I would love to see you
know I it's not asked even in the 2012

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:03.410
know I it's not asked even in the 2012
 

01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:05.440
know I it's not asked even in the 2012
data so so the questions got more

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:05.450
data so so the questions got more
 

01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:06.970
data so so the questions got more
refined it's really quite an interesting

01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:06.980
refined it's really quite an interesting
 

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:08.980
refined it's really quite an interesting
study just to look at the gender

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:08.990
study just to look at the gender
 

01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:10.900
study just to look at the gender
attitude type questions that they asked

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:10.910
attitude type questions that they asked
 

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:14.740
attitude type questions that they asked
in the 80 88 won the 94 won the 2002 in

01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:14.750
in the 80 88 won the 94 won the 2002 in
 

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:16.630
in the 80 88 won the 94 won the 2002 in
2012 there's a whole study that you can

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640
2012 there's a whole study that you can
 

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.290
2012 there's a whole study that you can
think of in terms of international

01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:19.300
think of in terms of international
 

01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:21.790
think of in terms of international
narrative around gender just for most

01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:21.800
narrative around gender just for most
 

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.530
narrative around gender just for most
questions but even in 2012 they don't

01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:23.540
questions but even in 2012 they don't
 

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:30.770
questions but even in 2012 they don't
ask if the dad stays at home

01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:30.780
 
 

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:33.450
 
did you can I'm just thinking there with

01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:33.460
did you can I'm just thinking there with
 

01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:38.350
did you can I'm just thinking there with
the correlation of that with

01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:38.360
 
 

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:41.890
 
it's public but like

01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:41.900
it's public but like
 

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:44.260
it's public but like
you know the children made

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:44.270
you know the children made
 

01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:48.520
you know the children made
professor you know doctor so how do you

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:48.530
professor you know doctor so how do you
 

01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:53.440
professor you know doctor so how do you
control for unless those you have

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:53.450
control for unless those you have
 

01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:55.480
control for unless those you have
specific some of the quota countries

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:55.490
specific some of the quota countries
 

01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:58.520
specific some of the quota countries
they may not have

01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:58.530
 
 

01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:00.710
 
right so that them you have to come

01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720
right so that them you have to come
 

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.890
right so that them you have to come
together just yeah so so we have over

01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900
together just yeah so so we have over
 

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:09.590
together just yeah so so we have over
the last couple months collected the

01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:09.600
the last couple months collected the
 

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.140
the last couple months collected the
data all the way back on to the if

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:12.150
data all the way back on to the if
 

01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:14.150
data all the way back on to the if
something is available on what they call

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160
something is available on what they call
 

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:20.380
something is available on what they call
female professionals so we do have

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:20.390
female professionals so we do have
 

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:23.440
female professionals so we do have
everything about female head of state

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:23.450
everything about female head of state
 

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:29.030
everything about female head of state
those are theirs it's just such a sparse

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:29.040
those are theirs it's just such a sparse
 

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.770
those are theirs it's just such a sparse
data almost everything's in zeros so

01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:30.780
data almost everything's in zeros so
 

01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:32.270
data almost everything's in zeros so
then we looked at whether there were

01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:32.280
then we looked at whether there were
 

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.480
then we looked at whether there were
many who we had run for office and

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:35.490
many who we had run for office and
 

01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:37.790
many who we had run for office and
gotten in the final run offs and even

01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:37.800
gotten in the final run offs and even
 

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.790
gotten in the final run offs and even
that is too sparse so that we can't use

01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:40.800
that is too sparse so that we can't use
 

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:44.020
that is too sparse so that we can't use
very much we do have women in

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:44.030
very much we do have women in
 

01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:46.940
very much we do have women in
c-suites that's only reported in some

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:46.950
c-suites that's only reported in some
 

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:49.010
c-suites that's only reported in some
countries so we're going to try with

01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.020
countries so we're going to try with
 

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:54.070
countries so we're going to try with
these new data to try to

01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:54.080
 
 

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:56.680
 
to try to see if we can understand this

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:56.690
to try to see if we can understand this
 

01:04:56.690 --> 01:05:00.250
to try to see if we can understand this
effect a little bit better but I don't

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:00.260
effect a little bit better but I don't
 

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:01.600
effect a little bit better but I don't
know where I don't know where it's gonna

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:01.610
know where I don't know where it's gonna
 

01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:04.990
know where I don't know where it's gonna
lead us those those numbers by the way

01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:05.000
lead us those those numbers by the way
 

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.640
lead us those those numbers by the way
tend to be the number you're talking

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:06.650
tend to be the number you're talking
 

01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:08.170
tend to be the number you're talking
about in terms of female professionals

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:08.180
about in terms of female professionals
 

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:11.050
about in terms of female professionals
and people parliamentarians controlling

01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:11.060
and people parliamentarians controlling
 

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:12.160
and people parliamentarians controlling
for nothing else they're actually big

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:12.170
for nothing else they're actually big
 

01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:13.359
for nothing else they're actually big
Rafi

01:05:13.359 --> 01:05:13.369
Rafi
 

01:05:13.369 --> 01:05:15.980
Rafi
so there's but I would think in certain

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:15.990
so there's but I would think in certain
 

01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:18.870
so there's but I would think in certain
countries

01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880
 
 

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:22.280
 
yes across the 25

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:22.290
yes across the 25
 

01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:25.930
yes across the 25
so that might use

01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:25.940
so that might use
 

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:32.210
so that might use
yeah you have really mixed

01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:32.220
 
 

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:37.210
 
these other countries that are

01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:37.220
 
 

01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.430
 
yeah that's good enough

01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440
yeah that's good enough
 

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:44.520
yeah that's good enough
yes interesting so what we could do

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:44.530
yes interesting so what we could do
 

01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:46.750
yes interesting so what we could do
which we hadn't thought about at all we

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:46.760
which we hadn't thought about at all we
 

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.279
which we hadn't thought about at all we
could essentially go in and find out

01:05:48.279 --> 01:05:48.289
could essentially go in and find out
 

01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:50.230
could essentially go in and find out
whether there's a photo it's easy to

01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:50.240
whether there's a photo it's easy to
 

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.690
whether there's a photo it's easy to
just put in a dummy for a photo yeah

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:52.700
just put in a dummy for a photo yeah
 

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:55.359
just put in a dummy for a photo yeah
because I I think it's the mechanism the

01:05:55.359 --> 01:05:55.369
because I I think it's the mechanism the
 

01:05:55.369 --> 01:05:57.309
because I I think it's the mechanism the
mechanism may have a really significant

01:05:57.309 --> 01:05:57.319
mechanism may have a really significant
 

01:05:57.319 --> 01:05:59.859
mechanism may have a really significant
and I would actually do do it both with

01:05:59.859 --> 01:05:59.869
and I would actually do do it both with
 

01:05:59.869 --> 01:06:02.529
and I would actually do do it both with
quota and then what the quota reserves

01:06:02.529 --> 01:06:02.539
quota and then what the quota reserves
 

01:06:02.539 --> 01:06:05.289
quota and then what the quota reserves
seem like what that mechanism is now

01:06:05.289 --> 01:06:05.299
seem like what that mechanism is now
 

01:06:05.299 --> 01:06:06.520
seem like what that mechanism is now
because it mechanisms actually make a

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:06.530
because it mechanisms actually make a
 

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:20.460
because it mechanisms actually make a
pretty significant

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:20.470
 
 

01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:26.520
 
one strong quota is yes

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:26.530
 
 

01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:33.060
 
yeah I think yeah and we could treat

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:33.070
yeah I think yeah and we could treat
 

01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:34.830
yeah I think yeah and we could treat
them as we could treat them as separate

01:06:34.830 --> 01:06:34.840
them as we could treat them as separate
 

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:38.340
them as we could treat them as separate
or we could at least interact quota with

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:38.350
or we could at least interact quota with
 

01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:42.870
or we could at least interact quota with
the that's a great idea did the pain

01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880
the that's a great idea did the pain
 

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.360
the that's a great idea did the pain
where the people asked if there are

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:45.370
where the people asked if there are
 

01:06:45.370 --> 01:06:48.150
where the people asked if there are
female representation it is totally

01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160
female representation it is totally
 

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.730
female representation it is totally
separate Davison because my expectation

01:06:50.730 --> 01:06:50.740
separate Davison because my expectation
 

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:53.610
separate Davison because my expectation
I mean most people have formed their

01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:53.620
I mean most people have formed their
 

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.530
I mean most people have formed their
political identity by the time they're

01:06:55.530 --> 01:06:55.540
political identity by the time they're
 

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:59.730
political identity by the time they're
about 18 to 20 so whether people are

01:06:59.730 --> 01:06:59.740
about 18 to 20 so whether people are
 

01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:01.680
about 18 to 20 so whether people are
flip assessed or not and all the data

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:01.690
flip assessed or not and all the data
 

01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:03.330
flip assessed or not and all the data
shows that it does come from what was

01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:03.340
shows that it does come from what was
 

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:04.890
shows that it does come from what was
discussed at the dinner table basically

01:07:04.890 --> 01:07:04.900
discussed at the dinner table basically
 

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:10.080
discussed at the dinner table basically
yeah um this is before their 14th so

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:10.090
yeah um this is before their 14th so
 

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:11.400
yeah um this is before their 14th so
those are the numbers were reporting

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:11.410
those are the numbers were reporting
 

01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:14.430
those are the numbers were reporting
here like I think Esther mohini's work

01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:20.070
is spectacular but I don't think it's
likely broadly applicable because it was

harvesting that kind of data it just
 

01:09:06.509 --> 01:09:09.379
harvesting that kind of data it just
intrigues me some of the paradoxes that

01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:09.389
intrigues me some of the paradoxes that
 

01:09:09.389 --> 01:09:12.280
intrigues me some of the paradoxes that
you just brushed over

01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:12.290
you just brushed over
 

01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:14.950
you just brushed over
of the impact of parliamentarians how

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960
of the impact of parliamentarians how
 

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.780

are you going to dig deeper in them and

01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:16.790
are you going to dig deeper in them and
 

01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:19.449
are you going to dig deeper in them and
I'd love to talk it into the future yeah

01:09:19.449 --> 01:09:19.459
I'd love to talk it into the future yeah
 

01:09:19.459 --> 01:09:21.279
I'd love to talk it into the future yeah
yeah there's definitely some digging to

01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:21.289
yeah there's definitely some digging to
 

01:09:21.289 --> 01:09:22.269
yeah there's definitely some digging to
go there

01:09:22.269 --> 01:09:22.279
go there
 

01:09:22.279 --> 01:09:25.490
go there
so I'm the

01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:25.500

that might not see them as a role model

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:44.789
that might not see them as a role model
 

01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:49.309
that might not see them as a role model
by their gender first

01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:49.319
 
 

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:58.919
 
so we don't know

01:09:58.919 --> 01:09:58.929
 
 

01:09:58.929 --> 01:10:03.440

as makeup of the female parliamentarians
 

01:10:03.450 --> 01:10:05.300
as makeup of the female parliamentarians
it would probably not be a big stretch

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:05.310
it would probably not be a big stretch
 

01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:06.979
it would probably not be a big stretch
to say it's probably

01:10:06.979 --> 01:10:06.989
to say it's probably
 

01:10:06.989 --> 01:10:09.740
to say it's probably
the majority of majority but it's a

01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:09.750
the majority of majority but it's a
 

01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:11.870
the majority of majority but it's a
really interesting question the the

01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880
really interesting question the the
 

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.390
really interesting question the the
other thing that we so so in terms of

01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400
other thing that we so so in terms of
 

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.190
other thing that we so so in terms of
the size of the fact for our working

01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:16.200
the size of the fact for our working
 

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.410
the size of the fact for our working
moms relative to other things it's a

01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:18.420
moms relative to other things it's a
 

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:23.420
moms relative to other things it's a
very very big effect the we don't have

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:23.430
very very big effect the we don't have
 

01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:25.250
very very big effect the we don't have
race in there

01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:25.260
race in there
 

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:28.580
race in there
the reason that we don't have race is

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:28.590
the reason that we don't have race is
 

01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:30.830
the reason that we don't have race is
because it's it's different in every

01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840
because it's it's different in every
 

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:32.180
because it's it's different in every
country

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:32.190
country
 

01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:40.879
country
so we could go in and try to put in

01:10:40.879 --> 01:10:40.889
 
 

01:10:40.889 --> 01:10:44.430
 
light-dark meter or some such thing but

01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:44.440
light-dark meter or some such thing but
 

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.050
light-dark meter or some such thing but
different countries have actually

01:10:46.050 --> 01:10:46.060
different countries have actually
 

01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:47.820
different countries have actually
different questions in terms of race so

01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:47.830
different questions in terms of race so
 

01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:49.560
different questions in terms of race so
even at the individual level point we're

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:49.570
even at the individual level point we're
 

01:10:49.570 --> 01:10:53.129
even at the individual level point we're
not controlling for race and I certainly

01:10:53.129 --> 01:10:53.139
not controlling for race and I certainly
 

01:10:53.139 --> 01:10:54.839
not controlling for race and I certainly
think it would have an effective that

01:10:54.839 --> 01:10:54.849
think it would have an effective that
 

01:10:54.849 --> 01:10:56.160
think it would have an effective that
would interact with some of these things

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:56.170
would interact with some of these things
 

01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:57.690
would interact with some of these things
we haven't done it

01:10:57.690 --> 01:10:57.700
we haven't done it
 

01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:05.110
we haven't done it
that is a very necessary

01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120
 
 

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.120
