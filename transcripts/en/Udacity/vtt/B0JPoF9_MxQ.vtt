00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.362
The first reason is false. Since the single set of triangles is shared by all

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:09.042
four tires, each tire must look exactly the same, at least as far as geometry is

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:13.060
concerned. A flat tire doesn't look the same as the others. The last reason can

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.342
also be rejected, as each tire is drawn with the same geometry. The second

00:00:17.342 --> 00:00:21.928
reason is not true, as each tire needs to have its own transforms. The third

00:00:21.928 --> 00:00:26.496
reason is definitely true. Instead of storing four separate triangle sets for

00:00:26.496 --> 00:00:30.885
each tire, we can store just one. The savings can be huge when there are many

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:35.733
identical parts. This reuse can also increase performance on the GPU, depending

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.430
on how the data is passed in.
