00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.610
- Hi, my name is Lisa Libicki.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.166
I'm a School Programs
Educator here at MoMa.

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:18.669
This is Collective Suicide
by David Alfaro Siqueiros.

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.492
So usually when I bring students here

00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:22.547
they immediately notice the sort of

00:00:22.547 --> 00:00:24.265
top two thirds of the painting

00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:27.886
and how sort of crazy
the paint application is.

00:00:27.886 --> 00:00:30.209
They notice these applied panels.

00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:31.520
Looking at this set of figures

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.646
students immediately notice
they're on horseback,

00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:37.070
they have weapons, the
coloring suggests a sense

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.919
of armor that they're
wearing, and helmets.

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:42.925
We see a second population of figures.

00:00:42.925 --> 00:00:45.296
You notice that they have weapons too,

00:00:45.296 --> 00:00:48.196
but they're not directly engaging
in battle with this group

00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:51.238
rather the weapons have
been turned on themselves

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:52.655
and we start noticing blood

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:55.150
and that they seem to
be committing suicide

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.097
as the title also explains.

00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:01.293
All these observations
together start building

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:04.077
this very social and
politically minded conversation

00:01:04.077 --> 00:01:06.028
about okay, why are they doing this?

00:01:06.028 --> 00:01:08.270
And whether or not they've studied

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.578
17th century Mexican Spanish history

00:01:11.578 --> 00:01:14.456
they can get sort of
like a generalized notion

00:01:14.456 --> 00:01:18.695
of like two civilizations in conflict.

00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:21.795
So I think this piece really
resonates with students.

00:01:21.795 --> 00:01:24.093
One of the reasons I think has to do with

00:01:24.093 --> 00:01:25.997
sort of the form of the painting.

00:01:25.997 --> 00:01:28.528
I like to introduce the idea
that Siqueiros really felt

00:01:28.528 --> 00:01:30.049
that if you're going to be talking

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.985
about radical social and political

00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:34.809
sort of themes content-wise

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:37.630
then you're method of producing that image

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.556
should be equally radical.

00:01:39.556 --> 00:01:41.588
Secondly, on sort of
like a different note,

00:01:41.588 --> 00:01:45.153
is like hey, this guy was
so politically engaged.

00:01:45.153 --> 00:01:46.987
He fought in the Mexican Revolution,

00:01:46.987 --> 00:01:50.133
he went over to Spain and
was about to at this moment

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:53.326
when he painted this,
fight in Spain's Civil War.

00:01:53.326 --> 00:01:55.392
And yet, in the 1930's did he choose

00:01:55.392 --> 00:01:56.785
to paint about any of those things?

00:01:56.785 --> 00:01:57.668
No.

00:01:57.668 --> 00:02:01.905
Instead he reflected back on
this incident from the 1600's.

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:04.273
And I think students find
that sort of curious,

00:02:04.273 --> 00:02:05.946
I find that sort of curious,

00:02:05.946 --> 00:02:08.186
and we start to have a discuss
about why would you do that?

00:02:08.186 --> 00:02:10.565
What would be the value to kind of reflect

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:14.071
on contemporary ideas and situations

00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:18.786
and concerns by reflecting
back on past issues?

00:02:18.786 --> 00:02:20.665
And I think that's something that really

00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:22.710
almost like challenges them

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.107
and really makes their brains
turn in new directions.
