hi my name is Daniel Shan ski I'm Chad's
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.470
hi my name is Daniel Shan ski I'm Chad's
intern here on the Android team at

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480
intern here on the Android team at
 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.120
intern here on the Android team at
Google and today I'll be discussing a

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130
Google and today I'll be discussing a
 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.640
Google and today I'll be discussing a
few car flip animations so today I'll

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650
few car flip animations so today I'll
 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.010
few car flip animations so today I'll
just show you how to flip cards both

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020
just show you how to flip cards both
 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.099
just show you how to flip cards both
from side to side out and in and as well

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109
from side to side out and in and as well
 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.150
from side to side out and in and as well
as a few little tricks on how to do

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160
as a few little tricks on how to do
 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.599
as a few little tricks on how to do
graphic animations on on darkening and

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609
graphic animations on on darkening and
 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.970
graphic animations on on darkening and
spinning the cards when you need to the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
spinning the cards when you need to the
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.470
spinning the cards when you need to the
main trick to today's animation is going

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
main trick to today's animation is going
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.610
main trick to today's animation is going
to be the fact that after every single

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620
to be the fact that after every single
 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.900
to be the fact that after every single
animation we're going to update the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
animation we're going to update the
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.780
animation we're going to update the
layered parameters such that previous

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790
layered parameters such that previous
 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.670
layered parameters such that previous
animations future animations are not

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680
animations future animations are not
 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.959
animations future animations are not
going to be dependent on the values of

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969
going to be dependent on the values of
 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.299
going to be dependent on the values of
previous animations so be animating the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
previous animations so be animating the
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.010
previous animations so be animating the
properties but then at the end of every

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020
properties but then at the end of every
 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.299
properties but then at the end of every
th single animation we'll be setting

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309
th single animation we'll be setting
 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.340
th single animation we'll be setting
them all back to zero such that any

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
them all back to zero such that any
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.139
them all back to zero such that any
future innovations won't be depending on

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
future innovations won't be depending on
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.330
future innovations won't be depending on
what has been done before so going

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340
what has been done before so going
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.189
what has been done before so going
straight into the demo here we have a

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
straight into the demo here we have a
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.439
straight into the demo here we have a
stack of red cards I can use touch

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
stack of red cards I can use touch
 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.069
stack of red cards I can use touch
events to flip it from right to left

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079
events to flip it from right to left
 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.029
events to flip it from right to left
similarly you can flip it from left to

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
similarly you can flip it from left to
 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.030
similarly you can flip it from left to
right the the speed at which the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040
right the the speed at which the
 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.950
right the the speed at which the
sentiment is actually dependent on the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
sentiment is actually dependent on the
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.870
sentiment is actually dependent on the
speed at which it fling it you can also

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880
speed at which it fling it you can also
 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.969
speed at which it fling it you can also
swipe down to open a stack of cards or a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
swipe down to open a stack of cards or a
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.560
swipe down to open a stack of cards or a
swipe back up to close the stack of

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
swipe back up to close the stack of
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.440
swipe back up to close the stack of
cards slice the boats text or if you tap

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
cards slice the boats text or if you tap
 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.410
cards slice the boats text or if you tap
on the stack then there's little delayed

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
on the stack then there's little delayed
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.940
on the stack then there's little delayed
animation showing you how to rotate a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950
animation showing you how to rotate a
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.160
animation showing you how to rotate a
full stack of cards completely so

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170
full stack of cards completely so
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.469
full stack of cards completely so
jumping straight into the code there's a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479
jumping straight into the code there's a
 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.060
jumping straight into the code there's a
lot of boilerplate code that you can

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
lot of boilerplate code that you can
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.399
lot of boilerplate code that you can
look into where at where I you handle

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409
look into where at where I you handle
 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.810
look into where at where I you handle
all the touches of to me which way I'm

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
all the touches of to me which way I'm
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.670
all the touches of to me which way I'm
flinging and things like that but the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680
flinging and things like that but the
 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.830
flinging and things like that but the
interesting things happen here in card

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840
interesting things happen here in card
 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.219
interesting things happen here in card
view so scrolling down initially one of

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229
view so scrolling down initially one of
 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.210
view so scrolling down initially one of
the things you need to note is that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
the things you need to note is that
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.810
the things you need to note is that
views and in turn image views have this

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820
views and in turn image views have this
 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.940
views and in turn image views have this
property called set camera distance so

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950
property called set camera distance so
 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.850
property called set camera distance so
what this actually lets you do is set

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
what this actually lets you do is set
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.550
what this actually lets you do is set
the position along the z-axis of how far

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
the position along the z-axis of how far
 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.830
the position along the z-axis of how far
you want to be from the actual animation

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
you want to be from the actual animation
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.990
you want to be from the actual animation
originally in this animation if you were

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000
originally in this animation if you were
 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.429
originally in this animation if you were
to set it back to its default value

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
to set it back to its default value
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.679
to set it back to its default value
you'd see that we don't actually see the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689
you'd see that we don't actually see the
 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.480
you'd see that we don't actually see the
flip animation because it happens behind

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490
flip animation because it happens behind
 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.270
flip animation because it happens behind
the screen we as after that we retrieve

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
the screen we as after that we retrieve
 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.100
the screen we as after that we retrieve
the bitmaps that we use for the front in

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110
the bitmaps that we use for the front in
 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.859
the bitmaps that we use for the front in
the back of the cards and keep going

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869
the back of the cards and keep going
 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.499
the back of the cards and keep going
down here there's actually this is

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509
down here there's actually this is
 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.960
down here there's actually this is
important to note we what we're doing to

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970
important to note we what we're doing to
 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.550
important to note we what we're doing to
the bitmap drawables is adding a one

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
the bitmap drawables is adding a one
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.979
the bitmap drawables is adding a one
pixal transparent border and the reason

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989
pixal transparent border and the reason
 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.229
pixal transparent border and the reason
we're doing this is when you're rotating

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239
we're doing this is when you're rotating
 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.650
we're doing this is when you're rotating
a when you're rotating a rectangle and

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660
a when you're rotating a rectangle and
 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.910
a when you're rotating a rectangle and
within some view the the edges don't

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920
within some view the the edges don't
 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.130
within some view the the edges don't
actually have any values that they can

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140
actually have any values that they can
 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.510
actually have any values that they can
retrieve outside the boundaries of the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520
retrieve outside the boundaries of the
 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.550
retrieve outside the boundaries of the
rectangle so you get end up getting

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560
rectangle so you get end up getting
 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.740
rectangle so you get end up getting
these very jagged edges when you rotate

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750
these very jagged edges when you rotate
 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.770
these very jagged edges when you rotate
a rectangle but this problem can be very

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780
a rectangle but this problem can be very
 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.120
a rectangle but this problem can be very
easily abided simply by having a one

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130
easily abided simply by having a one
 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.270
easily abided simply by having a one
pixel transparent border and it's done

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280
pixel transparent border and it's done
 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.650
pixel transparent border and it's done
right here and then you'll see that the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660
right here and then you'll see that the
 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.229
right here and then you'll see that the
edges are actually smooth as you rotate

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239
edges are actually smooth as you rotate
 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.800
edges are actually smooth as you rotate
the cards then there's two methods flip

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810
the cards then there's two methods flip
 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.630
the cards then there's two methods flip
from left to right and flip from right

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640
from left to right and flip from right
 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.940
from left to right and flip from right
to left before we actually call the

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950
to left before we actually call the
 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.170
to left before we actually call the
flipping animation we need to set the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180
flipping animation we need to set the
 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.110
flipping animation we need to set the
pivot by default that x and y pivots of

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120
pivot by default that x and y pivots of
 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.170
pivot by default that x and y pivots of
all views are a long center so if you're

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180
all views are a long center so if you're
 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.850
all views are a long center so if you're
rotated would only rotate about its

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860
rotated would only rotate about its
 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.470
rotated would only rotate about its
center but saying this manually would

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480
center but saying this manually would
 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.300
center but saying this manually would
give us more precision as to how we want

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310
give us more precision as to how we want
 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.130
give us more precision as to how we want
to animate it then there's a method

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140
to animate it then there's a method
 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.839
to animate it then there's a method
called flip horizontally after we set

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849
called flip horizontally after we set
 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.360
called flip horizontally after we set
the pivot what this does is set up a lot

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370
the pivot what this does is set up a lot
 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.949
the pivot what this does is set up a lot
of use property values holder object

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959
of use property values holder object
 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.690
of use property values holder object
animators and things like that to

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700
animators and things like that to
 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.140
animators and things like that to
actually animate the rotation of it from

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150
actually animate the rotation of it from
 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.280
actually animate the rotation of it from
along the y axis by 180 degrees we also

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290
along the y axis by 180 degrees we also
 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.170
along the y axis by 180 degrees we also
add a translation animation such that

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180
add a translation animation such that
 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.910
add a translation animation such that
when it finishes animating it's in the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920
when it finishes animating it's in the
 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.770
when it finishes animating it's in the
correct offset within the corresponding

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780
correct offset within the corresponding
 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.380
correct offset within the corresponding
pallet that it animated to and what

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390
pallet that it animated to and what
 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.729
pallet that it animated to and what

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:02.380
then I play all those animations
 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.360
then I play all those animations
together and the other thing so that's

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370
together and the other thing so that's
 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:07.740
together and the other thing so that's
how you actually get the animations for

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:07.750
how you actually get the animations for
 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.200
how you actually get the animations for
every individual card and if you look in

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210
every individual card and if you look in
 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.580
every individual card and if you look in
the cárcel activity which is the main

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590
the cárcel activity which is the main
 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.850
the cárcel activity which is the main
activity all I'm doing here is looping

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:14.860
activity all I'm doing here is looping
 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.400
activity all I'm doing here is looping
through all my cards when a some stack

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.410
through all my cards when a some stack
 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.140
through all my cards when a some stack
has been tapped

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.150
has been tapped
 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.120
has been tapped
I'd retrieve that object animator that I

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.130
I'd retrieve that object animator that I
 

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.030
I'd retrieve that object animator that I
can get from my card view and the other

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:24.040
can get from my card view and the other
 

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.410
can get from my card view and the other
thing I'm doing is bringing that child

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:25.420
thing I'm doing is bringing that child
 

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.360
thing I'm doing is bringing that child
to the front so depending on how I've

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.370
to the front so depending on how I've
 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.310
to the front so depending on how I've
been flipping the cards I don't exactly

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.320
been flipping the cards I don't exactly
 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.470
been flipping the cards I don't exactly
know whether all the cards in the left

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:31.480
know whether all the cards in the left
 

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.970
know whether all the cards in the left
and on the right side are on top of the

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:32.980
and on the right side are on top of the
 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.620
and on the right side are on top of the
cards of left side so I'm just a

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:34.630
cards of left side so I'm just a
 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.510
cards of left side so I'm just a
quantity calling brain child to front to

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:36.520
quantity calling brain child to front to
 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.220
quantity calling brain child to front to
change the set order of all the cards in

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.230
change the set order of all the cards in
 

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.650
change the set order of all the cards in
the stack that I'm animating and the

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:40.660
the stack that I'm animating and the
 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.670
the stack that I'm animating and the
other thing you need to do is always

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680
other thing you need to do is always
 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.280
other thing you need to do is always
call request layout after you've called

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:44.290
call request layout after you've called
 

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.110
call request layout after you've called
brain child to front in order for those

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.120
brain child to front in order for those
 

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.570
brain child to front in order for those
effects in order for that change to take

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:48.580
effects in order for that change to take
 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.450
effects in order for that change to take
effect otherwise you'll have to wait for

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:51.460
effect otherwise you'll have to wait for
 

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.340
effect otherwise you'll have to wait for
a child to be brought to front until

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:53.350
a child to be brought to front until
 

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.960
a child to be brought to front until
somebody has requested a layer on your

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:54.970
somebody has requested a layer on your
 

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.800
somebody has requested a layer on your
view very similarly in order to achieve

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:58.810
view very similarly in order to achieve
 

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.159
view very similarly in order to achieve
the full chord rotation I am retrieving

00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:02.169
the full chord rotation I am retrieving
 

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:03.750
the full chord rotation I am retrieving
the object animators from all the cards

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:03.760
the object animators from all the cards
 

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.450
the object animators from all the cards
bringing the objects the front and doing

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:06.460
bringing the objects the front and doing
 

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.100
bringing the objects the front and doing
almost the same the exact same thing

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.110
almost the same the exact same thing
 

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.409
almost the same the exact same thing
except with a different object animator

00:08:10.409 --> 00:08:10.419
except with a different object animator
 

00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:11.700
except with a different object animator
which I can retrieve from my card view

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:11.710
which I can retrieve from my card view
 

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.159
which I can retrieve from my card view
so that's pretty much how you can flip

00:08:14.159 --> 00:08:14.169
so that's pretty much how you can flip
 

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:16.020
so that's pretty much how you can flip
cards rotate them and animate them in

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:16.030
cards rotate them and animate them in
 

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.990
cards rotate them and animate them in
different ways thanks
