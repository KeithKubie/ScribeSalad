00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.460
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: And it was really about this
issue of the competition between climate change

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:16.940
and poverty reduction. [pause] In your work
at the foundation, are you finding that competition?

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.811
Are you finding one is driving out the other
more particularly of late, and what are you

00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:24.340
going to do about it?

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.500
&gt;&gt;Thanks Tom. Tom, thanks for doing this.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.730
&gt;&gt; Tom Friedman: My pleasure.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.260
&gt;&gt; Means a lot to all of us. At the morning
talk it was almost like it was set up between

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.170
Al and Donna Antipote's conversation. Climate
change versus poverty. The funds, the discussion,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.221
the public concept. And it was all about a
gas, an atmospheric gas. But I thought it

00:00:45.221 --> 00:00:53.890
was not about carbon dioxide, it was about
oxygen. Because it's true that climate change

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.810
takes all the oxygen out of the room, and
it takes all the momentum out of people who

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.040
spent their life committed to working against
poverty and it shouldn't be like that. Not

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.740
only are the poor in the developing world
the greatest victims of climate change, but

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.230
if we don't grow economic development in the
right way they will contribute as in China

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.770
and in India to climate change in a way that
we won't be able to bring it back. So, I can't

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.180
imagine a better statement. I heard President
Clinton say that the growing disparity between

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.030
rich and poor and the marginalization of poor
people, it is unequal, unfair, unstable and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.620
unsustainable. And it contributes to insecurity
around the world. We need to be mindful of

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.970
all these things. You know, the good news
I think about our generation is that whether

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.180
we're ADD or we can parallel process, we've
got to be big enough and grown up enough to

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.920
be able to simultaneously handle more than
one threat. So what we're doing about it is,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.869
we announce five initiatives, two of them
are on poverty. And..

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.009
&gt;&gt; Tom Friedman: Go through the five.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.009
&gt;&gt; Go through the five?

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.009
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: Yeah , just real quickly

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:10.000
&gt;&gt; So taking from poverty first. I was in
Africa. Many of you were I recognize your

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.160
faces. Were at the TED conference. There was
this big fight between aide and trade, aide

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.670
and trade. But if you talk to poor people
in the developing world, they're not going

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.680
to say I want more aide, more foreign aid.
They say, I want a job; I want to be able

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.440
to feed my family, and care for my family.
I want government services that work, education

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.400
for my kids, health care, electrification,
water. So we decided that those were twin

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.400
halves of the problem of poverty and economic
development. So one of our initiatives is

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.930
to empower people, not just poor people, but
you know starting off with poor people in

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.200
the developing world. So that they know what
public services, government and other public

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.090
services, are available. And empower them
to take advantage, to avail of, and to have

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.150
access to these services. Governments are
not bad, but we have this illusion that third

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.220
world governments are corrupt and incompetent.
There's wonderful governments in the developing

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.910
world and sometimes they just don't have the
tools to deliver what they want to do. So

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.142
the other half is to try to help governments
develop those tools and that draws in Google's

00:03:13.142 --> 00:03:20.390
technology and our information services. The
other initiative in the area of poverty is

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.220
job creation. And two thirds of all the jobs
in the United States are created by small

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.430
and medium sized enterprises. You'd think
it was the same in the developing world, it's

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.610
not. Less than fifteen percent of all the
jobs in the developing world are created by

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.000
small and medium sized enterprises. The bulk
of jobs now are created by these big, large

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.070
corporations, mostly extraction industry.
So if we can fire up the small and medium

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.150
sized entrepreneur, that's where all the jobs
will come from. We hope to be able to play

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.700
a role in that. In the area of health, and
in particularly the area of pandemics, and

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.890
in merging communicable diseases, there have
been three dozen new diseases that have jumped

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.989
from animals to humans in the last thirty
years. Any one of which under the wrong circumstances

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.830
could become pandemic. Or one of which already
has, HIV/AIDs, is a pandemic, and it jumped

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.160
from monkeys to humans. We worry about bird
flu and SARS, but there's also Ebola, basa

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.469
fever, marvric, you can chant them in a religious
way, all these diseases. You realize, something's

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:27.960
changed. And so what we're trying to do is
to fund early warning systems and increase

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.779
the availability of good response. And then
lastly, what we were talking about this morning,

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:39.409
our issues in energy and climate change, which
Larry and Surgay are going to talk more about.

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:46.449
On the one hand we, and I really appreciate
Al, you saying that r e less than c captures

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.029
the imagination of the problem. What Larry
said in the press conference, a little bit

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:55.389
wonkie, but you know, or a little nerdy, I
forgot what you said. It was something like

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.960
that. But it really captures the equation
exactly right. Until you can create utility

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.550
grade electricity from renewable energy at
a price cheaper than coal, but coal will be

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.490
burned. I lived in India ten years; every
lump of coal will be burned unless there's

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.809
a cheaper way to produce energy. So we're
really committed to that, and I'll let Larry

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:21.949
or Surgay or both, talk about what we're doing
inside of Google to mount an opportunity to

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:28.589
create our own one gig watt renewable energy
production facility. The flip of that equation

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:33.999
though is, as you said, we have to be able
to internalize the externalities of bad health

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:40.069
consequences of coal because the equation
only works when it's the right cost, the fully

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:46.699
loaded cost of coal and the fully loaded cost
of renewal. The last of our, our climate initiatives,

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:52.360
is to try to create a world in which not only
the coal stays in the ground but the oil stays

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.279
in the ground, the petroleum, the gasoline,
isn't consumed. And that really means electric

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:04.360
cars; it might mean temporarily, plug in hybrids.
But so long as you plug into a grid that is

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:10.689
mostly coal you do, you get some marginal
improvements but not substantial improvements.

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:15.309
If you have a grid which is green, and you
plug into a green grid, and the combination,

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:19.999
those two things really deal with almost fifty
percent of all of greenhouse gas emissions.

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:22.830
So I didn't mean to take so much time but
those are our five initiatives.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.969
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: Terrific.. Larry let me start
with you, take us back to your own internal

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:34.110
conversations about R E less than C which
stands for renewable energy cheaper than coal.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:40.990
Why you decided to go into the energy space,
it's a big move for Google. And what do you

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:47.529
think a company like Google could bring to
the goal of one giga watt of clean power,

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:51.729
enough to power San Francisco, that maybe
others haven't?

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:56.839
&gt;&gt;Larry: Yeah I think we were really luck
to be at the intersection of a bunch of different

00:06:56.839 --> 00:07:02.550
things. Being in Silicon Valley we had lots
of friends and companies working in renewable

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.129
energy area. We also had this sort of relentless
demand for people on the internet to do things.

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:10.279
People searching, and email, and all those
things.

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:13.580
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: How did that manifest itself?
How did it you sort of, how did you notice

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.580
it?

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.669
&gt;&gt;Larry: Well we you know actually have to
buy computers to hold everybody's email and

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:21.560
everybody's searches and web and there's huge
numbers of computers and the energy to power

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:28.529
those. And you know we want Google to work.
You don't want to go to Google and say oh

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:34.370
sorry we're busy right now. [laughter] That
would be really bad so we're farced to be

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:39.139
very practical about that. And so we've had,
you know, we had a team going around building

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:44.259
data centers and finding energy, and so on,
and doing that worldwide, because we want

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:51.599
our service to be fast everywhere. And because
of that we really noticed we're getting you

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:56.559
know we have some facilities for example that
are close to dams and so on. But a lot of

00:07:56.559 --> 00:08:00.009
times we're really displacing somebody else
who would use that energy. It's not that by

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:03.309
building a data center next to a dam, the
dam's already being used.

00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:04.309
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: Right

00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:07.360
&gt;&gt;Larry:Maybe you know there's not quite as
much transmission as there would have been

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:14.060
but it's not that that's such a green way
of doing it. And you know many places you

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.569
know you basically see that you know we would
see in buying a lot of electricity you know

00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:22.620
where you get it cheaply it's from coal. And
you know the business side of our company

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.909
is saying well you know let's buy the cheap
electricity and make sure you know our bottom

00:08:26.909 --> 00:08:30.939
line is good and all that. And we're kind
of looking, this isn't good right, computers

00:08:30.939 --> 00:08:35.759
are using more and more electricity people
are doing more things with them and that's

00:08:35.759 --> 00:08:43.209
the cost of your computing that's electricity
is going up as a percentage. It's actually

00:08:43.209 --> 00:08:47.700
pretty significant it might even approach
the cost of computers themselves. And because

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:52.370
of that we said well why aren't we making
renewable energy cheaper than you can get

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:57.880
it from coal. That would be the easy decision
to make. Say we're gonna get it cheaply and

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:05.230
it's going to be green. And there's tons of
start ups in the space, we invested in some,

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:09.720
we had friends in many different ones. And
the problem we had is that all the start ups,

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.449
they can basically have an incredible business
making electricity at 10 cents a kilowatt

00:09:12.449 --> 00:09:19.259
hour. And the reason is there's tremendous
demand for renewable energy. We would buy

00:09:19.259 --> 00:09:25.579
it at a higher price but you know, you're
not gonna fundamentally change the game unless

00:09:25.579 --> 00:09:29.569
it's cheaper than coal. And the problem for
a start up, you know they're looking at well

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:33.949
we wanna succeed and we can make it at 10
cents and succeed but we really wanna make

00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:39.529
it at 3 cents to really change the world.
And we want those projects that could be 3

00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:43.940
cents to start right now. And we're willing
to take you know the risks on those things

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.560
and obviously if you succeed in one of those
things you're going to have a great business.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.920
But it's very rational for start ups to say
we're not going to take that risk we're going

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.209
to you know produce it at the 10 cents and
we're gonna have a great business and you

00:09:56.209 --> 00:10:02.110
know we want our business to grow slowly and
our primary goal is not to fix that world.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:06.660
Where as we have a little bit of luxury of
driving some of those products forward. So

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.709
I think we saw that there wasn't enough investment
in some of those things. And we also saw,

00:10:11.709 --> 00:10:16.080
we talked to enough people that you know if
you really push the start up and the people

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.120
who are really smart on this thing, you say
well do you guys have a way of doing it at

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.519
3 cents. They say yeah we do, it's a little
bit modestly higher risk. But we have a clear

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:28.791
path to get there and you're like well why
don't we get going on that now, what do you

00:10:28.791 --> 00:10:33.329
need? You know you get some people and a little
bit of money an so on. That's relatively modest

00:10:33.329 --> 00:10:34.329
resource.

00:10:34.329 --> 00:10:38.779
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: Surgay tell us a little bit
about where the initiative is right now? Are

00:10:38.779 --> 00:10:45.240
you exploring different clean power alternatives?
Which ones attract you? Sort of where are

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:51.959
they? And what can Google bring to this that
an Exxon Mobile or Chevron can't?

00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:57.790
&gt;&gt;Surgay: Well, just first off, where we are
right now. We highlighted three areas of renewable

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:11.500
energy that we thought would be good initial
focuses. Solar thermal, also deep geothermal

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.900
and [pause] good one, high altitude winds.
I should clarify specifically.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.829
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: Why those three? As you winded
them down what..

00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:23.879
&gt;&gt;Surgay: We were looking at the options around
at the time. I think there are potentially

00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:29.759
a few others that could make the cut. If I
had to add one I would say photolotaeics.

00:11:29.759 --> 00:11:37.579
But [pause] I think these are three that are
known into the renewable energy community,

00:11:37.579 --> 00:11:45.839
but not broadly kind of thought about, well
understood. And currently for example, if

00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:50.959
you look at wind power, the wind mills are
on par with colt today other intermittent

00:11:50.959 --> 00:11:56.999
power you know one can't always rely on to
be there. But they are pretty good. We think

00:11:56.999 --> 00:12:02.749
that it can be even cheaper by using high
altitude winds. And we highlighted one company

00:12:02.749 --> 00:12:10.990
that we're working with call McCotney, they
use kites at potentially high altitudes to

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:15.600
generate and you know kites much cheaper to
make than big metal wind mills. So that's

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.470
a really interesting one. If you imagine getting
power that cheap, I mean that could be substantially

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:26.579
cheaper than coal. The other one solar thermal
is pretty well known, I mean you already see

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:32.160
these things with the big parabolic trenches
and the solar towers an what not. And it's

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:39.529
something that it just seems like there's
just a little bit of really basic just engineering

00:12:39.529 --> 00:12:44.249
and development to make that be really cheap.
I mean there's no inherit barrier in the way

00:12:44.249 --> 00:12:49.870
if you kind of you know you just need so much
mirrored surface and you can kind of do the

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.100
math. And the existing companies, the situation
that Larry said, you know they feel that if

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.319
they can produce at 10 cents which they take
the more conservative engineering route, they'll

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:02.519
still have a great business. We want to push
them a little bit more saying you know we're

00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:10.519
willing to risk these maybe being not you
know not quite as 100 percent guaranteed to

00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:13.779
pan out but we want to bring it down to 3
cents or something like that.

00:13:13.779 --> 00:13:17.240
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: So just to technically how
you're doing it. You found a stable of companies

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.361
in these different areas and you've invested
in them?

00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:26.350
&gt;&gt;Surgay: We have done investment in both
solar thermal as well as the high altitude

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:31.579
wind. We think that we should have some of
these things going on in house. We don't have

00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:36.430
the in house research going on yet but we
are hiring in those areas. And deep geothermal

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:44.640
is actually another example of one because
if you look at Iceland or something like that,

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:51.279
in those areas that have that that works pretty
well for them. That's not necessarily you

00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:56.339
know dirt cheap, I guess it's kind of dirt
cheap. Literally.

00:13:56.339 --> 00:14:00.939
[laughter]
But it's anyway there's reason to believe

00:14:00.939 --> 00:14:05.720
that if you go really deep and actually take
advantage of the technology that the dirty

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:11.529
industries take in terms of drilling and what
not that you can actually have geothermal

00:14:11.529 --> 00:14:16.660
power be cheap and available almost everywhere
around the world. And that's really exciting,

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.829
that's a little bit further off. This is where
you don't really see start ups because it

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:22.370
requires more fundamental research.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:28.709
&gt;&gt;Larry:A gentleman from Ireland I think is
here, they have 400 megawatts of geothermal

00:14:28.709 --> 00:14:32.569
I think they own so there's a lot of great
work going on in those areas.

00:14:32.569 --> 00:14:41.379
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: Larry what, Larry Page. Two
questions. One is, what is it, you guys have

00:14:41.379 --> 00:14:45.660
been an amazing innovation company in the
area of search, what's the difference between

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:51.009
doing innovation in something like search,
bits and bytes, and doing innovation in something

00:14:51.009 --> 00:14:57.480
like energy which is atoms, molecules? In
terms of being able to really do this kind

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:03.019
of breakthrough innovation. What's the difference
in working in these two areas?

00:15:03.019 --> 00:15:04.490
[pause] [laughter]

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:09.410
&gt;&gt;Larry Page: I mean I don't find it to be
that different, we've had a fair amount of

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.749
work that's going on just making our data
centers efficient and actually a lot of the

00:15:13.749 --> 00:15:18.540
people and knowledge we've had in pursuing
some of the energy related things are those

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:24.899
people. We're basically borrowing those people
a little bit from their day jobs and hopefully

00:15:24.899 --> 00:15:29.959
Google will still answer your query. [laughter]
We've had just wonderful people in those areas.

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:35.019
I think you know what you need are people
who are willing to take a new way of doing

00:15:35.019 --> 00:15:39.769
things and so on and who know enough about
the area to make some progress.

00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:43.649
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedmand:What's been the reaction of
the energy companies? The Exxon mobiles, suddenly

00:15:43.649 --> 00:15:48.439
they wake up one morning, they read the paper
that Google's going into the energy business.

00:15:48.439 --> 00:15:51.639
And these are companies that are historically,
Al Gore and I were talking about this on the

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:55.939
way over, you know they're expert at pushing
things into the future and seems like you

00:15:55.939 --> 00:16:01.319
guys want to claim the future now as opposed
to always keeping the future just ten years

00:16:01.319 --> 00:16:04.610
out you know. What's been their reaction?

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:09.439
&gt;&gt;Surgay:I haven't talked to many of them,
I would suspect that their reaction is different

00:16:09.439 --> 00:16:14.639
depending on which one. Like Exxon I don't
know would be the same as BP for example.

00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:19.779
But some of these companies like BP are certainly
very interested in investing in these green

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:23.209
technologies. I think we have a little bit
of benefit that we don't have an existing

00:16:23.209 --> 00:16:27.639
business that you know we're worried about
cannibalizing or anything like that. We bring

00:16:27.639 --> 00:16:31.559
that to the table. I do want to highlight
one important difference between doing web

00:16:31.559 --> 00:16:36.910
search and things like that and the energy
business, or at least web search when we started

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:43.110
it. Right now, it you want to prove a success
in energy, there's a certain scale you have

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:48.009
to achieve. Otherwise you can't demonstrate
the cost effectiveness of your product. And

00:16:48.009 --> 00:16:52.029
that probably means putting in you know a
hundred million dollar plants or something

00:16:52.029 --> 00:16:57.439
like that. And there's a big bet at some point
that you have to make and it takes a lot of

00:16:57.439 --> 00:17:04.279
capital. And that's, we feel that this maturation,
or a company, that we have a fair amount of

00:17:04.279 --> 00:17:09.439
capital and we're willing to probably be riskier
with it than other companies. Like we can

00:17:09.439 --> 00:17:14.970
take a chance on a data center. I think that
puts us in position to do things that other

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:15.970
companies wouldn't.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.679
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: I'm gonna get to that Larry
in a second. But I propose that Larry Page,

00:17:18.679 --> 00:17:21.339
what's been the reaction of your share holders?

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:26.939
&gt;&gt;Larry Page: I mean I think it's been fine.
I think that westated, we stated, that we

00:17:26.939 --> 00:17:31.770
would make investments, capital investments
and hundreds of millions of dollars that would

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:36.040
be, that would generate positive returns.
And I think we said, just what Surgay just

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.970
said, we take some more risk in those but
it would be modest and we expect them to net

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:44.549
out positive. We're already doing that in
the course of building out our infrastrusture

00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:50.860
in data centers and so on. So I think that
reaction was fine. In terms of hiring people

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:55.840
and really getting these projects going, I
mean, those are, you know, if we can hire

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.830
a thousand people that are really excited
about doing this we would. But we're not going

00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:59.830
to find those people.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:05.710
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman:Very brilliant. One of the
things we talked about at the morning session

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:10.399
is, I've always had this feeling that it's
much more important to change your leaders

00:18:10.399 --> 00:18:16.270
than your light bulbs. Because leaders write
rules, rules shape markets, markets give you

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:22.960
scale. But one of the problems we're had,
you almost couldn't make this up. People don't

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.110
realize because it was actually badly reported.
We just passed an energy bill where we threw

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:32.210
out the incentives or we did not include the
incentives in wind or solar, and we maintained

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:38.950
those in oil, gas, and coal. Nick Romney just
won a Michigan primary, the republican party,

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:46.140
by promising to get rid of the mileage standards
just passed by congress. That is dumb as we

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:52.891
want to be, you could not make that up, but
we just did that. [Applause] Now how do you

00:18:52.891 --> 00:18:59.370
[pause] succeed in this space without taking
(pardon the editorializing) but I read the

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:08.149
column now and I had to get it out you know
[laughter] Can you succeed in this space,

00:19:08.149 --> 00:19:13.110
I'm interested in all three of you, without
taking more of a political position? [pause]

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:18.260
&gt;&gt;So, what do they do in law? They say I'd
like to incorporate by reference his comments.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:32.240
[laughter] I'm accused often of being, maybe,
a little rosy eyed or rosy glasses, whatever

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:37.390
the expression is. Where's Donna to help me?
The people who have fought against [pause]

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:43.410
protecting us against climate change, a very,
very small percentage of them are bad people.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:49.110
It would be disingenuous if you didn't recognize
them. Very small percentage are bad people.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:53.860
They have children or they have grandchildren.
Whether they call it earth stewardship or

00:19:53.860 --> 00:20:01.560
they call it protecting their kinds from using,
they're good people. We have some how failed

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:07.890
to articulate in the most compelling way the
urgency of the moment. Let me just take the

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.630
moment to say, when we talked earlier about
the conflict between poverty and climate.

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:18.240
I think this is an extraordinarily sophisticated
audience. But you know, I had a conversation

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:23.000
with Mohammed Unis, he's been friends with
me for thirty years. Think of his whole body

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.950
of work, five million woman who have had loans,
all of them had paid it back because of micro

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:34.159
credit, moving into telephony. We had a deal
with him where the save a foundation will

00:20:34.159 --> 00:20:40.090
do surgery on blind people and he'll give
a micro credit loan to people who are blind.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:44.970
Bangladesh and the rest of the world had benefitted
from everything he's done. All of which will

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:54.220
be washed away if you have a sea rise of three
meters. So you can't separate the quest for

00:20:54.220 --> 00:21:01.350
dignity and fight against poverty and climate
change. And I think that, so he gets it now,

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:05.710
Mohammed Unis gets it. People working in the
developing world get it. They know that while

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:12.179
they want to battle urgently for the hurt
that poor people feel today, you know, the

00:21:12.179 --> 00:21:16.929
two million who died this year of malaria.
They also know that with climate change it

00:21:16.929 --> 00:21:23.770
will be five or seven million. We have failed
to get that degree of awareness and understanding

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:28.400
in congress and in senate and in the political
leadership. It's our failure. We can't give

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:34.110
up on that. So the areas that we're taking
aim at, I guess, because you got to be focused.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:39.500
We're very interested in internalizing the
extranalities, the negative help extranalities

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:48.519
of coal. When you dig for coal, you kill people.
Miners die. They get black lung disease, they

00:21:48.519 --> 00:21:53.960
get other respiratory disease. They're children
and our children miss school, we miss work,

00:21:53.960 --> 00:22:00.090
for respiratory disease caused by coal. You
only have to be in Beijing for a moment to

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:09.400
understand that. So the regulatory issues,
the policy issues, about how we truly, what's

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:15.320
the true costing for coal. It's not just the
marginal cost of extracting one lump of coal,

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.832
it's what does society pay for it. I liken
it to second hand smoking issue. And that's

00:22:19.832 --> 00:22:20.929
where I think we can go.

00:22:20.929 --> 00:22:23.961
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: How do we change, how do we
reframe the debate though? So you gave Al

00:22:23.961 --> 00:22:29.770
Quota these numbers this morning, nearlyer
three thousand questions asked up til now

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:35.240
on the Sunday morning talk shows, and on all
the debates. And three on climate in this

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:39.789
election. And as Al said there were three
on UFOs. So climate and UFOs are now equal.

00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:47.299
[laughter] Whare are we doing, what is Google
doing? What is the plan to reframe the debate?

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:51.950
&gt;&gt;Earlier I think Bono said this would be,
maybe Al said, this would be the first time

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:59.130
that public movement took place in order to
raise taxes in trade. I think it's much more

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:04.240
compelling to look at what happened with second
hand smoking. There was a time, how many of

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.570
you remember when all of the chief executive
officers of all the tobacco companies raised

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.010
their hand and said no it doesn't hurt, it
doesn't hurt anybody at all and I smoke it

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:17.120
all the time. You know we need to reframe
the debate. We need to understand the negative

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:23.250
consequences of the way in which we are developing
our world. And coal is a great example. And

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:28.640
that's a role that we can play. We can fund
research with credible researches who will

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.700
identify all the extranlities of coal. It
shouldn't be Google saying we don't like coal,

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:38.190
it should be here are the best researched
in the world and we're gonna give them grants

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:42.700
so they can cost that out. Those are the kinds
of things I think we can do. Far more affective

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.451
than going to Washington and saying we're
Google you got to stop digging for coal. That

00:23:46.451 --> 00:23:51.210
is not going to necessarily going to have
the desired effect.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:56.120
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: Ok. Larry, knowing what you
guys know now about the energy business. And

00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.070
how we get to scale. We're going to have an
election, we're going to get a new president.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:04.980
Afterpoe that issue. What do you think would
be the most helpful thing, in terms of your

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:09.860
own project, that the next president, him
or her, decides on day one around the energy

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.370
space. Which would be most helpful in getting
your energy scale?

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:17.600
&gt;&gt;Larry Page:I don't know the best possible
thing. One thing that I'm concerned about

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.669
is transmission and I'll just tell the whole
story. I went to the university of Michigan

00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:27.779
in engineering, and like 20 years before I
got there they closed their power transmissions

00:24:27.779 --> 00:24:32.309
school. They had a school that dealt with
high tension wires and power transmission

00:24:32.309 --> 00:24:37.890
that was closed long, long before I got there.
And you know surprisingly that area hasn't

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:42.620
advanced that much. I'm pretty concerned,
what Surgay mentioned about wind is very true.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:48.880
The cost of a windmill, the power is competitive
with coal now except for transmission and

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.320
the variability. If you have better transmission
that really helps you with the variability.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:57.809
There's been studies that show, for example,
Europe, they get 90 percent of their energy

00:24:57.809 --> 00:25:08.910
from wind at a cost equal to coal. 90 percent
just from wind, at the same cost as coal,

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:12.809
if they have better transmission.. It's kind
of terrible that there's nobody working in

00:25:12.809 --> 00:25:17.860
it as far as I can tell, or very, very few
people. And even if we did have the technologies

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:21.919
that were better for the transmissions, the
ones we have are probably good enough to solve

00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:27.540
Europe's energy needs. But the odds that they'll
get deployed across a wide area like that

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:33.139
are probably close to zero without somebody
like a U.S. president, or somebody powerful

00:25:33.139 --> 00:25:37.559
saying we're gonna build really good transmission
so that we can have better renewable energy

00:25:37.559 --> 00:25:39.159
and solve some of these problems.

00:25:39.159 --> 00:25:41.799
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman:Kind of an interstate highway
system for the grid.

00:25:41.799 --> 00:25:46.899
&gt;&gt;Larry Page:Yeah right now you know if you
order a transformer 30 years is an expedited

00:25:46.899 --> 00:25:51.371
delivery. We know that because we've ordered
transformers. So I think you know in that

00:25:51.371 --> 00:25:55.120
kind of environment, we're not going to see
very fast progress resolving these energy

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.870
issues. So I say transmission. We should always
just assume that we're gonna need better transmission.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:03.330
It would be nice to use more energy than we
use now and having it be renewable. You know

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:09.690
we're not going to get any of those things
unless we have better transmissions and that's

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:11.070
gotta be a governmental issue.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:15.380
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: Surgay, other than transmission,
what would be yours? What do you think the

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:18.030
next president could do that would be less
selfish?

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:25.520
&gt;&gt;Surgay: I think that we want to be on an
equal playing field with renewable and coal

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:32.690
and dirty energy. I think people kind of under
appreciate that right now and think wow all

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:38.120
the subsidies and taxes on dirty energys.
But the situation right now is very opposite

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:45.130
of that. If you just look at, Larry mentioned,
the pulmonary disease effects of coal, not

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:51.139
to mention the particulate of a lot of our
transportation. If you look at the Iraq war,

00:26:51.139 --> 00:26:54.919
which whether you want to believe that the
U.S. is in there for oil or not. Certainly

00:26:54.919 --> 00:27:01.280
the reason that Saddam had all that military
might was because of that oil money that we

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:07.549
paid. If you look at things like the cost
you put on renewables, the tariffs on Brazilian

00:27:07.549 --> 00:27:13.860
ethanol right now. Because I would today,
sure I'd run my car on Brazilian sugar cane

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:18.490
ethanol, but the tariffs make it prohibited.
Even though it's the equivalent of 30-40 dollars

00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:27.980
a barrel in Brazil today. I have friends who
have electric car companies and if you look

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:33.289
up the regulatory hurdles they have to go
through to get their cars on the road , all

00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:38.030
the crash testing and what not. It's true
that car companies do all the crash testing

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:42.451
on their gas cars, but they don't on the motorcycles.
And you know the motorcycles are unsafe, so

00:27:42.451 --> 00:27:47.730
why not, a budding young company can sell
a few hundred electric vehicles prior having

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:55.559
to go through all of that. Which may very
well be very safe. And also none of these

00:27:55.559 --> 00:28:06.690
car companies are forced to consider the safety
of the people that they hit. It's kind of

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:10.559
a funny thing. I also having, we've installed
a lot of solar capacity at our campus.

00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:13.720
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: Talk about that a little bit.
What you guys have done. And what you've learned

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.899
from your own experiences.

00:28:14.899 --> 00:28:22.139
&gt;&gt;Surgay: I think we're up to 1.6 megawatts
or something like that now. We installed them

00:28:22.139 --> 00:28:27.570
on the roofs of our building as well as we
built car ports and things like that. It's

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:33.630
been great. It creates shade, it reduces our
power costs, it's been a good investment.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:37.970
But there were a lot of hurdles. And most
of the hurdles aren't technical, they're not

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:42.760
financial, they're just regulatory. You know
by the time you got all the permits to do

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:47.690
this that and the other. I don't think these
are people conspiring against clean technology,

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:55.049
it's just by the time you ad up all the federal,
state, local, government zoning, planing what

00:28:55.049 --> 00:29:01.279
not, it adds up to a really big burden. Where
as if you use status quo technology, just

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:06.679
plug me into the grid, you don't have to do
anything, somebody just shows up. A friend

00:29:06.679 --> 00:29:13.590
of mine recently installed a fiber to his
office building, and had to cross a small

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:18.549
creek so they had to put up a post. All these
people showed up and they had to verify if

00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:23.460
it would withstand a 200 mile per hour wind
and what not. And the guy who erected it,

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:29.130
who normally puts it up for the power company
there, PGNE, said oh PGNE doesn't really have

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:34.960
to listen to any of those regulations, I just
put up a pole, don't have to go through any

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:41.630
of that. So there's just all of these hidden
barriers to clean energy today that don't

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:46.080
exist for dirty energy that's just the truth
of the world as it stands today.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:51.840
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: Larry Page, one of the things
that Google is trying to do is unlock ownership

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:59.820
in the world as it is in overcoming poverty.
A lot of people have taken a crack at that

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:07.380
and it failed. What do you think you guys
could bring, or are bringing to that initiative

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.710
that might make it work where others have
failed?

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:13.679
&gt;&gt;Larry Page: well I think that the problems
that you have left in the developing world

00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:18.279
are the really, really hard ones. I try to
take a lot of vacation time and travel around

00:30:18.279 --> 00:30:23.020
there to really understand kind of understnad
what's really going on. And there's been already

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:30.070
tremendous work by many different people,
a lot of which are in this room. So I think

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:35.210
that we're going to try to do something, something
more. We've been running things like business

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:40.980
plan competitions, which I've seen personally
some of the works of. And I think the things

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:46.010
that I've seen that have been successful in
these areas aren't like massive amounts of

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:51.380
labor, but a very careful, kind os seeded
attempt to generate a little bit of knowledge

00:30:51.380 --> 00:31:01.330
in local people. Like you should have a business
plan or you should think about what you're

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:02.330
going to do, then compete about it and talk
about it and learn about how to do that.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:04.559
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: Talk about that, you started
a competition around business plans. Talk

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:06.629
about that a little bit.

00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:10.760
&gt;&gt;Larry Page: I mean that's basically it,
you just have local entrepreneurs, you have

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:16.220
a big event, you give out a prize, a little
bit of money for the winner which gets the

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:22.820
winner ability to get funding and all those
things. It's just that whole mechanism, the

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:28.590
Silicon valley it's just what people do for
breakfast. They know how to do that, and in

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:33.250
Kenya or somewhere, they've never seen that
before. But once you get that started and

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:36.159
you get a community around, you get a few
hundred people involved first, then you get

00:31:36.159 --> 00:31:40.509
thousands and so on. I think that's how you
are going to make progress, with local people.

00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:46.610
And there's some idea that makes sense there
and really just growing that and making it

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:51.540
happen. I do think that having a lot of enterprise,
I mean there's a lot of things going on in

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:59.259
these places. But having a little bit of organized
enterprise having some of these things that

00:31:59.259 --> 00:32:05.240
we know how to do just getting that idea into
people's heads is really important. You go

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:11.360
to these places and they don't have any debt
financing. I was in Ghana for example recently

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:17.309
and they don't have any debt financing for
houses really. And you're like well no wonder

00:32:17.309 --> 00:32:19.220
it's hard for people to buy house. There's
no money for people to buy a house. You can't

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:26.190
secure it. We've discovered that's an important
thing. And somehow just getting that idea.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:31.660
And the people there are very capable and
they can really run with those things once

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.360
people know about that.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.411
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: when you are made aware of
a problem like that do you call up Larry and

00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:45.419
say hey is there some way we can get financing
to local banks, or start our own? What do

00:32:45.419 --> 00:32:46.500
you do with an idea like that?

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.870
&gt;&gt;Larry Page:I think we just try to talk about
them.. It's not, I think again, these are

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:54.340
the problems that are really hard that haven't
been solved yet and a lot of people haven't

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:59.669
been working on them. So there's usually 10
different things standing in your way. You

00:32:59.669 --> 00:33:05.480
don't' have the body of law. The way they
do land ownership there, or a lot of these

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.299
countries you don't really know who owns the
land or you don't have clear titles. It's

00:33:09.299 --> 00:33:14.789
hard to have that based on, so you just run
until you. The reason why it's not solved

00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:17.840
it because there's 10 things that need to
be done. It doesn't mean you shouldn't try

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.950
to do those things.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:27.120
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: Surgay, talk about what you've
learned in China and India energy space. You

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:33.139
obviously compete in China in the field of
search. What do you see there that excites

00:33:33.139 --> 00:33:36.330
you or not about in the energy field?
Surgay: well I think primarily in China what

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:44.950
it stretched out about the energy space, the
number of coal plants that are going up there.

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:50.960
That's gonna be a really big challenge. I
think it is important for us to solve the

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:57.889
problem in the U.S. first ahead of pushing
the developing countries. But I do think that

00:33:57.889 --> 00:34:06.460
we need to do it quickly before it's too late
for those other countries. And I think there's

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:13.190
a lot of reason for hope there too. If I drift
a little bit further to the field to Bhutan

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:20.320
which my wife and I visited a year and a half
ago. There's treks there where you hike up,

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:24.493
you know you go really high and get altitude
sickness. You're up in the middle of nowhere.

00:34:24.493 --> 00:34:28.340
And the only people you run into are these
Yak Crickers. They don't really have anything,

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:33.340
they just have old tarp which they put over
a few rocks, they have their yak which are

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:40.360
wondering around far away. They only had one
piece of technology, well two, they had a

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:44.970
solar cell and an LED light. And it's a most
amazing thing.

00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:49.600
Tom Friedman: And a battery also, that's related.
[laughter]

00:34:49.600 --> 00:35:01.340
&gt;&gt;Surgay: Anyway you walk around, you're in
a really remote part of the world, kind of

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:06.200
in the sky and that's what they have there.
And it makes a lot of sense. First they have

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:11.470
a legal system where they are trying to prevent
deforestation so people can't just chop down

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:17.180
trees to make fire. And they do take some
and they use that for cooking. But they don't

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:24.040
use that just for their night light that they
need. And it turns out to be really, even

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.230
though for them I'm sure it's expensive to
buy solar cell, it's still really cheap compared

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:32.170
to the alternatives. And I think that makes
sense in a lot of places around the world.

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:36.450
Africa for example, where you don't have the
transmission lines, you don't' have great

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:43.080
roads to transport the diesel fuel. Not to
mention it's 100 dollars a barrel now anyway.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:49.650
All these places, even at today's photolataeic
prices, it make a lot of sense to install

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:54.970
photolataeics. And I think you're going to
see that trend accelerate. Because this technology

00:35:54.970 --> 00:36:00.350
has become cheaper more ambiguous and nothing
has been improving in the dirty space.

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:06.900
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedmand: Do you notice, in terms of
Google trends, if you've looked at this, or

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:12.300
if you can, in terms of what are people searching
for in terms of solutions. Climate change,

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:20.010
energy, clean energy, solar. Do you see anything
showing up there in Google trends at all

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:24.310
&gt;&gt;Larry Page: I haven't really looked at that.
I think people are definitely much more aware

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:30.560
of these things and it's hard for every day
people to know what to do. I mean you have

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:35.440
to compact fluorescent and so on. But I do
think a lot of the changes that need to get

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:41.780
made are the bigger issues, transmission and
bringing down costs, and all those things.

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:43.130
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedmand: I want to open up the floor,
we have so many...
