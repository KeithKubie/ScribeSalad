PAIGE BAILEY: Hi,
I'm Paige Bailey,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.880
and I'm a TensorFlow
developer advocate at Google,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.470
here for TensorFlow Meets
with Sebastian Thrun,

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.020
founder of Udacity,
founder of Google X,

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.157
renowned deep learning
researcher, and--

00:00:16.157 --> 00:00:16.990
did I miss anything?

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.040
SEBASTIAN THRUN: [LAUGHS]
That's good enough.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.690
PAIGE BAILEY:
[LAUGHS] Excellent.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.520
So we're really
excited to have you

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.680
here today to talk
about the new Udacity

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.780
course for TensorFlow 2.0.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.650
Can you tell us a little
bit more about it?

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.530
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Well,
it's our second course

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.540
between my company,
Udacity, and Google.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.330
We launched the original
TensorFlow course a while back.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.000
And over 40,000 students
took this free course

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.600
and became TensorFlow
developers,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.600
which is really amazing.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.950
I think it's the most
successful platform ever.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.200
Now, with the launch of
TensorFlow 2.0 Alpha,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.310
we have a new course,
right on time,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.450
called Introduction to
TensorFlow, Induction

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.520
to Deep Learning.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.683
And you can find it on the
web at Udacity.com/TensorFlow.

00:00:54.683 --> 00:00:55.600
PAIGE BAILEY: Perfect.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.660
And for the students who
are taking the course,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.800
I know that sometimes they might
feel a little bit apprehensive,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.269
that maybe they
don't necessarily

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.940
have the mathematical background
they need in order to be

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.980
successful at deep learning.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.160
Is that really the case,
or does this course kind

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.230
of take them from
zero to deep learning

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.480
engineer just within the
space of a few lessons?

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.480
SEBASTIAN THRUN: So we
are really changing this.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.550
I agree, many courses
require a lot of math.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.560
We don't.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.950
Students can sign up without
any PhD or any extensive math

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.070
experience.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.030
And here's the cool
thing about TensorFlow,

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.120
it actually makes computer
program easier, not harder.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.180
And the reason is, in the past,
to be a software engineer,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.220
you had to give
these dumb computers

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.670
a step by step recipe
called software what to do.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.410
And these dumb
computers would have

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.080
to follow every single step,
and that is actually pretty hard

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.160
to do.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.250
Now, with TensorFlow
2.0, all you do is you

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.190
train based on examples, right.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.180
You give examples
to the computer,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.610
and the computer find its
own rules that actually makes

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.150
programming easier, not harder.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.550
So I encourage
anybody in the world,

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.680
no matter what your
background is, to try it out.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.748
And you can become
a TensorFlow expert.

00:02:05.748 --> 00:02:07.540
PAIGE BAILEY: It feels
pretty magic, right,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.780
to be able to take data and then
whatever your expected output

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.810
should be, and to be able to
generate the rules that you

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.720
would otherwise have to
painstakingly turn into FL

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.125
statements or something.

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:19.750
SEBASTIAN THRUN:
Yeah, and it's amazing

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.630
what happens right now in
society thanks to TensorFlow

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.840
and deep learning.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.720
We now in medicine
have examples where

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.140
TensorFlow gets better results
than the best human physicians.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.180
In law, we have
areas like, whatever,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.310
legal document
discovery and contract

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.490
drafting, where the TensorFlow
outperforms the best

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.630
human experts.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.000
Self-driving cars now massively
use TensorFlow these days.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.140
So there are so many areas
where you can take your skills

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.000
and bring them to the
betterment of rules

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.190
if you just take
this one free course.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.000
PAIGE BAILEY: Yes.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.540
And I heard also, I believe,
that you guys are using machine

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.200
learning for Udacity to optimize
your curriculum for students as

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.700
well, right?

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.908
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yes, so
we've massively used machine

00:02:58.908 --> 00:03:01.330
learning to help sort students
into the right curriculum

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.190
and then helping them
making through it,

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.100
because our goal at Udacity
is to close the talent

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.900
gap and the skills
gap and really empower

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.430
everybody to have a job
in the modern world.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.722
So that's part of our strategy.

00:03:11.722 --> 00:03:12.722
PAIGE BAILEY: Excellent.

00:03:12.722 --> 00:03:15.400
So it sounds like students,
all they would have to do is go

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.480
to Udacity.com/TensorFlow,
sign up for the free course,

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.210
and begin the learning
experience to find out all

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.600
about TensorFlow 2.0.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.620
SEBASTIAN THRUN: Yeah,
and in this free course,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.300
we have a guarantee.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.310
If you don't like it,
you get your money back.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.010
PAIGE BAILEY: [LAUGHS] Awesome.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.590
So remember to try out
our TensorFlow 2.0 course

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.930
on Udacity at
Udacity.com/TensorFlow.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.980
And if you have any comments
for me or for Sebastian,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.820
make sure to leave them
