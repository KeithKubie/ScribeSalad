00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.620
- What we're going to do in this video

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.486
is think about how the core beliefs

00:00:04.486 --> 00:00:07.130
of U.S. citizens impacts their views

00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:10.820
on the role of government.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.700
And what I'm gonna do

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.150
is talk about a few core beliefs

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.680
that are often associated
with the United States,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.900
but taken with a grain of salt.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.320
It's obviously a very large

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.560
and a very diverse country

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.390
where people have many,
many, many beliefs.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.570
Now one thing that often gets associated

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.880
with the United States

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.600
is this idea of self-reliance.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.790
Self-reliance.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.330
Or sometimes would be
called individualism,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.750
or these are related ideas, individualism.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.800
And this is the idea that, hey look,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.750
an individual, if people
don't get in their way,

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.290
can take care of themselves,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.460
that the goals of that individual

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.820
should sometimes or often trump those

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.170
of the collective, or say the government.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.210
And so you can imagine,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.890
someone who has a strong core belief

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.020
in self-reliance or individualism,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.300
they would want a limited government.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.210
They would say hey government,

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.230
just get out of my way

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.280
and I can take care of myself.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.870
Now, a related idea to that,

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.580
but this would be going
into the corporate realm

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.040
or the entrepreneurial realm,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.700
is the idea of free enterprise.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.140
Free enterprise.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.200
And this is the idea that, hey,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.130
we can generate wealth,
we can create things,

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.480
we can innovate, once
again, if enterprise,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.140
if entrepreneurial activity,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.530
is left to its own devices.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.330
Now, once again, this core belief

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.730
in free enterprise

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.790
would probably favor a limited government.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.540
Hey government, just get outta my way.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.640
The more that you get involved,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.350
that just slows things down.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.840
That just is a wet
blanket on the creativity

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.730
and on the wealth
creation that we could do,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.540
left to our own devices.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.490
Now, another idea is that of

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.240
equality of opportunity,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.860
often associated with the United Sates,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.110
equality of opportunity.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.560
And this goes to the
roots of the United States

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.030
where we don't have a formal nobility,

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.510
obviously, we don't
have things like kings.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.450
That the country started off,

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.080
obviously there's some major exceptions

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.830
around things like slavery,

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.360
but the country took pride in ideas

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.860
of equality of oppurtunity.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.693
And to some degree,

00:02:12.693 --> 00:02:14.620
they feed into these
first two bullet points,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.290
that if there truly is
equality of oppurtunity,

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.970
it kind of backs up the idea that,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.360
hey, let's just let people

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.080
take care of themselves.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.160
Now on the other hand,
someone who really cares

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.300
about equality of opportunity

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.080
might say, well, hold on a second,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.360
not everyone is born into
the same circumstance.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.690
And because of that, if you truly care

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.550
about equality of oppurtunity,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.230
there might be a role for
the government to play

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.040
in helping to level that
playing field a bit.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.700
So these folks might not want

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.560
as limited of a government
as some of the folks

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.870
who are strongly in the camp

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.650
of self-reliance or individualism.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.700
Now the fourth core belief I'll talk about

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.200
and that is the rule of law.

00:02:53.486 --> 00:02:55.550
Rule of law.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.900
Now, any country, in order to function,

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.670
needs a rule of law.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.320
But one thing that the United States

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.720
takes pride in itself,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.020
and I think the United States citizens

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.960
take pride in itself, is that, hey look,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.300
if there's going to be a contract

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.190
between individuals,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.200
people will uphold that contract,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.310
that because of a solid rule of law,

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.670
it's less likely that people

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.080
will get away with crimes.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.260
And there are examples

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.560
that you could look around the world

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.380
where people might have less faith

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.570
in the rule of law.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.444
Well,

00:03:21.444 --> 00:03:22.277
(mumbles)

00:03:22.277 --> 00:03:23.110
people are getting away with stuff

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.840
or if I get into an
agreement with someone,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.673
there's no way

00:03:25.673 --> 00:03:27.680
that I can really enforce that agreement.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.200
And so the rule of law,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.180
this would argue for
some role of government,

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.990
but it depends how focused or how limited

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.220
of a rule of law people's
core beliefs are.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.020
And to make these core beliefs

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.450
and their impact on government

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.790
a little bit more tangible,

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.530
I have some quotes from
some notable Americans.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.590
Now several of these are Presidents,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.360
but their views are really indicative

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.670
of broader views in the
American population.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.210
So, this first one comes from

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.000
President Ronald Reagan and he said,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.430
Government's first duty
is to protect the people,

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.090
not run their lives.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.670
So which core beliefs do
you think Ronald Reagan

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.090
is representing here?

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.530
Well, when I look at this,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.950
it seems like he doesn't
want the government

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.120
to really mess with people's lives,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.410
he's really talking about self-reliance,

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.240
individualism, free enterprise.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.490
And he is making some reference,

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.420
that look, there is a duty
to protect the people.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.700
So he's saying you do need the government

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.650
to enforce the rule of law,

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.360
but he seems to favor a limited government

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.060
and he, indeed, did favor
a limited government

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.100
that does not get in the way of, say,

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.200
free enterprise or people's ability

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.120
to be self-reliant.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.953
Now, some would argue

00:04:41.953 --> 00:04:43.650
on the other end of the spectrum,

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.560
here is a quote from Franklin Roosevelt,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.470
in which he said,

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.910
Not only our future economic soundness

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.240
but the very soundness

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.360
of our democratic institutions

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.220
depends on the determination
of our government

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.150
to give employment to idle men.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.360
So, FDR here, is talking about

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.810
a very active government,

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.850
not the type of limited government

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.930
that Ronald Reagan seems to allude to.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:11.860
Here, he's saying that

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.180
it's the job of the government,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.250
and remember the context here

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.100
is FDR was President
during the Great Depression

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.700
and the beginning of World War II,

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.080
and during the Great Depression

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.770
you had massive unemployment,

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:23.603
and he's saying look,

00:05:23.603 --> 00:05:26.490
not only the future of
our economic soundness

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.050
but the very soundness

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.390
of our democratic institutions depends on

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.590
the determination of the government

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.200
to give employment to these men.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.150
Now, his argument might have been look,

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.452
if we don't give employment,

00:05:38.452 --> 00:05:41.340
then you could have a
revolution on your hands,

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.864
then people are gonna lose faith

00:05:42.864 --> 00:05:45.360
in this idea of the United States,

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.960
they're gonna lose
faith in the government.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.793
Now, on the other hand,

00:05:48.793 --> 00:05:49.900
some people might say the whole reason

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.150
why we were in that mess

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.060
is that the government
was intervening too much

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.210
and the more that the
government intervenes,

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.960
it actually might not
allow free enterprise

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.290
to naturally solve the economic situation

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.350
that we were in at the time.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.880
But, once again, Franklin
Roosevelt seemed to be

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.520
a little bit less on self-reliance

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.353
cause he said, look,

00:06:08.353 --> 00:06:09.760
these people aren't gonna
find jobs on their own,

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.010
the government needs to get them jobs.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.590
Now here's another viewpoint.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.480
This is from President Barack Obama.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.770
And here, President Obama says,

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.370
The internet didn't get
invented in its own.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.330
Government research created the Internet

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.640
so that all the companies

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.690
could make money off the Internet.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.600
The point is, is that when we succeed,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.670
we succeed because of our
individual initiative,

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.020
but also because we do things together.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.865
So this is an interesting argument.

00:06:36.865 --> 00:06:38.220
When he's saying this,

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.750
he's clearly making
reference to these ideas

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.410
of individualism and free enterprise

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.530
that are strong core beliefs

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.550
in the United States.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.260
This individualism is, we succeed

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.510
because of our individual initiative

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.840
and free enterprise.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.890
These companies

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.220
that are making money off the Internet,

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.070
but his point is

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.870
that these things didn't
happen on their own,

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.490
that, at least in this case,

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.130
the Internet was started
as a government project.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.590
You had DARPANET and ARPANET,

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.070
which eventually evolved into the Internet

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.010
so that free enterprise could take over

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.440
and, frankly, allow you
to watch this video.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.180
He's saying that the
government actually does

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.240
have a role here and because of that role

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.940
that the government has played,

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.580
it has actually allowed things

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.950
like self-reliance,

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.040
individualism, and free enterprise

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.370
to flourish even more.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.760
And last but not least,
I'll give you a quote

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.580
from famous conservative economist,

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.450
Milton Friedman.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.160
He used to be a professor

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.920
at the University of Chicago and he said,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.450
Government has three primary functions.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.370
It should provide

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.320
for military defense of the nation.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.230
It should enforce contracts
between individuals.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.270
It should protect citizens from crimes

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.460
against themselves or their property.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.980
And so Milton Friedman, here,

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.250
is clearly advocating
for a limited government.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.815
In terms of his core beliefs,

00:07:58.815 --> 00:08:00.380
clearly from this statement,

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.870
he says, look, a rule of law is necessary.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.570
You have to have your
contracts between citizens,

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.620
you need to protect citizens

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.640
from crimes against
themselves or their property.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.160
If you read more Milton Friedman quotes

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.993
and I encourage you to,

00:08:10.993 --> 00:08:12.010
regardless of where you are

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.700
on the philosophical spectrum,

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.290
they're all quite interesting.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.830
He has a strong underlying core belief

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.150
in self-reliance, individualism,

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.690
and free enterprise.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:22.960
But I'll leave you there.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.970
Think about it on your own.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.160
How does the core belief

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.210
of a United States citizen,
including yourself,

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.170
how does that impact your view

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.830
of the role of government?
