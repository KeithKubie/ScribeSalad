00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.120
Okay, I really hope you enjoyed this lesson and

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.850
that you learned a lot about different kinds of professions,

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.810
you can use genetics with. One profession we learned

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.830
about is that of a Bioethicist. Bioethicists are critical in

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.630
helping us create new ethical standards in medical science

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.370
and research. They frequently debate issues like gene patenting and

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.530
they also help us to interpret important legal issues

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.530
such as GINA or the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act. Another

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.480
important profession uses genetics, but which you

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.430
don't need an advanced degree, or even a

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.900
specialized degree in genetics for, is a director

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.010
of clinical operations. A director of clinical operations

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.200
designs and manages clinical trials. And they

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.400
also use information from pharmacogenetics to help inform

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.900
their decisions about designing and managing those clinical

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.830
trials. Now, another profession, specifically a human geneticist.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.770
Deals with hardcore genetic questions. And their research sometimes

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.610
contributes to clinical trials that are carried out by

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.800
director of clinical operations. Now human geneticists find genetic

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.800
factors resulting in various traits. Which we've learned about in

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.465
lesson one, as well as simple traits in lesson

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:11.356
eight and complex traits in lesson nine. They also

00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:13.978
study gene expression which we learned about in lesson

00:01:13.978 --> 00:01:17.300
two, three, and four. And a human geneticist in particular

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.140
will frequently make use of a pedigree. Another profession that

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.110
also uses pedigrees is a genetic counselor. Remember a pedigree

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.920
is useful because it denotes family relationships as well as

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.350
whether or not you're affected by a particular trait. So

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.630
it can reveal an inheritance pattern of a trait you're

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.840
interested in. And genetic counselors frequently help with family planning.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.310
Couples who want to have a child, and they're very

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.620
interested in knowing what the future of that child might

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.180
be, health or otherwise. Another profession that uses

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.130
genetics is a computational biologist. And a computational

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.720
biologist is going to use copious amounts of

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.590
computer science coding. They're usually specialists in computers,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.840
specifically computer science or coding. Who also learn

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.210
enough Biology, to apply what they know in

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.280
computer science and coding. Now, one of the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.880
specific examples we talked about in our course,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.370
is how a computational biologist in particular,

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.710
can actually derive an IBD score. Which is

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.620
an identity by distance score. Which we know

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.130
can indicate relatives and ancestry, which we learned

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.510
about in lesson seven and 11. But another

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.980
important profession we discussed. A genetic genealogist also

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.560
uses IBD or identity by decent. And other

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.520
kinds of information to help find relatives and

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.150
ancestry for individuals. If you have any

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.190
interest in learning more about these professions

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.850
and others you should check out the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.720
instructor's notes on this page for career resources.
