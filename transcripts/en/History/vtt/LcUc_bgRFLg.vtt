[music playing]

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.540
NARRATOR: Despite the fact that
it is not open to the public,

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.710
ancient astronaut
theorist Giorgio Tsoukalos

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.670
asked Nick Pope to
take him to the CCC

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.120
for a firsthand look
at the installation.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.040
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: All right.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.880
Good luck.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.620
Thank you very much.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.120
NARRATOR: As a former employee
of the Ministry of Defense,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.580
Nick did not feel it
was appropriate for him

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.750
to approach the facility
himself without clearance.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.330
- I'll see you later, Nick.
- Yes.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.830
Take care.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.420
[music playing]

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.210
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Here we are.
The CCC.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.920
[music playing]

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.080
The lights are on.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.380
And just like Nick explained,
it's got a barbed wire.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.080
It is fenced down.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.210
Impenetrable.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.080
NARRATOR: According to the
British Ministry of Defense,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.080
the CCC is simply
a data processing

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.420
center for the Royal Navy.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.250
But if true, why is
it so heavily guarded?

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.580
Clearly it's an
access to what seems

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:10.960
to be an underground system.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.620
And if the stories that
Nick told me are true,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.460
then underneath our feet
is a vast system of tunnels

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.540
and underground facilities.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.250
[first responder sirens wailing]

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.460
NARRATOR: Within minutes
of Giorgio's arrival

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.620
at the security
gate, the crew is

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.960
met by a military police unit.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.290
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Can you tell
me anything about this place?

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.460
NARRATOR: Unfortunately,
the situation

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.120
ends with filming being halted.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.290
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
Well, we're only

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.170
trying to find out the truth.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.920
NARRATOR: But why?

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.500
What is it that's so top secret
that Giorgio and his camera

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.580
crew are not even allowed
to film the entrance

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.580
from public property?

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.620
[music playing]

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.500
So it was exactly
how you said.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.170
Fortification,
barbed wire fence.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.250
I had about five minutes and
then a police car showed up.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.920
And said, well, I think
it's time for you to leave.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.000
So I think you did exactly
the right thing to get

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.330
out there while you could.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.080
But you know that A,
it is operational,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.620
and B, it's obviously important.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.170
They send the
security people out.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.750
I guarantee you,
they had eyes on you

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.920
from the moment you started.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.830
NARRATOR: Could this
seemingly innocuous building,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.790
and the underground facilities
it lead to, be continuing

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.330
the extraterrestrial
investigations that

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.460
were previously carried
out at Rudloe Manor?

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.670
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.120
And suggest that they are not
only looking into UFO reports,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.460
but mysterious
phenomenon that has

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.710
been happening in the
county of Wiltshire

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.040
for thousands of years.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.620
[music playing]

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.540
- I think this is it right here.
- Yes.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.540
Here we are.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.960
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Great.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.380
NARRATOR: Author and
historian Andrew Collins

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.880
has lived in or near
Wiltshire for most of his life

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.670
and has investigated the
many strange happenings

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.620
associated with the area.
- How are you?

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.540
- All right.
- You good?

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.750
Yeah, you?

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.420
NARRATOR: Giorgio
and Nick arrange

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.080
to meet with him to discuss
why the Ministry of Defense

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.420
might have chosen this
location to be the headquarters

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.040
of their UFO investigations.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.420
You're looking at the dead
center of weird activity

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.750
in the whole of Great Britain.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.710
We've got UFOs.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.330
We've got crop circles.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.250
We've got the most intensive
amount of prehistoric sites.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.750
Ancient mounds.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.420
Barrows.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.420
Plus, we have, obviously, the
strange activity that surrounds

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.290
places like Rudloe
Manor and Corsham,

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.620
as a whole, where we are today.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.250
NICK POPE: : Absolutely.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.960
And some of these sites, I
don't think people realize,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.290
but they are older than
the Egyptian pyramids.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.460
Absolutely.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.620
We've got here Stonehenge
and Avebury itself.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.290
Most people think
that these sites

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.960
go back 4,500 to 5,000 years.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.460
But they, in fact, go back
at least 10,000 years.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.290
I lived in the
center of Avebury,

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.120
which is the largest
stone circle complex

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.120
in the whole of the world.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.580
UFOs have been seen in the
vicinity of the stones there.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.250
Sometimes they have
been seen to actually

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.330
come in to the circle and land.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.170
Other times, they have
manifested into strange shapes,

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.500
figures, things like that.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.170
[music playing]

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.460
All around the
country, there are

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.120
certain areas
where UFOs manifest

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.500
more than anywhere else.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.750
They're called window areas.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.170
And I believe that the area
around Stonehenge and Avebury

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.170
is exactly one of
those window areas.
