DAMIEN HENRY: --to upload
their content online

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.480
and to tell stories about them.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.790
There is more than 2,000
museums on the platform now.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.850
And we have a lab,
and The Lab is

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.640
where we explore interaction
between the art culture

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.380
and technology.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.460
For instance, it's the place
where David Coz and I started

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.430
the cardboard.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.470
It's a virtual set
made out of cardboard.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.760
It's also the place where
we started ArtSelfie,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.090
this feature that
allows you to find

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.390
if there is a portrait in a
museum that looks like you.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.030
It's super fun.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.390
If you haven't
tried, you should.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.780
And we are doing
many other stuff.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.020
You can check them from
G.co/artsexperiment.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.660
What is really
exciting with The Lab

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.110
is that we have a program
named Artists in Residency.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.650
So we have the opportunity to
work directly with artists.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.360
And for this
specific project, we

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.760
asked the Somerset
House, which is

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.070
an institution based in London,
to help us to curate an artist.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.590
And the open call that
they made for that

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.040
was named End Dimensions.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.170
So they select Jenna Sutela.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.930
Jenna Sutela is a
woman, an artist

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.550
working with words, with
audio, and with living

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.480
materials and technology.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.790
And her work has been presented
at the Bilbao Guggenheim

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.480
and also in the Contemporary
Art Museum of Tokyo.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.750
And for this project, we asked
Memo Akten, a very influential

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.880
creative curator to help
Jenna realize her vision.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.403
So what you will see now
is a 12-minute video,

00:02:00.403 --> 00:02:01.820
so it's a [? video ?]
of her work.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.950
But just before
that, we would like

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.050
to roll a five-minute
video behind the scene

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.770
so you will have more
context about why

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.150
she does what she does.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.140
So first I'll just roll
the behind the scene.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.983
I hope you enjoy it.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.470
- nimiia cetii is an audiovisual
artwork based on machine

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.760
learning or teaching the
machine to speak in tongues.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.150
So my name is Jenna
Sutela, and I work a lot

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.150
with words, sounds,
and living materials

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.620
exploring biological and
computational systems.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.720
I'm working with
machine learning

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.800
to generate a certain
type of glosa poetry based

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.400
on the Martian language by
the French medium Helene Smith

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.630
in the late 1800s and the
movement of Bacillus subtilis,

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.600
or the natto bacterium
that are also

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.350
known as a test species in
spaceflight experimentation.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.480
Together, the bacteria, as well
as these early Martian scripts,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.570
will--

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.310
together with the
computer shaman

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.130
will create a new
language altogether,

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.010
and the end result will
be an audiovisual work.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.836
[WARPED SOUNDS]

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.010
nimiia cetii is something
that I worked on

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.970
as part of my residency at
the Somerset House Studios

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.940
and at the Google
Arts and Culture Lab

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.430
in Paris together with
Mem Akten and Damien Henry

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.435
from Google Arts
and Culture Lab.

00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:48.720
- So I've been working
with computer vision

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.132
for well over a decade now,
trying to get machines to see.

00:03:54.132 --> 00:03:55.590
But in the last
four or five years,

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.110
I've also been very interested
in machine learning, which

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.750
has actually in the last couple
of years really exploded.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.500
Really using more
state-of-the-art machine

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.358
learning is really
conceptually fascinating

00:04:06.358 --> 00:04:08.650
because at the heart of a
lot of these state-of-the-art

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:15.540
algorithms, it parallels a lot
of cognitive processes that we

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.370
might have in our own brains
in the sense that we need

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.810
to distill these different
mediums down to common abstract

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.690
representations.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.090
And that's what the machine
learning approach has.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.560
- So Bacillus subtilis
is the main ingredient

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.810
of natto, or fermented
soybeans, known

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.970
as a very healthy probiotic.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.930
Bacillus subtilis is one
of the main bacteria taken

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.390
to space on, for example,
the Mars missions

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.220
to test the limits of life.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.740
This bacteria that it
can also survive on Mars

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.100
and maybe it also
came from Mars and is

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.770
this alien that we
inhabit through the food

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.880
that we're eating
like the probiotics.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.080
So it's the kind of
protagonist of this project.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.050
And right now, I'm
using its movement

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.950
as a script for this
language that is generated.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.670
So the bacteria is filmed
through a microscope,

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.920
and then the movement
of the bacteria

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.980
is observed by the computer.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.220
- We look at the video,
and we somehow encode that

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.400
to high-dimensional
latent space,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.400
which we think of as a language
agnostic representation of what

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.720
this system--

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.450
in this case, the bowl of
bacteria-- is thinking.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.150
And from that we
decode into text.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.200
We decode into a kind of
what we call the handwriting.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.130
We decode into speech.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.880
[WARBLED VOICES]

00:05:48.368 --> 00:05:54.522
- The idea was to generate
language that's audible,

00:05:54.522 --> 00:05:55.980
and that's the part
that we've been

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.260
working with Damien in Paris.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.340
So the idea is basically to
record these snippets of sound

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.600
and then feed these
into the computer

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.650
and have it learn that voice.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.555
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:13.555 --> 00:06:16.170
- It's very important for
us to work with artists

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.820
because it's the opportunity to
use algorithm in a way that's

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.500
not been designed in full.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.800
- The processes that take
place in machine learning

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.450
are also largely unknown to us.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.150
So there's the idea
of the black box,

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.660
and it's not clear
what exactly is

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.270
happening when the computer
is learning something.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.580
So we're also sort
of-- we created

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.280
an alien in that respect.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.980
There's a lot of
similarities between looking

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.830
into the microscope and
looking into the cosmos.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.260
I think we're all
on board, or we

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.990
can know what needs to be done.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.650
This residency has been a lot
about learning about machine

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.070
learning in practice
and also about what's

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.240
