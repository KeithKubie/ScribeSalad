00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:10.353
Your favorite band is great
at playing music,

00:00:10.353 --> 00:00:13.474
but not so great at being organized.

00:00:13.474 --> 00:00:16.264
They keep misplacing 
their instruments on tour,

00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:18.764
and it's driving their manager mad.

00:00:18.764 --> 00:00:20.574
On the day of the big concert,

00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:22.884
the band wakes up 
to find themselves tied up

00:00:22.884 --> 00:00:26.564
in a windowless, 
soundproof practice room.

00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:28.804
Their manager explains what's happening.

00:00:28.804 --> 00:00:32.034
Outside, there are ten large boxes.

00:00:32.034 --> 00:00:34.394
Each contains one of your instruments,

00:00:34.394 --> 00:00:39.214
but don't be fooled by the pictures -
they've been randomly placed.

00:00:39.214 --> 00:00:42.754
I'm going to let you out one at a time.

00:00:42.754 --> 00:00:46.235
While you're outside, you can look
inside any five boxes

00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:50.234
before security
takes you back to the tour bus.

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:51.903
You can't touch the instruments

00:00:51.903 --> 00:00:55.804
or in any way communicate what you find
to the others.

00:00:55.804 --> 00:00:59.574
No marking the boxes, shouting, nothing.

00:00:59.574 --> 00:01:02.145
If each one of you 
can find your own instrument,

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:04.005
then you can play tonight.

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:07.004
Otherwise, the label is dropping you.

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:10.794
You have three minutes to think about it
before we start.

00:01:10.794 --> 00:01:12.334
The band is in despair.

00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:16.854
After all, each musician only has a 50%
chance of finding their instrument

00:01:16.854 --> 00:01:19.334
by picking five random boxes.

00:01:19.334 --> 00:01:22.650
And the chances that all ten will succeed
are even lower -

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.774
just 1 in 1024.

00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:28.464
But suddenly, the drummer comes up
with a valid strategy

00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:33.044
that has a better than 35% chance
of working.

00:01:33.044 --> 00:01:35.744
Can you figure out what it was?

00:01:35.744 --> 00:01:43.765
Pause the video on the next screen
if you want to figure it out for yourself!

00:01:43.765 --> 00:01:45.214
Answer in: 3

00:01:45.214 --> 00:01:46.215
Answer in: 2

00:01:46.215 --> 00:01:47.645
Answer in: 1

00:01:47.645 --> 00:01:49.285
Here's what the drummer said:

00:01:49.285 --> 00:01:53.056
Everyone first open the box
with the picture of your instrument.

00:01:53.056 --> 00:01:55.375
If your instrument is inside, you're done.

00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:57.555
Otherwise, look at whatever's in there,

00:01:57.555 --> 00:02:00.435
and then open the box 
with that picture on it.

00:02:00.435 --> 00:02:03.505
Keep going that way until you find
your instrument.

00:02:03.505 --> 00:02:05.155
The bandmates are skeptical,

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:08.225
but amazingly enough,
they all find what they need.

00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:12.096
And a few hours later, they're playing
to thousands of adoring fans.

00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:14.655
So why did the drummer's strategy work?

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:17.285
Each musician follows a linked sequence

00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:20.945
that starts with the box whose outside
matches their instrument

00:02:20.945 --> 00:02:25.005
and ends with the box 
actually containing it.

00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:28.505
Note that if they kept going,
that would lead them back to the start,

00:02:28.505 --> 00:02:30.106
so this is a loop.

00:02:30.106 --> 00:02:32.925
For example, if the boxes 
are arranged like so,

00:02:32.925 --> 00:02:36.034
the singer would open the first box
to find the drums,

00:02:36.034 --> 00:02:38.265
go to the eighth box to find the bass,

00:02:38.265 --> 00:02:41.065
and find her microphone in the third box,

00:02:41.065 --> 00:02:43.886
which would point back to the first.

00:02:43.886 --> 00:02:46.475
This works much better 
than random guessing

00:02:46.475 --> 00:02:49.824
because by starting with the box 
with the picture of their instrument,

00:02:49.824 --> 00:02:54.435
each musician restricts their search to
the loop that contains their instrument,

00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:57.836
and there are decent odds, about 35%,

00:02:57.836 --> 00:03:02.277
that all of the loops 
will be of length five or less.

00:03:02.277 --> 00:03:03.925
How do we calculate those odds?

00:03:03.925 --> 00:03:07.727
For the sake of simplicity, 
we'll demonstrate with a simplified case,

00:03:07.727 --> 00:03:13.486
four instruments and no more than 
two guesses allowed for each musician.

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:16.327
Let's start by finding 
the odds of failure,

00:03:16.327 --> 00:03:19.677
the chance that someone will need
to open three or four boxes

00:03:19.677 --> 00:03:21.725
before they find their instrument.

00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:24.316
There are six distinct four-box loops.

00:03:24.316 --> 00:03:27.457
One fun way to count them 
is to make a square,

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:29.626
put an instrument at each corner,

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.787
and draw the diagonals.

00:03:31.787 --> 00:03:34.617
See how many unique loops you can find,

00:03:34.617 --> 00:03:38.107
and keep in mind that these two 
are considered the same,

00:03:38.107 --> 00:03:40.137
they just start at different points.

00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:42.398
These two, however, are different.

00:03:42.398 --> 00:03:47.098
We can visualize the eight distinct
three-box loops using triangles.

00:03:47.098 --> 00:03:49.448
You'll find four possible triangles

00:03:49.448 --> 00:03:52.017
depending on which instrument 
you leave out,

00:03:52.017 --> 00:03:54.948
and two distinct paths on each.

00:03:54.948 --> 00:03:58.329
So of the 24 possible 
combinations of boxes,

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.798
there are 14 that lead to faliure,

00:04:00.798 --> 00:04:03.398
and ten that result in success.

00:04:03.398 --> 00:04:08.468
That computational strategy works for any
even number of musicians,

00:04:08.468 --> 00:04:09.848
but if you want a shortcut,

00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:13.808
it generalizes to a handy equation.

00:04:13.808 --> 00:04:18.107
Plug in ten musicians, 
and we get odds of about 35%.

00:04:18.107 --> 00:04:20.428
What if there were 1,000 musicians?

00:04:20.428 --> 00:04:21.798
1,000,000?

00:04:21.798 --> 00:04:26.198
As n increases, 
the odds approach about 30%.

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:32.228
Not a guarantee, but with a bit of
musician's luck, it's far from hopeless.

00:04:32.228 --> 00:04:35.917
Hi everybody, if you liked this riddle,
try solving these two.
