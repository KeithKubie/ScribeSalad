00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969
connected each is to the other and it is
 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.910

for a boy that we have in modern culture

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
for a boy that we have in modern culture
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.090
for a boy that we have in modern culture
and it kind of nails some of the

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100
and it kind of nails some of the
 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.220
and it kind of nails some of the
intensity of those feelings it also and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230
intensity of those feelings it also and
 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.680
intensity of those feelings it also and
I think this is equally deep tells us

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690
I think this is equally deep tells us
 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.319

something about Redemption so the idea

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329
something about Redemption so the idea
 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.840
something about Redemption so the idea
is that if you can get your kid to love

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
is that if you can get your kid to love
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.569
is that if you can get your kid to love
you it's probably going to be okay and

you it's probably going to be okay and
 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.899
you it's probably going to be okay and
also if you do something heroic and good

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:41.909
also if you do something heroic and good
 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.329
also if you do something heroic and good
you can probably be redeemed in some

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339
you can probably be redeemed in some
 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.369
you can probably be redeemed in some
sense of your soul whether we're talking

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379
sense of your soul whether we're talking
 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.619

you if you read it about the newspaper
then you might think law and order is a

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489
then you might think law and order is a
 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.380
then you might think law and order is a
pretty good corrective and even if law

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390
pretty good corrective and even if law
 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.630
pretty good corrective and even if law
and order means that civil liberties and

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640
and order means that civil liberties and
 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.810
and order means that civil liberties and
civil rights will be reduced maybe

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820
civil rights will be reduced maybe
 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.759
civil rights will be reduced maybe
that's a trade you'll be willing to take

that's a trade you'll be willing to take
 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.640
that's a trade you'll be willing to take
and we certainly saw that in the United

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650
and we certainly saw that in the United
 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.699
and we certainly saw that in the United
States at times over the past let's say

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709
States at times over the past let's say
 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.759
States at times over the past let's say
40 years and while in the United States

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769
40 years and while in the United States
 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:23.690
40 years and while in the United States
in my view

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700
in my view
 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.729
in my view
nothing really horrific has happened in

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739
nothing really horrific has happened in
 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.740
nothing really horrific has happened in
terms of the rise of authoritarianism

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.080
terms of the rise of authoritarianism
the fact that there have been movements

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090
the fact that there have been movements
 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.860
the fact that there have been movements
away from civil rights of liberties is

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870
away from civil rights of liberties is
 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.180
away from civil rights of liberties is
suggestive of something that's possible

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190
suggestive of something that's possible
 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.150
suggestive of something that's possible
when people feel really at risk so what

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160
when people feel really at risk so what

transcend the kind of simple dichotomy

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170
transcend the kind of simple dichotomy
 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.960
transcend the kind of simple dichotomy

the dark side it does have a seductive
 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.550
the dark side it does have a seductive
