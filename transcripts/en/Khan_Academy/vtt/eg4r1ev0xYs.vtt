00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.680
We're on problem number 10.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.330
And it says, in a certain class,
one student is to be

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.600
selected at random to read.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.040
What is the probability
that a boy will read?

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.550
OK.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.940
So I guess we can assume that
everyone in the class can

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.700
read, because they don't really
talk much about that.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.580
And I think we can assume that
everyone in the class is

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.030
either a boy or a girl, that
we don't have any third

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.040
genders in this reality.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.370
OK.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.130
So what are the statements?

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.690
So we essentially just want to
know, what's the probability

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.710
we pick a boy in the
class, right?

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.850
Whether or not they read is
kind of -- so what's the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.490
probably that we pick a boy?

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.170
So to figure out whether we're
going to pick a boy, we have

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.790
to know, essentially,
what percentage of

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.080
the class are boys.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.120
So what are the statements
they give us?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.200
Statement number one is,
2/3 of the students in

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.950
the class are boys.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.070
Well, that's just what
I asked for.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.410
2/3 boys.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.230
Well, that exactly tells
me the probability

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.050
that I pick a boy.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.080
It's 2 out of 3, or 66.66
repeating percentage.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.780
So this alone is enough.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.740
So let's see if statement
two is at all useful.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.239
Statement two.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.090
10 of the students in
the class are girls.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.800
10 girls.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.200
Well, this, especially
by itself, is a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.680
fairly useless statement.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.400
Because maybe there are 10
girls, maybe there's 0 boys,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.540
in which case this probability
would be 0.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.770
Maybe there are 10 girls and
10 boys, in which case this

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.080
would be 50%.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.700
So 10 girls, by itself, really
doesn't tell us much.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.660
So in this case, all we
need is statement one.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.940
And statement two alone
is not sufficient.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.870
So that is what?

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.540
I always forget these.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.670
a, statement one alone is
sufficient, but statement two

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.450
is not sufficient.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.470
That's a.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.850
Problem 11.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.930
Let me switch colors to green.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.880
Problem 11.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:56.540
If 5x plus 3y is equal to 17.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.940
They want to know what x is
equal to. x is equal to what?

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.010
OK.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.170
The first statement
they give us is, x

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.420
is a positive integer.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.070
Well, that doesn't
help us solve x.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.460
I mean, x could be any
positive integer.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.180
They gave us no constraints
on y.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.590
So we really could pick x
as any positive integer.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.030
So that doesn't help
us with that.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.670
Statement number two is,
y is equal to 4x.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.410
Well, this is a little
bit more interesting.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.030
y is equal to 4x.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.880
Well, here we could substitute
this in for y, and

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.480
then solve for x.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.040
And remember, in these problems,
you really don't

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.830
have to solve for x.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.230
You just have to know
that you could.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.300
So I, immediately just
recognizing it, I could say,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.200
well, this is all I need
to do to solve for x.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.340
And just to prove it to
you, let's do it.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.220
Although you shouldn't have
to do this on the GMAT.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.820
So 5x plus 3 times y,
where y is equal to

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.130
4x, is equal to 17.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.590
So you get 5x plus 12x
is equal to 17, or

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.020
17x is equal to 17.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.630
x is equal to 1.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.400
So all you needed was
statement two.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.640
And statement one was
fairly useless.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.260
So that is b, statement two
alone is sufficient, but

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.570
statement one alone
is not sufficient.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:19.160
Problem 12.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:27.900
So they're asking whether the
product jkmn equal 1?

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.650
Does that equal 1?

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.250
So the first statement they give
us-- let me scroll down a

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.910
little bit-- the first statement
they give us is, jk

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.836
over mn is equal to 1.

00:03:43.836 --> 00:03:46.020
Let's see, we could do a little
algebraic manipulation.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.590
Multiply both sides by mn, you
get jk is equal to mn, right?

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.500
I just multiplied both
sides by mn.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.770
But that really doesn't
help me.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.180
I mean, that just tells
me that this part is

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.520
equal to this part.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.710
But it doesn't really tell me
that when you multiply them

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.880
all together, you equal 1.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.700
Let's see if statement two
is it all helpful.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:16.910
Statement two tells us that j is
equal to 1 over k, and m is

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.399
equal to 1 over n.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.370
So let's see if we could do
some interesting algebraic

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.920
manipulations.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.230
Let's see.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.950
Multiply both sides
of this by k.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.350
You get jk is equal to 1.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.450
And do the same thing here.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.180
Multiply both sides times n.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.080
You get mn is equal to 1.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.230
Well, this is useful, because
if j times k is equal to 1,

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:47.560
and m times n is equal to 1-- so
the whole product is going

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.660
to be 1 times 1.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.640
Well, that's definitely going
to be equal to 1.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.270
So using just the information in
statement two, we were able

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.510
to verify that j times
k, times m, times

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.750
n is equal to 1.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.060
So this is all we needed.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.660
Statement one was
fairly useless.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.480
So that is what?

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.680
That is b, statement two is
sufficient, and statement one

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.543
alone is not sufficient.

00:05:06.543 --> 00:05:13.670
Let's do problem number 13.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.060
A certain expressway has exits
J, K, L, and M, in that order.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.940
All right.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.310
My guess is that it's going
to be some type of

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.560
a number line problem.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.097
So let's see.

00:05:27.097 --> 00:05:34.980
The exits J, K, L, and M.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.140
That's the highway
in that order.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.220
And then they say, what is
the road distance from

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.990
exit K to exit L.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.870
So they want to know this
distance right here.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.130
That's what we have to see, if
we have sufficient data to

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.290
figure out.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.920
So statement one.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.870
They tell us the road distance
from exit J to L is 21.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.540
So we can just write that in.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.870
So line segment to JL
is equal to 21.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.320
So that tells us that this
distance right here is 21.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.730
Well, that by itself-- because
we don't know where K is

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.080
within that 21 miles-- so that
alone doesn't help us.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.850
Let's see if statement two
helps figure out things.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.160
The road distance from
K to M is 26.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.400
K to M is equal to 26.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.870
So this distance
is equal to 26.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.270
This doesn't really help us at
all, because if you think

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.800
about it, the distance between
K and M is fixed, right?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.605
But K could be here, which
would put M here.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.370
And then, of course, that would
change the KL distance.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.860
Or K could be really close to
L, which would put M here.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.140
M is definitely 26 miles, or
whatever it is, 26 kilometers

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.270
further from K.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.870
So we don't know where K is.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.400
This second constraint still
doesn't tell us where K is,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.610
relative to-- is it closer
to J, is it closer

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.970
to L, we don't know.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.580
So both of them combined
are useless.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.310
So that is e.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.350
Problem number 14.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.270
Unless I missed something.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.890
Problem number 14.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.350
Is the integer k
a prime number?

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.600
So k prime.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.660
So the first statement
they give us, is that

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.890
2k is equal to 6.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.950
Well, we could just do a
little algebra here.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.780
Divide both sides by 2, and
we get k is equal to 3.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.440
And 3 is prime.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.990
So this is good, that's
all we needed.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.560
We're done.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.710
Well, let's see what
two gives us.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.320
Maybe two also gives us that.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.650
Let's see, two says that
1 is less than k, which

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.950
is less than 6.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.220
Well, this is kind of useless,
because this is just telling

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.080
us that k-- we know it's an
integer, because they say, is

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.730
the integer k a prime number?--
but k could be 2, in

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.490
which case it wouldn't be--
well, 2 is prime-- but k could

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.780
be 4, in which case
it's not prime.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.250
Or it could still be 3,
so we don't know.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.010
So this is kind of useless.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.690
So all we need is statement one,
and statement two is not

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:13.160
sufficient.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.630
So that's a.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.375
Problem number 15.

00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:19.625
Let me switch colors.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:29.350
OK, so they've drawn some
type of x, y axes.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.280
That's the y-axis.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.809
That's is the x-axis.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:38.039
All right.

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:46.250
x, y, and then they have
this, they drew 1, 1.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.460
And then they labeled the
quadrants, quadrant I,

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.080
quadrant II, quadrant III.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.970
We're doing roman numerals.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.740
And they say quadrant IV.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.620
And they say if ab
does not equal 0.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.870
So a times b does not equal 0,
which essentially tells us

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:11.700
that neither a or b-- neither
a nor b-- is 0.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.090
OK.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.360
ab does not equal 0.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.310
In what quadrant of the
coordinate system

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.190
does point a, b lie?

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.890
So they want to know
where a, b is.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.520
So quadrant of a, b.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:23.830
OK.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.990
Let's look at the data.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.390
All right.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.560
So we know a, b-- well, we know
it's not along the axes,

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.610
because if one of these were
0, then we'd be along the

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.370
axes, if either a or b were 0.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:44.480
It says, this is interesting,
it says b, a

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.400
is in quadrant IV.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.470
b, a.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.370
So this is interesting.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:54.230
So quadrant IV tells us what?

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.760
If something is in quadrant
IV-- let me do that in a

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.210
different color.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.290
This is, I think, the first
interesting problem we've

00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.230
encountered.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:04.290
Quadrant IV tells us that x is
greater than 0, right, because

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.920
we're in the positive x-axis.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.720
And tells is that y is less than
0, right, because we're

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.630
in the negative y-axis, right?

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.770
We're here.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:16.570
So if b, a is in quadrant IV, in
this case b is playing the

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.590
role of x, right?

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.980
This is the point b, a.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:25.140
So that tells us that b has
to be greater than 0.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.680
b is greater than 0.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.970
And this is telling us that a,
because it's playing the

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.300
function of the y coordinate
here, a has to be less than 0.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:42.290
So if we talk about the point a
comma b, well, now we're in

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.630
a situation where we know
that a is less than 0.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.680
So we know that x
is less than 0.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.120
And we know that b is
greater than 0.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.670
And now b is playing
the y coordinate.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.410
So we know that y is
greater than 0.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.160
So if x is less than 0, we're
in the [? plot ?]

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.770
negative x, and y is greater
than 0 over here.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:03.930
So a comma b is going to have
to be there some place.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.090
So statement number one was
all we needed to know that

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:09.790
it's going to be
in quadrant II.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.220
So statement number
one is good.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.990
Now let's take a look at
statement number two.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.650
Well, statement number two is
kind of the same thing.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.210
So we actually don't even
have to work it out.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.770
That statement two alone is
also sufficient, just

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.385
eyeballing it, but let
me work it out.

00:11:23.385 --> 00:11:26.320
But we can apply the
exact same logic.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:35.160
Statement two says a comma
minus b in quadrant III.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:41.040
Well, if we're in quadrant III,
that means that x is less

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.280
than 0, right?

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.370
And a plays the x role.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.350
So this tells us that
a is less than 0.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:52.530
And quadrant III tells us that
y is also less than 0.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.610
And the y coordinate
here is minus b.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.240
So it tells us that minus
b is less than 0.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.410
This point is minus b, so minus
b has to be less than 0,

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.240
which tells us-- you can
multiply both sides by

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.270
negative 1, or divide-- and
that tells us that b is

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.640
greater than 0.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.300
So you get the same information
from statement two

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.000
as you get from statement one,
that a is less than 0, and b

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.890
as greater than 0.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:17.250
And then you can use that to
figure out that a, b has to be

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.220
in quadrant II.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.230
So each of them independently
are sufficient

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.290
to answer the question.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.270
So the answer is d.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.250
See you in the next video.
