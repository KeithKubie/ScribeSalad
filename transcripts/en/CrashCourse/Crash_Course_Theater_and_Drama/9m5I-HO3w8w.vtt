00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.990
Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash
Course Theater, and today the bodies hit the

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.590
floor: We’re talking about Shakespearean
tragedy.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.850
Remember how the Greeks left the violence
offstage?

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.310
Well, Shakespeare goes another way, with poisoning,
stabbing, strangling, and baking people into

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.310
pies.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.470
Get in line, Sweeney Todd.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.230
There are already a couple of Crash Course
Literature episodes about “Hamlet” and

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.480
that Scottish King whose name I could totally
say right now if I felt like it, but I’m

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.539
just not going to, so we’ll be looking at
“King Lear”.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.840
And to set it all up, we’ll look at the
staging conventions of Elizabethan drama,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.530
and how all those soliloquies and storm scenes
were acted.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.640
Macbeth!

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:53.600
OK FINE IM SORRY IM SORRY
INTRO

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.400
Because of changes in vagrancy laws, actors
organized themselves into companies named

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.580
after some royal patron.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.610
They mostly performed at purpose-built playhouses,
but when those were closed—looking at you,

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.970
bubonic plague—they would tour around the
country.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.460
A company would be made of 8–12 shareholders,
3–4 boys, a few hired players, some musicians,

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.470
and a couple of stagehands, who ran around
with whatever the Renaissance equivalent of

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.640
headsets and clipboards were.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.220
Actors tended to specialize.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.670
There were king types, queen types, lover
types, and even a few different types of fool—like

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.530
slapstick fools and clever fools ... like
Yorick here.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.640
Shakespeare was an actor.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.230
We don’t know the roles he played, though
there’s a rumor he played the ghost in “Hamlet.”

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.260
[[[From offscreen, ghost’s lines: “Swear…
swear… swear.”]]]

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.260
Who said that!?

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.980
But even specialized actors had to do more
than just act.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.060
They also had to sing and dance and sword
fight.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.950
And boy did they have to memorize.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.000
Actors would spend their mornings learning
a new play and their afternoons performing

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.020
an old one.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.260
Because plays ran in repertory, there could
be several plays on the go in any given week,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.939
and many actors had several parts within them.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.729
The boys in the company played the women’s
roles—and some of those women have a lot

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:07.729
of lines.

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.310
With a schedule like that, actors didn’t
spend a lot of time sitting around speculating

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.020
about themes and motivations.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.760
Especially because actors didn’t get copies
of the full script, just pages of lines and

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.910
cues.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.599
The goal was to learn the lines and recite
them without too much overacting.

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.290
We don’t know if Shakespeare hated overacting,
but Hamlet sure does.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.540
Here’s his speech to the traveling players:

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.730
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced
it to

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.280
you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you
mouth it,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.480
as many of your players do, I had as lief
the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.620
town-crier spoke my lines.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.550
Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand, thus, but use all

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.981
gently;
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as

00:02:51.981 --> 00:02:55.599
I may say,
the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.480
and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.840
Hamlet is telling the actors don’t yell,
don’t gesticulate wildly.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.630
Just get the words out, and if you need to
emote, do it with some elegance.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.890
No mouthing!

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.150
No sawing!

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.310
Wait… am I an overactor?

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.630
As we mentioned last time, the outdoor Elizabethan
playhouse was a smaller, chintzier version

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.290
of the Greco-Roman amphitheater.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.920
It had an acting area backed by a tiring house--the
place where players got changed --overlooked

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.190
by tiers of semi-circular seating and a pit,
the area where workingmen who had paid a penny

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.550
could stand and watch.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.080
Plays were performed in the afternoon, to
take advantage of natural light.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.780
And since this was an era before wireless
headset mics, actors had to project so they

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.320
could be heard above all the chit-chatting
groundlings.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.990
The stage was bare except for big-deal furniture
like a throne or maybe a bed.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.709
So to make things visually interesting, actors
relied on sumptuous costumes and hand props.

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.170
But this isn’t the Japanese theater.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.560
If an actor held a fan, he was probably just
using it to fan himself.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.270
There were only a few special effects, but
a couple of those were fire-based, which is

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.690
not the greatest idea in a theater made of
wood.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.880
On that flammable stage, actors performed
some of the most fire tragedies ever written.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.750
Many written by Shakespeare who borrowed from
Greek tragedy and the medieval morality play

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.710
and earlier Elizabethan forms to create a
whole new genre.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.800
Seneca, who we met in our episode on Roman
drama, is also an influence, especially on

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.840
Shakespeare’s first tragedy, “Titus Andronicus.”

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.880
Still, let’s remember that in terms of genre,
tragedy is a flexible term.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.000
As we mentioned last time, it was the editors
of the posthumous First Folio who decided

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.690
to group his plays into Comedies, Histories,
and Tragedies.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.460
In Shakespeare’s life there was a lot more
slippage.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.210
A quarto of “Hamlet” was published as
“The Tragicall Historie of Hamlet,” which

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.750
seems clear enough.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.550
But the history play “Richard III” was
published in quarto as “The Tragedy of King

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.260
Richard III,” so that’s confusing.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.260
More confusing?

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.550
“King Lear” appeared in quarto as the
“True Chronicle Historie of the life and

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.160
death of King LEAR and his three Daughters,”
which makes it sound like a history play,

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.210
but its not.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.360
So we propose a shortcut: When it comes to
Shakespeare, a tragedy is a play that ends

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.889
unhappily and is not about a recent king.

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.670
Like the other plays, the tragedies are mixtures
of prose and verse, though they tend to go

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.960
heavy on the verse, and the language is typically
more ornate than in the comedies.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.139
As in Greek tragedies, they are action-packed.

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:37.280
What with all the prophecies and soothsayers
and vengeful ghosts—[[[Offstage: “Swear…

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.750
swear… swear”]]] shush it up!

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.000
I don’t wanna hear it anymore!—Shakespeare
sets up related conflicts between fate and

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.130
free will, individual desire and public good.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.320
Reversal and recognition?

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.240
They’re here, too.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.240
Mostly.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.240
So is the idea of hamartia, or mostly good
characters missing the mark, like when Hamlet

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.720
gets caught up in his father’s revenge story,
or Brutus joins the conspirators, or the Scottish

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.570
characters in the play I could totally name
if I wanted to … agree to kill the king.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.889
But hey, there’s new stuff, too.

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:11.200
For one thing, Shakespearean tragedies have
a lot of funny bits.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.639
The actors in Shakespeare’s company who
played fools were big crowd-pleasers, so Shakespeare

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.180
wrote parts for them even in the sad plays.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.900
So, if you like your tragedy extra-depressing,
too bad!

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.669
As Samuel Johnson said, Shakespeare’s work
is defined by “an interchange of seriousness

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:32.500
and merriment, by which the mind is softened
at one time, and exhilarated at another.”

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.500
Kinda like a marvel movie!

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.229
Another important difference—sin!

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:39.100
These plays inhabit a Christian moral landscape,
at least in part.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.271
It’s not enough for characters to worry
about what an action will mean on earth, they

00:06:43.271 --> 00:06:46.960
have to wonder whether or not it will damn
in the afterlife.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.640
His construction of tragic heroes, though,
is where Shakespeare made his biggest innovation.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.830
Greek tragic heroes are mostly good people
who whiff it, but Orestes, Oedipus, Pentheus

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.550
aren’t as ... complicated .. as Hamlet,
Othello, Antony and Cleopatra!

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:07.680
The philosopher Hegel said that Shakespeare’s
big innovation was to put thesis and antithesis

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.620
into a single character.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.740
So it’s not Orestes versus Clytemnestra,
or Pentheus versus Dionysus.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.069
It’s Hamlet versus ... Hamlet.

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:17.660
Deep, yo.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:23.280
Basically, no one does radical psychological
interiority like tragic Shakespeare.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.930
This sets him apart from, well, everyone…
but also his contemporaries.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:33.380
In most Elizabethan revenge tragedies, the
revenger becomes more evil the more evil he

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.380
does.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.380
Makes sense, right?

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.960
But Shakespeare never lets the heroes of his
revenge tragedies become dehumanized.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.160
They’re thinking; they’re questioning;
they’re trying to figure out if what they’re

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.160
doing is right and if there are alternatives.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:52.130
We never stop feeling for the heroes of Shakespeare’s
tragedies, and this emotional engagement is

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.610
a lot of what makes them so sad, and terrible,
and great.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.430
To see this in action, let’s explore one
of Shakespeare’s greatest tragedies, “King

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.430
Lear.”

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.099
A play set in some fairy tale, hurricane-ravaged
version of ancient England, that was first

00:08:06.099 --> 00:08:10.699
performed at the Palace in 1606 and probably
written the year before.

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:14.169
Adjust your screen brightness, ladies and
gentlemen, because things are about to get

00:08:14.169 --> 00:08:15.169
dark.

00:08:15.169 --> 00:08:18.960
Light the way, Thoughtbubble:
King Lear decides to retire, which is not

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.960
something kings do.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.449
But first he makes his daughters stand up
before the court and praise him.

00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:26.980
His older daughters, Goneril and Regan, make
kissy faces.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:32.190
This disgusts his youngest, Cordelia, who
says nothing, so her father takes away her

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.259
inheritance and banishes her.

00:08:34.259 --> 00:08:36.550
He also banishes the loyal courtier Kent.

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:41.289
Meanwhile, Edmund, the bastard son of the
Duke of Gloucester, is hatching a plan to

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:42.889
frame his half-brother Edgar.

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:43.889
It works.

00:08:43.889 --> 00:08:47.459
Even though Lear is retired, he still wants
to live like a king, but his older daughters

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:49.800
are like, what if you didn’t?

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:55.439
They refuse to house his retinue of soldiers,
so Lear walks out into a terrible storm, followed

00:08:55.439 --> 00:08:58.940
by the disguised Kent and the fool, who soon
goes missing.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:04.100
They meet up with Edmund, who is pretending
to be a crazy beggar called Tom o’ Bedlam

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.300
until he can unframe himself.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.249
The older daughters decide they’ll have
to fight Lear, and when they learn that Gloucester

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:15.249
is trying to help him, they have his eyes
plucked out, saying, “Out vile jelly!”

00:09:15.249 --> 00:09:19.379
They give Gloucester’s land to Edmund, who
they are both obsessed with.

00:09:19.379 --> 00:09:21.139
Because Edmund is hot.

00:09:21.139 --> 00:09:26.589
Edgar, the non-hot, non-sociopathic one, finds
his father and promises to help Gloucester

00:09:26.589 --> 00:09:28.240
commit suicide.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.829
But it’s a weird trick.

00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:31.209
Gloucester lives.

00:09:31.209 --> 00:09:34.829
Cordelia has come back from France to help
her father, who has gone mad.

00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:36.089
There’s a fight.

00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:40.529
Lear and Cordelia are taken prisoner and Cordelia
is strangled before Edmund, suddenly overcome

00:09:40.529 --> 00:09:42.629
with remorse, can free her.

00:09:42.629 --> 00:09:43.869
Edgar kills Edmund.

00:09:43.869 --> 00:09:45.009
Goneril poisons Regan.

00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:46.009
Goneril kills herself.

00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:47.180
Lear dies of a broken heart.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.269
Gloucester dies for no reason.

00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:52.380
They try to make Kent king, but he says he’s
going to die, too.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:56.300
Everyone is sad, the fool is still missing,
and… scene!

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.009
Thanks, Thoughtbubble.

00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:59.839
I may never feel happy again.

00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:02.980
So at the beginning, Lear makes a couple of
wrong calls.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.990
He’s wrong to give up his kingship and expect
to live like a king.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:12.259
He’s wrong to ask his daughters to perform
their love rather than to honestly feel it.

00:10:12.259 --> 00:10:17.939
But throughout the rest of the play, we see
him wrestle with and regret his bad decisions.

00:10:17.939 --> 00:10:22.290
He’s never depicted as a monster or a sinner
who can’t be redeemed.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:28.499
He’s a sad and increasingly crazy old man
who asks for our sympathy and probably gets

00:10:28.499 --> 00:10:29.499
it.

00:10:29.499 --> 00:10:32.610
There are a couple of exciting reversals:
Lear’s team is going to win.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:33.610
No, it isn’t!

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:37.189
Oh wait, yes it is, but ... everyone we care
about is dead.

00:10:37.189 --> 00:10:40.670
One of the really clever things Shakespeare
does, is withhold recognition.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:46.239
There’s some discrepancy between the quarto
and folio versions, but in his last moments,

00:10:46.239 --> 00:10:50.239
Lear seems to imagine that Cordelia might
still be alive.

00:10:50.239 --> 00:10:54.929
Shakespeare asks us to decide whether it’s
better to live with this comforting illusion

00:10:54.929 --> 00:10:59.970
or to accept the harsh, unvarnished truth.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.059
We made it.

00:11:01.059 --> 00:11:06.529
And now maybe we better understand what it
is to be human and to fail and suffer and…

00:11:06.529 --> 00:11:08.970
[[swear, swear, swear]] whatis?

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:09.970
Stan?

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:13.149
Has that been you the whole time?

00:11:13.149 --> 00:11:15.009
You’re not my dad’s ghost!

00:11:15.009 --> 00:11:16.009
Okay.

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:18.989
Next time is going to be a little more cheerful
as we look at Shakespeare’s comedies and

00:11:18.989 --> 00:11:23.019
a genre that critics went on to call the romances
or the problem plays.

00:11:23.019 --> 00:11:34.579
Because—spoiler alert—there are some problems.

00:11:34.579 --> 00:12:02.789
Until then… curtain!
