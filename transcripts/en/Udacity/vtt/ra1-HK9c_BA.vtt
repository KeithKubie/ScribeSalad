00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.420
Property 2 says that each level must be consistent. In other words,

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.060
that Operations preserve invariance.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.080
We will use the term Valid to denote Operations with these properties. That is,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.760
we wanted to be to, want to ensure that all our operations are valid.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.290
Using the rotations we just introduced, we can express Property 2 precisely by

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.655
saying that for each operation. The following must hold. Well, first off, that

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:31.101
we have an abstract invariant over state s', and we have the preconditions for

00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:36.140
s, and we have the postconditions for s. If we have all three of those things,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.630
then the invariant, the abstract invariant must hold on the state afterwards.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.488
Remember that that's the state s' with an apostrophe on it.

00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:48.810
You have, invariant true before on the state.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.940
You have the pre-conditions all set so the operation can run.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.380
If the operation runs and leaves the post conditions the way we expect. And

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.405
it better be the case that the invariants are true on the state resulting.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.650
Now that said for the model that we've done so far there is no invariance.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.620
Okay, but we're going to need this later when we get to the refinement so

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.460
I thought I'd introduce it now.
