Thanks, Lauren. Let's move on to behavioral observation. What do we mean by

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.682
this? Remember that personality involves consistent and unique styles of

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:15.182
behaving, thinking, feeling, and our motivations. Now, it is the case that

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:20.942
other people cannot directly observe our thoughts. Internal feelings or

00:00:20.942 --> 00:00:27.360
motivations. However, they can directly observe behavior. So having observers

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.020
make ratings of personality, based on behavior, is one technique used by

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.303
psychologist, to rate personality. This technique is popular when ratings of

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:40.335
personality, need to made be of people who can not easily describe their own

00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:46.082
personality, such as young children. But it's not so simple as having a person

00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:50.850
sit down and rate the personality of another. Why is that?
