okay I'd like to just start by thanking
the organizers for the invitation to be

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:06.970
the organizers for the invitation to be
 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.940
the organizers for the invitation to be
here to speak to you all I'm going to

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:08.950
here to speak to you all I'm going to
 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.759
here to speak to you all I'm going to
talk about the health impacts of methyl

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:11.769
talk about the health impacts of methyl
 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.890
talk about the health impacts of methyl
mercury in fish and marine mammals and

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900
mercury in fish and marine mammals and
 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.470
mercury in fish and marine mammals and
when I say methyl mercury I want to I

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480
when I say methyl mercury I want to I
 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.940
when I say methyl mercury I want to I
want you to think about methyl mercury

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950
want you to think about methyl mercury
 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.680
want you to think about methyl mercury
as a prototype for bioaccumulative

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.690
as a prototype for bioaccumulative
 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.980
as a prototype for bioaccumulative
contaminants so methyl mercury like many

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990
contaminants so methyl mercury like many
 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.350
contaminants so methyl mercury like many
persistent synthetic organic chemicals

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360
persistent synthetic organic chemicals
 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.170
persistent synthetic organic chemicals
that we release bio magnifies and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180
that we release bio magnifies and
 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.060
that we release bio magnifies and
aquatic food webs and what I mean by

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070
aquatic food webs and what I mean by
 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.340
aquatic food webs and what I mean by
that is because shows so for each

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350
that is because shows so for each
 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.799
that is because shows so for each
successive trophic level in a food web

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809
successive trophic level in a food web
 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.529
successive trophic level in a food web
so as each organism eats other organisms

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539
so as each organism eats other organisms
 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:45.810
so as each organism eats other organisms
you have a magnification of that

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820
you have a magnification of that
 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.729
you have a magnification of that
chemical in a food web so in aquatic

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739
chemical in a food web so in aquatic
 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.979
chemical in a food web so in aquatic
environments concentrations can be very

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989
environments concentrations can be very
 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.169
environments concentrations can be very
low in the aqueous environment so in the

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179
low in the aqueous environment so in the
 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:54.540
low in the aqueous environment so in the
water or seawater and you can get

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550
water or seawater and you can get
 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.549
water or seawater and you can get
concentrations then and top predators

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559
concentrations then and top predators
 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.189
concentrations then and top predators
that are a million times are more higher

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199
that are a million times are more higher
 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.559
that are a million times are more higher
and so what that means about your food

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:01.569
and so what that means about your food
 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.020
and so what that means about your food
source is then that that dietary intake

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030
source is then that that dietary intake
 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.600
source is then that that dietary intake
becomes a concentrated source of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610
becomes a concentrated source of
 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.719
becomes a concentrated source of
chemical exposure now fish and marine

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729
chemical exposure now fish and marine
 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.310
chemical exposure now fish and marine
mammals so I work in a number of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320
mammals so I work in a number of
 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.399
mammals so I work in a number of
northern Arctic populations those are

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409
northern Arctic populations those are
 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.560
northern Arctic populations those are
essential food sources for many of these

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570
essential food sources for many of these
 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.450
essential food sources for many of these
people so this becomes a large intake

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460
people so this becomes a large intake
 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.109
people so this becomes a large intake
source for these toxic chemicals now

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119
source for these toxic chemicals now
 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.940
source for these toxic chemicals now
methyl mercury specifically has been

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950
methyl mercury specifically has been
 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.219
methyl mercury specifically has been
associated with a variety of adverse

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229

health effects the developing fetus is
the most sensitive target for methyl

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770
the most sensitive target for methyl
 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.560
the most sensitive target for methyl
mercury particularly during the third

mercury particularly during the third
 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.170
mercury particularly during the third
trimester of pregnancy and this has been

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180
trimester of pregnancy and this has been
 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.990
trimester of pregnancy and this has been
associated with long-term neurocognitive

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689
delays in children you know I could go
 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.510
delays in children you know I could go
on about health impacts of methyl

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520
on about health impacts of methyl
 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.310
on about health impacts of methyl
mercury or all or any of these other

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320
mercury or all or any of these other
 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.429
mercury or all or any of these other
chemicals I think we can all agree we

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439
chemicals I think we can all agree we
 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.310
chemicals I think we can all agree we
would like less of them in our food it

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320
would like less of them in our food it
 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.260
would like less of them in our food it
becomes much more complicated when we

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270
becomes much more complicated when we
 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.719
becomes much more complicated when we
start looking at the food itself so when

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729
start looking at the food itself so when
 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.940
start looking at the food itself so when
you start to think about seafood or

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950
you start to think about seafood or
 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.889
you start to think about seafood or
marine mammals in these populations

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899
marine mammals in these populations
 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.600
marine mammals in these populations
that's their traditional diet if you

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610
that's their traditional diet if you
 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.250
that's their traditional diet if you
advise people to change their

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260
advise people to change their
 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.600
advise people to change their
traditional diet

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610
traditional diet
 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.660
traditional diet
or to eat less fish then you're

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670
or to eat less fish then you're
 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.460
or to eat less fish then you're
introducing a whole nother risk scenario

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470
introducing a whole nother risk scenario
 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.310

don't want to advise people to consume

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580
don't want to advise people to consume

how do you craft a risk message that

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820
how do you craft a risk message that
 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.110
how do you craft a risk message that
isn't actually harmful to public health

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120
isn't actually harmful to public health
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.730
isn't actually harmful to public health
you can see from this plot that you it

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740
you can see from this plot that you it
 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.070
you can see from this plot that you it
is actually possible to pick species

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080
is actually possible to pick species
 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.480
is actually possible to pick species
that are relatively high in omega-3

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490
that are relatively high in omega-3
 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.610
that are relatively high in omega-3
fatty acids for example and low in

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620
fatty acids for example and low in
 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.979
fatty acids for example and low in
methyl mercury or species that are high

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989
methyl mercury or species that are high
 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.520
methyl mercury or species that are high
in methyl mercury but low in

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530
in methyl mercury but low in
 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.810
in methyl mercury but low in
micronutrients so you can craft a

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820
micronutrients so you can craft a
 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.180
micronutrients so you can craft a
message it's very complicated

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190
message it's very complicated
 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.130
message it's very complicated
so you think about introducing public

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140
so you think about introducing public
 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.440
so you think about introducing public
health messages it's very difficult to

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450
health messages it's very difficult to
 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.600
health messages it's very difficult to
parse a message for the general public

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610
parse a message for the general public
 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.110
parse a message for the general public

themselves and then the economic

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870
themselves and then the economic
 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.509
themselves and then the economic
implications so are these different

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519
implications so are these different
 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.490
implications so are these different
choices affordable and that's very

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500
choices affordable and that's very
 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.220
choices affordable and that's very
interesting it's been you know it's it's

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230
interesting it's been you know it's it's
 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.050
interesting it's been you know it's it's
a complicated scenario because we're

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060
a complicated scenario because we're
 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.390
a complicated scenario because we're
talking about you know intervening in

and what I'd like to introduce now is
 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.550
and what I'd like to introduce now is
just getting us thinking more broadly

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560
just getting us thinking more broadly
 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.360
just getting us thinking more broadly
about what perhaps are some other

this is something that I've been looking
 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.360
this is something that I've been looking
at for a number of years so for methyl

you know we think about global

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320
you know we think about global
 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.600

through the atmosphere sometimes we
 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:49.740
through the atmosphere sometimes we
think about them is distributed through

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750
think about them is distributed through
 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.990
think about them is distributed through
global ocean circulation and we also

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000
global ocean circulation and we also
 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.880
global ocean circulation and we also
redistribute them through the global

redistribute them through the global
commercial fisheries market okay so this

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410
commercial fisheries market okay so this
 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.320
commercial fisheries market okay so this
is why we perhaps have been concerned

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330
is why we perhaps have been concerned
 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.930
is why we perhaps have been concerned
from a public health perspective about

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940
from a public health perspective about
 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.230
from a public health perspective about

another dimension to this public health

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979
another dimension to this public health
 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.159
another dimension to this public health
problem is the communities that rely on

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169
problem is the communities that rely on
 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.290
problem is the communities that rely on
these resources exclusively so we have

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300
these resources exclusively so we have
 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.850
these resources exclusively so we have
choices we have lots of food

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860
choices we have lots of food
 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.590

when you think about some of these

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340
when you think about some of these
 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.870
when you think about some of these

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880
coastal communities in East Asia that
 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.850
coastal communities in East Asia that
rely on these resources they have very

rely on these resources they have very
 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.310
rely on these resources they have very
few choices okay so it's an essential

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320
few choices okay so it's an essential

source of micronutrients it's an
 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.330

away from their country foods then

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330
away from their country foods then
 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.880
away from their country foods then
they're immediately shifting to

they're immediately shifting to
 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.310
they're immediately shifting to

years again for mercury so we're looking

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:49.449
years again for mercury so we're looking
 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:51.390
years again for mercury so we're looking
at where do those contaminants go when

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400
at where do those contaminants go when
 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.860
at where do those contaminants go when
they're released into the physical

they're released into the physical
 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.710
they're released into the physical

building on recently we did a global
 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.680
building on recently we did a global
inventory from Mercury in rivers and we

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690
inventory from Mercury in rivers and we
 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.330
inventory from Mercury in rivers and we
put that into an ocean general

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.340
put that into an ocean general
 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.279
put that into an ocean general
circulation model to look at where does

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:05.289

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:07.529
circulation model to look at where does
that Glo go globally and how does it

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:07.539
that Glo go globally and how does it
 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:11.490
that Glo go globally and how does it
disperse and what you see on the far

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:11.500
disperse and what you see on the far
 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.159
disperse and what you see on the far
side here is the Arctic and this is

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:14.169
side here is the Arctic and this is
 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.129
side here is the Arctic and this is
zooming in on a region of on the Asian

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:17.139
zooming in on a region of on the Asian
 

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:19.860
zooming in on a region of on the Asian
coastline and what you see obviously is

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:19.870
coastline and what you see obviously is
 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.710
coastline and what you see obviously is
that there's a concentration of mercury

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720
that there's a concentration of mercury
 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.129
that there's a concentration of mercury
in these coastal areas and so the

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:26.139
in these coastal areas and so the
 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:28.170
in these coastal areas and so the
implication again when you look at the

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:28.180
implication again when you look at the
 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.450
implication again when you look at the
the concentrations in these fish they're

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:30.460
the concentrations in these fish they're
 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.760
the concentrations in these fish they're

fish stocks themselves but the larger

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:42.729
fish stocks themselves but the larger
 

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:44.339

public health I just want to leave you

00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:44.349
public health I just want to leave you
 

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:45.839
public health I just want to leave you
with this the larger public health

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:45.849
with this the larger public health
 

00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:47.760
with this the larger public health
concern that I think we should be

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:47.770
concern that I think we should be
 

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.279
concern that I think we should be
thinking about is what happens if you

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:50.289
thinking about is what happens if you
 

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:53.029
thinking about is what happens if you
know these large concentrations from

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039
know these large concentrations from
 

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:56.370
know these large concentrations from
industrialization in Asia largely in the

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:56.380
industrialization in Asia largely in the
 

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.110
industrialization in Asia largely in the
Arctic a lot of these processes are

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.120
Arctic a lot of these processes are
 

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.300
Arctic a lot of these processes are
being forced by climate variability so

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.310
being forced by climate variability so
 

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.180
being forced by climate variability so
for permafrost melt freshwater discharge

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:03.190
for permafrost melt freshwater discharge
 

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.310

patterns you're threatened you're going

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:05.320
patterns you're threatened you're going
 

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.689
patterns you're threatened you're going
to start to threaten the stocks

00:08:06.689 --> 00:08:06.699
to start to threaten the stocks
 

00:08:06.699 --> 00:08:08.459
to start to threaten the stocks
themselves and so this is what we're

00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:08.469
themselves and so this is what we're
 

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:12.000
themselves and so this is what we're
looking into now thank you sorry
