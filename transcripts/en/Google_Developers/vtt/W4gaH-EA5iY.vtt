00:00:00.434 --> 00:00:04.934
[applause]

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:06.801
Kevin Gibbs: Great.
Thanks a lot, Mike.

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:09.300
Well, I want to talk about
one more thing about SDC

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.434
before I move on,
and that's integration.

00:00:11.434 --> 00:00:14.200
Now, if any of you have worked
with web services before,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.601
you know that there are
a lot of different types

00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:18.133
and a lot of different formats,

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.968
and integrating
is not always easy.

00:00:19.968 --> 00:00:22.534
To help with that,
something that we've done

00:00:22.534 --> 00:00:24.801
is we've worked with a number
of Enterprise partners

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:26.267
to create connectors for SDC,

00:00:26.267 --> 00:00:27.367
that make it easy to work

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:28.968
with the Enterprise
software packages

00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:30.467
that you already have.

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:32.701
There are already
50 connectors available,

00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:34.968
and if there's an
Enterprise software package

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.734
you're using that doesn't
have a connector,

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:38.334
we have
another set of partners

00:00:38.334 --> 00:00:39.367
who are eager to help out,

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:40.901
can help you create a solution.

00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:44.267
Now, let's recap about
what I've already talked about

00:00:44.267 --> 00:00:45.734
this evening really briefly.

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:47.968
I've talked about some
major features for App Engine.

00:00:47.968 --> 00:00:51.267
One, we have the ability to
purchase additional resources.

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:54.000
We talked about
the cron support for App Engine.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.534
We talked about the ability

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:57.734
to import
large amounts of data

00:00:57.734 --> 00:01:00.267
and the ability to access data
behind the firewall.

00:01:00.267 --> 00:01:03.267
Now, we think
all of these things together

00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:05.767
make App Engine
a more viable platform

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:06.934
for more developers

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:09.334
and more people
who are building applications,

00:01:09.334 --> 00:01:11.400
but we still have
a promise to keep to you.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.133
When I was here last year,
one year to this day,

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.267
I promised that Python

00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:17.434
was just the first language
for App Engine,

00:01:17.434 --> 00:01:20.033
the first runtime language
that we would support.

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:22.767
Thus tonight,
I'm really excited to announce

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:25.133
our early look
at Java language support

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:27.567
for App Engine.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:28.801
[applause]

00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:33.033
Now--

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:34.801
Now, what's up
with the early look?

00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:36.567
You guys might be wondering.

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:38.100
Now, the reason
for the early look

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.467
is that we feel that the support
we're launching right now

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:41.901
is not yet complete.

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.367
We've got a lot of details
that we need to work out,

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:47.234
and things that we need to make
run a little more smoothly.

00:01:47.234 --> 00:01:49.601
Particularly, due to the nature
of the environment,

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:51.400
we know a lot of software
that you're used to

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.300
and a lot of frameworks
you've used before

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.934
may need some slight adjustments

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:56.534
to work properly
on App Engine.

00:01:56.534 --> 00:01:59.734
Thus, we want to learn
what those things are

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:01.734
and get your help to fix them,

00:02:01.734 --> 00:02:03.901
so that we can make App Engine
work better for you

00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:05.033
and for everyone else,

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:06.601
so that's why we're giving you

00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:08.300
this early access
to the product,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.367
to get that feedback,

00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:12.067
and get the product on track.

00:02:12.067 --> 00:02:13.868
Now, with all of that said,

00:02:13.868 --> 00:02:15.667
I think what we're launching
to you tonight

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:16.801
is pretty impressive.

00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:17.934
For the first time,

00:02:17.934 --> 00:02:20.534
we've given you
an in-to-in solution,

00:02:20.534 --> 00:02:23.501
a runtime, a Java runtime
for App Engine,

00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:26.334
an Eclipse plugin
for the Eclipse IDE,

00:02:26.334 --> 00:02:29.100
and integrated
Google Web Toolkit support

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.100
for your UI.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.267
Altogether,
this allows you--

00:02:32.267 --> 00:02:33.267
[applause]

00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:34.701
Thanks.

00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:36.167
Altogether,
this allows you

00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:38.834
to build a client
and the server together,

00:02:38.834 --> 00:02:41.067
in one integrated
development experience,

00:02:41.067 --> 00:02:42.734
using a single language,

00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:45.334
and a single, seamless
application that you create.

00:02:45.334 --> 00:02:46.734
We think that's pretty cool.

00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:48.601
So tonight,
for the rest of the night,

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:49.901
I'm going to take you through

00:02:49.901 --> 00:02:52.267
our early look at Java support
for App Engine.

00:02:52.267 --> 00:02:54.734
I'm going to take you through,
initially,

00:02:54.734 --> 00:02:57.367
a demonstration that we built
using GuestBook,

00:02:57.367 --> 00:02:59.701
an application
that just allows you

00:02:59.701 --> 00:03:01.100
to quickly enter some stuff.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.868
Andrew is going to take you
through that demo

00:03:03.868 --> 00:03:05.567
and how we built
the GuestBook app.

00:03:05.567 --> 00:03:07.701
Then I'm also going to
bring on some partners

00:03:07.701 --> 00:03:09.467
who've built
some real-world apps

00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:11.400
using App Engine,
Google Web Toolkit,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.434
and other things,

00:03:12.434 --> 00:03:14.200
so that you can see how
this can be--

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.567
you could use this yourself

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:17.267
to accomplish
some other things.

00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:18.734
But to get started,

00:03:18.734 --> 00:03:21.067
let me take you through
the Java runtime support

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:22.267
for App Engine.

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:24.968
Now, our Java runtime support
for App Engine

00:03:24.968 --> 00:03:26.667
allows you to utilize
all the APIs

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:28.868
that you already have available
on App Engine.

00:03:28.868 --> 00:03:31.901
That includes things like
our scalable data store,

00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:34.300
which is based on BigTable,
not SQL,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.133
things like memcache,
our serving architecture,

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:39.334
and also all of the existing
management tools

00:03:39.334 --> 00:03:40.334
you've been using,

00:03:40.334 --> 00:03:42.367
such as our
administration console,

00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:44.534
the billing support
I mentioned earlier,

00:03:44.534 --> 00:03:45.701
and all of that.

00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:46.834
It makes it easy for you

00:03:46.834 --> 00:03:49.000
to build and deploy
web applications.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.167
But there's something

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:52.133
that I think
is particularly interesting

00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:53.334
about our Java support.

00:03:53.334 --> 00:03:55.501
We built our Java support
around Servlets

00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:57.968
and the web.xml standard.

00:03:57.968 --> 00:04:00.701
These are the standard ways
of building web apps in Java,

00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:02.234
so what that means for you,

00:04:02.234 --> 00:04:04.601
is if you've ever built
a web app in Java before,

00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:05.901
you probably already know

00:04:05.901 --> 00:04:08.067
how to build a web app
for Google App Engine.

00:04:08.067 --> 00:04:09.834
It's the same thing
you're used to,

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:11.601
written in the same way.

00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:13.667
Now, the other major detail

00:04:13.667 --> 00:04:16.167
about our Java runtime
support for App Engine,

00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:20.167
is that it is a full
Java 1.6 JVM.

00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:21.400
Now, what does that mean?

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.033
That means two important things.

00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:24.200
One, it means that

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.801
we're running byte code
on the server,

00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:27.467
not your source code.

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:30.667
You only send us
your compiled application.

00:04:30.667 --> 00:04:33.267
Two, it means that because
we're running byte code,

00:04:33.267 --> 00:04:35.501
App Engine's
Java runtime support

00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:38.667
can run other languages
that compile to Java byte code,

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:42.067
things like JavaScript,
Ruby, Groovy,

00:04:42.067 --> 00:04:43.701
and other projects.

00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:45.100
Now, I should make it clear--

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.100
just because we can
run those languages

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.467
in the Java runtime support,

00:04:48.467 --> 00:04:50.234
doesn't mean
that your applications

00:04:50.234 --> 00:04:52.968
written in those languages
will just work automatically.

00:04:52.968 --> 00:04:54.267
There's still a lot of work

00:04:54.267 --> 00:04:55.601
to be done with integration,

00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:57.601
to make sure everything
runs smoothly,

00:04:57.601 --> 00:04:59.968
particularly with
our serving infrastructure

00:04:59.968 --> 00:05:02.334
and our security infrastructure
on App Engine,

00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:05.868
many frameworks will need to be
adjusted slightly.

00:05:05.868 --> 00:05:07.033
We also have a white list

00:05:07.033 --> 00:05:08.801
of JRE classes
that are available,

00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:10.801
which may sometimes result
in changes.

00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:12.934
However, that's why
we're launching this

00:05:12.934 --> 00:05:13.968
early to you now,

00:05:13.968 --> 00:05:15.200
so we can get your help

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.501
in making sure everything

00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:18.968
does work smoothly
on App Engine.

00:05:18.968 --> 00:05:22.367
Now, our overall goal
with our entry in Java support

00:05:22.367 --> 00:05:23.934
is to give you tools

00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:26.000
that compliment
your existing workflow,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.868
how you already
build applications.

00:05:27.868 --> 00:05:30.567
And one thing we know
about a lot of Java developers

00:05:30.567 --> 00:05:33.801
is that you use IDEs
to get these applications built.

00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:35.701
So as I mentioned earlier,

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:37.234
that's why I'm excited tonight

00:05:37.234 --> 00:05:40.000
to announce
the Google plugin for Eclipse.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.634
The Google plugin for Eclipse

00:05:41.634 --> 00:05:44.467
integrates every step
of the application development,

00:05:44.467 --> 00:05:46.634
from creating
and managing a project

00:05:46.634 --> 00:05:48.567
to doing local testing
and debugging,

00:05:48.567 --> 00:05:51.367
and to finally
deploying to App Engine.

00:05:51.367 --> 00:05:54.067
It even integrates
using Google Web Toolkit

00:05:54.067 --> 00:05:55.467
to create your front-end UI,

00:05:55.467 --> 00:05:57.334
which I'll talk about
a little bit later.

00:05:57.334 --> 00:06:00.234
Now, we think this is great
for productivity.

00:06:00.234 --> 00:06:02.434
You're programming
just in one language,

00:06:02.434 --> 00:06:03.868
in one familiar IDE

00:06:03.868 --> 00:06:05.501
that you're
already comfortable with.

00:06:05.501 --> 00:06:08.767
And because App Engine
is always free to get started,

00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:11.267
it means that anyone
can download this SDK

00:06:11.267 --> 00:06:14.234
and start building
an application right away.

00:06:14.234 --> 00:06:16.601
Now, I want you to know
one other thing, though.

00:06:16.601 --> 00:06:19.434
Although we are launching
the Google plugin for Eclipse,

00:06:19.434 --> 00:06:22.133
we're in no way tied
to this Eclipse support.

00:06:22.133 --> 00:06:24.934
We're also providing you
with robust, stand-alone tools

00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:27.367
that you can use
to build applications,

00:06:27.367 --> 00:06:29.300
and that means that you can work
with other IDEs

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.367
like IntelliJ or Visual Studio,

00:06:31.367 --> 00:06:34.467
or you can work with tools
on the command line.

00:06:34.467 --> 00:06:38.868
Now, one more aspect about
our Java support for App Engine

00:06:38.868 --> 00:06:40.734
that I'm particularly
excited about

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:43.100
is our support for standards.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.567
Our Java support
for App Engine

00:06:45.567 --> 00:06:48.567
is 100% standard spaced.

00:06:48.567 --> 00:06:50.334
Now, what does that mean?

00:06:50.334 --> 00:06:52.300
That means two key things.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.601
One, it means
that if you choose,

00:06:54.601 --> 00:06:56.000
you can build an application

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.834
on our early look at Java
support for App Engine

00:06:58.834 --> 00:07:02.167
that does not use
a single proprietary API.

00:07:02.167 --> 00:07:04.767
Through these standards
for everything that we do,

00:07:04.767 --> 00:07:07.400
including specifying
your web application

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.734
for accessing HTTP resources,

00:07:09.734 --> 00:07:11.801
and even for working
with our datastore,

00:07:11.801 --> 00:07:13.167
which is based on BigTable,

00:07:13.167 --> 00:07:15.968
there is a standard
that you can use

00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:19.801
backed by a JSR and sign
for building your application.

00:07:19.801 --> 00:07:21.434
For our datastore in particular,

00:07:21.434 --> 00:07:23.934
we're supporting
the Java persistence API

00:07:23.934 --> 00:07:26.067
and the Java data
object standards.

00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:28.100
And that means that if
you build an application

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.834
with these standard APIs,

00:07:29.834 --> 00:07:32.367
your same application
can work with BigTable

00:07:32.367 --> 00:07:34.834
and a SQL server easily.

00:07:34.834 --> 00:07:37.901
Now, the second detail
about our standard support

00:07:37.901 --> 00:07:40.634
is that if you choose to build
your application

00:07:40.634 --> 00:07:41.934
to all of these standards,

00:07:41.934 --> 00:07:43.067
it makes it easy for you

00:07:43.067 --> 00:07:45.334
to run your application
elsewhere,

00:07:45.334 --> 00:07:46.901
because these same standard APIs

00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:49.400
work in any other
Servlet container.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.567
That means that you can build
an application on App Engine,

00:07:52.567 --> 00:07:54.200
and without changing
the line of code

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.033
or making any significant
modifications,

00:07:56.033 --> 00:07:58.601
you can run that application
on premise...

00:07:58.601 --> 00:08:00.934
behind your firewall.

00:08:00.934 --> 00:08:04.200
You're not locked in
to using our cloud.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.234
So, with that,
if you're like me,

00:08:06.234 --> 00:08:07.501
you're probably itching

00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:09.033
to actually see
a demo of this,

00:08:09.033 --> 00:08:10.200
and see how it all works.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.300
So for that,

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.834
I'd like to call up
Andrew Bowers,

00:08:12.834 --> 00:08:14.067
the product manager at Google,

00:08:14.067 --> 00:08:15.467
and he's
going to step you through

00:08:15.467 --> 00:08:16.868
creating a GuestBook application

00:08:16.868 --> 00:08:20.601
using our Eclipse integration
and App Engine.

00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:22.000
Thank you, Andrew.
