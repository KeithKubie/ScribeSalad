so this is a area of interest to me and

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810
so this is a area of interest to me and
 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.240
so this is a area of interest to me and
my labs been studying this for a while

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250
my labs been studying this for a while
 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.780
my labs been studying this for a while
is this is why time is rubbery and can

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790
is this is why time is rubbery and can
 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.200
is this is why time is rubbery and can
speed up or slow down and the experiment

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210
speed up or slow down and the experiment
 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.589
speed up or slow down and the experiment
had never been done about why time seems

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599
had never been done about why time seems
 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.620
had never been done about why time seems
to move in slow motion when you're in a

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630
to move in slow motion when you're in a
 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.400
to move in slow motion when you're in a
life-threatening situation

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
life-threatening situation
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.650
life-threatening situation
but I talked to so many people and I'd

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660
but I talked to so many people and I'd
 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.810
but I talked to so many people and I'd
experienced it myself

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820
experienced it myself
 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.599
experienced it myself
that I wanted to study that so I found a

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
that I wanted to study that so I found a
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.580
that I wanted to study that so I found a
way to study it by by dropping people

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590
way to study it by by dropping people
 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.640
way to study it by by dropping people
from 150 foot tall tower and measuring

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650
from 150 foot tall tower and measuring
 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.139
from 150 foot tall tower and measuring
their time perception on the way down

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149
their time perception on the way down
 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.020
their time perception on the way down
and that plus several other experiments

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030
and that plus several other experiments
 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.630
and that plus several other experiments
we did in my lab led me to understand

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640
we did in my lab led me to understand
 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.090
we did in my lab led me to understand
that people don't actually see time in

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100
that people don't actually see time in
 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.729
that people don't actually see time in
slow motion during an event instead it's

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739
slow motion during an event instead it's
 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.670
slow motion during an event instead it's
a completely retrospective assessment in

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680
a completely retrospective assessment in
 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.840
a completely retrospective assessment in
other words when you're in a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850
other words when you're in a
 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.029
other words when you're in a
life-threatening situation your brain

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039
life-threatening situation your brain
 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.459
life-threatening situation your brain
writes down memory much more densely and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469
writes down memory much more densely and
 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.619
writes down memory much more densely and
then retrospectively when you look at

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629
then retrospectively when you look at
 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.630
then retrospectively when you look at
that you have so many details that you

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640
that you have so many details that you
 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.029
that you have so many details that you
don't normally have that it seems as

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039
don't normally have that it seems as
 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.680
don't normally have that it seems as
though it must have lasted a very long

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
though it must have lasted a very long
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.720
though it must have lasted a very long
time that's the only interpretation your

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
time that's the only interpretation your
 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.780
time that's the only interpretation your
brain can make so time your assessment

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
brain can make so time your assessment
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.330
brain can make so time your assessment
of how long something took has a lot to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340
of how long something took has a lot to
 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.640
of how long something took has a lot to
do with how much energy your brain has

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
do with how much energy your brain has
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.039
do with how much energy your brain has
to burn during the event and how much

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
to burn during the event and how much
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.210
to burn during the event and how much
footage you have of the event
