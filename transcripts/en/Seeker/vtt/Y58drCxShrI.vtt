00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.300
Expiration dates aren't
actually expiration dates.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.195
Important information ahead
so you could eat more food.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.731
Hey.

00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:12.230
Everyone.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.500
Laci Green here for D News.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.455
A study published by Harvard
Law School says 90% of us

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:19.660
are throwing away food that's a
perfectly delicious and edible.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.060
We think that food has
gone bad when it hasn't.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.330
Even if it doesn't look or smell
bad, once the date has passed,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.260
it gives us the
heebie-jeebies to eat it.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.430
I know you've been there.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.245
I've definitely been there.

00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:33.100
If I eat this, this is going
to make me sick or kill me.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.280
The problem is that this
expiration date-induced

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.040
paranoia results in
several billion pounds

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.289
of unnecessary food
waste every year.

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.330
The study points the finger
at America's hot mess

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.660
of a food labeling system.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.810
There's no federally
binding system,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.050
so every state and local
area has their own rules

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.960
and regulations.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.914
And within that, there's
a ton of variability.

00:00:50.914 --> 00:00:53.080
There are different regulations
for different areas,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.700
for different
foods, which ends up

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.230
being inconsistent
and plain confusing.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.890
Between "best by" and "sell
by" and "best if used before,"

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.390
how is an everyday
American supposed

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.765
to know what's
still safe to eat?

00:01:03.765 --> 00:01:06.098
The thing about expiration
dates is that they can't ever

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:08.380
give an exact date that
something's going to go bad.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.670
It's really variable.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.580
And as for the current
labels, the "best by" label

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.864
indicates when the product
is in its peak freshness.

00:01:14.864 --> 00:01:16.530
But even if it's not
fresh, that doesn't

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.080
mean you can't eat or drink it.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.270
Sell by date, on the other
hand, is a guide for you,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.120
but for the grocer.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.190
It's the date that
the product should

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.770
be sold in order to get to
you while it's still fresh.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.340
In general, using your eyes,
nose, and a little common sense

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.610
is a good idea.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.190
Have your tomatoes gone wrinkly?

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.780
They're just a little
dehydrated, but probably not

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.660
going to kill you.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.150
Have they decomposed
and gone mushy?

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.910
Well, I'm not sure I'd eat that.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.370
But to be honest, I've
eaten a ton of expired crap

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.719
and I've never gotten sick
from it that I know of.

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.760
One of the scientists who
reviewed the study said

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.745
that in his 30 years of
studying food safety,

00:01:47.745 --> 00:01:49.810
he's never seen any
illnesses break out from food

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.304
kept on the shelf or in the
fridge past its expiration date

00:01:52.304 --> 00:01:53.970
as long as the food
was stored properly,

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.172
because like keeping meat
in the store wrapping

00:01:56.172 --> 00:01:58.630
to avoid spreading bacteria
and making sure it doesn't leak

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.920
on other things in the
fridge, not putting things

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.130
like sour cream or yogurt back
into the original container

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.890
once you've taken
it out, not putting

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.331
in open cans in
the fridge-- these

00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:09.039
are the kind of things
that go a long way

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.247
to keep you safe and healthy.

00:02:10.247 --> 00:02:11.920
The researchers think
the food industry

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.495
should go a lot further, too.

00:02:13.495 --> 00:02:16.450
They're advocating a clear
and consistent food labeling

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.610
system, regulated at
the federal level.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.370
They want smart
labels that clearly

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.755
relay safety information.

00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:23.130
And they want the
"sell by" dates

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.587
to be made invisible so that
customers don't get confused.

00:02:25.587 --> 00:02:28.170
Not only is this a food safety
issue, but it's one of the ways

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.580
that we can prevent food waste.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.550
And by preventing
food waste, we prevent

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.030
a lot of wasted labor,
natural resources,

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.620
and we lower our
already tremendous toll

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.630
on the environment.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.210
So have you thrown out food
at the expiration date,

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.766
or do you eat with
your nose first?

00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:43.140
Tell me about it down below
on the on the D News Facebook

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.640
page.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.910
And I'll see you next time.
