00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.450
All right.

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.730
We're now on problem number
5, on page 408.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.440
And they have this little
drawing here, and it says, on

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.350
the disk shown above, a player
spins the arrow, this little

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.660
blue arrow.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.430
A player spins the
arrow twice.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:25.010
The fraction a/b is formed,
where a is the number of the

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:34.760
sector where the arrow stopped
after the first spin, and b is

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.600
a number of the sector where
the arrow stopped after the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.850
second spin.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.070
On every spin, each of the
numbered sectors has an equal

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.010
probability of being
the sector on

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.350
which the arrow stops.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.780
What is the probability that
the fraction a/b is

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.410
greater than 1?

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.330
So they want to know the
probability that a/b is

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.850
greater than 1.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.420
Well, the first thing you need
to realize is, this is just a

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.020
random number generator.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.720
The probability that any number
between 1 and 6 is

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.820
equal, so this could just be
a roll of a six sided die.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.820
And saying well, if I roll a
six sided die twice, what's

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.110
the probability that the first
roll is going to be larger

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.150
than the second roll, right?

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.060
Because in order for this
fraction to be greater than 1,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.820
the numerator has to
be greater than the

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.510
denominator, right?

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.700
Or, you could just take a/b is
greater than 1, and multiply

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.626
both sides by b.

00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:38.650
And that's the same thing as
the probability that a is

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.460
greater than b.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.120
So we can set up a little table
and we could say, well,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.800
what's the probability of
getting each of these numbers

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.840
on the first roll?

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.160
And then given that probability,
or given that you

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.640
got, let's say, a 2 on the first
roll, what are the odds

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.090
that the second roll is going
to be less than the first

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.190
roll, right?

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:12.610
So let's say spin, call this
a spin, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.525
What's the probability of
getting each of these spins?

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.210
I'm just making up
notation as I go.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.390
But, hopefully this is
making sense to you.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.550
So the probability of
getting any one of

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.890
these is 1/6, right?

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.810
They all have an equal
probability of happening.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.560
1/6.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:52.876
Now, given each of these, what's
the probability that

00:02:52.876 --> 00:02:59.170
soon. your second spin is going
to be less than the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.500
first spin?

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.830
This is the second spin, b.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.290
Actually let's put an a here.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.000
The probability of a.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.720
That'll probably make
more sense to you.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.990
And then we want to know the
probably that the second spin,

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.080
b, is less than a.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.690
Well, if I got a 1 the first
time, what's the probability

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.980
that I get a number less
than 1 out of these?

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.310
Well, is there any number
less than 1?

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.650
There's 1, but that's not
even less than 1.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.700
That's equal to 1, so there's a
0 chance that I get a number

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.610
less than 1, right?

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.670
Because there is no number less
than 1 that I can get.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.320
If I got a 2, well there's only
one number less than 1

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.310
out of the six, right?

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.470
That's 1.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.720
So there's a 1/6 chance.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.110
A 3.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.610
If I got a 3 on the first spin,
I can only get a 1 or 2

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.200
on the second spin, right?

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.470
So that's a 2/6 chance.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.440
2/6.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.600
If I got a 4, I could
get a 1, 2, or 3.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.530
That's a 3/6.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.500
I think you see the
pattern here.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.360
There's a 4/6 chance of getting
something less than 5.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.570
And there's a 5/6 chance of
getting something less than 6.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.230
And so, what's the combined
probability now for each of

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.860
the scenarios?

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.410
So what is the probability that
I get a 1, and then I get

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.950
something less than 1?

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.220
Well, you just have to multiply
these probabilities.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.530
So that's a 0.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.590
What's the probability that I
get a 2, and then something

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.170
less than 2?

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.045
It's 1/6 times 1/6
which is 1/36.

00:04:33.045 --> 00:04:34.960
The probability that
I get a 3, and then

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.760
something less than 3?

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.600
Multiply them.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.350
It's 2/36.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.230
I think you see the pattern
here again.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:48.210
3/36, 4/36, and then 5/36.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.670
5/36 is the probability
to get a 6, and then

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.450
something less than a 6.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.760
So in general, the probability
that I get my first spin is

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.990
greater than my second spin is
going to be the sum of these

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.910
probabilities, right?

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.610
Because any one of these
scenarios would satisfy a

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.500
being greater than b.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.830
So I just add up these
probabilities.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.780
So the denominator for
all of them is 36.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.220
It says 0/36, right?

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:25.620
So it's essentially 1 plus
2 plus 3 plus 4 plus 5.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.530
Now let me add carefully
because this is where I

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.460
historically mess up my
problems. 1 plus 2 is 3.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.770
3 plus 3 is 6.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.990
6 plus 4 is 10.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.510
10 plus 5 is 15.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.990
So that equals 15/36.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.360
And that is choice you a.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.440
Move on to the next problem.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.160
We're on problem number 6.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.670
Which of the following tables
shows a relationship in which

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.350
w is proportional to x?

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.190
All right, so let's just
write them all out.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:22.180
So choice a, if we have wx, so
they have 1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.250
So w is proportional to x.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.190
Well, that also means that
x is going to be

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.200
proportional to w, right?

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.400
So in this case x is 3 times.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.750
So here we have times 3.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.350
0, 3.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.950
Here we have times 2 and
here we have times 5/3.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.000
So we're multiplying by a
different factor every time.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.960
So w is not proportional
to x and x is not

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.630
proportional to w.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.020
I'm just trying to figure out
what do I have to multiply w

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.920
by to get x?

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.810
What would I have to multiply
x by to get w?

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.730
They all have to be the same
in order for these two

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:55.810
variables to be proportional.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.450
So choice a is not right.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.450
Choice b.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.710
w, x, 3/9.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:14.120
Let's see what I'm doing,
3, 9, 4, 16, 5, 25.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.130
It looks like, in every scenario
here, we squared w to

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.430
get x or w is the square
root of x.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:21.720
But they're not proportional
because here we

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.610
multiplied by 3.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.500
Here we multiplied by 4, and
here we multiplied by 5.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.400
So once again, it's not
going to be choice b.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:30.840
c.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.910
I will change colors
for variety.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.060
I changed it to brown.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:46.150
C w, x, 5, 10, so I
multiplied by 2.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.740
This is what I'm
multiplying by.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.080
It's not 10 times 2.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.120
6 to 18, I multiplied by 3.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.290
I already know this
is wrong, right?

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.190
I multiplied by two
different factors.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.570
It's not choice c.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.300
Choice d.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.080
w.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.030
I did one of the later choices,
just to make sure we

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.280
do a lot of work.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.510
Choice d is 7 to 21.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.480
I multiplied by 3 to do that.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.030
8 to 24, times 3.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.350
Looks good so far.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.860
9 to 27, multiplied by 3

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.500
So, in every case, I multiplied
by the same factor.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.290
So w is proportionate to x and
x is proportionate to w.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.340
So d is our choice.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.409
I will see you in
the next video.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.763
And we don't have to worry about
e because we know that d

00:08:35.763 --> 00:08:36.659
is our choice.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:38.080
I'll see
