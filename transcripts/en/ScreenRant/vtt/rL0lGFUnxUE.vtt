00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.059
The box office may be dominated by sequels,
prequels and reboots these days, but when

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.410
a movie can stand on its own, it's truly a
success.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.020
But sometimes the movies that seem the most
original, most unique, or just the most successful

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.490
can hide serious links to other movies - even
establishing a shared movie universe audiences

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.050
never knew to look for.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.050
Until now.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.599
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Amazing Secret Relations
Between Popular Films.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.759
Avengers: Age of Ultron &amp; Castle in The Sky

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.400
The second Avengers team-up saw Marvel's best
take on an evil robot, hellbent on lifting

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.170
a city into the sky using cutting-edge technology.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.559
But it's not exactly an original idea.

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.550
Marvel fans may not have seen or heard of
Castle in the Sky, Miyazaki's first animated

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.109
movie released through the world famous Studio
Ghibli.

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.140
But the movie also happened to feature a floating
city, not to mention robots of its own.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.820
Did Ultron get his idea from the same animated
film?

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.859
The answer might be clear, once you catch
one of the movie's thin-limbed robot protectors,

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.870
rendered in 3D inside the Tony Stark's Avengers
Tower.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.890
Star Wars &amp; E.T.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.159
The Extraterrestrial

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.420
Since Steven Spielberg was one of the only
people to guess that Star Wars would be a

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.920
massive success, it only seems right for him
to include a nod in his own story of an alien

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.920
encounter.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.159
When Elliot takes E.T. out trick-or-treating,
a kid in a Yoda costume walks by, with E.T.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.130
seeming to recognize the other alien visitor.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.140
It was just a playful joke, but George Lucas
doubled down, making sure to include members

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.670
of E.T.'s race in his own Galactic Senate,
establishing that E.T. and Yoda really were

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.380
neighbors in the very same galaxy.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.350
Memento &amp; The Dark Knight Rises

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.750
You might think all the movies have in common
is dire tor Christopher Nolan, but a supporting

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.020
character suggests they take place in the
same universe.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.200
Actor Thomas Lennon is the key, having first
played a young, unnamed doctor in Nolan's

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.479
fragmented Memento.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.979
When filming began on the final chapter of
his Dark Knight Trilogy, Lennon got a call

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.640
to once again appear as Bruce Wayne's personal
doctor.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.510
Lennon played the same character, admitting
that he assumed it was the same doctor - which

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.289
meant, to him at least, the Batman story was
all taking place in the damaged brain of Memento's

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.689
hero, Leonard Shelby.

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.820
Spy Kids &amp; Machete

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.091
From the moment director Robert Rodriguez
met Danny Trejo on the set of Desperado, he

00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:16.940
began writing an entire film around his intimidating,
ruthless personality, picturing 'Machete'

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.170
as a Latin action hero.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.590
But before he could make the movie, Rodriguez
moved onto the family-friendly Spy Kids series.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.620
Seeing an opportunity, he cast Trejo as the
kids' Uncle Machete, eventually cutting a

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.510
mock trailer for a standalone movie as part
of the Grindhouse double feature.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.730
Two feature films would follow, making Uncle
Machete a memorable figure with two completely

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.569
different audiences.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.409
Collateral &amp; The Transporter

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.599
Before Jason Statham was a certified action
star, he made a name for himself in director

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.799
Guy Ritchie's tales of London crime - with
Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels his first.

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.090
Tom Cruise was apparently a fan, looking to
star in a Hollywood remake.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.040
That never happened, but Statham did land
a small role in Cruise's Collateral - a scene

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.160
that meant much more to Statham's fans.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.061
It's easy to see why most view the cameo as
an appearance by Frank Martin, the star of

00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:02.269
The Transporter series.

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.159
It's never stated outright, but Statham arriving,
delivering a bag, and asking no questions

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.349
is more than enough proof for fans.

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.950
The Rock &amp; Armageddon

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.730
Movie fans know that director Michael Bay's
movies tend to look alike - but there's actual

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.480
evidence to suggest they take place in the
same shared universe.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.800
At least, two of his most famous might.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.050
When the American President had to order an
airstrike on hostages held on Alcatraz, Bay

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.730
turned to actor Stanley Anderson for the job.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.599
Just a few years later, when an asteroid was
heading towards Earth in Armageddon, Bay called

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.730
on the exact same actor to deliver yet another
speech.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.180
Compared to the rest of the two movies, hearing
they're set in the same fictional timeline

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.650
isn't actually that hard to believe.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.000
Alien &amp; Spaceballs

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.159
It's the original Star Wars saga that Spaceballs
is parodying, but a single joke teases that

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.790
in THIS galaxy far, far away, Ellen Ripley
and her crew also ran into the unforgettable

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.670
monsters of the Alien movie series.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.090
How else do you explain the presence of actor
John Hurt, reprising his role as the unfortunate

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.850
victim of an alien chestburster?

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.989
In this universe, it's obviously not as serious
an injury.

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.969
Star Trek &amp; Star Wars

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:11.469
Can a single person really unite the two most
famous space franchises in history?

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:15.240
Fans have director JJ Abrams to thank for
linking the two series, including one of the

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.079
iconic R2 droids in not just the Star Trek
reboot, but in the sequel, Star Trek Into

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.079
Darkness.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.160
Audiences can still play favourites between
Trek and Wars, but on the big screen, a pair

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.070
of easter eggs means they no longer have to.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.139
The Fast and The Furious &amp; Herbie: Fully Loaded

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.680
As crazy as the world of the Fast &amp; Furious
may have become, cars are still cars - not

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.200
intelligent members of the cast.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.570
At least, not EVERY car in the franchise's
universe.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.060
At the end of the first movie, Dominic Toretto
accidentally totals his prized Dodge Charger

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.590
before running from the police.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.110
But fans will have to look to Herbie the Lovebug
to find out what happened to the car after

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.110
the crash.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.120
The opening of Herbie: Fully Loaded takes
place in a car-filled junkyard - with Toretto's

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.000
Charger sitting front and center.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.970
Now we can only wait until the Fast &amp; Furious
cars start talking themselves.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.090
The Abyss and Terminator 2

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.580
The Terminator spawned and entire multimedia
franchise, but fans may not realize that long

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.610
before shared universes were all the rage,
James Cameron had crafted his own.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.430
Aside from using the exact same news reporter
in the first Terminator movie as his underwater

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.790
adventure The Abyss, the company funding the
undersea oil mining operation is known as

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.370
Benthic Petroleum.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.590
The logo will look familiar, since it's the
same logo subtly plastered over the gas station

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.270
Sarah and John Connor visit in Terminator
2: Judgment Day.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.370
Those are all the subtle, sneaky, or downright
invisible links between hit movies that we

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.500
could find, but which ones do you know of
that we missed?
