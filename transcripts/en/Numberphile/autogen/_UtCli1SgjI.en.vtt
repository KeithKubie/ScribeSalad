are four ends so on each end we put a
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.630 align:start position:0%
are four ends so on each end we put a
toothpick<00:00:21.600><c> and</c><00:00:22.080><c> these</c><00:00:22.410><c> toothpicks</c><00:00:22.980><c> actually</c>

and<00:00:27.449><c> we</c><00:00:27.539><c> keep</c><00:00:27.689><c> going</c><00:00:28.050><c> we</c><00:00:28.439><c> do</c><00:00:28.590><c> this</c><00:00:28.769><c> forever</c><00:00:29.039><c> so</c>

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 align:start position:0%
and we keep going we do this forever so
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.089 align:start position:0%
and we keep going we do this forever so
the<00:00:29.849><c> next</c><00:00:30.090><c> generation</c><00:00:31.050><c> this</c><00:00:31.349><c> is</c><00:00:31.410><c> the</c><00:00:31.619><c> fourth</c>

the next generation this is the fourth
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
the next generation this is the fourth
step<00:00:32.579><c> we</c><00:00:33.059><c> had</c><00:00:33.600><c> for</c><00:00:33.870><c> free</c><00:00:34.140><c> ends</c><00:00:34.500><c> we're</c><00:00:35.100><c> gonna</c>

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 align:start position:0%
step we had for free ends we're gonna
 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.229 align:start position:0%
step we had for free ends we're gonna
add<00:00:35.520><c> four</c><00:00:36.270><c> more</c><00:00:36.600><c> toothpicks</c><00:00:37.579><c> those</c><00:00:38.579><c> those</c><00:00:39.000><c> two</c>

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
add four more toothpicks those those two
 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.330 align:start position:0%
add four more toothpicks those those two
toothpicks<00:00:39.750><c> met</c><00:00:40.140><c> at</c><00:00:40.440><c> the</c><00:00:40.739><c> middle</c><00:00:40.980><c> so</c><00:00:41.190><c> those</c>

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
toothpicks met at the middle so those
 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.220 align:start position:0%
toothpicks met at the middle so those
ends<00:00:41.579><c> are</c><00:00:41.670><c> no</c><00:00:41.790><c> longer</c><00:00:42.120><c> free</c><00:00:42.360><c> so</c><00:00:42.870><c> now</c><00:00:43.050><c> their</c>

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 align:start position:0%
ends are no longer free so now their
 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.979 align:start position:0%
ends are no longer free so now their
word<00:00:43.320><c> there</c><00:00:43.800><c> are</c><00:00:43.920><c> four</c><00:00:44.129><c> ends</c><00:00:44.520><c> so</c><00:00:45.030><c> we</c><00:00:45.059><c> add</c><00:00:45.360><c> four</c>

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 align:start position:0%
word there are four ends so we add four
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.450 align:start position:0%
word there are four ends so we add four
more<00:00:46.020><c> toothpicks</c><00:00:48.230><c> now</c><00:00:49.230><c> we've</c><00:00:49.590><c> got</c><00:00:49.770><c> eight</c><00:00:50.070><c> free</c>

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
more toothpicks now we've got eight free

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
we have three free ends so we add three
 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.750 align:start position:0%
we have three free ends so we add three

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
two three four free ends so we had four

look here you can see this is sixteen so
 

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.690 align:start position:0%
look here you can see this is sixteen so
this<00:13:13.550><c> is</c><00:13:13.700><c> where</c><00:13:13.910><c> we</c><00:13:14.030><c> were</c><00:13:14.180><c> after</c><00:13:14.600><c> eight</c><00:13:15.700><c> each</c>

this is where we were after eight each
 

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.330 align:start position:0%
this is where we were after eight each
power<00:13:17.000><c> of</c><00:13:17.120><c> two</c><00:13:17.330><c> we</c><00:13:17.840><c> we</c><00:13:18.110><c> get</c><00:13:18.290><c> a</c><00:13:18.320><c> closed</c><00:13:18.680><c> hexagon</c>

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:19.340 align:start position:0%
power of two we we get a closed hexagon
 

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
power of two we we get a closed hexagon
I'm<00:13:19.520><c> just</c><00:13:19.730><c> showing</c><00:13:20.060><c> you</c><00:13:20.090><c> one</c><00:13:20.860><c> sector</c><00:13:21.860><c> one</c>

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:22.850 align:start position:0%
I'm just showing you one sector one
 

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
I'm just showing you one sector one
sixths<00:13:23.660><c> of</c><00:13:23.900><c> the</c><00:13:24.290><c> whole</c><00:13:24.470><c> pizza</c><00:13:25.240><c> just</c><00:13:26.240><c> a</c><00:13:26.450><c> slice</c>

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:27.170 align:start position:0%
sixths of the whole pizza just a slice
 

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:32.170 align:start position:0%
sixths of the whole pizza just a slice
so<00:13:27.710><c> after</c><00:13:28.160><c> sixteen</c><00:13:29.530><c> the</c><00:13:30.530><c> we</c><00:13:31.220><c> have</c><00:13:31.400><c> that</c><00:13:31.670><c> after</c>

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:32.180 align:start position:0%
so after sixteen the we have that after
 

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.830 align:start position:0%
so after sixteen the we have that after
32<00:13:32.540><c> it's</c><00:13:32.900><c> like</c><00:13:33.080><c> that</c><00:13:33.320><c> and</c><00:13:33.710><c> then</c><00:13:33.890><c> if</c><00:13:34.250><c> life</c><00:13:34.840><c> was</c>

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
32 it's like that and then if life was
 

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:06.200 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes you can but it's a
