00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.820
We're asked to
add 0.822 to 5.65.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.430
So let me rewrite this.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.150
And when I rewrite it, I
want to line up the decimals

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.030
so that we add the right
place to the right place.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.260
And so we could write
either number first,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.410
although I like to write
the larger number first.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.395
So let's write 5.65.

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:23.770
And remember, the
important thing

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.120
is that we line up
the decimal points.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.235
So if we write 0.822-- so
we line up the decimal.

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:31.805
Let me line up
the decimal first.

00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:34.710
So I'll write the decimal
right below the other decimal.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.070
And it is 0.822.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.320
And now we are ready to add.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.290
So let's see what's
going on here.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.040
So I like to start in
the smallest place.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.460
That way, the carrying
works out well.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.640
So you might say, wait,
I need to add this 2

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.000
thousandths to something.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.640
I don't see anything up here.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.254
Well, you could say there's just
a 0 thousandths right up here.

00:01:00.254 --> 00:01:01.420
Then it makes it very clear.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.060
Well, 0 thousandths
plus 2 thousandths

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.330
is going to be 2 thousandths.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.992
5 hundredths plus 2
hundredths is 7 hundredths.

00:01:10.992 --> 00:01:16.530
6 tenths plus 8
tenths is 14 tenths.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.524
Well, 14 tenths is the same
thing as 4 tenths and 1 one.

00:01:22.524 --> 00:01:24.940
Another way of thinking about
it is you're carrying the 1.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.450
But really, what you're saying
is, look, this is 14 tenths.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.690
I could write it as 4 tenths
and a 1, or a ones place, a 1

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.930
in a ones place.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.400
Then you have 1 plus 5 is 6.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.210
And of course, you cannot
forget the decimal.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.090
The decimal goes right there.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.110
And this is 6.472.
