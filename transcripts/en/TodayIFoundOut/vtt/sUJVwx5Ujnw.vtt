00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.010
Penthouse and Stephen King

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.130
While to date Stephen King has managed to
sell about 350 million copies of his novels,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.250
he started out with quite humble beginnings
as an author.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.450
After graduating from the University of Maine
with a degree in English in 1970, Stephen

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.570
King couldn’t find work as a teacher at
first, so continued to work odd jobs, such

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.120
as at an industrial laundry service.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.879
In 1971, he managed to get a high school teaching
job at Hampden Academy, but continued to pursue

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.850
his dream of becoming a professional writer
by working on novels on the side, as well

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.579
as selling some of his short stories to various
magazines, such as Cavalier, Ubris, Penthouse,

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.280
and Cosmopolitan.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.170
His big break came not too long after he began
teaching, when Doubleday agreed to publish

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.060
Carrie in 1973 (ultimately published in 1974),
which was a bestseller and allowed him to

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.950
be able to quit teaching and devote himself
full time to writing.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.080
He followed this up by immediately writing
Salem’s Lot during the summer of 1973 (published

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.570
in 1975), while living in a small summer home
in Maine where he’d moved to help take care

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.770
of his ailing mother, who was dying of uterine
cancer (which she ultimately lost her battle

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.080
with at the age of 59).

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.790
Despite this success as a full-time writer
(and taking up a position as a creative writing

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.910
teacher at the University of Maine in 1977),
King still occasionally would write short

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.570
stories to sell to magazines, including the
15 page short story, The Children of the Corn,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.640
which was published in the March of 1977 edition
of Penthouse.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.700
One year after Children of the Corn was published,
he bundled up many of the short stories he’d

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.579
written for the various magazines and put
them in a book of their own, Night Shift,

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.610
which would go on to win the Balrog Award
for Best Collection, as well as be nominated

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.600
for the World Fantasy Award and the Locus
Award.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.079
It also spawned numerous film/TV/theater adaptations
of the stories in the compilation including

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.479
The Lawnmower Man, Graveyard Shift, Cat’s
Eye (which incidentally starred 10 year old

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.200
Drew Barrymore), The Mangler, and Sometimes
They Come Back.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.910
Five years after Night Shift was published,
Children of the Corn was adapted into a low

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.150
budget short film called Disciples of the
Crow.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.230
One year later, it was again adapted, this
time with a much bigger budget, to the movie

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.720
Children of the Corn, which Stephen King originally
wrote the screen play for, but his version

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.190
was thrown out due to having too much dialogue
and back-story.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.410
Instead a much more violent/gory version with
more conventional narrative style was written

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.430
by George Goldsmith and used for the film.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.490
Bonus Stephen King Facts:

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.480
Another famed short story by Stephen King,
The Ledge, was also originally published in

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.959
Penthouse Magazine, this one in the July 1976
edition.

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.650
As a testament to the fact that, as a writer,
you can never really tell what people will

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.519
end up liking, King actually threw the incomplete
Carrie in the trash, but the draft was rescued

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.849
by his wife who convinced him to finish it.

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.890
It soon earned him $400,000 ($1.7M today)
for the paperback rights alone and allowed

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.180
him to quit his day job, as mentioned above.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.510
Stephen King allows any student film/theater
group to use his stories in their productions

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.500
for just $1 a story, called “The Dollar
Deal”.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.599
In his early years as a professional writer,
Stephen King also wrote under the name Richard

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:19.730
Bachman.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.959
This may seem a strange thing for an author
to do when they are first trying to build

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.220
their “brand”, but King had good reason,
“I did that because back in the early days

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.630
of my career there was a feeling in the publishing
business that one book a year was all the

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.290
public would accept, but I think that a number
of writers have disproved that by now.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.511
… Ed McBain is another novelist who publishes
multiple books in some years and his original

00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:41.940
name was Evan Hunter.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.090
That’s the name he’s always published
under and he adopted the pen name of Ed McBain

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.840
for the same reason I adopted Richard Bachman
and that was that.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.459
It made it possible for me to do two books
in one year.

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.599
I just did them under different names and
eventually the public got wise to this because

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.090
you can change your name, but you can’t
really disguise your style.”

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.640
King came up with the name “Richard Bachman”
off the cuff.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.340
His publisher called and asked what name they
should put on the novel and King had a book

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.170
by Richard Stark on his desk, so used the
name “Richard” and he had music on in

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.230
the background by Bachman Turner Overdrive
(You Ain’t Seen Nothin’ Yet), so he told

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.230
them “Richard Bachman”.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.109
The photo of “Richard Bachman”
The photo of Richard Bachman that appeared

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.680
in the books was of Richard Manuel, an insurance
agent of King’s literary agent, Kirby McCauley.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.711
Before he went with the Bachman name, King
briefly considered publishing under Gus Pillsbury,

00:04:24.711 --> 00:04:25.711
which was his maternal grandfather.

00:04:25.711 --> 00:04:28.060
“Bachman’s” identity was discovered
Steve Brown, a bookstore Clerk, who became

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.169
convinced that Bachman and King were the same
person, despite all of King’s efforts to

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.550
hide the fact, including dedicating a book
to Bachman’s fictional wife, “Clauda Inez

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.550
Bachman”.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.280
In order to route out the truth, Brown decided
to go to the Library of Congress and look

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.940
up publisher records to see if there were
any records connecting Bachman and King.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.230
What he found there was a document that listed
King as the author of one of Bachman’s books.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.860
Brown subsequently sent a copy of this to
King’s publishers and received a phone call

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.960
from King himself suggesting that Brown interview
King and then write an article about if for

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.960
publication.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.870
This article was published in the Washington
Post.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.860
King later sent out a press release stating
that Bachman had died of “cancer of the

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.620
pseudonym”.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.340
Despite today being something of a cult classic,
the film Children of the Corn was not well

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.100
received in its day, garnering mostly negative
reviews from critics and even today has a

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.699
“Rotten” rating of 39% on Rotten Tomatoes.

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:25.930
It did, however, bring in about $14.5M vs.
a budget of only $800,000.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.100
Unlike the movie, in the original short story,
neither Burt nor Vikki survive the ordeal.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.820
Specifically, Vikki has her eyes cut out and
is murdered and “He Who Walks Behind the

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.660
Rows” kills Burt after Burt discovers Vikki’s
body.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.410
When Stephen King was just two years old,
his father, who was a merchant seaman, went

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.660
to “buy a pack of cigarettes”, but never
came home, abandoning the family.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.090
Another traumatic thing that happened to King
as a child, though he says today he has no

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.509
memory of the event, was watching his friend
get hit by a train.

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.370
When King came home after this, he didn’t
mention it, but seemed in shock and wouldn’t

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.370
talk.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.880
Later, his mother learned that King’s friend
had been hit by a train and killed while playing

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.580
with King.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.510
Stephen King briefly considered retiring in
2002.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.889
This was largely due to being hit by a car
in 1999.

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.070
Bryan Smith, the driver of the car had been
distracted by his dog in his car and hit King,

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.860
who went flying approximately 14 ft.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.910
From this, he suffered a collapsed right lung,
shattered bones in his leg that were so severe

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.790
the doctors strongly considered amputating
it, broken hip, and scalp lacerations.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.840
Despite the severe injuries and five operations
over the course of the next couple weeks,

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.560
King resumed work almost immediately upon
being released from the hospital.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.150
However, because of his injuries, sitting
became painful, which by 2002 prompted King

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.350
to announce that he would retire from writing.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.990
However, he was soon back at it, though at
a much less breakneck pace than before.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.030
As he states on his website, “I’m not
a kid of 25 anymore and I’m not a young

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.479
middle-aged man of 35…-I have grandchildren
and I have a lot of things to do besides writing

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:02.479
and that in and of itself is a wonderful thing
but writing is still a big, important part

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:05.539
of my life and of everyday.”

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:10.690
For prospective writers, King recommends reading
and writing for at least 4-6 hours per day,

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.410
every day, to become a good writer.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.650
His personal quota every day is a minimum
of 2000 words before he’ll allow himself

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:32.169
to stop and do something else if he so chooses.
