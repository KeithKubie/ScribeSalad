MALE SPEAKER 1: Hi.

00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.760
GDG is a very interesting
developer community.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.600
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.850
has asked this question.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.440
MALE SPEAKER 2: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.600
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.910
answer show, so if any of you
out there would like to ask

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.160
questions--

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.860
VIC FRYZEL: Hi everyone.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.680
Welcome to Google
Developers Live.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.290
I'm Vic Fryzel, and this
is Steve Bazyl.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.530
We're here today to talk about
the Google Drive SD.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.920
And specifically today, we're
going to be doing an app

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.040
review of one of the Drive SDK
applications that integrates

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.250
via the drive API.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.980
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah, and today
we're going to take a look at

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.430
an application called Loupe,
which does image collages.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.170
It let's you pick in photos from
all different sources,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.560
from everything from the
Facebook to Google Image

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.340
Search to Drive and Instagram,
and so on.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.940
And they did some drive
integration a while back, and

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.670
we're going to go through some
of the really cool things they

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.530
did and highlight some of the
areas where maybe they could

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.600
work on tightening up
the integration.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.710
VIC FRYZEL: Exactly.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.720
So we're going to start off by
watching the application from

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.820
the Chrome Web Store.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.209
So Steve has the application
open here.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.459
And let's start off by
going through their

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:06.360
Chrome Web Store listing.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.210
They did a pretty
good job so far.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.860
They have very excellent
photos and an excellent

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.480
description of their
application.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.700
This is really important to
make sure that users are

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.190
attracted to the application.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.000
STEVE BAZYL: Exactly.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.970
These are really engaging
photos that show how the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.540
application works, what you can
do, what the output is.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.660
And if you go through, we're
not going to go through all

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.450
this, but they did a really nice
job at highlighting what

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.850
all of the features of the app
are and why it would be cool

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.850
to play with.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.290
VIC FRYZEL: So Steve
already has

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.100
this application installed.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.680
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.896
I'm going to go over to my drive
here, actually, and I

00:01:38.896 --> 00:01:40.720
have just a bunch
of photos here.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.250
This is just my wife and I on
vacation in Thailand here.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.240
So nothing too exciting,
but you can go in and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.780
create a new collage.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.360
So one of the cool things
they did is they do

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.170
single sign-on correctly.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.900
It already knows who I
am and everything.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.300
And they have a really easy
getting started process in

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.480
terms of connecting to
different accounts.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.390
You can see here, it's already
logged in from Drive.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.080
Actually, it already
has my photos.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.650
And if I want I can go and
connect to Facebook, or even

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.650
pull photos from say public
Twitter feeds and so on.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.630
So it's a pretty cool app
the way this all works.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.050
But today, were obviously mostly
interested in Drive.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.490
So let's just bring in--

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.130
actually, let's not
do these two here.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.140
And we'll add the photos.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.030
So actually it looks pretty
quick in terms of the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.580
responsiveness of bringing
in the photos from Drive.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.420
Then you can actually
see some of the--

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.310
just play around with it.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.560
Let's do-- since this is cloud
storage, let's make our photos

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.990
into a little cloud
shape here.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.650
Actually, these photos here,
these little South Park

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.320
characters are ones we
do of my wife and I

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.700
for our annual picnics.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.180
We'll just parse all
together over here.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.880
So that's--

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.670
VIC FRYZEL: This is the primary
use case, pulling in a

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.130
bunch of photos from one
of these services and

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.240
then making a collage.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.430
So you can drag the photos
around and edit the collage.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.390
You can zoom in, zoom out.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.880
STEVE BAZYL: And they have a
public gallery where people

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.550
can share the collages, or you
can share them through

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.380
services like Drive.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.830
So just for testing purposes
here, we're going to just go

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.445
and save this, and we can
just give this a name.

00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:34.130
I'll just say Test for now
and make it just private.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.380
So this is where one of the
improvements that I was--

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.100
and to be fair to them, a lot
of the feedback that we're

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.030
going to go through today, we've
already provided to the

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.980
developers at Loupe.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.090
And hopefully, they'll
have an updated

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.110
version out pretty soon.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.390
But this is a case where
the behavior wasn't

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.550
really what I expected.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.015
If I go back into my Drive--

00:03:59.032 --> 00:03:59.930
VIC FRYZEL: Oh, we
lost connection.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:00.880
STEVE BAZYL: Yes, we did.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.011
Oh, here we go.

00:04:02.011 --> 00:04:07.510
So when we go back to Drive,
I don't have that picture.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.480
I clicked Save, but
where is it?

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.360
It's not in my drive.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.860
And turns out that in order to
do this, you actually have to

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.470
do a second save to put
this back in to Drive.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.950
So now I can say Save to Drive,
and it will save it.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.399
VIC FRYZEL: And when we come
back to Drive, it's actually

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.000
saved under an unusual name.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.640
STEVE BAZYL: Correct.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.940
VIC FRYZEL: Which is Loupe and
then a bunch of characters.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.180
STEVE BAZYL: Right.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.790
And as a user, I would've
expected that to basically

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.060
pick up the name that I just
put in earlier here.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.420
So a couple of little things
like that, from a user's

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:42.080
perspective, they do appear
to be unpolished.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.550
VIC FRYZEL: So up until this
point, Loupe has done a couple

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.890
of things very well.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.260
I mean, their UI is obviously
very slick.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.740
And even in the integrations
with Drive that they already

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.557
have, they're well integrated
via these buttons and

00:04:56.557 --> 00:04:58.840
dialogues and everything, and
everything just works.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.730
So that's very good.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.900
We would like to see a couple
of tweaks, though, to this

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.240
integration.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.480
STEVE BAZYL: Right.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.940
VIC FRYZEL: So one of the
tweaks, for instance, that

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.520
Loupe could have made was
to use our own picker.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.780
And we provide a picker, which
is essentially a dialogue

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.320
allowing you to select
files from Drive.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.390
In this case, though, it's
probably a good thing that

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.220
Loupe didn't do that.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.760
STEVE BAZYL: Exactly.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.670
This is a conversation that
I've had with the

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.570
developers at Loupe.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.120
The trade-offs and using our
picker versus theirs.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.530
And because they pull in photos
from so many different

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.860
sources-- they have Facebook,
Twitter, Instagram, Tumbler,

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.640
Google Image Search,
actually--

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.830
they wanted this to come
across as a unified

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.980
experience.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.320
Whereas if they used the picker
from each of these

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.440
different services,
it would've been a

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.330
little jarring to users.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.190
In this case, they end up asking
for a lot of access to

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.100
Drive, but the user experience
is actually really good here.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.620
VIC FRYZEL: And actually, when
you select the Drive tab, you

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.390
can see that Loupe has gone
through a lot of work to make

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.780
sure that this is very fast
and user-friendly.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.840
This could be implemented less
efficiently, and if it had

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.840
been, users would see
loading signs here

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.140
and things like that.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.500
So they did a really good
job of a custom picker.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.530
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah, they did a
good job optimizing this.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.170
And a lot of this is made
possible by the fact that we

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.940
provide thumbnail links for
these images, so that they're

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.280
just downloading lower res
versions until they actually

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.534
need it for building
the collage.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.320
VIC FRYZEL: So another thing
that Loupe could have done

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.820
slightly differently was instead
originating from

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:44.770
getloupe.com, users might find
it more sensible sometimes to

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.395
start from within Drive.

00:06:46.395 --> 00:06:48.760
STEVE BAZYL: Right, so let's
say I go back to my photos

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.870
folder here, and I just want
to create a collage with a

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.250
couple of these pictures.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.230
It would be nice if I could
do Open With Loupe and

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.380
then bring these in.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.160
We actually have some
multi-select.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.740
I can select all of these and
import these in, but it's just

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:07.630
not an option here.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:12.030
And it would be a pretty easy
thing for them to add.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.340
VIC FRYZEL: And not only that,
you would get a lot of other

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.080
nice features of the Drive user
interface like Search,

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.790
for instance.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.650
You could search for only
wedding photos.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:20.090
STEVE BAZYL: Correct.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.020
VIC FRYZEL: And just make a
collage of just selecting all

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.970
of the wedding photos.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:23.810
STEVE BAZYL: Exactly.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:30.380
So a very, very cool thing they
could do and pretty easy.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.160
The other thing, as I mentioned
earlier, we did talk

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.900
to the developers there
and gave them

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.340
a lot of this feedback.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.120
One thing that Loupe actually
used as a demo for back at IO

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.390
was the sharing dialogue.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:45.940
So just like we can
go in and--

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.190
oops, wrong share.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.130
I can share here.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.730
We actually have this
dialogue as now

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.430
an embeddable component.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.380
And we actually got to work with
them in demoing this at

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.330
IO, and they had integrated it
into their development version

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.200
of Loupe so that when I did go
in here and create a collage

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.660
and Save to Drive, it would
automatically display that

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.050
sharing dialogue so that I
can share that with my

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:11.940
friends and my family.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.400
So that's something that I know
that they've worked on.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.040
It is in their sandbox, and I do
hope that hopefully pretty

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.920
soon that will be available
to all users.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.860
VIC FRYZEL: So that's also a
really good idea for them

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.250
because if Loupe in the future
decides to store a native

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.879
collage format in Google Drive
so that when you save a

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:37.200
collage you can reopen it in
Loupe, sharing the collage to

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.020
other users who don't
necessarily have Loupe

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.220
installed will drive
installations to their

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:41.789
application.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:46.730
Because we will know Loupe's
native client format requires

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.050
the application.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.320
And once that happens, we can
suggest to users by this

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.240
mechanism that they should
go and install Loupe.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.330
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.340
It might be a little hard to
see, but there is this Chrome

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.820
Web Store icon down at the
bottom, which will then let me

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.560
go find some apps that
work with this.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.520
So PicMonkey, Marqueed, Hello
Fax, and it looks like we have

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.940
a new one, Cloud Paint, which
I have not seen before.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:14.500
So, as you said, sharing this
and also, you're right.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.040
I don't know if I have a demo of
that readily available, but

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.860
with the custom formats, you do
get an even more prominent

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.480
display of an upsell of--

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.570
VIC FRYZEL: The application's
icon shows up very prominently

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.260
on the bottom.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.405
A user is just one click away
from its Chrome Web Store

00:09:29.405 --> 00:09:30.630
listing installing
the application.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.050
STEVE BAZYL: Exactly.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.720
So a really, really good
way to get additional

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.680
users to the app.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.620
VIC FRYZEL: So in saving to
Google Drive, Loupe would have

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.450
to detect that a user originated
from Google Drive.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.730
And then throughout their user
interface here, they'd have to

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:45.370
propagate that.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.250
And once a user finally clicks
Save, the user probably wants

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.520
to save the collage back to
Drive, because that's where

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.650
they started from.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:52.990
STEVE BAZYL: Exactly.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.900
VIC FRYZEL: So that's something
that would be a

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.440
little bit different when
choosing to save a collage

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:02.490
here instead of just saving
natively within Loupe.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:06.460
STEVE BAZYL: We could even do
recursive collages here.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.000
But yeah, that's definitely a
bit of feedback that they are

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.590
aware of, and again, hopefully
will be in the next version

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.760
once that's available.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.120
VIC FRYZEL: And Loupe doesn't
even have to go so far as to

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.470
use our common sharing
dialogue.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.790
They could use the Drive API
once they've created a Loupe

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:30.310
collage natively in Drive to
share that with other users.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:34.230
So we have built-in access
control lists for each file.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.960
And Loupe could just use that
to send out an email

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.670
notification or share
the file.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.435
STEVE BAZYL: Exactly.

00:10:41.435 --> 00:10:43.970
And each of these networks for
sharing has a slightly

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:44.790
different way of doing it.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.400
And the nice thing is we give
developers the choice of

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.030
really low-level, API-level
sharing, or just a nice

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.220
pre-built widget.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.900
VIC FRYZEL: So, what do
you think, Steve?

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.370
STEVE BAZYL: Overall?

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.130
VIC FRYZEL: Yeah.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:04.520
STEVE BAZYL:I'd give it a solid
B. I mean, it's a really

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.160
fun app to play with.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.510
When they first went into the
Chrome Web Store and showed

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.740
off their Drive integration, I
had a lot of fun playing with,

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.230
creating collages, and so on.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:14.660
VIC FRYZEL: Yeah, same.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.740
STEVE BAZYL: But there are some
of those a little tiny

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.900
missing features that aren't
that hard to implement, but I

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.720
think go a really far way
just to make it a really

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.300
all-around solid app.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:25.730
VIC FRYZEL: Yeah.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.500
I definitely agree, a B. The
one feature that I would at

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.520
least like to see is just saving
back to Google Drive.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.480
Even if the user doesn't
originate in Google Drive, the

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.830
ability to just automatically
save in Google Drive with a

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:42.480
proper title and proper,
maybe, metadata, like

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.240
indexable text and things like
that, so that the collages are

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.060
searchable.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:46.960
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.770
Yeah, and that would be
something they could do pretty

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.970
easily in terms of using the
source image names as the

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:54.710
indexable text.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:56.800
So they could find collages
that include a particular

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.140
image, which is actually kind
of a pretty cool use of the

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.350
search features.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:05.420
VIC FRYZEL: So, everyone, that
is Loupe, the collage

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.440
application in the Chrome Web
Store for Google Drive.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.690
Anything else you'd
like to add?

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.140
STEVE BAZYL: No.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.630
I'd just encourage people to try
it out or try out any app

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.280
in the Chrome Web Store.

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.875
There are some that are really,
really solid, some

00:12:18.875 --> 00:12:20.980
that need a bit of work.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:25.660
But each one is an opportunity
to learn and figure out what

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:26.500
works and what doesn't.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.280
VIC FRYZEL: So, Steve, if
a user's interested in

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.740
installing this, how
do they do it from

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.640
the Chrome Web Store?

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.310
STEVE BAZYL: Pretty easy.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:35.660
You can go to the Chrome Web
Store, and we do have a Google

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.480
Drive collection where you
can go and find all the

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.450
applications.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.525
VIC FRYZEL: So Loupe is right
there on the bottom right?

00:12:42.525 --> 00:12:43.110
STEVE BAZYL: Yep.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.170
This order actually
does change.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.700
It's a little bit dynamic, but
you can go, and in this case,

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.060
I already have it installed.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.550
But you can just click
on that, or

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.002
Save or Add to Chrome.

00:12:54.002 --> 00:12:57.130
The one thing is you don't
actually need Google Chrome to

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:57.870
install a Drive app.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.142
It will work with any browser.

00:13:00.142 --> 00:13:02.690
It's just, right now,
this is where we're

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.990
surfacing the apps.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:05.650
So go try them out.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.880
There's a bunch of others
here that I'd love

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.230
to do reviews on.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.760
VIC FRYZEL: If you have
any requests for

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.680
reviews, please tell us.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.550
STEVE BAZYL: Or if you have an
app yourself and you would

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.990
like our feedback on it, we'd
be happy to spend some time

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.980
playing with it and getting
into some suggestions.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:22.450
VIC FRYZEL: Great.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:23.390
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:24.450
VIC FRYZEL: So that about
wraps it up for us.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.660
Please tune in later this week,
We're going to have

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.400
another Google Developers
Live session on the

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.400
Google Drive SDK.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.870
STEVE BAZYL: And do we have
a topic for that one?

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:31.940
Is that going to be--

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.320
VIC FRYZEL: I don't think
we have a topic yet.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:33.530
STEVE BAZYL: OK.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.300
Well, we'll figure
it out and--

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.760
VIC FRYZEL: We kind of
live on the edge.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.050
STEVE BAZYL: That's right.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.260
So that's it for us,
and I hope to see

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.820
guys again on Thursday.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.420
VIC FRYZEL: Thank you.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:55.000
