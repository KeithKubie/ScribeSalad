00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.727
To start this unit, we'll look at Math Quill so you can input exponents and

00:00:03.727 --> 00:00:07.582
scientific notation with ease. You might have already discovered how to enter

00:00:07.582 --> 00:00:11.468
exponents using Math Quill, and even if you haven't here's a quick walk-through

00:00:11.468 --> 00:00:15.404
on what to do. First you want to type the letter x, this will create an x in

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:19.774
your math quill box. Then you want to type carrot symbol, you notice that right

00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:23.862
before you type the carrot symbol your cursor bar will appear after the x.

00:00:23.862 --> 00:00:28.096
Immediately after you type the carrot key, the cursor bar will move up and in

00:00:28.096 --> 00:00:32.685
the position for an exponent, or a superscript. You will then type the number 4

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:36.419
to get the 4 as the exponent. And here's where you can run into trouble. If you

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:41.230
keep continue typing, you will be typing exponents or powers. To move the cursor

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.600
bar back down to the main line, you want to hit the right arrow key. Hitting the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.632
right arrow key gets us to the main line and now it continues typing the rest of

00:00:48.632 --> 00:00:52.712
our expression. So finish entering this expression, and then try these other

00:00:52.712 --> 00:00:57.008
ones. There's also a challenge problem down here. It contains both an exponent

00:00:57.008 --> 00:00:58.163
and a fraction.
