00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.160
When I sat in front of the computer

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.020
I felt like I had superpowers

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.280
But people told me I was just wasting my time

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.160
When I turned 7

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.320
I got parts to build a computer with my Dad

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.460
It was mind blowing for me

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.340
You know, something, that I built

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.380
came to life

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.260
When I graduated high school

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.420
my parents just told me that

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.540
I need to do something that will land me a job

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.000
I didn't really know where to go

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.820
I gave up on my dreams

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.260
of pursuing Computer Science and

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.280
eventually I got into Business School

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.380
I felt like I was out of place

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.920
I felt like it wasn't a good fit

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.560
and I knew it wasn't a good fit

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.980
Dropping out felt really risky because

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.660
I was afraid that

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.760
I'm gonna make the same mistake again

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.980
Since my parents didn't graduate high school

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.960
they just didn't know what was right for me

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.480
I found Udacity

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.120
It was a good way to learn about

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.680
different areas of Computer Science

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.180
before I started my studies again

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.400
Online learning is really good at

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.360
reflecting the market's needs

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.860
and you can start with something like web development

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.960
and work yourself up to self-driving cars

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.660
It's all in the realm of possibilities

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.020
and you don't need a degree

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.680
and you can do it from anywhere in the world

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.600
With Udacity and Google

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.920
you build projects which are

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.920
interesting for potential employers

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.060
When I had my job interview

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.660
they looked at the app I built

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.160
and they saw what I could do for them

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.380
Once I got my certification from Google

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.400
it took 3 months to go from

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.040
knowing some programming

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.260
to landing a job

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.040
it's just really a fast track program

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.860
to becoming an Android Developer

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.940
My work really reflects how I approach things

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.540
and seeing people enjoy that

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.540
gives me the feeling of being on the right track
