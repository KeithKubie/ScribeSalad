both you and this question where do we

both you and this question where do we

social transformation and maybe you have

into that process and I guess part of my

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:20.670
argument that I was trying to make is
 

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:24.680

that even if there is this will be my

out there that sort of constrains the

out there that sort of constrains the
 

00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:33.500
out there that sort of constrains the

think if we look closely there's a lot

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:40.890
think if we look closely there's a lot
 

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:43.760
think if we look closely there's a lot
of play within that system and there's a

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:43.770
of play within that system and there's a
 

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:46.190
of play within that system and there's a
lot of potential possibilities for how

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200
lot of potential possibilities for how
 

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.640
lot of potential possibilities for how
that system can be incrementally moved

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:49.650
that system can be incrementally moved
 

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:54.140
that system can be incrementally moved
from within so yeah well I would argue

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:54.150
from within so yeah well I would argue
 

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:56.120
from within so yeah well I would argue
that every one of the pieces that I was

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:56.130

that every one of the pieces that I was
showing is rhetorical is conscious of

00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980
showing is rhetorical is conscious of
 

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:02.270
showing is rhetorical is conscious of
what moves it's making that way and

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280
what moves it's making that way and
 

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.530
what moves it's making that way and
certainly it's true that they are

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:05.540
certainly it's true that they are
 

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:08.840
certainly it's true that they are
advocating and trying to find new ways

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:08.850

to actually bring that change forth and

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:12.930
to actually bring that change forth and
 

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:16.550
to actually bring that change forth and
so there are that's why it's choosing

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560
so there are that's why it's choosing
 

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:20.120
so there are that's why it's choosing
examples that are both in traditional

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:20.130
examples that are both in traditional
 

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:22.910
examples that are both in traditional
art context where you've got pieces that

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920
art context where you've got pieces that
 

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.470
art context where you've got pieces that
are being sold for a hundred thousand

are being sold for a hundred thousand
 

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.630
are being sold for a hundred thousand
dollars right so that you could still

they're bringing these other issues into
 

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.000
they're bringing these other issues into
that form so that even when you have the

that form so that even when you have the
 

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:36.680
that form so that even when you have the

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:36.690
painting behind you on the couch it's
 

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:38.109
painting behind you on the couch it's
pretty hard to

pretty hard to
 

00:42:38.119 --> 00:42:41.230
pretty hard to
extricate yourself from what it's

increasingly out of focus things it's a
 

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:53.079
increasingly out of focus things it's a
whole different way about thinking of

00:42:53.079 --> 00:42:53.089
whole different way about thinking of
 

00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:54.950

photography and the credibility of
 

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.290
photography and the credibility of
photography right it's not just the fact

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:57.300
photography right it's not just the fact
 

00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:00.530
photography right it's not just the fact
that digital manipulation has undermined

that digital manipulation has undermined

the veracity of what's going on right
 

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:10.089
the veracity of what's going on right
and that ontologically i think is being

and that ontologically i think is being

touring things by showing you the fact
that you can make a clearer picture of

something that's 500 million miles away
then it is 40 miles away because of the

then it is 40 miles away because of the
 

00:43:33.599 --> 00:43:37.540
then it is 40 miles away because of the
