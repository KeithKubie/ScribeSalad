00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.130
We're first exposed to the idea
of a slope of a line early on

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.280
in our algebra careers, but I
figure it never hurts

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.600
to review it a bit.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.450
So let me draw some axes.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.800
That is my y-axis.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.170
Maybe I should call
it my f of x-axis.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.320
y is equal to f of x.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.380
Let me draw my x-axis, just
like that, that is my x-axis.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.970
And let me draw a line, let
me draw a line like this.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.770
And what we want to do is
remind ourselves, how do we

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.935
find the slope of that line?

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:42.260
And what we do is, we take
two points on the line,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.030
so let's say we take
this point, right here.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.070
Let's say that that is the
point x is equal to a.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.260
And then what would this be?

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.480
This would be the point f of
a, where the function is

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.440
going to be some line.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.170
We could write f of x is going
to be equal to mx plus b.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.200
We don't know what m and
b are, but this is all

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.410
a little bit of review.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.050
So this is a.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.880
And then the y-value is what
happens to the function when

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.890
you evaluated it at a, so
that's that point right there.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.950
And then we could take
another point on this line.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.760
Let's say we take
point b, right there.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.110
And then this coordinate
up here is going to be

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.010
the point b, f of b.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.290
Right?

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.980
Because this is just the
point when you evaluate

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.780
the function at b.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.360
You put b in here, you're going
to get that point right there.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.270
So let me just draw a
little line right there.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.630
So that is f of b, right there.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.420
Actually, let me make it clear
that this coordinate right

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.780
is the point a, f of a.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.280
So how do we find the slope
between these 2 points, or more

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.760
generally, of this entire line?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.890
Because whole the slope
is consistent the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.350
whole way through it.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.060
And we know that once we
find the slope, that's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.610
actually going to be
the value of this m.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.420
That's all a review of your
algebra, but how do we do it?

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.890
Well, a couple of ways
to think about it.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:05.130
Slope is equal to
rise over run.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.050
You might have seen that when
you first learned algebra.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.670
Or another way of writing
it, it's change in

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.570
y over change in x.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.240
So let's figure out what the
change in why over the change

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.810
in x is for this
particular case.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.230
So the change in y
is equal to what?

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.180
Well, let's just take, you can
take this guy as being the

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.990
first point, or that guy
as being the first point.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.980
But since this guy has a
larger x and a larger y,

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.870
let's start with him.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.960
The change in y between that
guy and that guy is this

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.070
distance, right here.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.800
So let me draw a
little triangle.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.210
That distance right
there is a change in y.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.190
Or I could just transfer
it to the y-axis.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.190
This is the change in y.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.340
That is your change
in y, that distance.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.980
So what is that distance?

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.030
It's f of b minus f of a.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.880
So it equals f of
b minus f of a.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.990
That is your change in y.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.480
Now what is your change
in x The slope is change

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.010
in y over change in x.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.760
So what our change in x?

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.770
What's this distance?

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.490
Remember, we're taking this
to be the first point,

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.370
so we took its y minus
the other point's y.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.880
So to be consistent, we're
going to have to take this

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.660
point x minus this point x.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.460
So this point's
x-coordinate is b.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.130
So it's going to be b minus a.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.580
And just like that, if you knew
the equation of this line, or

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.610
if you had the coordinates of
these 2 points, you would just

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.460
plug them in right here and
you would get your slope.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.990
That straightforward.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.150
And that comes straight out
of your Algebra 1 class.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.060
And let me just, just to make
sure it's concrete for you, if

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:55.250
this was the point 2, 3, and
let's say that this, up here,

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.640
was the point 5, 7, then if we
wanted to find the slope of

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.460
this line, we would do 7 minus
3, that would be our change in

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.370
y, this would be 7 and this
would be 3, and then we

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.950
do that over 5 minus 2.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.460
Because this would be a 5, and
this would be a 2, and so this

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.620
would be your change in x.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.690
5 minus 2.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.830
So 7 minus 3 is 4, and 5
minus 2 is 3. so your

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.760
slope would be 4/3.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.010
Now let's see if we
can generalize this.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.370
And this is what the new
concept that we're going

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.320
to be learning as we
delve into calculus.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.970
Let's see if we can generalize
this somehow to a curve.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.310
So let's say I have a curve.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.340
We have to have a curve
before we can generalize

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.180
it to a curve.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.900
Let me scroll down a little.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.850
Well, actually, I want to
leave this up here, show

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.820
you the similarity.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.390
Let's say I have, I'll keep
it pretty general right now.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.290
Let's say I have a curve.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.080
I'll make it a
familiar-looking curve.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.390
Let's say it's the curve y is
equal to x squared, which

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.860
looks something like that.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.010
And I want to find the slope.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.280
Let's say I want to find
the slope at some point.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.680
And actually, before even
talking about it, let's even

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.930
think about what it means to
find the slope of a curve.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.450
Here, the slope was the same
the whole time, right?

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.920
But on a curve your
slope is changing.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.350
And just to get an intuition
for that means, is, what's

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.240
the slope over here?

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.610
Your slope over here is the
slope of the tangent line.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.150
The line just
barely touches it.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.180
That's the slope over there.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.760
It's a negative slope.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.790
Then over here, your slope is
still negative, but it's a

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.360
little bit less negative.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.250
It goes like that.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.570
I don't know if I did
that, drew that.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.660
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.790
Let me do it in purple.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.320
So over here, your slope is
slightly less negative.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.590
It's a slightly less
downward-sloping line.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.130
And then when you go over here,
at the 0 point, right here,

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.030
your slope is pretty much flat,
because the horizontal line, y

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.610
equals 0, is tangent
to this curve.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.330
And then as you go to more
positive x's, then your

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.660
slope starts increasing.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.340
I'm trying to draw
a tangent line.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.170
And here it's increasing even
more, it's increased even more.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.240
So your slope is changing the
entire time, and this is kind

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.930
of the big change that happens
when you go from a

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.530
line to a curve.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.450
A line, your slope is the
same the entire time.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.600
You could take any two points
of a line, take the change in y

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.170
over the change in x, and you
get the slope for

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.620
the entire line.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.980
But as you can see already,
it's going to be a little

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.290
bit more nuanced when
we do it for a curve.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.570
Because it depends what
point we're talking about.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.200
We can't just say, what is
the slope for this curve?

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.760
The slope is different at
every point along the curve.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.120
It changes.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.500
If we go up here, it's
going to be even steeper.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.450
It's going to look
something like that.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.780
So let's try a bit
of an experiment.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.870
And I know how this experiment
turns out, so it won't

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.450
be too much of a risk.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.300
Let me draw better than that.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:11.800
So that is my y-axis,
and that's my x-axis.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.690
Let's call this, we can call
this y, or we can call

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.660
this the f of x axis.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.890
Either way.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.780
And let me draw my curve again.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.740
And I'll just draw it in the
positive coordinate, like that.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.890
That's my curve.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:33.400
And what if I want to find
the slope right there?

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.680
What can I do?

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.010
Well, based on our definition
of a slope, we need 2 points

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:39.380
to find a slope, right?

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.905
Here, I don't know how to
find the slope with 1 point.

00:07:41.905 --> 00:07:49.210
So let's just call this
point right here,

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.240
that's going to be x.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.500
We're going to be general.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.120
This is going to
be our point x.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.300
But to find our slope,
according to our traditional

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.140
algebra 1 definition of a
slope, we need 2 points.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.100
So let's get another
point in here.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.950
Let's just take a slightly
larger version of this x.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:10.430
So let's say, we want to take,
actually, let's do it even

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.590
further out, just because it's
going to get messy otherwise.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.680
So let's say we have
this point right here.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.750
And the difference, it's
just h bigger than x.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.565
Or actually, instead of saying
h bigger, let's just, well

00:08:20.565 --> 00:08:22.120
let me just say h bigger.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.630
So this is x plus h.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.910
That's what that point
is right there.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.430
So what going to be their
corresponding y-coordinates

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.820
on the curve?

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.030
Well, this is the curve
of y is equal to f of x.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:39.910
So this point right here
is going to be f of our

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:41.590
particular x right here.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.930
And maybe to show you that I'm
taking a particular x, maybe

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:45.305
I'll do a little 0 here.

00:08:45.305 --> 00:08:48.400
This is x naught, this
is x naught plus h.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.430
This is f of x naught.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:56.870
And then what is this going
to be up here, this point up

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.140
here, that point up here?

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:04.430
Its y-coordinate is going to be
f of f of this x-coordinate,

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.630
which I shifted
over a little bit.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.170
It's right there. f of this
x-coordinate, which is

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.950
f of x naught plus h.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.310
That's its y-coordinate.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:15.840
So what is a slope going to be
between these two points that

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.410
are relatively close
to each other?

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:18.810
Remember, this isn't
going to be the slope

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.070
just at this point.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.950
This is the slope of the line
between these two points.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.080
And if I were to actually draw
it out, it would actually be a

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.680
secant line between,
to the curve.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.860
So it would intersect the curve
twice, once at this point,

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:32.450
once at this point.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.180
You can't see it.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.510
If I blew it up a little
bit, it would look

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.330
something like this.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:47.510
This is our coordinate x naught
f of x naught, and up here

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:51.805
is our coordinate for this
point, which would be, the

00:09:51.805 --> 00:09:56.080
x-coordinate would be x naught
plus h, and the y-coordinate

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.180
would be f of x naught plus h.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.135
Just whatever this function is,
we're evaluating it at this

00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:03.770
x-coordinate That's all it is.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.380
So these are the 2 points.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.740
So maybe a good start is to
just say, hey, what is the

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.090
slope of this secant line?

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.760
And just like we did in the
previous example, you find the

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:22.470
change in y, and you divide
that by your change in x.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.220
Let me draw it here.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.940
Your change in y would be that
right here, change in y, and

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.840
then your change in x would
be that right there.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.040
So what is the slope going
to be of the secant line?

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.250
The slope is going to be equal
to, let's start with this

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.440
point up here, just because
it seems to be larger.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.320
So we want a change in y. so
this value right here, this

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.230
y-value, is f of
x naught plus h.

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.740
I just evaluated
this guy up here.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.630
Looks like a fancy term,
but all it means is, look.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.970
The slightly larger x
evaluate its y-coordinate.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:57.250
Where the curve is
at that value of x.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.290
So that is going to be, so the
change in y is going to be

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.400
a f of x naught plus h.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.880
That's just the
y-coordinate up here.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.830
Minus this y-coordinate
over here.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:13.600
So minus f of x naught.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.500
So that equals our change in y.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.543
And you want to divide
that by your change in x.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:21.800
So what is this?

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.340
This is the larger x-value.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.030
We started with this
coordinate, so we start

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.460
with its x-coordinate.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.450
So it's x naught plus
h, x naught plus h.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.610
Minus this x-coordinate.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.970
Well, we just picked
a general number.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.330
It's x naught.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.300
So that is over
your change in x.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:39.990
Just like that.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.510
So this is the slope
of the secant line.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.670
We still haven't answered what
the slope is right at that

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:47.100
point, but maybe this
will help us get there.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.250
If we simplify this, so let
me write it down like this.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:57.630
The slope of the secant, let
me write that properly.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:03.930
The slope of the secant line is
equal to the value of the

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:08.840
function at this point, f of x
naught plus h, minus the value

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.750
of the function here,
mine f of x naught.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.370
So that just tells
us the change in y.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.250
It's the exact same definition
of slope we've always used.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:19.890
Over the change in x.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:20.920
And we can simplify this.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.980
We have x naught plus
h minus x naught.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.450
So x naught minus x naught
cancel out, so you

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:27.700
have that over h.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.530
So this is equal to our change
in y over change in x.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:33.380
Fair enough.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.500
But I started off saying, I
want to find the slope of

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.880
the line at that point, at
this point, right here.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.860
This is the zoomed-out
version of it.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.260
So what can I do?

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.830
Well, I defined second point
here as just the first

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.370
point plus some h.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:52.300
And we have something in our
toolkit called a limit.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.840
This h is just a
general number.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.400
It could be 10, it could be 2,
it could be 0.02, it could be 1

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.050
times 10 to the negative 100.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.690
It could be an arbitrarily
small number.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.210
So what happens, what would
happen, at least theoretically,

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.620
if I were take the limit
as h approaches 0?

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.360
So, you know, first, maybe h is
this fairly large number over

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.710
here, and then if I take h a
little bit smaller, then I'd be

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.740
finding the slope of
this secant line.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.300
If I took h to be even a little
bit smaller, I'd be finding the

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.790
slope of that secant line.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.200
If h is a little bit
smaller, I'd be finding

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.390
the slope of that line.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:28.430
So as h approaches 0, I'll be
getting closer and closer to

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:34.230
finding the slope of the line
right at my point in question.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.720
Obviously, if h is a large
number, my secant line is going

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.110
to be way off from the slope at
exactly that point right there.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:45.430
But if h is 0.0000001, if it's
an infinitesimally small

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.810
number, then I'm going
to get pretty close.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:51.250
So what happens if I
take the limit as h

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.530
approaches zero of this?

00:13:53.530 --> 00:14:00.220
So the limit as h approaches
0 of my secant slope.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.180
Of, let me switch to green.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:08.560
f of x naught plus h minus f of
x naught, that was my change in

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:15.490
y, over h, which is
my change in x.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.720
And now just to clarify
something, and sometimes you'll

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.810
see it in different calculus
books, sometimes instead of an

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.930
h, they'll write
a delta x here.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.390
Where this second point would
have been defined as x naught

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.660
plus delta x, and then, this
would have simplified to just

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.685
delta x over there, and we'd
be taking the limit as

00:14:30.685 --> 00:14:31.870
delta x approaches 0.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.200
The exact same thing.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.780
h, delta x, doesn't matter.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.630
We're taking h as the
difference between one x point

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.710
and then the higher x point,
and then we're just going to

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:40.980
take the limit as that
approaches zero.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.010
We could have called that
delta x just as easily.

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:52.050
But I'm going to call this
thing, which equals the slope

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.260
of the tangent line, and it
does equal the slope of the

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.720
tangent line, I'm going to call
this the derivative of f.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.105
Let me write that down.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:10.650
And I'm going to say that this
is equal to f prime of x.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.680
And this is going to
be another function.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.320
Because remember, the slope
changes at every x-value.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.640
No matter what x-value
you pick, the slope is

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.260
going to be different.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.880
Doesn't have to be, but the
way I drew this curve,

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.500
it is different.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.950
It can be different.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:27.070
So now, you give me an x-value
in here, I'll apply this

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.090
formula over here, and
then I can tell you the

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:31.810
slope at that point.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.180
And it all seems very
confusing and maybe

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.810
abstract at this point.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.030
In the next video, I'll
actually do an example of

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.300
calculating a slope, and
it'll make it everything a

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.400
little bit more concrete.
