Carving pumpkins is a
fantastic Halloween tradition

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.600
where usually we'll carve
a face into our pumpkin.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.600
We wanted to do something like that today,
but not the normal jack-o'-lanterns

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.320
face that you may be used to.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.012
I'm going to see
if I can carve mine

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.300
and Grant's faces into this pumpkin.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.240
[Music]

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.300
Guys, I wanted to jump in
with a quick update that our upcoming

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.700
mystery project has been guessed,
and we will be contacting the winner

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.680
in the coming week.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.100
Everything isn't quite ready
to launch just yet though.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.380
So here is a sneak peek
at what's to come.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:42.420
[Music]

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.400
Any ideas what it could be, head on over
to Instagram to vote in the poll,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.600
and use the #TKORCreator
to share your guesses.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.100
Don't forget to click the link
in the description to sign up

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.900
for our mailing list,
so you're the first one

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.700
to find out what's inside.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.200
Now, I should be up front
and say this is not

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.600
in fact a real pumpkin.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.800
This is an artificial pumpkin,
mostly made of expanding foam.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.240
It's designed to carve
and cut like a normal pumpkin,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.500
while not having to worry about
whether it's going to rot.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.100
After you've carved these,
you can store them

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.800
and use them for as long as you want.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.240
The pumpkin I'm using
here is made by Funkins.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.780
I got this one at Jo-Ann Fabrics,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.580
but I believe they're
sold in several stores.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.840
The idea is simple.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.000
I'll take some pictures
of myself and Grant,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.200
throw them on Photoshop,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.500
and play with the levels
until they're a good match

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.300
for what we're going for on the pumpkin,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.400
and then try to transfer that image
onto the surface of our gourd.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.900
The first step is going
to be making the photos

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.102
and editing them on Photoshop
to make them look right

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.340
for this pumpkin surface.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.660
So let's grab my computer,
and see what we can do.

00:01:36.682 --> 00:01:39.700
Now, for people who
do understand the basics

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.000
of Photoshop, what I am doing
for the most part is just

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.620
increasing the contrast a fair amount

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.700
and then adding a color gradient map
over the Photoshop layer

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.400
so that the darkest color
is approximately the color

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.160
of a pumpkin in very low light.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.380
So a very dark orange,
or almost a brownish color,

00:01:58.962 --> 00:02:03.000
and the light is the color
of a pumpkin that's carved

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.292
really thin with a light inside of it.

00:02:06.182 --> 00:02:09.300
You can see on my gradient
that it's going

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.100
from this really darkish color up
through orange through yellow and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.952
to this very whitish yellow,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.200
and that's about the color
gradient that you get when

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.960
you're actually carving a pumpkin.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.900
Now, to simplify the design
just a little bit.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.420
I'm going to run it
through this filter gallery

00:02:26.942 --> 00:02:29.300
that just sort of gives
me some edge guidelines,

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.000
and I'm not even necessarily
going to follow these perfectly,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.220
but they'll make it easier to measure,
and compare to later on.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:55.960
[Music]

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.700
Now, we need to print
these out the same size

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.200
that we want them to be on the pumpkin,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.400
and it may take some trial
and error of growing it

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.500
and shrinking it just a little bit
to see what's really going to fit best.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.000
But we do want to print it
at the actual size that

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.700
we were going to have
it show up on the pumpkin.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.000
I'm now just using scissors
to cut off a lot of the extra paper,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.200
and this is going to help us get
the paper to lie as flat as it can.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.400
Pumpkins are not flat,
and the carving will not be flat.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.900
But we do want to get
the paper about as flat

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.700
as we can on to the pumpkin.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.900
So we're just going to remove
a lot of the excess,

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.200
and then we'll just sort of
have to make it up a little

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.020
as we go with the rest.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.420
Just throw a pin
in here for that.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:45.180
[Music]

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.600
Now these are pinned in place,
and we're also going to use

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.402
the pins to do some marking.

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:52.800
We can't really trace
through the paper onto the pumpkin.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.800
So what we're going to do
is use the pin to poke

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.200
through the pictures
into the pumpkin to leave

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.892
some marks in important places.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.260
Then after we've got those marked in,
we'll go in with a Sharpie,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.500
and maybe fill in some
of the lines a little bit

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.200
more completely.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.100
So you can see on the skin of the pumpkin
that I can leave very small marks,

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.600
and they'll still
show up pretty well

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.940
in the skin of the pumpkin.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.112
So I can use that to sort of draw lines
through the paper onto the skin.

00:04:17.112 --> 00:04:34.380
[Music]

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.200
I've now gone through
on my face.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.300
I haven't yet done Grant's,
but I've gone through in my face,

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.200
and I've poked holes lining a lot
of the important spots,

00:04:41.212 --> 00:04:45.100
especially what I've done is
mark out all of the darkest parts.

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.400
I've sort of made an outline around that,
and the reason is those parts aren't going

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.300
to get removed at all.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.400
We're going to leave that as the skin,
because the skin blocks the most light,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.400
and we do want to have a light
inside the pumpkin.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.400
So when that shines out,
the parts with the skin

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.600
will be very dark.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.000
I've also gone through
and mark some other important lines,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.300
but those may not show up very well
because the first step is going

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.800
to be to remove the skin
from all of the parts that

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.720
aren't going to be dark.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.200
And once I do that,
I may not be able to see any

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.900
of those holes that I poked anymore.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.000
[Music]

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.700
Now, I've pulled the print off,
and all of the holes are still there,

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.200
but you can't see a whole lot of detail.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.380
So it's really good to take
this fine point marker,

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.000
and just go over some of those spots,
and trace them out.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:48.460
[Music]

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.000
We've now got all the lines drawn out
for both Grant's and my face,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.342
and it's time to start doing some carving,

00:05:53.342 --> 00:05:56.500
and the first step is we're going to use
an exacto knife to just cut along most

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.460
of those lines,

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.700
and start peeling and
cutting away the skin

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.300
of the pumpkin leaving
behind the orange foam behind it,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.500
and all of the spots that
are going to remain dark,

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.240
we're going to leave the skin on.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.400
But as soon as we do that,
we're going to go

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.600
into the next step which is shading,
and what we do is anywhere that

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.500
needs to be lighter,

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.680
or more yellow in our prints
or on the computer screen,

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.900
we need to cut farther into the foam.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.400
So it gets even thinner,
lets more light through,

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.100
and makes for a lighter color.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.300
And the way we're actually going to do
that is turn the lights down all around,

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.100
and we're going to cut a hole in the top
like you do with the standard pumpkin,

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.500
and put a light inside
so we can see when we're achieving

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.200
just the right amount of carving.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.300
That way, we'll have a real
time feedback system to know

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.602
if we've carved deep enough,
or need to carve deeper.

00:06:39.602 --> 00:06:44.320
[Music]

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.600
You can see inside,
one of the nicest things about one

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.800
of these pumpkins is you don't have
to spend a lot of time scraping it

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.260
and carving it out of the inside.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.660
It's already carved out.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.640
Nice and hollowed,
just like we want it.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:02.420
[Music]

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.680
Let's turn off all if the lights
and see what that's looking like.

00:07:05.602 --> 00:07:09.000
So now, we can see with the light
inside the pumpkin, just a little bit

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.200
shines through the skin,

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.040
and it's not perfectly even
because the foam on the inside

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.700
is not 100% the same thickness,

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.200
and that's very very similar
to what you would run

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.960
into with an actual pumpkin.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.200
Pumpkins aren't perfectly
universally thick.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.800
They aren't perfectly
universally dense.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.600
And so, you really get a lot
of this same look with a real fruit

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.842
or with the artificial one.

00:07:28.842 --> 00:07:35.720
[Music]

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.300
So right away, you can see the light
difference between where there is

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.640
and is not the skin,

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.800
and so this is going to be sort of
our base color for everything that

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.200
is not completely dark.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.900
So we'll have the skin on in some places,
and then this will be the darkest point,

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.212
and we can get lighter
from there just by carving farther

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.540
and farther into the walls.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:09:39.400
[Music]

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.660
Well, the pumpkin is finished,
and I am completely

00:09:42.732 --> 00:09:45.700
covered in pumpkin dust,
which is not a thing that happens

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.000
if you use a real pumpkin,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.820
but is a thing that happens
if you use these artificial pumpkins.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:10:02.640
[Music]

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.800
The pumpkin carving is complete,
and now that I have vacuumed myself off,

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.160
and am no longer
covered in the dust from this,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.900
we can talk about what we've done.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.800
I am very happy
with how this turned out.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.400
Even though I've done stuff
like this before,

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.200
it's always a little nerve-wracking.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.880
Like, oh, is it going
to work this time?

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.340
This as it is took me five
or six hours to do.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.660
But it is not a very
quick process overall.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.900
So it might be something you
want to give yourself a day

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.800
or two to work on.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.400
I do want to talk
about the difference

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.520
between artificial pumpkins
and real pumpkins when you're carving.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.700
They both have some advantages
and disadvantages.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.940
Where I live at least,
real pumpkins are way cheaper.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.280
This thing was on sale 40% off,
and still cost 30 bucks.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.000
A pumpkin even one this size where
I live would only be maybe 12,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.900
and if you wanted to practice,
then smaller pumpkins are really cheap,

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.980
like two or three bucks
for a decent-sized pumpkin.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.300
That's not true everywhere.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.180
Some places, pumpkins
are more expensive,

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.100
but I would say for practicing,
a real pumpkin's much better.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.700
This of course will last indefinitely,
unless someone breaks it,

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.700
which is possible.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.100
There are lots of kids
who live at this house.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.000
Carving real pumpkins
and artificial pumpkins is different.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.540
Just about any tool that you
can scrape with will do an okay job

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.040
for carving a real pumpkin.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.900
This foam has a very
different texture.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.200
If you try and just
scrape at it, it roughs it up,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.060
but it doesn't really carve anything away.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.800
So you probably saw
that by far the most

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.600
useful tool for me was a rotary tool.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.200
This thing just spins
and with a slightly rough

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.700
or drill like tip on it,
it does a really good job

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.000
of just cutting through the foam,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.200
and all you need is
a steady hands to just

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.000
take off exactly what you want,
and go over it slowly,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.200
taking away little bits at a time.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.700
A real pumpkin is usually
a little bit more yellow than this.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.100
These pumpkins have this foam,
which is slightly yellow,

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.200
but a little bit white,
at least for now.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.900
It's possible that if you left it out
in the sun for a while,

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.200
it would turn more yellow.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.600
So you're going to get a slightly
different effect when you put a candle

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.700
or a light inside it.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.072
We've been using an artificial light
because there's no air flow and,

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.080
we don't want to burn
our pumpkin down.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.700
With a real pumpkin,
with holes that

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.840
you've carved into it, normally,
a real candle will do a great job.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.100
Not a good plan
for urethane pumpkins.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.200
I also really loved how
nonsensical it looks when you're looking

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.040
at it with external light
and no internal light.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.200
It barely looks like it's people at all,
and you definitely can't really

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.740
tell what's going on,

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:17.700
and it's fun to watch
how much that changes

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.880
when you take down the external lights,
and light it up from the inside.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Guys, I love jack-o'-lanterns.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.300
I love seeing all the artwork.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.100
So whether you use this tutorial,
this style or not,

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.500
I want to see what you've carved.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.892
Post your jack-o'-lantern on Instagram,
and tag us @TheKingofRandom.

00:12:30.892 --> 00:12:31.900
I want to see what you've got.

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.700
Guys, that's all for today,
but the fun's not over.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.000
That box up at the top will take you
directly to our last video,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and you can check that out.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.800
The other box will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.902
you should be watching next,

00:12:40.902 --> 00:12:43.300
and if you're not a subscriber yet,
just hit this bomb to get in the club,

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.900
and that way, you'll never
miss out on the fun.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.500
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we will see you in the next one.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.580
Talk to you then.
