00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It's the final option. The time step has to be smaller than half of Δx² divided by thermal diffusivity.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Let me explain why--if the time step was exactly equal to 1/2  (Δx)² divided by thermal diffusivity.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This expression would equal to and our result would be -1.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What would happen is that our initial temperature distribution would be reflected

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
after the first time step where it was 1 before, it would be -1 after,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and it's easy to compute that where it was -1 before, it would be 1 after.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The next time step would undo this reflection and here

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the blue distribution again and so on and so on.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We would see infinite oscillation. We would see oscillation but no decay.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If age is smaller than 1/2 this ratio, this expression is smaller than 2.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If age is smaller than 1/2 times this ratio, this expression is smaller than 2,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
we're subtracting less, so the result is larger than -1.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Oh a new temperature, 1/2 to 1 times step at position 0 is not -1 but a little more than that,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and of course, it's similar for the others.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So you see that when it totally reflecting our function, we're losing a little,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and with the next time step, we again are going to lose a little, so that's going to work out well.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
As soon as age is smaller than 1/2 this ratio, we're going to see decay,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
but to stop that oscillation during the decay, we indeed have to pick age smaller than

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
1/4 of that ratio, so that we're subtracting less than 1.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
This condition shows that our method is really poor.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If you use a spatial subdivision that's finite by a factor of 2,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
we have to use a time step that's smaller by a factor of .4.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Hopefully, this reminds you of Unit 3, the recovered implicit methods to deal with such instabilities.

00:01:55.000 --> 99:59:59.000
For partial differential equations, implicit methods maybe unavoidable.
