00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.730
From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.190
[MUSIC] Librarianship was really
an adventure for me-to find

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.810
out that there's a profession
that was dedicated to making books

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.470
and reading and knowledge
available to people.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.060
And that just seemed ideal.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.710 position:56%
The confirmation process was really
an eye-opener for me in so many ways

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.170
because I got to meet
legislators that were committed

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.500
to not only the nation's history,
but making information available.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:49.460
And that made me very
pleased that I was confirmed.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.140
My vision for this library is very
simple: that people will realize

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.330
that they have a national
treasure and that it is part

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.300
of their heritage and everyone
can find something in the Library

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.810
of Congress, produced by
the Library of Congress,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.850
that relates to their lives
or where they want to go.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.170
What I hope to accomplish with
the dedicated staff of The Library

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.480
in the next ten years of the
appointment is to really make more

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.830
of the collections
accessible in various formats.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.600
And if we can say that we have
collections in the next ten years

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.030
that have never been seen digitally
and that are used and that are tied

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.080
in with curriculums
around the country

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.480
and that people are going
to, at the end of ten years,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.240 position:56%
if people are thinking of the
Library of Congress as a go-to place

00:01:48.240 --> 00:02:01.500
in the stratosphere, really, for
information and resource-that,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:18.490
I think, would be quite
an accomplishment.
