[SOUND] [COUGH] We

00:00:04.358 --> 00:00:09.431
did it, Marty.

00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:10.320
We're back.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.149
That's you, only seconds before
you turn your phone back on and

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:18.150
find your algorithm is gone.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.430
Only this time,
your algorithms should still be there.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:29.421
Come.

00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:31.380
Great Scott, Marty!

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.645
I was still in the app.

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:36.400
Your algorithm's too big and
it takes up too much memory.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.370
We need to find out
another way of saving.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.690
But first, we need to find more
about your iPhone file system.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.400
&gt;&gt; I was reading something recently.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.436
Something about a sandbox?

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:54.901
&gt;&gt; We'll see Marty, we'll see.

00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:55.401
