00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.980
The team that brought you Wallace and Gromit now bring their first full-length animated feature, Chicken Run.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.840
This is a movie all the critics went nuts for.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.760
"It was well-written, it was well-animated, it was different, it had a unique story."

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.080
And it's another one, honestly, I think just sorta falls into the OK pile.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.980
But that's not bad, it's just OK.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.240
Why? Well, let's take a look.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.740
On a chicken farm in England, one little hen tries as hard as she can to escape everyday, but is constantly caught and thrown back in.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.740
Things get more dangerous, though, when the owner of the chicken farm decides that she wants to start making pies out of the chickens.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.260
So the hens have to make it out before the machine that makes the pies is fully put together.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.460
Their answer comes in the form of a rooster played by Mel Gibson.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.640
He claims that he flew into the pen and that he can teach the chickens how to fly as well.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.180
The only downside is his wing is broken, so he can't teach them right away.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.320
But he spends their time trying to verbally show them how to do it.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.980
But the clock is ticking away as they get closer and closer to pie day.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.400
It's a race to see if they can get out a la Great Escape style before the owner can turn them into mincemeat.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.360
It was really great seeing this animation team finally do a full-length motion picture and showing that they can pull it off and still have it be very entertaining.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.180
Its comedy is a little different from, say, something like Wallace and Gromit, which was a little bit more quiet at times.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.420
This one is constant dialogue and constant visual jokes.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.140
But, in a sense, it has sorta the same feel as Wallace and Gromit as it's not always trying to make you laugh every second.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.260
It'll take time just to have a character breathe and talk about however they're feeling.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.240
A lot of people say there was a ton of grownup jokes, but really, I didn't see them until maybe near the end.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.000
"Great Scott, what was that?!"

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.760
"A cling-on, captain!

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.160
The engines can't take it!"

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.640
I guess the only main problem I have with it is that the story is a touch too predictable.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.260
I mean, once again, we're gonna have the liar reveal backstory.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.520
And it's not gonna be just brushed over, either.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.600
It's gonna take up a good chunk of the third act with the characters moping and doping and-

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.860
Oh, Jesus, I've gone on and on about this. I'm not gonna prattle anymore. Let's just say it's boring.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.260
And I don't think the jokes are quite strong enough to make up for such a lackluster part of the movie.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.800
But like I said before, I still think it holds up as being OK.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.540
It is still very creative, it's got some memorable characters, it does have some good lines.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.840
This stop-motion animation is always great to see. I mean, this team always does a wonderful job.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.720
It's bright, it's colorful, it's mostly upbeat, it's very imaginative at times, and it has 1 or 2 bits for adults, too.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.380
Had it not gone for the liar reveal story arc and maybe thought a little bit more out of the box, I would've liked it a lot more, but I still think it's a decent flick.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.140
It's got just enough for kids and just enough for adults.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.620
I think it's worth at least a viewing.
