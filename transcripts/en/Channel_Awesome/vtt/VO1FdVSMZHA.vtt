''Foodfight!'' is one of the worst,

If our data serves correctly, this flop
could be as popular as ''The Room''

Only a few online critics have reviewed it so far,

often seen in grocery aisles.

It was also supposed to come out in 2002.

But due to production problems, copyright issues 
and even somebody stealing the footage--

pushed back to ten years later.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:06.720
[loud thud]

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.940
"Good evening, Madame."

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.160
"Can I interest you in my product?"

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.740
"It's called, "Evil Poison Bites Death."

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.900
"Um...I'm sorry, that doesn't seem 
like a product I'd be interested in."

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:24.220
"Oh, come now. It'll provide your business with the wholesome attractive image of Satan's anus

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.680
that it so desperately needs."

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.240
"I'm going to knee you in the crotch 
if you don't leave right now."

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.280
"That's just what the Jehovah's Witness said."

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.740
[yelps]

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.480
"Be honest. I came on too strong, didn't I?"

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.140
[loud smack]

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:44.140
So the grocery store owner, of course, 
agrees to such a puppy dog-looking man

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.500
and Brand X begins to be brought into the store.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.560
Back in "Sam and Max Hit the Sauce", we see 
Dex makes his way to "Casa de Cameo"

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:57.320
which is the hangout for big name icons like 
Mr. Clean, Charlie the Tuna and the California Raisins.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:03.020
The funny thing is that the people who obviously 
said "no" to using their product icons in this movie

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.880
all have really ugly, really bitter substitutes that, I guess,

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.340
are trying to stick it back to the people 
who denied the use of their image.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.880
Like, this is their version of Chiquita Banana.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.960
"Do I look like the Dairy Queen to you?"

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.840
And this is obviously supposed to be the Keebler Elves.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.620
"I hate you!"

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.120
"I'll sue!"

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.800
The Brawny Man.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.020
"Stop it!"

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.220
"Stop it! No, that hurts!"

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.880
And gee, a chocolate cereal vampire? 
[sarcasm] I wonder who that's supposed to be.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.580
"Chocolate vampire, used to have cards."

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.460
"Looking pretty good for biting it."

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.220
Most of them are portrayed as 
either stupid, ugly, or not very helpful.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.280
It's kind of like the movie's way of saying

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.260
"Oh, yeah, you missed out, guys!"

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:45.280
"You too could have been in a movie where farting is 
the highlight and people trip into other people's butts."

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.600
I think we know who the losers are in this deal!

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.440
[loud fart]

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.760
Give them another grand.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.160
And I guess the representative of 
Brand X in this world is Lady X.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:59.000
A supposedly sexy seductress with the 
dead lifeless eyes of a plastic blow-up doll

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.360
and a personality just as interesting to match.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.920
"Of all the produce bars in all 
the supermarkets in all the world...

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.020
"she had to walk into mine."

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:13.980
Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention, every scene 
that has Dex in it has to end in a bad pun.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:14.940
And I know what you're thinking,

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.640
"Oh, Nostalgia Critic, you say 'every' about everything!"

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.060
But no, literally! Every scene ends with a bad pun!

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
"Time to banana split outta my club!"

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.560
"My problems are just a hill of coffee beans."

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.280
"Let's snap, crackle and pop out of here."

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.500
"How the Ho-hos can this be happening?!"

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.300
"I don't know if I can cut the mustard!"

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.940
"I've got a bone to pick with this guy."

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.580
"Holy chips!"

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.280
"It sure does a body good."

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.620
Some of them don't even make a lick of sense!

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.140
"Let's strawberry jam out of here!"

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.740
And the only thing more demeaning 
than that is all the sexual innuendos.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:47.080
Oh, yeah, there's a ton of those in this, too.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.220
Lady X: "I wanna scrub your bubbles, Dex."

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.720
"It warms my heart the way you love my raisins."

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:54.180
"She's got a real sweet tooth for chocolate!"

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.040
"You already eat through to his hollow center?"

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.420
"Are those melons real?"

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.560
Dex: "There are some stains you can never wash out."

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.460
"Dan's your man! Melts in your mouth, not in your hand!"

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:08.280
[sarcasm] Because a movie like this CLEARLY needs that adult edge for the audience they're obviously going for.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.320
"What can I say...

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:10.900
"Chicks dig chocolate."

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:14.760
Like there's some grown-up somewhere 
watching this movie with their kids, saying

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.700
"Hmm...well, I was going to turn this off and 
not expose my child to such a piece of sh*it,

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:23.560
"but then it acknowledged I'm a pervert 
in a way that my kid won't understand.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.640
"This movie gets me."

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.820
The innuendos are so many and so strange,

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:33.300
you have to wonder if the director had some 
sort of other sexual agenda on his mind--

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.100
"Crying over spilt milk?"

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.400
THIS IS A FETISH FILM!

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.200
Between the innuendos, the cat lady

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:44.720
and the fact that every outfit this woman 
wears even a dominatrix would say is too silly...

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.640
[loud thud]

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.800
And by the way, plaid gloves? Really?

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.780
The design is so weird that it creates the 
illusion that her hands are on backwards.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.400
On top of that, it looks like her arm 
is melting into Al Borland's shirt.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.040
Is this actually a popular thing and I just never noticed?

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.780
"You've been through the wash plenty. 
I can see it in your eyes."

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.740
So, Dex starts to notice something 
along with stereotype #20 here.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.620
"Are you sayin' what I dinks yous is sayin'?"

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.580
[imitating a mob gangster] "Hey, what's 
yous Italians gettings upsets aboutses?"

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.980
That being that Lady X is starting 
to rub out the other characters.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.040
"Oh, you have to help me, Dex, before I go bald!

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.600
"Not that bald isn't beautiful!"

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.680
Dex: "I don't...get involved."

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.400
Really?

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:30.240
Mr. Clean showed up just for that ONE joke?

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:35.860
He wasn't even around in the rest of the scene and suddenly he appears when they said the word "bald".

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.940
And...now he's just stuck there.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.140
Look at him! He's just standing around like,

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.660
"Uh...is there anything else you wanted me to do...?"

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.400
"Was I really just a pawn in your 
lame-ass little punchline?"

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.360
"I have a Ph.D. in physics!

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:57.520
Perhaps I could educate the young children
watching about fluid or solid mechanics or...

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.000
...or I'll just look over here..."

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.780
"Yeah, I'm sure I'll show up when 
you make another boob joke.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.420
Shouldn't take long..."

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.960
So, Dex decides it's time to go get 
some answers from the street.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.720
"Everybody seems to be searching for--"

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.160
Oh, my God, his dick's talking!

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.460
His dick's talking! That's it! 
GAME OVER, MAN! GAME OVER!

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.000
"Mayhaps a reward for the reckless rodent?"

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.620
Tell me you wouldn't be shocked 
if they went that direction!

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.960
"But this dish is extra spicy..."

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:33.040
Yeah...something else you'll notice 
is the motion capture arm acting.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:37.300
I guess because the expressions 
in this movie are...nonexistent,

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.640
all the acting comes through how much the
characters awkwardly wave their arms.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.580
It's like watching C-3PO have a seizure,

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.060
but even he somehow would have more 
expression on his face than these guys!

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.180
"Not that bald isn't beautiful!"

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.720
[imitating C-3PO] "R2-D2, where are you?"

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.560
So, Dex and Dan go to get some 
answers from, you won't believe this,

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.980
another scary demon of Hell!

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.320
"Brand X!" [speaking incoherently]

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.560
GOD!

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.680
[panicky speaking] "Doctor Pepper, doctor--!"

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.900
"--anybody but-!"
Dex: "Doc! Doc! Doc!"

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.260
I'm just going to close my eyes and pray it goes away...

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.720
"BRAND X! Brand X!"

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.000
[shouts] "DAYTIIIIIIIIME!!!"

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.880
[miserably] No. It only got worse.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.340
"AAACHOOOO!"

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.820
"Discontinued!"

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.740
Well, at least they're not pulling the ultimate insult
by giving him a stereotypical Jewish accent--

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:22.700
"But it's in the Expiration Station!

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.280
And at the other end of the store! No, you'd never
make it there before the supermarket opens."

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.700
[shouts] "IT'S DAYTIIIIIIIIIIIIME!!!!!"

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.540
Are there any other groups you'd like to insult?

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.860
I mean, the human race is so vast and full of variety,

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.340
I'm sure you can find the blackface 
of every single person on the planet!

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.620
In fact, why even focus on a group?

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:50.460
Why not just show us ugliness in any shape or form? You're good at that!

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.420
Don't even give a reason, just use it in this 
scene where they now physically exist in the store,

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.380
again, adding no continuity to 
how the fuck this world works,

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.880
and just throw in whatever terrible 
ungodly thing comes out of your head--

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.680
[dramatic music]

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:09.940
WHAT! WHAT! WHAT! WHAT! 
WHAT! WHAT! WHAT! WHAT! WHAT!

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.980
Oh my God! I get it! I totally get it now!

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:17.000
This movie is punishment for me to repent 
all of the terrible things I've done in my life!

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.360
Alright! If it'll stop you from scaring 
the living animal Jesus out of me,

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.920
I'LL CONFESS! I'LL CONFESS!

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.720
I was the one who cancelled Firefly!

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.980
I was the one who encouraged 
Fred to be an online series!

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.260
I was the one who told Taco Bell 
to make a breakfast menu!

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:31.820
I was the one who told John Travolta 
how to pronounce Idina Menzel!

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.080
I was the one getting rid of the 
cartoons on Cartoon Network!

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.640
Just take me out of this scene!!!

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.400
Dan: "Batter up, Dog!"

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.840
[dramatic music intensifies]

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.560
[music ends]

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.660
I think we need a break.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.380
Here's some commercials.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.980
For the love of God, don't make a movie out of them!

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.680
So they come across a mascot who's a 
chocolate vampire for a chocolate cereal.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.180
CLEARLY this is supposed to be Captain Crunch.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.600
"I am the undead!

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.960
Alright? The undead.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.280
No, you're not dead, but you're not exactly living, either.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.840
It's sort of like being in summer school."

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.160
[laughs]

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.360
"Oh, come on, that's funny. Now that's funny.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.240
Let's not lose out senses of humor."

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.420
You have to have one before you can lose it.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:35.920
So, they decide to get all the brands together 
to stop the evil Lady X and her Brand X army.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.740
But not before her head of the guards 
tries to shut down the Coco Banana.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.040
"And unless you care to suffer a long cruel expiration...

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.780
you will sing your allegiance to Brand X."

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.720
Oh, no! They got Tim Curry in on this too!

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.460
Why, Tim? WHY?

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:59.580
Nostalgia Critic: [imitating Tim Curry] 
"I was seeing if I could do anything more 
demeaning than saying 'Ducks Rock!'

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.940
This is a very clear sign that I can."

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:02.880
[clapping]

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:07.100
[monotone] "Brand X, Brand X, it's simple and plain."

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.620
"Brand X, Brand X, it's different but all the same."

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.660
But Dex comes in and starts 
singing their triumphant song...

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.760
["La Marseillaise" plays]

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:42.080
In a way that unless you saw the original movie, 
this would make absolutely no sense whatsoever.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.880
And it's extremely unlikely any little 
kid would have seen this movie,

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.420
so this probably makes absolutely 
no sense whatsoever.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.340
If you haven't guessed it yet, they're 
clearly paying homage to Barb Wire.

greatest performance,

Wow. Absolutely outstanding detail.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.440
Surely they must have asked Pixar to 
do this breathtaking work of genius!

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:45.380
Actually, they did, and after reading the script, not
only did they send this terrible animation as a joke

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:49.660
but they also attached a handwritten note saying
"GO FUCK YOURSELVES!" signed by John Lasseter.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.440
But the director was so lazy, he used the clip anyway.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.960

And wow, look at THIS amazingness!

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.440
Surely they must have asked Dreamworks 
to have this incredible work done!

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.860
Actually, they did!

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.060
And after they read the script, they 
sent them this spit-in-the-face render

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:14.400
while also sending out a picture of Spielberg, Katzenberg, and Geffen all mooning the camera

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.520
and giving the finger.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.780

so he used the clip anyway.

Unbelievable! Wow!

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:33.200
Surely, such epic magnitude must have 
been asked to be done by Blue Sky Studios!

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.960
Actually, they did!

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.800
And they asked if they could 
turn it into a horrible franchise.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.860
Don't be shocked if you see this 
coming soon to a theater near you.

Hey, look! There's the Twinkie Guy!

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.920
I'm sure he's gonna do something really 
big and really important coming up!

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.280
After all, he is one of the biggest 
characters on the poster,

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.480
along with these other icons 
you've barely seen in the movie!

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.920
Hell, Dex and Sunshine are one-third of their size.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:09.040
Surely all of them are gonna get together and 
do something huge in the movie's climax!

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.960
Like, say nothing...

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.320
...pretty much do nothing...

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.620
...and take a backseat to graphics worse 
than the Money for Nothing video.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.480
And...Okay, a lot of you might be shouting, 
"that's phenomenal false advertising

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.520
in a film that is absolutely nothing but advertising."

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.220
But this is incredibly common of even good films.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:32.880
Heck, I once a saw a Star Wars poster where 
the main focus was the Mouse Droid,

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.840
and we all know what a gigantic part he played, right?

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.500

Perhaps you'd like to do something funny with it.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:27.100
So, Dex makes it to Lady X's headquarters 
and discovers--big fucking shock

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.240
--that she was behind Sunshine's 
disappearance the whole time.

Sunshine gets her hands untied, throws a 
raisin to Dex which he uses as a weapon,

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.140
so he can untie the hands we 
clearly just saw she untied herself.

Uh, did she go blind since the last time we saw her?

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.180
I don't think she's looked at him 
in the face once during this scene!

Or...was he always part of the world, or is he SOMETIMES in their world and sometimes not,

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:42.220

punishment program they use in the Matrix?

The villain of the movie the whole time was...
the villain of the movie.

"So you built yourself a human 
robot and recalled Sunshine,

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.740
then you stole her essence 
to make your elixir for Brand X?"

"No. Just...no."

"But...how did you get in and out of the store? 
You're an Ike!"

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.640
"Perhaps if I do more ballerina twirls,
the answer will become clear!"

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.120
"When you look like this, you can get them to do anything."

of the illusion of animation!

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:50.260
And we quite literally have a catfight between 
the two attractive women of the film.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.000

kick you where the sun don't shine!"

the ass of the hot dominatrix,

[snickering] "That's so funny..."

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.080
And then she gets turned into an ugly woman,

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.740
proving once and for all that if you're an ugly woman, 
no good can come out of you!

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.720
In fact, I don't think human hands could have made it.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:49.600
I think something much more horrendous and disrespectful had to pull its energy together

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.660
and make something so awful.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.600
[creepy music]

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.800
Oh my God...

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.820
I just figured it out...

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:58.260
The horrible CG animation...

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.500
The awful stereotypes...

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.900
The tremendously unfunny humor...

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:04.480
The fact that everything in this movie
is despicably awkward and unnatural!

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.740
MY GOD!

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.860
I KNOW WHO DIRECTED THIS FILM!

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.840
"Meesa need way more fart jokes!
Lotsa more fart jokes!

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.140
Thissa gonna bea greata for the Foodfighta Twoa!"

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.580
From Hell's motherfucking heart, I stab at thee!

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:21.200
[beep]

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.580
[missile wooshing]

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:23.440
[explosion]

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.420
"Waits a minute.."

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.500
[screaming and explosions]

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:32.980
It is done.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.380
But the evil will never truly go away.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:42.320
This IS the worst animated film I have ever seen, 
hands down, no comparison.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.160
Its scars are left deep inside of me.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:48.740
Why did I do it?

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.340
For you.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.600
I did it for you.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.020
Because I know that I have seen the worst.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:01.800
I know that no other form of animation
will ever be worse than Foodfight!

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.580
And because of that...

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:12.120
I know for a fact that this film will forever 
in the history books, always be seen as--

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.380
Passé?!

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.060
Malcolm: Yup! Since you started the review, 
the movie's popularity has already died out.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.580
But that was a fucking half-hour ago!

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.720
Malcolm: Well, that's practically 
five years in Internet time.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:25.040
Tamara: Yes! People knew it was going to 
be the next popular thing to mock...

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.840
Malcolm: So they decided not to mock it at all.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:31.320
Wait...so the popularity of something can fade 
even before it becomes popular?

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.140
Malcolm: Mm-hmm. We call it the "Hipster Effect".

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:37.140
Knowing something is going to be ironically cool suddenly makes it traditionally cool.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:41.040
So to be ahead of the curve, they decided 
to not even make it ironically cool.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.980
Hell, even thinking about it 
probably cuts its lifespan in half.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.800
[sigh]

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.520
So, you're telling me that sitting through all this misery...

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.400
the worst animated film of all time was--

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.820
Malcolm: A complete waste of time.

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:54.900
Sorry, buddy.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.940
And there's nothing I can do about it?

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.600
Malcolm: Not unless you want to somehow do 
a review of the Attorney General of Crimea.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.680
She is on FIRE right now!

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.240
Oh, I just want to eat her up!

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.640
Oh, look! She smiled!

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.580
She's like the Jennifer Lawrence of warfare!

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:17.980
Tamara: I just want to pinch her cheeks, 
but I respect her.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.480
[grunting and smashing]

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.480

[Melancholic Music]

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:49.760
To all those critics foolish enough to
think that they can review Foodfight!...

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.080
I won't lie to you about your chances.

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.180
You have my sympathies.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.860
It will not leave you the same way it found you.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.120
Its scars run deep.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:08.840
If there is anyone out there damn insane 
enough to try and take on this film...

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.360
All I have to say is...

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.120
Be strong...

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:14.960
Be brave...

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.720
[whispering] Beware...
