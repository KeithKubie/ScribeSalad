00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.484
Your turn

00:00:01.484 --> 00:00:02.600
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.270
[NOISE]

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.270
You know, I've been thinking, this is a

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.540
really great analogy for how the human body works.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.740
&gt;&gt; It's just a board game.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.830
&gt;&gt; Well sure, but I mean, think about it, from the outside looking in, it's

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.350
a lot like the human body, it can

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.016
seem really complicated, like a Rube Goldberg machine.

00:00:20.016 --> 00:00:20.410
&gt;&gt; What's that?

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.650
&gt;&gt; Well, you know? Something where there's a seemingly

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.305
simple task, right? There's just a trap coming down.

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:25.730
[SOUND]

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.130
But there's a ton of energy dependent steps that have

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.320
to be accomplished for us to get to this simple outcome.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.380
&gt;&gt; I won.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.980
&gt;&gt; You did win. Now, although it looks complicated. If

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.260
we remove just one piece from the machine here, we

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.750
can totally alter the end outcome, or the end result.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.156
So, let's do it again and remove this little diver man

00:00:44.156 --> 00:00:44.390
[NOISE].

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:52.310
&gt;&gt; Okay. So

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.450
I see, the whole game is like the human body. But there's obviously a lot more

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.990
genes in the human body than there are human pieces

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.610
in the game. Sounds like something a geneticist would study.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.090
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right. But a geneticist doesn't study all the genes at once.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.770
They still use the one gene at a time approach, meaning that they remove

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.840
one piece, and they see what happens. Now if

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.860
you remove one piece, and you actually can see

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.580
a visible, overall effect, then you know you've got

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.580
something important to the whole process. And this is actually

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.260
what geneticists call a monogenic trait A monogenic trait

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.190
is whenever one gene has a variation that effects

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.080
the overall outcome or phenotype. This lesson is dedicated

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.530
to inherited tratis that are influenced by single genes, or

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.750
monogeneic traits. We're going to cover traits

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.990
like, red, green colorblindness, dwarfism, osteogeneis

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.150
imperfecta, and sickle cell anemia. For each of these traits we're going to

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.470
uncover some of the genetic variations that cause these traits. And then also

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.180
examine the dominance of these various

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.530
alleles that contribute to an individual phenotype.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.510
&gt;&gt; Here's the concept map for lesson eight. As always, I

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.580
want you to print it out and try to fill in the

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.520
blanks on your own as we go through the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.060
lesson. Then in the end you'll have a chance

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.570
to see how you did. There'll be a complete

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.419
version of the map waiting for you at the end.
