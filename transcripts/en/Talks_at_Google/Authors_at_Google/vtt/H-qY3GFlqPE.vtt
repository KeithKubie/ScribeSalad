RICK NEEDHAM: Thank you everyone
for joining us today on our,

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.780
I believe, third, final,
some might argue best event

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.330
that we have sponsored here in
Mountain View for Veterans Day

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.727
activities.

00:00:14.727 --> 00:00:16.810
I'm here as a representative
our Veterans Network.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.920
I'm Rick Needham.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.930
I work in energy
and sustainability.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.330
But here today I'm really
meant to kind of introduce

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.170
Jake who's our honored
guest here today who

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.220
wrote this awesome
book, "Take Command."

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.961
I suggest reading it.

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:33.210
It's got some really cool
lessons, even like puts them

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.590
in really bulletized
form at the end,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.465
so if you really want
to get through quickly,

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:39.320
you can, but lots of
really cool insights.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.670
This is, as I mentioned,
a series of events

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.227
that we have around
Veterans Day.

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:46.310
People sometimes get
confused between Veterans Day

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.220
and Memorial Day.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.080
So Memorial Day is meant to
honor those who have fallen.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.870
Veterans Day is meant to
honor those who've served.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.640
It actually started off
as Armistice Day, which

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.570
is based on the final day of
World War I. It's changed names

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.410
and dates a couple of times.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.920
After World War II
it changed a bit.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.480
But basically, it's a way of
honoring those who have served.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.470
And we have a lot of
people within Google

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.105
who have served-- a lot
of people here today who

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:14.120
have served, both Jake and
members of Team Rubicon.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.430
So it's an important day.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.980
Another interesting important
day, especially to Jake

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.650
and to Ben who's going to
be moderating the talk,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.750
is the Marine Corps
birthday, which

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.540
was earlier this week,
the 239th if I'm right.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.176
If I was a Marine, I'd
definitely know for sure.

00:01:30.176 --> 00:01:34.356
Oh, there's someone there
who can verify that.

00:01:34.356 --> 00:01:35.980
So in addition to
the events that we've

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.060
had with respect to
Veterans Day at our offices

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.240
here in Mountain
View and worldwide,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.500
we also launched
just this week a site

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.314
that highlights hiring
of veterans at Google.

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:47.730
That's been a lot
of effort that's

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.060
been put into that from
our veterans network.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.240
We're really excited
about the site.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.500
It really shows in the
words of David Drummond,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.010
that "the doors are open
at Google for veterans."

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.430
And we want to make
sure that that's known,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.700
and that people
who may have people

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.590
that they know who are
veterans to encourage

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.980
them to apply to jobs at Google.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.400
Again, doors are open.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.050
Here at Google, we recognize
the value of diversity.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.170
And veterans is one
of those communities

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.550
that we certainly reach out
to as a way of bolstering

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.340
our own employee
base and getting

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.150
the prospective and
the skills that they

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.130
can bring to bear
for our own business.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.990
The site, just in case you
want to go there, is g.co/vets.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.370
So I would recommend
going there.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.880
It's really cool.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.001
But recognizing the value and
the skills that veterans have

00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:39.500
is something that
probably resonates

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.220
pretty well with
our guest speaker

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.610
today with Jake who, when
he form Team Rubicon,

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.844
really was able to pull
from the veterans community

00:02:47.844 --> 00:02:50.010
to provide a really interesting
opportunity for them

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.520
to continue to serve in
a really powerful way.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.620
So before I talk about a
bit about Team Rubicon,

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.170
first a little bit about Jake.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.060
Jake served as a sergeant
in the Marine Corps

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.740
with deployments in both
Iraq and Afghanistan

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.880
as a scout sniper.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.290
So people hear Marine
sniper, that was Jake.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.040
He was a Marine sniper.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.630
He received a lot
of awards in combat,

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.630
was the honor graduate
of the recruit training

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.500
from school of infantry and
Marine scout sniper course.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.180
And then in 2010, that's
when he, with a former Marine

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.665
William McNulty,
founded Team Rubicon.

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:29.290
Jake has been-- and I'll talk a
bit about more of Team Rubicon,

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.900
but Jake has been a really
outgoing advocate of veterans,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.980
about issues facing
returning veterans,

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.120
and has been on numerous kind
of US committees on this topic,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.230
and has made a lot of progress
and been a very strong voice

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.860
for the veterans community.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.260
Prior to all this work, Jake was
at the University of Wisconsin

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.820
where he got his
bachelor's degree,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.778
where he played four
years of varsity football,

00:03:54.778 --> 00:03:59.880
and as I hear also weighed 295
pounds, which as you can see,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.610
Marine Corps sniper training can
really take the pounds off too.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.590
That's one way of doing it,
if you want to go that route.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.370
So Team Rubicon-- so when
Jake formed Team Rubicon,

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.970
that was in 2010.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.980
It was when he saw
what was happening

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.829
in Haiti, with the disaster in
Haiti, and he thought, my gosh.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.700
I can go help out.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.350
I can do something.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.350
So Team Rubicon basically
formed, literally,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.480
in the hours after that
disaster to be a team that

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.074
can help deliver veterans
to disaster zones

00:04:33.074 --> 00:04:35.740
where they could really use some
of their skills and experiences

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.380
to not only help but
to feel like they're

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.960
continuing the
service, continuing

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.095
the service to something that's
beyond just what they can

00:04:44.095 --> 00:04:46.220
do as individuals, but
something beyond themselves.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.970
So it's really a pretty
powerful organization

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.980
that taps into the
strong desire of veterans

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.806
that we've seen
here at Google too,

00:04:54.806 --> 00:04:56.680
the desire to work on
something that's bigger

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.660
than just themselves.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.351
Today Team Rubicon-- and
this is maybe out of date.

00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:03.850
This I think I read from the
book, but they've been growing.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.730
So today boasts over two
dozen full time employees,

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.520
scores of part time
employees, and I

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.100
think it's over like, is it,
20,000 volunteer veterans

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.280
and first responders, so
an enormous organization,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.610
a lot of it from volunteers,
many of whom are here today.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.820
Not 20,000.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.910
So they've engaged
over 50 missions

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.330
by the end of last year, on
four different continents.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.490
They've been,
obviously, to Haiti,

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.070
but they've gone to places
like where Hurricane Sandy hit

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.110
in New York and New Jersey.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.370
They'd been to places like
South Sudan and Burma.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.100
They've been into the Midwest
when tornadoes have hit.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.710
So they've gone into all
kinds of disaster zones.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.460
They've won a lot of awards.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.720
They won the National Small
Charity of the Year Award.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.430
They also won the Heroes
and Leaders National

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.260
Award, the Grinnell Prize.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.380
And in 2012, Jake was
named a CNN hero too.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.020
So if you didn't want
another accolade,

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.650
there's another one for you.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.310
So I did have a chance
to read the book.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.660
And I think there was
a lot of things in here

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.320
that resonated not only
with, I think, veterans,

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.210
but also resonated well with how
we think about doing business

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.210
here at Google and how
we think about employees

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.900
and how do we think
about work environment.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.110
A couple of things that
really stuck out to me

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.800
is one, really
focusing on people

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.020
who don't see just
obstacles but see solutions.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.370
So here at Google,
we certainly prize

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.260
those employees and those
folks who really are thinking

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.850
not just about the
issues that we'll face

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.404
or the challenges we face,
or the competitors we face,

00:06:39.404 --> 00:06:41.320
but really think about,
what are the solutions

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.070
around those things?

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.070
Focusing on the people who
don't just look at problems

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.180
but conjure up solutions,
who look at obstacles

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.010
and see only opportunity.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.650
And this is the one quote
I really like for the book,

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.310
that they don't ask why
we would do something,

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.350
but they ask why not?

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.774
And I think that's a culture at
Google that exists at Google.

00:07:00.774 --> 00:07:02.690
I mean, who would think
a search company would

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.400
go make a driverless car, or
would make a wearable device,

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.180
or do many things we
do, genomics research?

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.890
All these people would
consider crazy things.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.220
But it's because
we're a company that

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.790
doesn't ask the question, why?

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.600
It's a company
that asks, why not?

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.615
Why can't we go do that?

00:07:19.615 --> 00:07:20.990
And I think that
really resonates

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.239
with some of the things that
the Jake had in his book,

00:07:23.239 --> 00:07:24.610
"Take Command."

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.220
Also another one,
action is often

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.130
the first step
toward a solution.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.120
So to me, translating
that into Google

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.370
speak, we launch and iterate.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.390
We do things, find
out what worked,

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.600
what didn't, modify
it, make it better,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.640
and we're continuously
improving.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.880
But if you get stuck in just
the continuous analysis,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.530
you never actually
get to do something.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.160
So we're very much
a culture that

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.214
focuses on doing and improving.

00:07:48.214 --> 00:07:49.380
I think that also resonates.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.020
And one other thing that stood
out for me is Team Rubicon

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.250
has a culture of a
lot of transparency.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.110
And talking with Jake
just before this,

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.820
I didn't know that part of
the roots of that transparency

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.736
actually come from
something that Google does,

00:08:02.736 --> 00:08:06.000
our TGIF, that happens every
week, where the founders get up

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.680
and talk to the
entire employee base

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.513
and are able to answer
questions from anyone

00:08:09.513 --> 00:08:12.560
who wants to have the courage to
stand up and grab a microphone

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.941
and ask a question.

00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:16.190
They do that with their
employees, internal employees.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.200
They also do it
with their donors,

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.690
where they share not just
their successes but also

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.490
the challenges that they face.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.390
And that's, I
think, an indication

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:28.150
of a very healthy organization
and one that can really thrive.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.390
And although we can hear
it directly from Jake here,

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.090
I think one of the key themes
of why Team Rubicon really works

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.720
is that it affords
the veterans a way

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.280
to continue their dedication
to service and a dedication

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.650
to doing something, again,
that's bigger than themselves--

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.750
which is, when we think
about things at Google,

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.890
we tend to hire people who not
only are good at their job,

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.760
and can make the
next great product,

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.300
or help build out our
infrastructure that delivers

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.390
products and services
to a billion users,

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.500
but they tend to be
people also think about,

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.350
how can I make the world better?

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:04.700
What I'm working on, it
could be good for Google.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.470
But I want it to be
good for the world.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.480
I want to make the
world a better place.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.140
And that to me felt
like also another way

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.880
that we kind of resonate
with the way Team Rubicon

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.430
thinks about gathering up
people who really have a desire

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.570
to do something much
bigger than themselves.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.070
So we'll hear
directly from Jake.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.430
But in order to elicit these
key insight and golden nuggets

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.370
from Jake, we also
have someone here

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.820
from Google who's going
to help moderate, Ben.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.360
He's the head of
mid-market sales

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.970
and small medium business in
America for Google for Work.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.386
He's been here
almost seven years,

00:09:35.386 --> 00:09:38.470
so that's a long-time
veteran in Google years.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.290
Ben also is a Marine.

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.710
He led Marines in Fallujah.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:43.710
He has his own Purple
Heart from an RPG.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.440
So he's been there.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.960
And a connection that Jake
has with Team Rubicon I think

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.660
is actually twofold,
beyond just being Marines.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.350
And Ben relayed to me that,
although he wasn't a Marine

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.090
sniper, he very,
very much appreciated

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.970
when they were around to
help support the infantry.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.250
So he's certainly very
emphatic about that.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:04.750
The other thing is
that Ben actually

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.200
spent time volunteering
with Team Rubicon

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.480
in New York with respect
to Hurricane Sandy.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.430
So he got to see firsthand
some of the things

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.250
that Team Rubicon does.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:18.100
So a great avenue to
getting some of these

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.770
nuggets out of Jake.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:20.980
So I won't take anymore time.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.890
I probably took too
much time already.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.400
But let me introduce you to Jake
and Ben who can help moderate.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.570
So thank you so much
for being here, guys.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:33.290
BEN BUDDE: Thanks, Rick.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:34.860
I appreciate it.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.560
I'll just ask Jake to start off.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.462
Please, introduce
yourself and then--

00:10:39.462 --> 00:10:40.420
JAKE WOOD: Get into it?

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.086
BEN BUDDE: Yeah.

00:10:41.086 --> 00:10:42.420
JAKE WOOD: All right.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.370
Jake Wood.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.570
How many people here are
Team Rubicon volunteers?

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.300
Awesome.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.060
Googlers, Google vetters?

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.220
Vet Googlers?

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:53.720
All right.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.480
Well, thank you
for your service.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.021
Hopefully we can
turn all of you guys

00:10:57.021 --> 00:10:59.860
into Team Rubicon volunteers
by the end of this.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.340
Really excited to be here.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.320
Very, very happy to be
on the Google campus.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.210
I was not as excited when
my alarm went off at 6:00 AM

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.750
on the East Coast this morning
after being at a Metallica

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.310
concert on the National
Mall last night,

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.930
celebrating Veterans
Day, which was awesome,

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:18.570
the Concert for
Valor last night.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.210
We got to rock out with
some pretty sweet bands.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:24.870
But no, I really am
happy to be here.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.979
And we were talking
beforehand why

00:11:26.979 --> 00:11:28.520
it's actually pretty
cool to be here.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:33.010
Because I, no kidding,
three years ago to the day,

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.600
I got a phone call from someone
at Google, a woman I known

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.130
named Carrie Laureno,
who has been a long time

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:44.270
big part of the vet net, or
the internal vet network here.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:48.352
And it was the day
after Veterans Day 2011.

00:11:48.352 --> 00:11:50.310
I had just been at a
Monday Night Football game

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.643
between the Green Bay Packers
and the Minnesota Vikings.

00:11:52.643 --> 00:11:53.860
I'm a huge Packers fans.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.930
So you can imagine the
state of mind I was in.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.145
And I'm boarding a plane early
in the morning, probably 8:00

00:12:00.145 --> 00:12:00.692
AM again.

00:12:00.692 --> 00:12:01.650
And I get a phone call.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.860
And she says, Jake.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:08.480
We are about to release
our last grants for 2011.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.330
Somebody that we were
going to give money to

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:11.525
just fell through.

00:12:11.525 --> 00:12:12.900
I want to give
you money, but you

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.682
have to have a grant proposal
in to me by the end of the day.

00:12:16.682 --> 00:12:19.470
I'm like, oh my god.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:20.787
I feel like shit, Carrie.

00:12:20.787 --> 00:12:23.370
You're going to make me write--
So I wrote this grant proposal

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.286
on the way from Green
Bay back to Los Angeles.

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:26.820
I hit Send as soon as I landed.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.830
And Google became our first
ever corporate sponsor

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.090
about two weeks later.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.965
Gave us $150,000 back
when $150,000-- I mean,

00:12:33.965 --> 00:12:35.340
that's always a
big sum of money,

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.250
but back when $150,000 was an
organization-changing amount

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.270
of money for Team Rubicon,
so pretty cool to be here,

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.410
actually and make it
all come full circle.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:48.840
So Team Rubicon, it was touched
on in that introduction,

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.097
is really an organization
about service.

00:12:51.097 --> 00:12:52.180
And we do a lot of things.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.846
But really at the
core of it is service.

00:12:53.846 --> 00:12:57.310
And my journey toward
service actually

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.630
started as kind of a
journey away from service.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.692
Back when I was a
junior in high school,

00:13:02.692 --> 00:13:04.650
I thought I was going to
join the Marine Corps.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.185
And I had all these
posters up in my room,

00:13:07.185 --> 00:13:08.662
you know, Marine Corps posters.

00:13:08.662 --> 00:13:10.870
I'd go steal some off the
recruiter's desk every time

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.660
he'd come into the cafeteria
looking for suckers like me.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.396
And after my junior
year of high school,

00:13:18.396 --> 00:13:19.770
I realized I had
this opportunity

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.228
to go and play
football in college.

00:13:21.228 --> 00:13:23.540
And so I had these two
competing opportunities

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.370
for what I wanted to
do after graduating.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.880
I ended up choosing to go to
college and play football.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:31.830
I went to the University of
Wisconsin, showed up on campus

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.440
there in 2001.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.695
And that was my dream.

00:13:34.695 --> 00:13:36.570
My dream was to go on
and playing in the NFL.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:37.610
I played offensive line.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.850
At the time-- well, and
I'd like to think still--

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.506
Wisconsin is the best offensive
line school in the country.

00:13:43.506 --> 00:13:46.622
And I got there, and we all
know kind of what happened.

00:13:46.622 --> 00:13:48.330
Well, the first thing
that happened was I

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.621
realized that I was actually
a pretty terrible football

00:13:50.621 --> 00:13:52.770
player, despite
being 295 pounds.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:53.895
They wanted me at like 320.

00:13:53.895 --> 00:13:56.970
And I just couldn't
physically do it.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.990
And I'm made of glass.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.930
So I show up, and after about
the second or third week

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.710
of the season, 9/11 happens.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:07.695
We all remember 9/11.

00:14:07.695 --> 00:14:08.570
I remember waking up.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.110
I was in my dorm room.

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.260
I went down to the
cafeteria, saw everybody

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.442
huddled around the TV.

00:14:13.442 --> 00:14:14.650
And it was a powerful moment.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.775
And everybody knew that we
were going to be at war.

00:14:16.775 --> 00:14:18.380
And I had this
first moment where

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.935
I was second guessing my
choice to come to Wisconsin

00:14:21.935 --> 00:14:25.930
and pursue this thing,
this football thing.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.440
My dad calls me that afternoon.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.480
He says, don't even
think about it.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.090
Stay in school.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.110
And I thought long
and hard about it.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.420
And I stayed in school.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.280
And we went to war
in Afghanistan.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.280
A year and a half later,
we went to war in Iraq.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.110
And I'm sitting there
every day, and I'm

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.490
watching on CNN from
my dorm room young men

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.210
just like me in the
Battle of Fallujah.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.485
Were you there in 2004?

00:14:47.485 --> 00:14:48.510
BEN BUDDE: I was.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.260
JAKE WOOD: So I was
watching this guy kick

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.297
in doors, 4,000 miles away.

00:14:52.297 --> 00:14:54.130
And I'm sitting there
eating mac and cheese,

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:57.250
trying to get to
315 pounds still.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.085
And it weighed on me.

00:14:59.085 --> 00:15:00.460
Now, it didn't
weigh on me enough

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.360
to drop what I was doing to
go and join the Marine Corps.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.234
But it weighed on me.

00:15:03.234 --> 00:15:06.947
And then about a couple
months later, Pat Tillman

00:15:06.947 --> 00:15:08.030
was killed in Afghanistan.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.490
And that for me was the
moment where I said, OK.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.621
It's time to stop
serving yourself

00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:14.370
and start serving your
country like you've

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:16.661
been talking about for the
better part of the last four

00:15:16.661 --> 00:15:17.610
or five years.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:21.780
So I walked the graduation
ceremony, got my degree.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.430
And I went over the
recruiter's office

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:24.950
and I enlisted in
the Marine Corps.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.230
And that's really where
service kind of began for me.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.960
I served in the Marine Corps,
did my first tour in Iraq

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.930
and the Anbar Province in
2007 as part of the surge.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.940
It was with a unit, a battalion
out in Southern California,

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.970
2nd Battalion, 7th Marines.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:42.230
And it was a tough tour.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.300
My second week
in, I was actually

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.250
a young fire team
leader, a lance corporal.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.704
My squad got hit.

00:15:48.704 --> 00:15:50.120
One of my good
friends was killed.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.430
Our squad leader was
wounded pretty badly.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:58.260
That night I saw what
bad leadership was.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:02.091
I was the junior fire
team leader in that squad.

00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:03.590
But the senior fire
team leader, who

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:07.420
should have been taking charge
of that situation, he failed.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.410
He hesitated.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.970
There was this moment of
uncertainty in his eyes.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:16.790
And so I ended up
taking, pardon--

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.590
I ended up taking command
of the squad at that moment.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:22.284
And I received a
promotion to corporal.

00:16:22.284 --> 00:16:24.450
And I led that squad then
for the next seven months.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.470
Two weeks of combat experience.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.040
And I learned
very, very quickly,

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.623
although I'd always thought that
I was a decent leader, that I

00:16:30.623 --> 00:16:32.410
didn't know shit
about leadership.

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.850
Seven months trying to
motivate 13 young men

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.600
to suit up every day and go
outside the wire in the Anbar

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.640
Province during the
surge was tough.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.530
And there were a
lot of failures.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.110
And it continued be a tough
tour for seven months.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.410
But I got back.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.300
And I had a decision to make.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:54.000
I ended up choosing to go into
the sniper platoon-- trying out

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.280
and being selected to
the sniper platoon,

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.730
and had an opportunity
a couple months later

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.160
to go to sniper school,
which is challenging.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.450
It's got the highest dropout
rate in the Marine Corps.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:10.760
We started with 32 guys, and I
think 15 or 16 of us graduated.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.880
And that's after a pretty
cutthroat selection process

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.390
to get there.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:18.680
And about a month
after graduating

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.500
from sniper school, my
little six man team,

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:25.230
within our platoon, we got
deployed to Afghanistan.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.990
We got sent to the
Helmand Valley.

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.865
This was before Congress
authorized the surge

00:17:29.865 --> 00:17:30.510
in Afghanistan.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:34.060
So this was a really interesting
time to be in that country,

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.570
because it was
really understaffed,

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.050
under equipped, under supported.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:41.120
And the Marine
Corps, particularly,

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.597
didn't really have
a mission there.

00:17:42.597 --> 00:17:44.180
But they were trying
to give them one.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.360
So they send this
battalion of Marines

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.810
into Helmand Valley, first
time US troops had been there

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.130
in about three or four years.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:55.980
And my sniper team was attached
to a Marine infantry company.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.650
And we were given
the city of Sangin.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.960
So we had about 150
Marines to control

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.580
the city of Sangin, which
about two years later required

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.020
almost 2,000 Marines to control.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.440
And we needed 2,000
Marines when we were there.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.900
We got our ass kicked every day.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.200
And it was tough.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.400
Got back in '08, and
decided to get out.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.480
I felt like I'd served.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:21.910
I felt like my service
was over, rightfully so.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:24.050
I served honorably,
done everything

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:25.964
that I wanted to do
in the Marine Corps.

00:18:25.964 --> 00:18:27.630
But it was a tough
decision nonetheless.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:29.005
You're waking away
from a mission

00:18:29.005 --> 00:18:31.370
that, although it was
vague and ambiguous,

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.060
was still incomplete,
nonetheless.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.455
And so it was a
really tough call

00:18:35.455 --> 00:18:36.830
to get out at that
point in time.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.900
But I got out in '09, wanted
to be an entrepreneur,

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.700
as if you can just go check a
box and become an entrepreneur.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.950
But I knew I needed to go
and get some more schooling.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.480
You know, it's tough to just
come out as a Marine sniper

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.912
and go and apply to
be an entrepreneur.

00:18:53.912 --> 00:18:56.370
So I started to apply to a
bunch of different grad schools.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.900
And in January 2010, I
got a rejection letter

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.360
from Stanford, which sucked.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.970
And about two or three days
later, the Haiti earthquake

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:06.470
happened.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:09.800
So that kind of gets us
to the point of the story.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.290
I had never thought
in my life that I

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:13.739
would work for nonprofit.

00:19:13.739 --> 00:19:15.030
I'd always been service minded.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.410
I did different hunger drives
during high school and things

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:18.910
like that.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.035
But I never thought I'd be in
the nonprofit space at all.

00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:23.410
But I was siting
there, and I was

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.326
watching what was happening
in Port Au Prince.

00:19:25.326 --> 00:19:32.340
And my combat experiences
was still so recent.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.780
So as I was sitting there,
watching these images come

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.970
across the TV, it was just
like a second 9/11 moment.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.450
And this time I knew that
I had the opportunity

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:43.930
to really serve
and have an impact.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.950
And so together with
another Marine, actually

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.030
a college friend
of mine as well,

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.790
who is now a
Milwaukee firefighter,

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.700
we organized this
team of eight people.

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.866
And we got down to Port Au
Prince about four or five

00:19:56.866 --> 00:19:59.110
days after the earthquake
and didn't really know

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.700
what we were going to do,
didn't have a solid plan.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.090
The only map we had
going down I ripped off

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.320
the back of a Wall
Street Journal

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.350
on the flight to Miami
that had some arrows on it

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:15.560
about where supply depots
were inside Port Au Prince.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.100
I mean, it was
pretty rudimentary.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.534
And we didn't even
know how we were

00:20:21.534 --> 00:20:23.700
going to get from the
Dominican Republic into Haiti.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.116
We just knew that
we weren't going

00:20:25.116 --> 00:20:26.584
to figure that out
by Googling it.

00:20:26.584 --> 00:20:29.000
We'd have to get to Dominican
Republic to figure that out.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.124
So we end up getting there.

00:20:30.124 --> 00:20:32.460
And we cross the border
into Port Au Prince.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:37.140
And for the next three weeks,
we run medical triage clinics

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.530
all across the city.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:43.050
So we're setting up these mobile
clinics in the hardest hit

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:46.500
areas, going to places that
before the earthquake were

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.100
too dangerous for people to go.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.786
And after the
earthquake were-- most

00:20:50.786 --> 00:20:52.660
people assumed they were
even more dangerous.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.330
But in reality,
they really weren't.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.930
I mean, you had a population
that was desperate and shocked,

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:58.970
but they were also
in need of care.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.732
But after about
two weeks of this,

00:21:00.732 --> 00:21:02.190
William and I looked
at each other.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:03.731
And we just said,
you know, all we've

00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:05.800
been doing is using
counter insurgency

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.045
tactics to deliver
humanitarian aid.

00:21:09.045 --> 00:21:11.870
And that seems kind of
weird to think about.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.150
But it was the truth.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:14.890
These principles
that had been drilled

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.920
in us in the second half of the
Iraq War, how to, as they say,

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:22.890
win hearts and minds
to defeat the enemy,

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:26.180
things like working with
the local populations,

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:30.360
employing locals, winning trust
by engaging community leaders.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.020
And just these
things that we'd been

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.940
doing in these tribal villages
in Iraq and Afghanistan

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.982
was exactly what we were doing
in these rough areas of Port Au

00:21:37.982 --> 00:21:39.800
Prince.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.300
And so as we were thinking
about that, we said, OK.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.580
Let's see where
we can take this.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:53.141
You saw in Haiti just how broken
the disaster response industry

00:21:53.141 --> 00:21:53.640
is.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.642
It was slow.

00:21:54.642 --> 00:21:56.100
There was a lot of
great innovation

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.410
that came out of Port Au
Prince, but by and large,

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:03.950
a lot of these organizations
were ripe for being overhauled.

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:07.609
The tactics that they were
using were antiquated.

00:22:07.609 --> 00:22:08.400
And so we said, OK.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.850
Let's change disaster response.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.710
Let's build an
organization that is

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:15.380
capable of doing
this quicker, better,

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.770
more efficiently,
more transparently.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:20.740
And so we organized or we
incorporated Team Rubicon

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.740
when we got back.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.000
And our mission, as
we thought about it,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.220
was to change disaster
response by using the skills

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.490
and experiences of
military veterans.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.400
So we did that in 2010.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.020
We went to places like
Chile after the tsunami.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.000
We went to Pakistan after
the terrible flooding

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.500
there in Punjab
Providence in 2010.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:44.500
We did humanitarian missions
in South Sudan and Burma.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.650
And along the way, we kept
deploying these really

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:51.970
specialized troops, guys that
had been SEALs, or Recon,

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.285
or Rangers, that had
significant experience overseas.

00:22:54.285 --> 00:22:56.660
Because we were sending people
into some pretty dangerous

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:57.357
places.

00:22:57.357 --> 00:22:58.940
But they were all
coming back and they

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.481
were saying the same
thing, that this

00:23:00.481 --> 00:23:02.890
was the most incredible
opportunity they'd each

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.390
had since they took
off the uniform.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:07.186
They'd say, I never thought that
I'd feel this way ever again,

00:23:07.186 --> 00:23:09.060
that I'd ever use those
skills that I learned

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.390
in Ranger school, or
special forces school,

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:14.020
to help people again.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.590
And so we started
thinking about it.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:16.381
Wow, this powerful.

00:23:16.381 --> 00:23:18.990
And at the same time, we
had all these veterans

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:23.250
that had jobs in the
military that we didn't

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:28.710
have a use for overseas, people
that were maybe in bulk fuel

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:32.440
specialists, or water
sanitation, just jobs,

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.964
missile repairman, right?

00:23:34.964 --> 00:23:37.130
And we're like, we're not
firing Tomahawks anywhere,

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.870
so we don't need
you to go to Burma.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.310
We need a medic.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:44.870
So missile technician doesn't
really fit the mission profile.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.360
But it was obvious that
they needed an opportunity

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.640
to serve again.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.112
And we were hearing
from the people

00:23:50.112 --> 00:23:52.070
that we were deploying
that the opportunity was

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.265
in fact powerful.

00:23:54.265 --> 00:23:56.640
So we started to look at how
we could expand our programs

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.160
to get more veterans
more involved.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.630
And we started to look at
different opportunities

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:07.014
and the urgency of the
situation came home to roost.

00:24:07.014 --> 00:24:08.930
My sniper partner, and
one of my best friends,

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.220
committed suicide
in Houston, Texas.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.000
And he'd been with us in Haiti.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.970
His name was Clay Hunt.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.160
He was a great, great guy.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:22.270
And the thing I tell
people is that Clay, he

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.300
struggled with
post-traumatic stress.

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.530
He'd been wounded in combat.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:28.830
He'd been shot, actually,
by an enemy sniper.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:30.080
And so he struggled with that.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.820
But he was dealing with
his post-traumatic stress.

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:36.700
What was really causing him
anguish was the lack of purpose

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.310
that he had in his
post-military life.

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:45.280
And so when the dust
settled from his suicide,

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.740
we knew that that's
what we could do,

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:51.050
that we could provide--
we had to provide.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:52.050
It wasn't that we could.

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.155
We had to provide a mission
for these veterans that

00:24:55.155 --> 00:24:58.030
could provide that purpose
and that community for them.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:00.470
So shortly after Clay's
memorial service,

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:02.670
the Tuscaloosa tornado
happened, the first one.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:03.990
It was devastating.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:07.090
We had no idea what we would
do for a domestic operation.

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.510
We had no idea what the
mission profile might be.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:12.820
But we knew that, one,
there was a huge need.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.806
And we knew that, two, we were
adaptable and nimble enough

00:25:16.806 --> 00:25:18.555
to go down there and
find a way to plug in

00:25:18.555 --> 00:25:21.250
and at least do something,
and along the way

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.400
discover what that
mission profile might be.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.840
So we deployed, knocked
it out of the park.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.970
It happened to be the
same week that Osama bin

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.350
Laden was killed in Afghanistan.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.890
So I'm sitting there
with 20 guys and girls

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.400
around a campfire in
bumble fuck Alabama.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:42.570
I mean, this was like banjos
in the background Alabama,

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:45.060
at this hunting cabin
and drinking whisky.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.780
And we hear the word that
bin Laden's been killed.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.450
So it was a pretty
poignant moment

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:53.600
that actually
brought some closure,

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.500
I think, for a lot of
people to everything

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.500
that had been happening.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.780
I couldn't imagine a more
fitting setting for that news

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.976
to have been broken.

00:26:01.976 --> 00:26:03.600
So we launched this
domestic operation.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.270
And over the course of the
last now, see, 3 and 1/2 years,

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:11.440
that's become the
mainstay of Team Rubicon

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.410
So since that point in time, the
domestic program that we offer,

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:19.286
where we now have these 20,000
military veterans and civilians

00:26:19.286 --> 00:26:21.160
across the country
organized into 10 regions,

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:21.990
that's what we do.

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:26.702
We go into communities after
terrible crises have happened,

00:26:26.702 --> 00:26:28.660
whether it's a flood, or
tornado, or hurricane,

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.392
a wildfire, you name it,
some sort of calamity.

00:26:31.392 --> 00:26:33.100
And we're going to go
in there, and we're

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.683
going to help stabilize
that community

00:26:34.683 --> 00:26:36.960
and help get them back
on the road to recovery.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.380
And so you can
imagine that we bring

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:42.840
this-- we try to bring order
to that chaos that invariably

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:43.580
happens.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:47.150
We provide a bunch of different
functions, post-disaster.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:49.905
We go in, and we
collect information

00:26:49.905 --> 00:26:51.410
and create intelligence.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:55.009
We provide the command and
control that is often lacking.

00:26:55.009 --> 00:26:56.550
And then we deploy
a bunch of grunts.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:58.781
And we go in and we
kick down houses.

00:26:58.781 --> 00:27:00.030
And we pull them to the curve.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:03.940
And we help expediently
repair homes that need it,

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.860
that aren't going to
be catastrophic losses.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.910
And through this, through
this mission that's exciting,

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:12.100
that's meaningful,
that's needed,

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.350
we're able to provide that
purpose and that community.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.129
I mean, you see some
of these volunteers

00:27:16.129 --> 00:27:17.170
here with the gray shirt.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:21.940
The gray shirt has come to
symbolize this really powerful

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:26.060
ethos that we believe in,
the power of this purpose

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:27.380
that we can provide.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:31.620
And really as I look at what
the organization can become

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.780
over the next fie 10,
hopefully 100 years,

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:39.210
is that we can penetrate
down to the community level.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.830
And we can make
communities more resilient

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:45.360
by bringing leadership out
at the community level.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.350
And so that when crisis
happens in the future,

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:51.649
whether it's a single home
fire in a neighborhood,

00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:53.190
that when crisis
happens, that people

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.481
are looking to the military
veterans in their community

00:27:55.481 --> 00:27:56.860
to lead them through it.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.350
And we hope Team Rubicon
can play the role for them.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:00.180
We think we can.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.060
We think we're getting there.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.220
But that's really
the long term vision

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.770
that we're thinking about,
how can we get there?

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.100
And so along the way,
we've learned a lot.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.594
It's been a classic
entrepreneurial journey.

00:28:14.594 --> 00:28:16.010
I mean, we've had
fits and starts.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.440
We've made mistakes.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.510
We've hit some home runs.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:22.120
We've had dwindling
cash flows and had

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.635
to make really tough decisions,
hiring people, firing people.

00:28:25.635 --> 00:28:27.540
And it's been a challenge.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.499
I mentioned when I first
was talking about Iraq

00:28:29.499 --> 00:28:31.748
that I thought that I was a
good leader prior to Iraq.

00:28:31.748 --> 00:28:33.620
And I quickly learned
with one explosion

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.769
that I didn't know
shit about leadership.

00:28:35.769 --> 00:28:38.185
I left the Marine Corps thinking
that I was a good leader.

00:28:38.185 --> 00:28:40.500
And entrepreneurship slapped
me in the face and said,

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.060
you don't know shit
about leadership.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:46.150
And so, it's been another
journey over the last five

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:50.010
years as we approach in the
coming months our fifth year

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:50.570
anniversary.

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:53.750
But I think that some
of the lessons that

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.620
we've learned in building
Team Rubicon, I think,

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:57.370
can translate.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.411
I think they can transcend
just what we're doing.

00:28:59.411 --> 00:29:02.640
And that's what I tried
capturing in the book,

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.276
if anybody that's
read it thinks so.

00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:06.560
I'd be happy to hear that.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.920
But anyway, that's
what we're doing.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.225
I want to kind of open it
up to you then, I guess.

00:29:11.225 --> 00:29:13.350
BEN BUDDE: So such an honor
to have you here, Jake.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.974
And thanks, Rick,
for the introduction.

00:29:14.974 --> 00:29:16.060
It was just outstanding.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.440
A little bit on format, guys.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.170
So I'll ask Jake a
bunch of questions.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:20.628
And then we'll pass
around the mic.

00:29:20.628 --> 00:29:22.580
So start to think
about those as well.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.900
Jake, let's talk more
about disaster response.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.540
I'm super curious.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.070
I think you articulated
well the value

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:30.850
of what Team Rubicon
brings to the table

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:33.490
and what you guys
really represent.

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:35.750
But there's all
these other NGOs that

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.420
are working in the
disaster response world.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.330
How in the world
can you coordinate

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:45.190
to come to an effective solution
and collaborate together?

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:47.630
JAKE WOOD: Yeah, so
it's always a challenge.

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:51.480
Every disaster is unique for all
the reasons you might imagine.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.590
Every community's unique.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:55.280
Every disaster itself is unique.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.510
The resiliency of the
structures are unique.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:01.670
So each situation is
entirely different.

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:02.800
It's been a journey for us.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.150
When we first got into
the domestic space,

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:07.020
the domestic disaster
response space

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.950
is-- and
internationally as well.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.840
It's a bunch of large
legacy organizations.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.170
And it's a bit of a
good ol' boy club.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:17.370
A lot of these people have
been in disaster response

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:18.162
their entire lives.

00:30:18.162 --> 00:30:19.203
They all know each other.

00:30:19.203 --> 00:30:20.620
They show up in
Joplin, Missouri.

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.470
They're all shaking hands
across organizations

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:24.261
because they see each
other 10 times a year

00:30:24.261 --> 00:30:25.550
in 10 different cities.

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:28.414
And so when we were just
an upstart organization

00:30:28.414 --> 00:30:30.580
that nobody knew about,
nobody wanted to know about,

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.390
say in a situation
like Joplin, we

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:35.444
couldn't get a
seat at the table.

00:30:35.444 --> 00:30:37.360
So we would have to go
into these communities.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.800
And we would have to-- we
would try to coordinate.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.890
We had a lot of doors
shut in our face.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:44.390
So we would go out
of the community,

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:46.280
and we would try
to identify a need.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.140
And we would serve
that need with humility

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.700
and professionalism
until we got to the point

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.570
where fewer doors were
being shot in our face.

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:57.710
And at least some
conversations were happening.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:00.750
The real watershed moment
for us was Hurricane Sandy.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:02.920
We'd started to build a
reputation domestically

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.610
over about the year and a
half prior to that event.

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.640
We'd started to
build relationships

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.000
within the New York City
office of emergency management,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.300
specifically.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.190
So we were actually
pretty well poised

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:15.584
when that storm made landfall.

00:31:15.584 --> 00:31:17.250
We actually had
somebody staffing a desk

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:19.210
in that office when
it made landfall.

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:22.360
And so we were immediately a
part of the official response.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.200
And for us, that was one of
those moments in our startup

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.875
journey where we had a
dwindling cash reserve.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:32.640
A week prior Sandy
hitting, I remember

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:36.780
sitting down with our
accountant and saying, OK.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.810
OK, we got two or three
months of cash left.

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:42.440
What bills are we
going to stop paying?

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.070
Who can we stretch out?

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.170
What invoices can we ignore?

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.020
And started having
those discussions.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:52.170
So when Sandy happened,
massive event, massive

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:55.150
need, but massive
opportunity, if your business

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.181
is responding to disasters.

00:31:57.181 --> 00:31:59.180
So we knew we had to put
our chips on the table.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.480
Because we knew the world
was going to be watching.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.720
We knew that if
we went out there,

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.540
and we put all the
chips on the table,

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.130
and if we hit it
out of the park,

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:08.679
somebody was going to notice.

00:32:08.679 --> 00:32:10.470
And so like I said, we
are well-positioned,

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.220
because we were already
working with the OEM.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:17.140
But we put all our
chips out there.

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.009
We ended up having a lot of
really, really strong winds.

00:32:20.009 --> 00:32:22.425
And we've got some people that
were in Hurricane Sandy-- I

00:32:22.425 --> 00:32:25.180
guess yourself included--
that were there.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.220
And so after Sandy, we started
to get a seat at the table.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.570
People started to say, OK.

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:31.820
Well, veterans in disaster
response, that makes sense.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:32.770
OK, so tell us.

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:34.495
More and we started
to make some changes.

00:32:34.495 --> 00:32:36.370
We learned a lot of
great lessons after Sandy

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:39.150
as well that we were able
to implement in 2013.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:42.640
So now how it happens-- we've
gotten ourselves at the point

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.140
here at the end of 2014 where
all these other organizations

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:48.410
have allowed us this
seat at the table.

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:51.324
We are a voice that people
will listen to in the space.

00:32:51.324 --> 00:32:52.740
But what we also
learned was there

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.810
was a void in the national
framework of disaster

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.917
response at the NGO level.

00:32:57.917 --> 00:32:59.250
You have the American Red Cross.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:01.180
The question I always
get is, how do you guys

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.680
compete with the
American Red Cross?

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.230
Well, the answer is
simply, we don't.

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:07.040
The Red Cross provides mass
care and mass sheltering.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.139
So they go in they set up
these massive shelters.

00:33:11.139 --> 00:33:13.180
If a bunch of homes are
destroyed, they'll go in.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.300
They'll set up in a gymnasium.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.450
They'll put a bunch of cots out.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:18.074
They'll set up shower facilities
so that all the homeowners who

00:33:18.074 --> 00:33:20.560
no longer have a home to
go home to have a place

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.670
that they can lay their
head at night that's safe

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:24.440
and that they're going
to be well fed in.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.440
But the Red Cross isn't
going to go to your home

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.590
and take the tree that's
sticking out of your roof

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.710
where the water's pouring
into your living room.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:33.220
But nonetheless, you'll
have people standing

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.580
on their porch
saying, where's FEMA?

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.440
And where's the Red Cross?

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.648
And why aren't they getting
this tree out of my roof?

00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:39.510
Well, it's because
that's not what they do.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:41.530
And there's actually
not a whole lot

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:45.590
of national non-governmental
organizations that do that.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.310
Typically what happens is that's
neighbors helping neighbors

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:50.950
or it's contractors going
in and fleecing people.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:53.740
So if it's neighbors helping
neighbors, that's great.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:54.430
That's good.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:55.950
That's American
values right there.

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:58.440
But those people aren't going
to be bonded and insured.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.050
They're not necessarily going
to know the standard of work

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:04.240
that's going to be
needed to conduct it.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:10.830
There's no guarantee that,
again, not knowing standard,

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:12.880
that it's going to be
done the right way.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.719
So what we're able to
do from that function

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:19.440
is go in and provide a national
level of standardization

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.360
and command and control to
conduct those operations so

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:25.320
that we can stabilize
that homeowner

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.820
and make sure that they
are worried about dealing

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.412
with insurance, and claims, and
all of that, and not worried

00:34:30.412 --> 00:34:32.870
about the next thunderstorm
that's coming through and going

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:36.172
to dump two inches of rain
through the hole in their roof.

00:34:36.172 --> 00:34:37.880
So we can go in and
make sure that that's

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.364
stabilized for them.

00:34:39.364 --> 00:34:41.780
One of the other things that's
been really cool that we've

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.170
been able to do is bring--
because of, I think,

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:47.530
are two things, our
youth as an organization

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:49.757
but also the type of
people that we have in it.

00:34:49.757 --> 00:34:53.234
We have been able to
bring new technologies

00:34:53.234 --> 00:34:55.400
to bear in this that have
made some real differences

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:56.840
in disaster response.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.810
Anybody here know of
the company Palantir?

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:00.332
I mean, it's-- yeah so.

00:35:00.332 --> 00:35:02.540
If you're in tech, you
probably know who Palantir is.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.160
We've got a great philanthropic
relationship with Palantir.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.962
So we will go in,
and I mentioned

00:35:07.962 --> 00:35:09.670
that one of the
functions that we provide

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:13.060
is collecting information
and creating intelligence.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.560
And so you can imagine a
tornado rips through a town.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.890
And it takes out a half
mile swath for two miles.

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:21.870
And it rips up all these
homes and businesses.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:22.930
And it's destroyed.

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:27.010
Well, nobody really knows the
level of destruction early on.

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.800
And what organizations
typically will do

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.980
is they'll go deploy
these people out on foot.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.790
They've got these paper tablets.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:35.155
Every organization's working
off a different form,

00:35:35.155 --> 00:35:36.430
a different intake form.

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.372
And they put in this
information home by home.

00:35:38.372 --> 00:35:40.080
And they're on different
pieces of paper.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.060
And they go and they dump
these pieces of paper

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.460
somewhere at a command center.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.590
Lord knows what happens
to the information on it.

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.600
I doubt anybody's collating
it and making any sense of it.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.160
I think it's just
kind of a check

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.576
in the box for
some organizations.

00:35:52.576 --> 00:35:54.530
And it gets thrown into
the back of the room.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.590
And no actionable intelligence
is generated from that.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:58.589
Well, what we're doing
is working with Palantir.

00:35:58.589 --> 00:36:01.694
We have these mobile
phones that are loaded up

00:36:01.694 --> 00:36:04.110
with their software, the mobile
version of their software.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:05.840
We go house to house.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.760
We're able to put
all the information

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.559
in on a FEMA standardized form.

00:36:09.559 --> 00:36:10.850
That's, of course, cloud-based.

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:13.058
It's getting sucked up into
the cloud, sent back down

00:36:13.058 --> 00:36:15.260
to our technicians at our
forward operating base who

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:20.010
in real time are mapping out
the disaster as it's unfolding.

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.300
And so we can then create
an intelligence picture

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.920
that other organizations
can look at.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.810
And we can actually make
actionable, well-informed

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:28.820
decisions based off
of that information

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:29.830
that we're collecting.

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:32.230
Now the reason we're
able to do that is we

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.590
don't have any legacy
systems we have

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.440
to jettison in order to do it.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.550
And second, like I said, the
people that we have staffing

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:42.320
these positions, most
of them veterans,

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.990
come from the best equipped, the
most technologically advanced

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:47.780
military in the
history of the world.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.810
So whereas if you're a sniper
team on the battlefield

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:54.470
in Afghanistan and you want
to know what's going on,

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:55.610
you call in a drone.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:57.605
And you might have a
snazzy little tablet

00:36:57.605 --> 00:37:00.540
that you're looking
at a live feed of.

00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:04.000
We expect that same
level of technology

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.229
enabling in the disaster zone.

00:37:06.229 --> 00:37:07.270
So we're able to do that.

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:10.080
We're actively seeking out those
different types of technologies

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.289
and trying to implement them.

00:37:11.289 --> 00:37:12.871
And along the way,
what we're doing is

00:37:12.871 --> 00:37:14.060
we're changing the industry.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.680
Like Palantir, it's
probably why we're still

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.430
in a philanthropic
relationship with them.

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:20.250
It's probably going to make
a lot of money off the stuff

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.830
that we're pioneering in
this disaster response space.

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.320
And so if we can make some
of these technology platforms

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.350
ubiquitous across
organizations, then we've

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:30.220
done that part of changing
disaster response.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:33.220
Long winded answer to whatever
the hell your question was.

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:34.810
BEN BUDDE: No,
it's very cool what

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:37.180
you guys are doing to really
connect all these NGOs.

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.860
You mentioned Hurricane Sandy.

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:42.130
And yeah, I had the privilege to
go with some folks from Google

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.900
Veterans Network to
help volunteer there.

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.540
And I see some Google
vets in the crowd as well.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.050
I'm actually not sure why
we've had such a great turnout.

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:51.760
Is it your celebrity
status or is it

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.469
because we promised
all of our vets beer?

00:37:53.469 --> 00:37:54.968
JAKE WOOD: Yeah,
we're about-- yeah,

00:37:54.968 --> 00:37:56.820
we're standing in
between vets and beer.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.040
It's a dangerous position.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.690
BEN BUDDE: But I think for me,
I was able to see on the ground

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:03.110
the benefit that
the Team Rubicon

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:05.000
folks were able to provide.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.880
But it was just chaos
there, and just seeing

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.430
and walking the streets,
the aftermath of it.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:13.520
It was really moving
and impactful.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.570
And I did see signs
here and there,

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:18.330
even in New Jersey where
we were, that said,

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:20.090
looters will be shot on site.

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:22.020
I'm super curious,
as you guys have

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.030
done so many dozens
of missions worldwide,

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:28.370
how you evaluate the threat
and whether to deploy or not

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:30.920
from a physical
security standpoint.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.695
JAKE WOOD: Yeah,
it's interesting.

00:38:32.695 --> 00:38:34.570
The first time I ever
had a gun pointed at me

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:36.110
was not after I
joined the Marines.

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:39.475
It was before when I went
down to Hurricane Katrina.

00:38:39.475 --> 00:38:41.350
That was my first taste
in disaster response.

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:43.725
I just went down there on a
whim with a high school buddy

00:38:43.725 --> 00:38:48.040
and had a gun pulled on me by
a guy near the shores of Lake

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.940
Pontchartrain, because we had a
truck with out-of-state license

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.510
plates, right?

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.790
Damn Yankee license
plates, at that.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:59.430
And he pulled a gun on us, and
we got the hell out of there.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:01.220
But, it happens.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:05.050
I think that one of the
things that we can lean on

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.900
is we have a uniform
when we go out.

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:09.870
OK, so there's an instant
level of credibility

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:11.120
that comes with that.

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.040
But the moment a
homeowner learns

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.750
that it's a military
veteran-based organization,

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:17.610
there's an instant
level of trust.

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:22.999
You look at polls that show
different federal and US

00:39:22.999 --> 00:39:24.665
institutions and the
level of confidence

00:39:24.665 --> 00:39:26.520
that the public has
in then, obviously

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:30.730
the Congressional line
is trending downward,

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:32.000
if it's not rock bottom yet.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.310
But the one that's been
steady at about-- I'll make up

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:39.710
a number-- it's well over
80%, is the US military.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:43.164
And so listen, I served
with a lot of shady guys

00:39:43.164 --> 00:39:44.080
and a lot of assholes.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.621
But by and large
for whatever reason,

00:39:45.621 --> 00:39:47.630
we got a pretty
decent reputation.

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:50.540
And so when you walk up,
and you have a uniform on,

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.950
and you say hey,
we're Team Rubicon.

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:55.050
We're a veterans-based
organization.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:57.890
We're here to help for free.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.410
It disarms people.

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:02.490
And I will say, I mean,
some of these guys

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:05.420
have been on a lot more
missions than I have.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.990
You'll have people just
break down in tears instantly

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:09.542
with the thought
of veterans coming

00:40:09.542 --> 00:40:11.000
to help them in
their time of need.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.270
It's pretty powerful.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:13.250
It's pretty cool.

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.700
BEN BUDDE: That's awesome.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:14.730
And then when you're
on the ground,

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:17.200
there are some of these
areas, you don't have power.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.230
Or even getting food, water,
or a decent night's sleep,

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:22.105
I think, could
probably be a challenge

00:40:22.105 --> 00:40:23.230
for some of the volunteers.

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.271
And it's very different
from the day-to-day lives

00:40:25.271 --> 00:40:27.550
that we live every day.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:31.200
Can you talk a little bit about
how you think strategically

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.620
in that environment when
it's hard not to think like,

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.171
when am I just going to
get a pound cake or like--

00:40:36.171 --> 00:40:37.420
JAKE WOOD: A lemon pound cake.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.130
BEN BUDDE: Yeah.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:42.260
JAKE WOOD: So it's
funny you say that,

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:49.210
because we more often than
not will have members complain

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:52.290
that the deployment is too easy.

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:53.920
The first time I
heard that, I kid you

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.380
not, we were doing this
humanitarian intervention

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.555
in South Sudan.

00:40:58.555 --> 00:41:00.430
We were partnered with
an organization called

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:01.900
International Medical Corps.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.480
They've been around
since the '80s.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.092
There a fantastic organization.

00:41:05.092 --> 00:41:07.050
And they go into the
worst places in the world,

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:07.974
and, you know, big.

00:41:07.974 --> 00:41:10.390
It's a $100 million organization
based out of Los Angeles.

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:15.100
They wanted our
veterans to help them

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.420
in this refugee crisis that
was blowing up in South Sudan.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.670
and we were rotating teams
in, teams of five to eight

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:24.090
over the course of
about five months.

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:27.040
And I got a call from
the in-country director

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.730
from International Medical Corps
who said, your guys are crazy.

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:34.110
They got here, and they
literally gave up their cots

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:36.750
because they said--
they felt bad

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:39.550
that they were sleeping
on clots and complaining

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:42.770
and they weren't
sleeping in the mud.

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:44.920
So yeah, I mean,
Hurricane Sandy,

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.250
for anybody that was in New
York, you couldn't get fuel.

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:50.280
Water and power
were challenging.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:56.070
We were sleeping in a massive
unheated warehouse in Brooklyn

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:59.960
in the middle of winter with
another nor'easter coming in.

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:04.430
It was getting down to
in the 30s at night.

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:07.990
And we had people sleeping
on cots, nobody complaining.

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:12.272
And what it is is
it's that feeling

00:42:12.272 --> 00:42:13.480
that you're back in it again.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.502
And there's something
that's nostalgic about that.

00:42:16.502 --> 00:42:17.960
I think that the
men and women that

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.780
did that overseas, you never
stopped complaining about it

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:25.120
when you were sleeping
on a cot in Afghanistan

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.905
or on the ground in Afghanistan.

00:42:27.905 --> 00:42:29.530
You never stopped
complaining about it.

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:32.029
But you get out, and you like
to think about how awesome you

00:42:32.029 --> 00:42:33.860
used to be when you
were doing that.

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:37.270
And so we can kind of give these
people a taste of that again.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.850
But listen, I think
it's also something

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:44.060
we pride ourselves on.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.560
You'll hear organizations say,
oh, we're not going to go in.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.890
The hotel rooms
are all sold out.

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:50.056
We don't know where we're
going to sleep our people.

00:42:50.056 --> 00:42:51.440
It's like, come on.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:53.350
There's people in need.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:55.372
You're telling me you
would take a hotel room

00:42:55.372 --> 00:42:57.580
when there are people whose
homes have been destroyed

00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:58.830
and might need it?

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:01.622
I don't know if we've ever had
somebody stay in a hotel room

00:43:01.622 --> 00:43:03.080
in the history of
our organization.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.830
I don't know if we ever will.

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:06.955
I feel bad enough that I'm
sleeping in a hotel room

00:43:06.955 --> 00:43:07.485
tonight.

00:43:07.485 --> 00:43:09.610
BEN BUDDE: I think for the
benefit of the audience,

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:12.300
you know, Jake I had a couple
conversations in leading up

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:12.940
to this.

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:15.180
And I will say
that never once did

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.230
he talk about
himself or his book.

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:20.380
It was all about Team Rubicon.

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:24.680
And I'm so inspired by that
type of humble leadership.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.800
I'm curious for you
what inspires you today

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.110
and who inspires you.

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:32.915
JAKE WOOD: Oh man.

00:43:32.915 --> 00:43:36.814
You know, the stories-- if
you hang around Team Rubicon

00:43:36.814 --> 00:43:39.480
long enough, you'll hear stories
that are just so inspirational.

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:46.560
You know, part of the challenge
of this organization growing

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.720
and professionalizing
is that I've

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.450
started to get more and
more isolated up at the top.

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:56.560
And that's tough, because
when I joined the Marines,

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:58.340
I enlisted versus
going officer because I

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.420
wanted to be in the mud.

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:06.290
And that idea of kicking
in doors leadership

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:07.100
is what I wanted.

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.960
And that's what I had in Haiti.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.560
I was leading a small
team in Port Au Prince.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.317
And in Joplin, I was leading
a small team in Joplin.

00:44:14.317 --> 00:44:16.025
I haven't been on a
mission in two years.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:23.540
But I hear these stories
that come out of them.

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.430
And it's inspiring.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:30.600
We had a couple in Colorado.

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:34.350
We were responding to the
floods a year ago in Colorado.

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.540
And those were freakish.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.000
Those were 150 year floods.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.244
And we had a guy that
was medically retired

00:44:42.244 --> 00:44:43.910
from the Army for
post-traumatic stress.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:46.450
He has a crazy story
for what he was

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:50.930
doing with JASOC in
Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:52.930
He'd met a woman through
another organization

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:55.220
called Mission Continues.

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:57.600
And they had gotten engaged.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:59.940
But he was medically retired,
so he wasn't working.

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.340
And so he was able to
spend about two or three

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:05.240
weeks with our teams in
Colorado with his wife.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:11.930
And he was so inspired
by that mission.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:14.380
This was his first real
Team Rubicon experience.

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:15.910
He was so inspired
by the mission,

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:19.520
he felt so at home with the
people that he was with,

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:24.240
that they threw away
their wedding plans.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.010
They were six months
in the future.

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:29.300
They got married right there.

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:33.310
They got married by a TR
volunteer who was a chaplain.

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:34.980
All the witnesses
were TR people.

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:36.610
We set up in a
Home Depot parking

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:41.410
lot a chapel out of a
warehouse and buckets for pews.

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:43.380
And we had shovel bearers.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:44.870
And they got married.

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:46.680
And that sounds kind of hokey.

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.340
But when you think
about it, here's

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:50.660
a guy that I don't
think he ever thought

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.700
he'd feel that
sense of belonging

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:54.420
and brotherhood again like that.

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:59.109
And I watched that live
on Skype from London.

00:45:59.109 --> 00:46:00.150
I remember sitting there.

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.220
I got shushed by the
mother of the bride who

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:04.054
was also on Skype.

00:46:04.054 --> 00:46:06.010
I felt really bad about that.

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:08.740
But it was unbelievable.

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:16.080
And the thing that-- we used
to think about how we measure

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.880
our brand or how we measure
the power of the identity

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:19.870
a Team Rubicon.

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:22.420
And there's a lot of vanity
metrics that you could look at.

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:24.890
And sometimes they're exciting
like Facebook Likes and Twitter

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:25.389
followers.

00:46:25.389 --> 00:46:28.440
But the first time I saw
a Team Rubicon tattoo,

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.920
it was like, OK,
that's interesting.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.950
But person's probably a weirdo.

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:36.060
And this is a heavily tattooed
organization to begin with.

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:38.576
So I'm not sure it's that
weird or out of place.

00:46:38.576 --> 00:46:40.950
Then I saw another one, and
another one, and another one.

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:45.060
And we've got three dozen
people with TR tattoos.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:48.320
And I think that when you
evaluate whether you've

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:53.150
built something that really
matters-- whether it's Google,

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:58.010
whether it's Team Rubicon--
is if it went away overnight,

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:00.760
other than the people that are
financially dependent on it,

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.270
would anybody give a shit?

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:05.360
So we've got 28 employees
down in Los Angeles.

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:06.640
Obviously, they would
care, because they

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.640
have to pay their bills.

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:10.100
But would the other 20,000
care if Team Rubicon just

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.250
disappeared?

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:13.020
And it forced us to
really look at that

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:14.478
when we start seeing
these tattoos,

00:47:14.478 --> 00:47:15.620
and say, like, yeah, OK.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:16.550
Well, they've got tattoos.

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:18.758
So that would be awkward
for the rest of their lives.

00:47:18.758 --> 00:47:20.300
But I think we've
build something

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:24.050
that would leave a
void in people's lives

00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:26.450
that I don't know that
they could easily replace.

00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:29.150
And that's inspiring.

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:30.830
It's a lot of pressure.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:34.150
Now but it's inspiring.

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:36.310
It adds pressure, but it
also relieves pressure.

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:38.110
Because it indicates
that there are

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:40.740
people that are willing to
go to the ends of the world

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:44.660
to make this
organization succeed.

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.255
What we've built is
the product of-- now,

00:47:47.255 --> 00:47:49.380
I think we just last night,
because of this Concert

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.640
for Valor, eclipsed
20,000 volunteers.

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.310
And we've got 20,000 people
that will not let it fail.

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:58.597
So that's-- I guess that takes a
little bit of the pressure off.

00:47:58.597 --> 00:47:59.430
BEN BUDDE: For sure.

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:00.780
Congrats on the milestone.

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.480
Yeah, super inspiring story.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:08.410
I think there's this notion
of social entrepreneurship.

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:11.290
And I think you've
done an outstanding job

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:12.800
with Team Rubicon.

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.400
Can you talk a little
bit about just what

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.039
that means in the world
of social entrepreneurship

00:48:18.039 --> 00:48:19.580
and the connection
that you're having

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:22.540
with vets as they
transition out.

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:25.930
JAKE WOOD: Well, I think
entrepreneurship is changing.

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:27.430
There's a lot of
different companies

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:29.805
that have kind of turn the
model of what entrepreneurship

00:48:29.805 --> 00:48:31.060
can and should be on its head.

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.880
I mean, look a guy
like TOMS Shoes.

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:38.034
You've got Blake, the guy
that runs TOMS Shoes who just

00:48:38.034 --> 00:48:39.450
sold a controlling
interest in it.

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:41.750
So he's not doing
bad for himself.

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:44.280
I think the guy just had
a $300 million windfall.

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.520
But he's changed an
industry so that people

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:52.387
expect to see social good
come out of the corporations

00:48:52.387 --> 00:48:53.720
that they align themselves with.

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:55.560
So social
entrepreneurship I think

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:58.090
is changing, whether it's
a for-profit non-for-profit

00:48:58.090 --> 00:48:59.310
model.

00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:01.610
And we certainly, as we
look at the next three,

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:03.310
to five, or 10 years,
we want to get out

00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:04.750
of the begging for
money business.

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:07.740
We think that we can maintain
our nonprofit identity

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.370
and our service
identity and still

00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:12.390
monetize some of the
functions that we provide.

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:13.360
And we want to do that.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.250
We're trying to
move towards that.

00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:17.812
Because again, I
think that is going

00:49:17.812 --> 00:49:19.520
to be the next
expectation of nonprofits,

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.510
that they're not
begging for money,

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:25.430
that they're finding a way to
provide real value in the world

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:28.969
and make money off it
that can sustain them.

00:49:28.969 --> 00:49:30.260
So what's it mean for veterans?

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:33.390
I mean, you have 2 and
1/2 half million, roughly,

00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:35.510
veterans coming back from
Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:40.495
the majority of whom joined
the military at one of the most

00:49:40.495 --> 00:49:42.120
critical ages that
they'll deliver hit,

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:45.590
that 18 to
22-year-old age frame.

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:53.340
It's the transformative period
of so many of their lives.

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.370
And so they join at 18.

00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:57.520
They get a uniform.

00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.595
They get a job.

00:49:58.595 --> 00:49:59.470
They get an identity.

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:03.460
They get a mission that is
probably-- reasonable minds

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:06.880
could argue-- but one of the
more noble missions in life,

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.840
wear the uniform of your country
and fight for your country.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.210
And they do that for four,
six, eight, 10 years.

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:14.380
And they get out,
so many of them

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:18.260
became men, became women,
during that point in time

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:20.890
alongside other men and women
experiencing the same thing.

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:24.690
You rip them out of that, and
you might give them a job.

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:26.440
They might come and
work for Google.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:30.540
Maybe they're a
mechanic in Portland.

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:33.700
But does it have the
same sense of purpose

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:36.760
and does it bring with
them that same community?

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.930
There's a reason why all of
these Fortune 500 companies

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:42.870
have all these veterans
affinity groups.

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:44.612
You guys like each other.

00:50:44.612 --> 00:50:46.570
You want to be around
like-minded people again.

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:54.480
So I do think that
social entrepreneurship

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:59.220
and organizations like Team
Rubicon-- not just Team Rubicon

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:03.140
but like Team Rubicon-- can
really help fill that void.

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:07.270
I mean, I talk about it
as like a purpose cliff.

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:08.250
You're 24 years old.

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:09.791
You've bee in the
Army for six years.

00:51:09.791 --> 00:51:10.310
You get out.

00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:12.910
You've got a job, but
maybe it's menial.

00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:14.707
And you move back home.

00:51:14.707 --> 00:51:16.790
You're not with any of the
people you served with.

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:18.560
Your high school friends
have all moved on

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:21.890
or they have their
families, whatever it is.

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:24.420
Where are you going to
find your purpose in life?

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:27.690
Whether veteran or civilian,
having purpose in your life

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:29.320
is the key to happiness.

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.710
I think that the
challenge for veterans

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:34.100
is that they've had
such a purposeful life.

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:35.930
How do you maintain
that post-military?

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:37.740
That's the challenge,
because it's perhaps

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:41.250
the most purposeful life
that you could lead.

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:43.439
So you yank somebody
out of that at 25 years

00:51:43.439 --> 00:51:44.480
old-- that's a challenge.

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.620
And I think that there's an
opportunity for organizations

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:50.240
like Team Rubicon, like
Team Red, White &amp; Blue,

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.840
and some others in
the veteran space,

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.370
to come in and help fill
that and shepherd people

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:56.080
through that period
and transition

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.674
to the next period
of their life.

00:51:57.674 --> 00:51:58.840
BEN BUDDE: That's fantastic.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.540
And in the book, you talk about
this a little bit as well.

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:02.914
Something I loved
about the book,

00:52:02.914 --> 00:52:06.840
it wasn't just about history,
or your experience, or business.

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.680
It was really these common
trends across all of them.

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:12.310
I remember one
business story you

00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:19.675
were telling about a hedge fund,
a private equity manager-- just

00:52:19.675 --> 00:52:22.650
an extremely successful
man-- and he was thinking,

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:24.870
I think I just
want to quit my job

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:28.020
and just do something
more purposeful.

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:32.520
But in the end, your
message and lesson

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:35.420
from this decision
he was going through

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.290
was you don't actually
have to quit your job

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:41.452
and join a nonprofit full time
to have a purposeful life.

00:52:41.452 --> 00:52:42.160
JAKE WOOD: Right.

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.530
BEN BUDDE: Can you
talk about that?

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:48.150
Like, are the roles for
Googlers here and people outside

00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:51.114
of Team Rubicon to really
make that connection?

00:52:51.114 --> 00:52:52.030
JAKE WOOD: Absolutely.

00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:57.820
So this guy was one of our
first major private donors.

00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.997
And yeah, he's a great person.

00:53:00.997 --> 00:53:01.830
He's very religious.

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:05.380
He's tithed at least 10% of
his income for his entire life.

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:06.830
And this guy makes
a lot of money.

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:09.490
So he's given a lot
of it away every year.

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:11.690
And he went to his pastor--
he told me this story.

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:13.530
He went to his pastor, and he
said, I want to quit my job

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:14.696
and become a youth minister.

00:53:14.696 --> 00:53:16.260
His pastor said,
you're an idiot.

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:17.870
You're giving me a half
million dollars a year.

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:18.820
Leave it to the professionals.

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:20.210
You keep making money,
which the only thing

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:21.330
in the world that
you're good at.

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:23.590
And you keep giving it to me,
and we'll do good with it.

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:25.840
And he had to come to terms
with that was his purpose.

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:29.370
And he finds value in that.

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:35.710
I think that what I go on from
in the book from that story

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:39.070
is that you don't have to
rush off to Port Au Prince

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:43.222
to find purpose, or Joplin,
or any of these things.

00:53:43.222 --> 00:53:44.930
This shouldn't be
preaching about purpose

00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:46.920
and you have to go
and live as a pauper

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:50.270
and do good deeds for
the rest of your life.

00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:53.760
I imagine that working as a
nuclear tech on a submarine

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.970
and now helping a
company like Google

00:53:55.970 --> 00:54:00.670
reduce its energy footprint
in a period of time when

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:03.520
this whole climate change thing
is hanging over everyone's

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:07.740
heads, and people to probably
don't know that technology

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:12.400
companies have enormous
energy footprints.

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.640
That's purposeful.

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:18.520
There's an opportunity there to
find value and purpose in work,

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.480
even though it's for
a for-profit that's

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:24.040
publicly traded, that you're
probably making good money at.

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:27.136
There's absolutely purpose to
be derived from that mission.

00:54:27.136 --> 00:54:28.760
There's purpose to
be derived from just

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.030
working at Google in general.

00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:32.530
I mean, think about how
Google has changed the world.

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:34.450
One, I can win any bet
instantly because I

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:36.616
can Google any of the answers
that I think is right.

00:54:36.616 --> 00:54:38.940
But beyond that,
Google has contributed

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:42.300
to revolutions that are positive
in parts of the country the

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.830
never thought they'd see
things like democracy before.

00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:47.500
People that are
working at Twitter

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:50.310
can hang their hats
on the Arab Spring.

00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:53.647
And so I think people
just have to understand

00:54:53.647 --> 00:54:55.480
the value that they're
bringing in the world

00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:59.630
and see that through
the lens of purpose.

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:01.380
But if you can't find
it in your job-- say

00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:09.020
you work in a meaningless job in
a windowless basement cubicle,

00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:11.440
and you can't possibly
find it, you probably

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.560
should go coach a Little
League team or something

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:15.050
and get it somewhere.

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:16.145
I think it's important.

00:55:16.145 --> 00:55:16.936
BEN BUDDE: Awesome.

00:55:16.936 --> 00:55:18.610
Let's talk about
teams a little bit.

00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:20.700
It sounds like you're
part of some great ones,

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:26.456
really, as a collegiate athlete,
the Marine Corps, Team Rubicon.

00:55:26.456 --> 00:55:28.080
What do you think is
the common thread?

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.230
What makes a great team?

00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.910
JAKE WOOD: I think it's--
boy, there's a lot.

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:38.340
There's a lot to
get into in teams.

00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:41.620
I think, though, if you have a
vision that inspires everybody

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:44.230
on the team, that's
the most basic tenant.

00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:48.120
You have to have a vision
that everyone on that team

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:51.090
aspires to accomplishing.

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:53.920
I think we have that
at Team Rubicon.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.980
It's moved a little bit.

00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:58.150
It's changed.

00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.824
It's evolved.

00:55:58.824 --> 00:56:00.240
But at the end of
the day, I think

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.531
we have people that have
bought into the vision of what

00:56:02.531 --> 00:56:03.700
we're trying to do.

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:07.330
And so good teams
need great leaders.

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:08.977
Great teams require them.

00:56:08.977 --> 00:56:10.560
But at the end of
the day, that leader

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.920
is really only
there to articulate

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.350
that vision and that mission
and continue to put it out

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:17.725
in front of people's eyes so
they see it every single day

00:56:17.725 --> 00:56:20.160
and they're working and
aspiring towards it.

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:25.270
Other than that, get out of
the way and let the team do it.

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:29.549
So I think if I had to boil
it down into one thing,

00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:30.340
it would be vision.

00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.060
But there's a lot that
goes into building teams.

00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:33.200
I talk a lot about
it extensively

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.270
in one of the chapters.

00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:37.650
But I mean, the thing, when
I go and I talk to companies,

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:40.610
that I most often talk
about is building teams.

00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:42.130
So there's a lot
that goes into it.

00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:44.021
We don't have the
perfect recipe.

00:56:44.021 --> 00:56:45.020
We're still tweaking it.

00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:46.640
But I think we've
found a hell of a team.

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.765
BEN BUDDE: And getting the
right people on the bus.

00:56:48.765 --> 00:56:52.070
JAKE WOOD: Yeah, I mean Jim
Collins sold $20 billion copies

00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:55.750
of a book talking
about building teams.

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:56.480
So yeah.

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:57.396
BEN BUDDE: Absolutely.

00:56:57.396 --> 00:56:59.560
So I think we all have
stress in our day-to-day,

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:02.400
and you've certainly
seen your fair share.

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:05.250
I'm curious how you're
able to just kind of rise

00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:09.180
above and navigate the ambiguity
and really take command.

00:57:11.729 --> 00:57:14.270
JAKE WOOD: Man, you know, that's
what sniper school is really

00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:17.630
designed to drill out
of you is the ability

00:57:17.630 --> 00:57:20.530
to handle stress, rise above
stress, see things clearly.

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:25.800
One of the things
I talk about is--

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.870
I actually learned
prior to sniper school

00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:29.500
from my old football
coach at Wisconsin

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:30.958
who used to scream
it all the time.

00:57:30.958 --> 00:57:33.592
But he used to say,
control the controllables,

00:57:33.592 --> 00:57:35.300
which probably isn't
even proper English.

00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:35.930
I'm not sure.

00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:38.940
But he he'd say, control
the controllable.

00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:41.770
And he would say it in the
context of football games,

00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:44.070
where you were facing things
outside of your control,

00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:44.709
be it weather.

00:57:44.709 --> 00:57:46.000
I mean, we played at Wisconsin.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.666
We played in a lot
of bad weather games,

00:57:47.666 --> 00:57:50.310
whether rain, or snow, or sleet.

00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:52.540
It's easy for teams
or for players

00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:54.037
to dwell on those things.

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:55.120
Oh, man, it's raining out.

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.350
My cleats are going
to slide on the grass.

00:57:57.350 --> 00:57:59.350
The ball's going to be
slippery, all this stuff.

00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:01.266
Well, shit, if you spend
all your time worried

00:58:01.266 --> 00:58:02.690
about all those
things that-- you

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:04.710
can worry about that
till the cows come home.

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:06.020
You are not going
to change the fact

00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:07.395
that that ball's
going to be wet.

00:58:07.395 --> 00:58:10.690
So draining your mental
faculties on that

00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:12.970
instead of thinking
about, OK, so how are

00:58:12.970 --> 00:58:15.670
we can execute, because that's
something we can control.

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:18.090
How are we going to maintain
a positive attitude, all

00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:20.040
these other things.

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:25.420
I think not focusing
on the controllables

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:28.170
is the quickest way to
fall back into the fray.

00:58:28.170 --> 00:58:30.720
It's maybe not the key
to rising above it.

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:32.660
But it's the key to
falling back into it,

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:34.680
if you find yourself above it.

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:37.120
So I think that's
always critical.

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:40.560
I often find myself in
stressful situations,

00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:44.990
yelling at people to stop
worrying about those fringe

00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:47.360
concerns that are
beyond their control.

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:50.160
Because-- and this is
just my personal opinion--

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:54.890
I think that people, they
focus on those things

00:58:54.890 --> 00:58:59.760
when they're scared about the
entirety of the situation.

00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:03.220
And they kind of hide behind
those uncontrollables.

00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:05.430
People that really succeed
in ambiguous situations

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:07.980
are the people that just go
after and attack the things

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.100
that they can
actually influence.

00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.970
So that's one of the things
that, when I found myself

00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:17.240
in really bad situations,
and not just bad

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:23.780
situation like Afghanistan,
but bad situation in business.

00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:25.390
It's, hey, stop
worrying about that.

00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:28.350
Focus on, that is our
singular problem right now.

00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:30.320
All these other 10 things?

00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:31.510
Hey, they suck.

00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:32.480
That's our problem.

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:33.680
BEN BUDDE: And that's
the one we can control.

00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.930
JAKE WOOD: And that's the
one we can control, so focus

00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:36.940
everything on that.

00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:38.535
BEN BUDDE: Great advice.

00:59:38.535 --> 00:59:40.830
So I'll have one more
question here for Jake.

00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:42.330
Please start passing
around the mic,

00:59:42.330 --> 00:59:44.750
thinking about your questions.

00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:47.670
At Google, we're big on
moonshots and thinking 10x

00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:48.610
and what that like--

00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:51.110
JAKE WOOD: I thought you were
going to say moonshine, sorry.

00:59:51.110 --> 00:59:51.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:53.995
BEN BUDDE: We haven't gotten
into the moonshine business,

00:59:53.995 --> 00:59:58.610
but really thinking of what
that ideal solution is.

00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:03.350
And I'm curious, in
a world, hopefully,

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:06.780
in the future we can predict
or prevent to some extent

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:07.800
natural disasters.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:12.090
But until that happens,
what's the ideal kind

01:00:12.090 --> 01:00:16.529
of crisis and disaster response
world look like to you?

01:00:16.529 --> 01:00:17.945
You touched a
little bit about it,

01:00:17.945 --> 01:00:20.090
about engaging folks
from the community.

01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:24.855
I'm just curious what you think
10, 20 years down the line.

01:00:24.855 --> 01:00:26.980
JAKE WOOD: Well, the buzzword
in the industry right

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:28.230
now is resiliency.

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:30.130
And so that touches
on everything

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:33.230
from infrastructure
resiliency to community

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:36.990
and behavioral resiliency
after disasters.

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:39.090
Disasters, you can
call it moonshot.

01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:43.680
I don't think we're ever going
to find a way to prevents them.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.470
I just don't think
that's going to happen.

01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:47.150
I don't think even
Google could do that.

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:48.930
So they're going to happen.

01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:51.015
We shouldn't focus on
trying to stop them.

01:00:51.015 --> 01:00:52.265
Because that's uncontrollable.

01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:59.760
I truly think the greatest tool
in any disaster is leadership.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.540
Now preparedness is important,
but that requires leadership.

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:05.364
Action in the midst
of is important.

01:01:05.364 --> 01:01:06.780
You've got to have
all the tactics

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:07.940
and resources necessary.

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:10.740
But you've got to have
leadership to deploy them.

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:13.310
The recovery-- the immediate
recovery situation--

01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:17.370
is critical, setting up
the long term recovery.

01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:20.570
And it requires, again, good
plans, and good resources,

01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:23.230
and at the end of the
day requires leadership.

01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:26.130
So how do we make sure that
we're putting good leadership

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:27.942
in place in advance
of these things

01:01:27.942 --> 01:01:29.650
and that we have good
leadership in place

01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:31.260
to lead us through them?

01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:35.290
Not every military veteran's
a good leader, flat out.

01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:39.940
I served under a lot of terrible
leaders in the Marine Corps.

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:44.010
I was a bad leader at
times in the Marine Corps.

01:01:44.010 --> 01:01:46.897
So I'm not trying to
say that we should just

01:01:46.897 --> 01:01:48.980
find veterans and put them
in leadership positions

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:52.460
in order to lead us through
times of chaos after disasters.

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:55.750
But I do think that there are
very, very good leaders coming

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:58.590
out of the military, and
they're repopulating counties

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:01.080
and communities all
across the country.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:04.090
I think they're looking for
an opportunity like this.

01:02:04.090 --> 01:02:06.180
And I think we should
engage them to do it.

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.670
So I think, what's
the key to making

01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:12.710
us better at responding
to disasters?

01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:13.960
Yeah, resources are important.

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:14.793
Plans are important.

01:02:14.793 --> 01:02:16.280
All of that stuff is important.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.960
Without leadership,
none of them matter.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.600
So let's focus on leadership.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.510
That's what we're trying
to focus on anyway.

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:24.468
BEN BUDDE: Outstanding.

01:02:24.468 --> 01:02:27.880
And I think one thing I
love about you in your book

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.420
and even in your
talk today, you're

01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:32.000
so open and honest
about your failures.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.030
And you're ready
to learn from them.

01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:35.890
And you're super
transparent about that

01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:37.240
in your organization.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:40.200
And for me, my experience
of military leaders,

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:44.010
there's been great ones and
ones that could improve as well.

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:45.754
But I think there
is that potential,

01:02:45.754 --> 01:02:47.670
because that common
thread amongst all of them

01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:49.640
is like, we just want to learn.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.040
And we're OK to
fail along the way.

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:55.020
So let's go ahead and
pass the mic around.

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.760
Anyone have a question for Jake?

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:57.430
Please.

01:02:57.430 --> 01:03:00.320
AUDIENCE: I know a lot has
evolved over the last four

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:05.880
years, 4 and 1/2 years, since
you started Team Rubicon.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:09.700
But obviously you
have it perfected,

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:15.740
the natural disaster response
overall program as a whole

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:17.030
also.

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:18.040
What's next?

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.240
I mean, where do
you see Team Rubicon

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.960
in two years, five
years, 10 years.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:27.120
Or maybe a better question
would be, what's missing?

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.390
Maybe it's not even Team
Rubicon that fills that gap.

01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:32.250
Maybe it's grooming
another organization

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:35.971
or nonprofit to come
in, similar how--

01:03:35.971 --> 01:03:37.470
Team Rubicon, like
you said, removes

01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:39.260
that tree from the house.

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.320
That was a void that's
there for a long time.

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.110
And now that that
void is filled,

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:44.580
there are other voids I'm sure.

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:46.670
I'm curious if you've
identified them.

01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:49.220
JAKE WOOD: Yes, so, looking
out over the next five years,

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:53.810
we want to, I guess, kind of own
the life cycle of a disaster.

01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:56.330
So we are in the response
business right now.

01:03:56.330 --> 01:03:58.850
When bad things happen,
we go in and respond.

01:03:58.850 --> 01:04:02.399
Because of our mission, though,
of veteran reintegration,

01:04:02.399 --> 01:04:04.190
we know it's important
for the organization

01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:08.040
to be reaching out to and
meaningfully engaging veterans

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.220
in between disasters.

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:10.900
Because we can't
predict when they're

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.780
happening, with the duration,
or who could be involved.

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:16.180
So what we started to
implement this year

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.330
was a training program,
training pipelines,

01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:22.790
so we're engaging veterans
between in more of a readiness

01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:23.650
aspect.

01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:26.135
So this is a meaningful
way to engage our veterans.

01:04:26.135 --> 01:04:27.410
It's creating that community.

01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:29.200
It's helping them to
think about the mission.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.420
So it's providing
them that mission.

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:31.710
They really actually
feel like they're

01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:33.285
raising their right
hand to serve.

01:04:33.285 --> 01:04:35.430
It's making us,
of course, better.

01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:37.421
I think that as a
component of readiness,

01:04:37.421 --> 01:04:38.920
in addition to
training, we're going

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.086
to be looking at resiliency.

01:04:40.086 --> 01:04:45.350
We're looking at best in
class resiliency models.

01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:47.280
The one that we are
really in love with

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.884
is one based out
of Mira Loma here

01:04:48.884 --> 01:04:50.300
in San Francisco
that we're really

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:54.290
looking at how we can take that
framework and rubber stamp it

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:56.540
in cities and communities
across the country.

01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:00.160
So that's going to be an
important, I think, next phase.

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.870
The phase that I think is
exciting for a lot of people

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:05.380
to think about is that
third leg or that third part

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:08.755
of the wheel in a disaster's
life cycle, which is recovery.

01:05:08.755 --> 01:05:10.630
We don't do any long
term recovery right now.

01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:12.254
So we take that tree
out of that house.

01:05:12.254 --> 01:05:13.220
We'll patch it up.

01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:15.220
But we're not going
to repair the roof.

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:20.160
That requires real skills.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.360
I mean, you need
carpentry, roofing,

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.930
things that are
resource-intensive,

01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:26.890
certification-intensive,
things like that.

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:29.450
But it provides for
us an opportunity

01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:33.040
to have a long term engagement
with a certain portion

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.180
of our membership base.

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:35.650
It also provides
us an opportunity

01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:37.580
to get into an
employment aspect.

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:39.880
I think one of the tragedies
of the initial roll out

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:44.670
of the post 9/11 GI Bill
was it didn't allow veterans

01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:46.810
to take it and go
to trade schools.

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:49.420
It forced veterans into
four-year college programs.

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:50.270
It's since changed.

01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:54.335
But what that did was it sent
veterans who were probably not

01:05:54.335 --> 01:05:56.960
suited for college for a variety
of reasons-- not everybody is.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:59.320
I think it's one of the great
tragedies of our education

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:01.070
system that we try to
make everybody think

01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:02.903
they have to go to
college to be successful.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.120
So I think there's
a real opportunity

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:11.540
to engage transitioning
veterans in the trade crafts.

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:14.200
I think that we can
do that and do it

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.580
under the auspices of more
of a recovery battalion.

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:21.780
And so we can send in a response
team, stabilize a community,

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:23.860
and then we'll bring in
these men and women who

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:27.010
are learning real trade
skills to come in and get

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:29.310
a federal or state contract
to help with the long term

01:06:29.310 --> 01:06:32.700
six to 12 months recovery phase.

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:38.679
It's real meaningful
work opportunities,

01:06:38.679 --> 01:06:39.720
employment opportunities.

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.910
And hopefully we could
work with organizations

01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:45.710
to have employment transition
to full time careers afterwards.

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:49.406
But in my opinion, it solves
a couple of social issues.

01:06:49.406 --> 01:06:52.160
It addresses veterans'
unemployment, transition

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:56.490
training, but also this void
in real necessary trade skills

01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:57.940
that's happening
in this country.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:59.490
Aside from the
veteran issue, that's

01:06:59.490 --> 01:07:00.975
a real problem in this country.

01:07:00.975 --> 01:07:02.350
And we're not
going to tackle it.

01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:06.280
We're talking about maybe a
couple hundred, maybe 1,000

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.120
veterans a year.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.840
But I think it's more of
the philosophy behind it.

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.510
So that's, I guess,
an example of what

01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:15.232
we're looking at over
the next five years.

01:07:15.232 --> 01:07:19.440
AUDIENCE: So you touched on
briefly about the challenges

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:22.840
early on dealing with
more powerful NGOs

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:25.280
and getting a seat at the table.

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:31.290
And during Hurricane Sandy, that
was like your breaking point.

01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:34.450
Can you expand a little bit
about how your organization

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:38.140
overcame the large
barrier to entry

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:41.610
and became a respected NGO?

01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:43.310
JAKE WOOD: It's
is still journey.

01:07:43.310 --> 01:07:47.110
I think they were doing a
really good job of it now.

01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:54.380
But we had to treat every
opportunity, every disaster

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:55.880
that we responded
to prior to Sandy,

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.670
like it was our Super Bowl.

01:07:57.670 --> 01:08:02.090
And that meant going all
in on each one of them.

01:08:02.090 --> 01:08:07.130
That meant trying to be as
professional as possible and as

01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:08.407
humble as possible.

01:08:08.407 --> 01:08:10.490
So what we would do is
we'd walk into a community.

01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:13.090
We'd go into a community, and
we'd find the person in charge.

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:14.700
He would have no
idea who we are.

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:15.450
We'd walk up.

01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:19.013
Our incident leader would
walk up and say, hey.

01:08:19.013 --> 01:08:19.596
I'm Jake Wood.

01:08:19.596 --> 01:08:21.660
I'm from Team Rubicon.

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:23.010
Here's how many people I have.

01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:24.384
They're mostly
military veterans,

01:08:24.384 --> 01:08:27.160
which again, instantly at least,
OK, now they're intrigued.

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.520
They're going to listen to you.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.460
Here's what we can do for you.

01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:33.640
You could have us go take care
of this neighborhood over here.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.510
Or you can tell us
to go shovel shit.

01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:36.884
If you tell us to
go shovel shit,

01:08:36.884 --> 01:08:39.020
we'll be the best shit
shovelers you've ever seen.

01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:40.560
And we meant it.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.250
We would be willing to take on
any task that was given to us.

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:47.729
And most people,
once they found out

01:08:47.729 --> 01:08:52.420
that we had young,
strong, able-bodied vets,

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:55.120
chances are that it was a
police chief or a fire chief

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.189
that we were talking to.

01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:58.830
Good chance that person's
a vet his or herself.

01:08:58.830 --> 01:09:01.371
So there was that level
of familiarity there.

01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:02.870
We weren't just
another church group

01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:07.430
that was a bunch of 14-year-olds
led by a 24-year-old youth

01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:08.620
minister.

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:12.110
No calluses on anybody's hands,
never worked an honest day

01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:13.180
in their lives.

01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:14.889
So I think we were a
breath of fresh air.

01:09:14.889 --> 01:09:16.388
But that being said,
a lot of people

01:09:16.388 --> 01:09:18.350
still didn't want to
trust us at the beginning.

01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:21.240
You're talking about communities
that are very vulnerable.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.415
Looters are a problem
in these situations.

01:09:23.415 --> 01:09:25.290
People that are coming
in and scheming people

01:09:25.290 --> 01:09:27.880
with bad contracts
are a problem.

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:29.450
So it was challenging.

01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:33.609
But it was approaching
the industry

01:09:33.609 --> 01:09:35.597
with humility and
professionalism.

01:09:35.597 --> 01:09:37.180
And it's weird,
because I don't really

01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:40.080
consider us a
humble organization.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.630
Social media, we like to be
very boastful of what we do.

01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:44.410
I think we've towed
the line pretty well.

01:09:44.410 --> 01:09:46.910
But we're humble
when we need to be.

01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:48.670
Again, I think that
kind of comes back

01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:52.609
to a little bit of that
military tradition.

01:09:52.609 --> 01:09:55.552
I was a sergeant in the Marine
Corps, on the enlisted side.

01:09:55.552 --> 01:09:57.010
But every once in
a while, I'd have

01:09:57.010 --> 01:09:58.718
to go up the battalion
commander and sell

01:09:58.718 --> 01:10:00.267
a mission in Afghanistan.

01:10:00.267 --> 01:10:02.350
You have to know how to
walk up to somebody that's

01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:06.850
in a position of authority,
and be deferential, but also

01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:11.272
be strong in your conviction,
and able to articulate why.

01:10:11.272 --> 01:10:12.730
Here's why we need
to do something.

01:10:12.730 --> 01:10:14.540
And I'm not unique in
having that experience

01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:15.030
in the military.

01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:17.321
A lot of these young men and
women have the same thing.

01:10:17.321 --> 01:10:20.150
So I think that's
served us well.

01:10:20.150 --> 01:10:21.390
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jake.

01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:25.870
So one of the questions I
have is, as a former Marine ,

01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:29.120
we all know that "hurry up
and wait" is something--

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.580
it's just instilled in us.

01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:32.120
We're ready, ready to go.

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.460
And we're just sitting
around waiting.

01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:36.550
I've been involved
now for six months.

01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:38.520
And one of the
things I notice is

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:41.510
that there's not enough
natural disasters-- thank

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:43.540
God-- for all of
us to get deployed.

01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:45.970
And I know that
the organization's

01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:48.260
grow really, really fast.

01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:50.860
How fast do you see
it continuing to grow?

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:53.990
And are there any
programs that-- one

01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:58.090
of the things that I felt
very closely was I also

01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:01.050
had some friends that didn't
find their sense of purpose

01:11:01.050 --> 01:11:01.550
in life.

01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:02.350
I'm self-motivated.

01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:04.580
So for me, it was
easy to find something

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:06.840
I'll substitute
the corps within.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.920
And that camaraderie
was never substituted.

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.352
Now I feel that whenever I
engage with other veterans

01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:14.560
and volunteer at the hospital
or something like that.

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:15.900
I get a little bit of that back.

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:19.740
But is there plans to,
while people are waiting,

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:23.160
maybe engage the VA into--

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.285
JAKE WOOD: That disaster?

01:11:24.285 --> 01:11:24.826
AUDIENCE: No.

01:11:24.826 --> 01:11:25.560
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.060
JAKE WOOD: Sorry,
I couldn't resist.

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:28.060
Sorry.

01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:30.597
AUDIENCE: VA Palo Alto
and VA SF are incredible.

01:11:30.597 --> 01:11:31.680
JAKE WOOD: Yeah, they are.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.580
AUDIENCE: I do vouch for them,
because I tried VA in Atlanta

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:34.080
once.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:38.130
And that was like walking
into a Civil War Museum.

01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:42.010
But regardless of
that, just engaging

01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:45.850
some maybe psychologists
or professionals in therapy

01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:49.340
to actually engage the
groups and the teams

01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:51.800
and the people that are
joining in as the group

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.660
grows really fast
and we're sitting

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:56.680
around waiting for the next
possibility to volunteer.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:00.950
JAKE WOOD: Yes, so I'll
actually challenge your premise

01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:04.787
and say that there are
plenty of disasters happening

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:05.870
every day in this country.

01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:07.950
We currently don't have
the systems or capacity

01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:09.280
to respond to them.

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.180
So we aren't
currently constrained

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:14.030
by the number of disasters
that are taking place.

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:18.320
We're constrained by leadership
at the regional and state

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.300
levels, equipment, and
systems and process.

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:24.060
So what I mean by
that is there's

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:27.930
been a disaster
within 50 miles of us

01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:30.200
where we're sitting right
now that Team Rubicon didn't

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.960
respond to in the
last six months,

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:34.600
be it a wildfire, a
small flood that just

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:40.740
didn't make the "San Francisco
Chronicle," or a lost hiker.

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:47.760
And so what Team Rubicon needs
to do is engage leadership,

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:50.860
continue to engage leadership,
as low a level as possible.

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:53.830
That requires time, because it
requires systems and process

01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:55.290
in order to hold accountability.

01:12:55.290 --> 01:12:59.390
It requires standards to
hold people accountable to.

01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:01.430
And we're still
developing those things.

01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:02.580
I mean, you'll ask
some of the people who

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:04.000
have been around for a little
bit longer than others,

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.010
and we've come a long way
in the last 18 to 24 months.

01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:10.440
So the first thing I'll say
is that you'll be surprised,

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.710
I think, over the next 12 months
the disasters that you never

01:13:13.710 --> 01:13:15.950
realized were happening
in your own backyard.

01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:21.140
And you'll find yourself
responding to them.

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:24.580
I never knew that
disasters were happening,

01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.900
and now I get a threat
briefing every morning

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:30.910
when I wake up from
our planning section.

01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:32.497
So that's the first thing.

01:13:32.497 --> 01:13:34.080
I think what you'll
find is that there

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.757
are plenty of opportunities
of tragedy and crisis

01:13:36.757 --> 01:13:39.090
around the country, happening
every single day in states

01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:40.255
and communities all
across the country.

01:13:40.255 --> 01:13:41.960
The second thing is,
yeah, absolutely.

01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.490
And we are engaging
other organizations.

01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:45.948
We've got a great relationship
with Team Red, White &amp; Blue.

01:13:45.948 --> 01:13:47.430
There's a representative
back here.

01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:51.810
We think physical fitness is
a core pillar of preparation

01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:53.670
on a personal level.

01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:57.730
And obviously, we're deploying
people into, sometimes,

01:13:57.730 --> 01:13:59.510
more tough than
other situations,

01:13:59.510 --> 01:14:03.000
where physical fitness and
capability is important.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.810
I think there's
real value in that.

01:14:04.810 --> 01:14:06.930
We have a great relationship
with a mental health

01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:08.400
organization called
Give an Hour,

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.727
and we're placing Give an Hour
points of contacts or liaisons

01:14:11.727 --> 01:14:13.810
within each of the regions,
hopefully at the state

01:14:13.810 --> 01:14:16.080
level over the course
of the next 18 months,

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:19.760
depending on funding so
that we have that bridge.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.370
What we're doing is we're
deploying those mental health

01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:25.650
professionals alongside
our teams into communities.

01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:29.310
Kind of the the
stated objective there

01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:31.670
is that they are there for
the people whose lives have

01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:33.160
been devastated by the disaster.

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.415
But of course, if
our people want

01:14:35.415 --> 01:14:37.890
to bend their ear at the
end of the night, that's OK.

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:39.830
And in between missions as well.

01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:42.650
So we're big believers in
maintaining a core focus

01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:43.930
on what we're doing.

01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:45.900
You'll hear us up
at headquarters

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:47.690
say that "do what you do best.

01:14:47.690 --> 01:14:48.954
Partner for the rest."

01:14:48.954 --> 01:14:50.620
So we're not going
to get into designing

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:53.386
a bunch of programming that
isn't core to what we do.

01:14:53.386 --> 01:14:55.510
But we want to partner with
great organizations who

01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:57.760
can help fill that void, I
think Team Red, White &amp; Blue

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.680
being a great example.

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:00.405
Does that answer your question?

01:15:00.405 --> 01:15:02.626
AUDIENCE: I've another
growth question.

01:15:02.626 --> 01:15:04.250
So one of the challenges
here at Google

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:07.040
is how do we grow but also
stay very nimble, and creative,

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:10.890
and flexible, and running an
organization that prides itself

01:15:10.890 --> 01:15:13.694
on response time,
and where hours

01:15:13.694 --> 01:15:14.860
make such a huge difference.

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:17.140
How do you guys grow
but stay nimble?

01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:19.660
And then how do you
maybe leverage technology

01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:23.830
to kind of help get spun up
before a disaster strikes,

01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:26.802
whether through modeling
or things like that?

01:15:26.802 --> 01:15:28.760
JAKE WOOD: Yeah, I think
it's a great question.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:30.513
I'd love to turn
it around to some

01:15:30.513 --> 01:15:31.970
of the senior
executives at Google

01:15:31.970 --> 01:15:34.310
and ask how you
guys have done it.

01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:36.150
We battle that
question all the time.

01:15:36.150 --> 01:15:38.670
We have leaders within
our organization

01:15:38.670 --> 01:15:41.750
who have questioned
the direction

01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:43.530
the organization's
going at time.

01:15:43.530 --> 01:15:46.380
When we were going to
places like Joplin,

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:51.230
we were rushing in there, 15
guys, a couple of chainsaws,

01:15:51.230 --> 01:15:53.680
24 hours after that thing hit.

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.910
We'd stick around for
four, five, six, seven days

01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:58.940
before somebody kicked us
out, and then we'd go home.

01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:01.070
OK, well, we got there
and we prided ourselves

01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:03.030
on being there in 24 hours.

01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:07.040
Now it might take a 72 hours
to go to that same operation.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.900
The reason is we're liaising
with government officials.

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:13.625
We're making sure
that we've got--

01:16:13.625 --> 01:16:15.750
laying the groundwork for
a forward operating base.

01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:18.290
And we'll hear
criticisms from people

01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:19.790
saying, why are we
getting in there?

01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:23.020
Why aren't we getting in there?

01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:25.260
And how I'll respond
or how we will respond

01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:27.770
is that we're not looking
for speed for speed's sake.

01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:29.520
There's such a
thing as just simply

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.230
going after speed for
the sake of vanity.

01:16:31.230 --> 01:16:33.800
We're not going in the Joplin
to do search and rescue or life

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:34.465
safety operations.

01:16:34.465 --> 01:16:36.256
We're going in to
stabilize people's homes.

01:16:36.256 --> 01:16:38.780
And the difference
between 24 and 72 hours

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:40.260
is really negligible.

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:43.440
But the foundation that we're
able to lay over those 72 hours

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:46.160
allows us to stay for two,
three, four weeks instead

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.840
of two, three, four days.

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.740
And so when you
balance out, OK, what

01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:51.490
is the net good that
has come of this?

01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:53.860
OK, I think the 72
hours is still quick.

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.660
We're still bridging a
gap in that response.

01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:59.340
But that extra 48 hours
doesn't really matter.

01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:04.360
But it is a challenge.

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:07.850
I think what it requires
is in the military,

01:17:07.850 --> 01:17:09.840
you talk about the
strategic corporal, at least

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:10.940
in the Marine Corps.

01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:13.130
And the strategic
corporal was this concept

01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:15.250
that came out in the
mid '90s, General Krulak

01:17:15.250 --> 01:17:21.285
was talking with some pretty
high level of prescience

01:17:21.285 --> 01:17:24.790
that in some war in the future,
we'd have to rely on a corporal

01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:27.030
to make these critical
four block warfare

01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:29.992
decisions on the grounds
in some unforeseen country

01:17:29.992 --> 01:17:30.950
that we don't yet know.

01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:33.520
Well, fast forward 10 years
from when he said that,

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.320
and we're in Iraq,
and we're relying

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.486
on the strategic corporal
in the streets of Baghdad.

01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:42.890
So the reason why
that's important

01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:46.920
is because the
ability for a general

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:51.640
to trust a corporal, who's
probably 19 years old,

01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:53.390
maybe has a high school
diploma, certainly

01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:56.190
probably does not have a college
degree, the reason a four star

01:17:56.190 --> 01:17:59.110
general can trust that
19-year-old fire team

01:17:59.110 --> 01:18:01.960
leader with making a critical
decision that has implications

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:04.680
that are theater-wide,
whether to shoot that speeding

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.405
car coming at them,
whether to hand out

01:18:06.405 --> 01:18:10.640
$1,000 cash to some guy who
claims that a missile killed

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:14.960
his donkey, you have to
trust that they understand,

01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.732
one, the mission, the
method of getting there,

01:18:17.732 --> 01:18:19.690
and the importance of
every decision they make,

01:18:19.690 --> 01:18:22.724
and what the standard is
for success along the way.

01:18:22.724 --> 01:18:24.640
In the book, I talk about
commander's intent--

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:26.130
it's something that we
talk about all the time--

01:18:26.130 --> 01:18:28.920
articulating what we want to
see accomplish, what that end

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:30.810
state looks like,
then allowing people

01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:33.860
to accomplish it on their own,
with their own strategies,

01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:35.810
with their own tactics.

01:18:35.810 --> 01:18:37.240
That's what we're
working towards.

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.830
But what it requires is at
least a general framework

01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:41.730
for how we do everything.

01:18:41.730 --> 01:18:44.024
Once you have that loose
framework in place,

01:18:44.024 --> 01:18:45.440
some people call
that bureaucracy.

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:48.280
But listen, at the end
of day, bureaucracy

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:51.110
can either liberate you
or it can burden you down.

01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:53.120
If you use bureaucracy
to eliminate

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.290
the thinking or the decisions
that you shouldn't be spending

01:18:56.290 --> 01:18:59.160
time and mental energy
on, then it liberates you.

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:02.716
If you hide behind bureaucracy,
then it's burdening.

01:19:02.716 --> 01:19:04.590
So you can look at the
framework for decision

01:19:04.590 --> 01:19:05.790
making one of two ways.

01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:08.270
And it really depends on the
type of leaders that you are.

01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:09.305
So we're trying to
build a framework,

01:19:09.305 --> 01:19:10.763
and we're trying
to recruit leaders

01:19:10.763 --> 01:19:12.830
that use bureaucracy to
liberate their decision

01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:15.280
making versus something that
they're going to hide behind.

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.670
And if you're hiding behind
bureaucracy and process,

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:20.070
then you're probably not going
to last a whole long time

01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.736
in Team Rubicon.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:27.880
And technology's critical at
every layer of what we do.

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:31.610
We're bringing in some
really awesome technology.

01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:34.270
And we're in the
implementation phase for a lot

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.510
really, really
cool things, things

01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:39.985
like we've got this new
software platform that's

01:19:39.985 --> 01:19:40.900
a tracking tool.

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:43.320
And I mean it's
nothing groundbreaking.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.327
But it basically is allowing
us to dispatch guys and girls

01:19:46.327 --> 01:19:47.910
from across the
country to an incident

01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:50.800
and track them in real time as
they're getting to the rally

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:53.360
point, and making sure that
we have full accountability,

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:56.100
and able to see on a
battle map where everybody

01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:58.080
is at every single time.

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:01.240
And they instantly fall in
credential to their hierarchy.

01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:03.552
And it's pretty cool stuff.

01:20:03.552 --> 01:20:05.760
A couple of innovative fire
departments are using it.

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:07.520
But we're the first
nonprofit organization

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:09.640
to start adopting it.

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:13.160
And so what that allows you
to do is let people loose.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:15.940
Because I know that I can
just log onto my computer

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:17.640
and have instant accountability.

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.181
So that's one thing--
that's one less

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:21.310
thing that I have
to worry about.

01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:23.440
Technology, it's just critical.

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.470
It is.

01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:28.160
BEN BUDDE: Awesome,
well to wrap it up,

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.660
I want to say I'm so thankful
to have such an honorable guest

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.450
and a wonderful organization.

01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:35.170
So if you're part
of Team Rubicon,

01:20:35.170 --> 01:20:39.050
please do stand up now.

01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:41.700
We'd all love to thank you.

01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:45.950
What you guys do for our veteran
community and for our world

01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:48.320
is just simply unbelievable.

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:51.394
So please join me in welcoming
them with a round of applause.

01:20:51.394 --> 01:20:55.218
[APPLAUSE]

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.647
And to Jake, yeah.

01:20:59.647 --> 01:21:00.980
JAKE WOOD: Thanks for having me.

01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:02.230
BEN BUDDE: It's been an honor.

01:21:02.230 --> 01:21:02.880
It's awesome.

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:06.050
I will say, so "Take Command,"
Jake's new book, is out.

01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:08.690
We have 30 free copies, please.

01:21:08.690 --> 01:21:11.640
We can all dog pile
on the way to those.

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:15.480
After those 30 run out,
there's subsidized books here

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.320
that [INAUDIBLE]
has for you all.

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:20.410
So I'll leave the last words
of wisdom to you, Jake.

01:21:20.410 --> 01:21:21.030
Thanks again.

01:21:23.802 --> 01:21:25.760
JAKE WOOD: The Team
Rubicon people are probably

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:27.800
going to rush the bar
pretty soon, so the line--

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:28.970
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:28.970 --> 01:21:31.010
The line for the books
will be pretty short,

01:21:31.010 --> 01:21:33.060
just as you think
tactically about how

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:35.220
you want to do things.

01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:36.905
No, I really appreciate
the opportunity.

01:21:36.905 --> 01:21:39.280
I mean, to think that three
years ago I was the hung over

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:43.450
guy on a Delta fly trying to
pound out a grant proposal is

01:21:43.450 --> 01:21:46.190
pretty interesting,
actually, pretty timely.

01:21:46.190 --> 01:21:47.327
No, but it has been great.

01:21:47.327 --> 01:21:48.910
Google's been a great
partner of ours.

01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:53.550
And I really admire
Google for being

01:21:53.550 --> 01:21:55.470
innovative in the
veteran transition space

01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:57.450
before it was cool for
all these corporations

01:21:57.450 --> 01:21:59.840
to be in the veteran
transition space

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:01.820
as a corporate social
responsibility platform.

01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:03.985
I mean, Google has been
at it for a long time.

01:22:03.985 --> 01:22:05.110
I think that's pretty cool.

01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:07.485
I think it's something you
guys should hang your hats on.

01:22:07.485 --> 01:22:09.060
And on top of that,
Google is just

01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:11.506
a very responsible
company in society.

01:22:11.506 --> 01:22:12.880
And you guys should
all be really

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.320
proud and honored to work here.

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:18.180
I would be remiss if
I left without saying

01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:19.960
that as a nonprofit,
we are always

01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:23.080
looking for financial support.

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.830
We just got done
running a campaign that

01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:26.510
ended yesterday
called 11/11, trying

01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:30.720
to encourage people
to donate $11 a month.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:33.092
Don't want to be car salesman
up here, but if at the end

01:22:33.092 --> 01:22:35.050
the year you're looking
for a good organization

01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:37.420
to put your money
to work, we think

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:39.710
that we put it to work
as well as anybody else.

01:22:39.710 --> 01:22:42.220
So we'd love to
have your support.

01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:45.260
And more importantly we'd
love for you guys to sign up.

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:47.290
Because we are not
just exclusively

01:22:47.290 --> 01:22:48.290
a veterans organization.

01:22:48.290 --> 01:22:50.070
We have a ton of
civilians that work

01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:52.400
alongside our vets every day.

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:56.614
And they're a critical,
critical part to what we do.

01:22:56.614 --> 01:22:58.030
And you guys would
have to show up

01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:59.321
Palantir when you go out there.

01:22:59.321 --> 01:23:01.910
And I know there's probably
some jockeying and ego

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:03.790
thing that goes with that.

01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:06.895
They are definitely more geeky
than the people I've seen here.

01:23:06.895 --> 01:23:07.580
But that's it.

01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:07.880
BEN BUDDE: Awesome.

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:08.180
Thanks, Jake.

01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:09.380
I really appreciate it.

01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:12.730
[APPLAUSE]
