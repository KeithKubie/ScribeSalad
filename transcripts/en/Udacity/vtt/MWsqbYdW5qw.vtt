00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.580
So just to recall where we're at, we started out taking a look at

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.790
histograms of inter-tweet times in order to get a feel for the data.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.980
We observed that it seemed to follow an exponential distribution.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.270
Now as we recall the form of an exponential distribution is

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.720
the following expression.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.060
And so we did a maximum likelihood estimation fit for

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.970
this distribution to the observed data.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.260
But the problem is,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.780
how sure are we that the beta value we fit is the correct value?

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.599
And as we discovered, that confidence depends on the amount of data we have.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.230
And we found that we could quantify that uncertainty via Chebyshev's inequality.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.210
Which simply says that the absolute value of the deviation of our

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.050
estimate of beta from the actual value of beta, that the probability of

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.970
that being greater than epsilon is one over four n epsilon squared.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.330
But there's actually a tighter bound on this confidence interval

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.530
via something called Hoeffding's inequality.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.239
So Hoeffding's inequality is saying exactly the same sort of

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.320
statement about our estimate of the true beta parameter.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.390
It's just talking about the probability that our deviation from the true data

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.430
parameter is greater than epsilon, but the bound on it is a little bit better.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.290
Instead of one over four n epsilon squared,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.880
it uses two times e to the power of two n epsilon squared.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.740
A link to more about Hoeffding's Inequality is in the instructor's notes.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.280
But again, as you can see,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.330
the inequality depends on the amount of data that we've collected
