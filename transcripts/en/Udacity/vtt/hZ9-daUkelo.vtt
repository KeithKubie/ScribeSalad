00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.550
Here's another practice you can
use to help refine your pitch.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.560
Pretend you only have 60 seconds
to present your business.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.160
How would you organize your pitch
to provide the most impact within

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.830
this time limit?

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.880
With this much time, you can take
a slightly different approach and

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.340
expand a bit on some of the details.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.420
As a general rule,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.119
you can assume that you can get through
about 150 words in this 60 seconds.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.548
Try limiting yourself to these 150
words, then time how long it takes.

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:31.240
Adjust your pitch from there to
come up with your 60 second pitch.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.549
