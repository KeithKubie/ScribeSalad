00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.096
- [Instructor] So what I
would like to do in this video

00:00:02.096 --> 00:00:05.179
is graph the inequality negative 14 X

00:00:06.527 --> 00:00:09.194
minus seven Y is less than four.

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.205
Like always, I encourage
you to pause this video

00:00:12.205 --> 00:00:13.457
and see if you can graph it on your own

00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:16.298
before we work through it together.

00:00:16.298 --> 00:00:18.578
So the way that I like to do this

00:00:18.578 --> 00:00:23.194
is I like to isolate a Y on
one side of this inequality,

00:00:23.194 --> 00:00:25.864
and I'll do it on the left-hand side.

00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:27.426
So the first thing I want
to do is let's get rid

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:30.021
of this negative 14 X here on the left.

00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:32.784
So the best way to do that is to add 14 X,

00:00:32.784 --> 00:00:34.705
but if I do that to the left-hand side

00:00:34.705 --> 00:00:38.246
I also want to do that on
the right-hand side as well.

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:41.613
So I'm adding 14 X to both sides,

00:00:41.613 --> 00:00:44.493
and that leaves me with
these two cancel out.

00:00:44.493 --> 00:00:47.645
On the left-hand side I
have negative seven Y,

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:52.043
and that's going to be less
than, I have 14 X plus four,

00:00:52.043 --> 00:00:54.035
or four plus 14 X.

00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:55.285
14 X plus four.

00:00:57.401 --> 00:01:01.779
And now I want to divide
both sides by negative seven

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:03.908
in order to isolate this Y.

00:01:03.908 --> 00:01:06.377
But we have to be very,
very, very careful.

00:01:06.377 --> 00:01:09.986
When you multiply or divide
both sides of an inequality

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:13.576
by a negative number,
you need to swap this,

00:01:13.576 --> 00:01:15.680
you need to swap the inequality sign.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.853
Instead of it being less than,

00:01:16.853 --> 00:01:18.562
it would have to become greater than.

00:01:18.562 --> 00:01:22.121
So if you divide both
sides by negative seven,

00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:26.121
you are going to be left
with Y is greater than,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.052
let me do that in a different color

00:01:28.052 --> 00:01:29.998
just to highlight that
I'm swapping this around.

00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:34.165
Y is gonna be greater than
14 divided by negative seven

00:01:35.951 --> 00:01:37.451
is negative two X.

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:42.234
And then four divided by negative seven,

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:45.234
well that's negative 4/7.

00:01:47.018 --> 00:01:49.439
And now I'm ready to graph this.

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.843
And the way that I would graph this,

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:55.010
I would graph Y is equal to
negative two X minus 4/7.

00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:00.750
But since we're not greater
than or equal to it,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.517
I would put a dotted line there

00:02:02.517 --> 00:02:04.595
and just shade everything above that.

00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:07.289
But let me just do what I'm talking about.

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:09.789
So let me draw some axes here.

00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:14.005
So this is gonna be an
approximation obviously.

00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:17.638
This is a hand-drawn graph
that we're dealing with.

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:20.638
So it's like that, that's my x-axis.

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:24.667
And let's see, our
y-intercept is negative 4/7,

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:26.591
which is a little bit more than 1/2.

00:02:26.591 --> 00:02:29.892
So let's say that this right over here is,

00:02:29.892 --> 00:02:32.631
let's say this right over here is one,

00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:34.172
or negative one, I should say.

00:02:34.172 --> 00:02:36.151
Actually, I think I'm
gonna have to put my axis

00:02:36.151 --> 00:02:38.036
a little bit higher.

00:02:38.036 --> 00:02:40.064
Let's do it like this.

00:02:40.064 --> 00:02:41.509
So that is X.

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:43.818
Let's make this negative one.

00:02:43.818 --> 00:02:46.960
And then that's about negative two.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.675
And so this would be one,

00:02:49.675 --> 00:02:53.092
and then this is going to be right about,

00:02:54.093 --> 00:02:58.260
this is about one, and then
we have two right over there.

00:02:59.551 --> 00:03:03.086
So we look at our y-intercept, when X is,

00:03:03.086 --> 00:03:05.217
so let's just think
about what would we have

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:06.755
if we're thinking about Y is equal

00:03:06.755 --> 00:03:10.639
to negative two X minus 4/7.

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:15.143
Well our y-intercept right over
here would be negative 4/7,

00:03:15.143 --> 00:03:17.981
which is a little bit more than 1/2,

00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:21.028
so it'll be roughly right around there.

00:03:21.028 --> 00:03:24.513
And then we have a slope of negative two.

00:03:24.513 --> 00:03:27.187
We have a slope of negative two.

00:03:27.187 --> 00:03:29.354
So if you increase by one,

00:03:30.738 --> 00:03:34.235
you are going to decrease by two.

00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:36.932
So you're gonna decrease,
you're not gonna just go there,

00:03:36.932 --> 00:03:39.979
you're gonna go right around there.

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.146
So you're gonna go right around there.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.319
And I'm gonna get my ruler tool out

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.973
so I can actually draw that.

00:03:48.973 --> 00:03:53.327
So I'll connect these two
dots with my ruler tool.

00:03:53.327 --> 00:03:55.614
Now remember, I'm not just
trying to graph Y equals,

00:03:55.614 --> 00:03:57.935
and in fact, this isn't
greater than or equal.

00:03:57.935 --> 00:03:59.800
It's just strictly greater than.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.824
So let me draw a dotted line there

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:04.415
to show that I'm actually not
going to include the graph

00:04:04.415 --> 00:04:08.258
where Y equals negative two X minus 4/7.

00:04:08.258 --> 00:04:11.067
So let me do that dotted line.

00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:12.696
Dotted line right over there.

00:04:12.696 --> 00:04:16.205
Show that I'm not, it's
not going to equal to that.

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:20.633
It's all the Y's for any X
that are greater than that.

00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:23.757
My spacing is getting a little sloppy.

00:04:23.757 --> 00:04:26.281
So that does the job.

00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:27.114
There you go.

00:04:27.114 --> 00:04:29.167
So that would be the line Y is equal

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:33.347
to negative two X minus
4/7, but I dotted lined it

00:04:33.347 --> 00:04:35.135
because this isn't
greater than or equal to.

00:04:35.135 --> 00:04:36.986
If it was greater than or
equal to I would fill it in,

00:04:36.986 --> 00:04:39.291
but it's greater than to show
that we don't include the line

00:04:39.291 --> 00:04:41.021
but we want all of the region,

00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:43.805
all of the area above the line.

00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:45.805
So let me shade that in.

00:04:46.843 --> 00:04:49.775
So that's gonna be all of this,

00:04:49.775 --> 00:04:53.942
actually I can shade it in with
a nice, big, juicy shading,

00:04:54.993 --> 00:04:56.641
get the right tool out.

00:04:56.641 --> 00:04:57.885
Alright, here we go.

00:04:57.885 --> 00:05:02.569
So it would be all of
this area right over here,

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.472
would be what I would actually shade in.

00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:05.791
So once again, I don't include the line.

00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:08.442
I include everything above the line.

00:05:08.442 --> 00:05:09.692
And I am done.
