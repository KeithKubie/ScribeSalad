00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.130
SUBJECT 1: At first,
when we were kids,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.730
we've always wanted to help
other people in our own way

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.030
and to do something
that is rewarding.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.760
SUBJECT 2: It was sort of
a simple decision for us.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.910
We just know that we're
passionate in what we do.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.219
And what we're good at is
being compassionate to others.

00:00:22.219 --> 00:00:24.510
SUBJECT 1: I think the biggest
challenge of being twins

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.990
is assuming that
we're always the same.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.880
But actually, that's not
really the case 100%.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.300
SUBJECT 2: As we grew
up, we found our way.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.360
And we found what
our differences are.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.630
And people usually
also pick up on that.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.340
SUBJECT 1: Now that we're
graduating from our doctorate

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.790
degree, we hope to be able to
work as nurse practitioners.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.520
SUBJECT 2: And
whatever challenge

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.540
that comes in your
way, you will always

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.570
have the say in how
you end your day

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.780
and give back to people
that also supported you.
