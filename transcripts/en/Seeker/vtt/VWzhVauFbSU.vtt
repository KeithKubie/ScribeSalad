00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.819
Ernest Hemingway, Vincent Van Gogh, Amy Winehouse-
the idea of the tortured artist is as old

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:05.819
as art itself.

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:15.080
But is there a link between mental illness
and creativity?

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.710
Plato once said on the subject that he found
joy in such pain and to treat it as a gift:

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.189
“Madness, provided it comes as the gift
of heaven, is the channel by which we receive

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.749
the greatest blessings…

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:27.720
Madness comes from God, whereas sober sense
is merely human.”

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.699
There’s no shortage of myths and stories
of artists brooding moodily in front of a

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.640
canvass, musicians turning to the bottle for
comfort, or writers ending their own lives.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.800
One landmark study by Neuroscientist Nancy
Andreasen in 1987 showed a link between creativity

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.160
and mental illness.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.579
Her research found that of the 30 writers
she interviewed, most, 80%, had been hospitalized

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.500
for some mood disorder like bipolar or depression.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.090
Some studies find a higher incidence of mental
disorders in those in creative fields and

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.829
especially in those individuals who’ve reached
some notoriety or eminence.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.100
Other studies find a higher incidence of mental
disorders in the family members of very creative

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.100
people.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.089
These results strongly hint at a genetic link.

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.540
Maybe it's not just genetic but neurological
too.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.110
Some studies show that the brain acts in similar
ways when being creative and when mentally

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.110
ill.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.180
One study published in the journal Neuroimage
found that a center of the brain, the precuneus,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.240
that is normally deactivated when thinking,
remains active when creative people are thinking

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.240
creatively.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.979
The precuneus has been linked in previous
studies to things like imagining the self

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.460
and retrieving memories.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.290
Using MRI techniques, they found that the
precuneus is typically deactivated when focusing

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.310
on cognitive tasks.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.899
But those that were unable to suppress this
part of the brain were linked with more original

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:34.899
ideas.

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.670
They also found that a similar thing happened
in the brain of people who scored high on

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.600
schizotypy, a less intense version of schizophrenia.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.100
Basically when you are trying to focus on
something you tune out everything around you,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.810
but not creative people.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.509
According to one study published in the journal
Cognitive, Affective, &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.890
“more-creative people may include many more
events/stimuli in their mental processes than

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.170
do less creative people.”

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.409
But how does mental illness mean more creative
thoughts?

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.380
Well maybe it has to do with free association
which can be defined as the spontaneous and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.790
undirected association of ideas, emotions,
and feelings.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.450
Sometimes free association in the unconscious
mind could lead to strange and bizarre links.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.060
Which isn’t a bad thing.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.360
This very process can spark novel ideas.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.650
Einstein called it “combinatory play”.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.410
Like coming up with a new formula for gravity
or a great metaphor.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.560
But sometimes the ideas are a little too far
out there and can delve into the truly delusional.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.890
Famous mathematical genius John Nash said
“the ideas I have about supernatural beings

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.900
came to me the same way that my mathematical
ideas did, so I took them seriously.”

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.600
It’s almost like creativity and madness
are on a spectrum.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.459
With creativity somewhere in the middle and
delusion and madness on the other end.

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.400
While considering more possibilities certainly
leads to greater creativity, so does dwelling

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.610
on a single problem.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.530
One of the hallmarks of depression is neurotic
thinking.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.180
Neurotic thinking can be focusing on negative
thoughts and feelings and constantly ruminating

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.180
on things past.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.209
For instance if you’re like me you still
remember that one time when you waved back

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.819
at someone when they were really waving at
the person behind you.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.639
That scene replays in my head over and over.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.470
( don’t wave, just don’t wave.. oh god
you waved)

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.019
But this rehashing can have an up side, according
to a study published in the journal Trends

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.620
in Cognitive Sciences.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.450
Rumination means focusing on a problem for
longer than most people would.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.110
By dwelling on the same problem, sometimes
single-mindedly, these types of people would

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.040
eventually come up with an interesting solution.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.739
And it’s not just the pursuit of a single
problem, but neurotic people might be more

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.220
creative too.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.129
Mostly because neurotic people are highly
anxious.

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.390
You know, in preparation for a threat they
literally imagine the worst.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.319
Like when your mom doesn’t text you back
you imagine something bad must have happened

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.959
like a car accident or she’s in a hold up
at the bank.

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.739
This penchant for dramatic imaginings might
help creative people imagine solutions most

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:34.739
people wouldn’t.

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.340
While the idea of the mad genius might be
alluring and seductive, it shouldn’t be.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.010
Like Nancy Andreasen highlighted, these people
like Kurt Vonnegut and others were successful

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.000
not because of their mental illness, but in
spite of it.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.250
It’s hard to work when you’re depressed
or manic.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.930
Many creative types find themselves disabled
by their disorders just as often as they are

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.299
inspired by it.

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.360
Speaking of signs of creativity, are you a
um… messy person?

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.280
Turns out you’re more than just disorganized,
you’re probably creative!

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:19.549
Anthony explains the research in this great
episode, right here.
