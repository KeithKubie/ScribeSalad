[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.207 --> 00:00:08.790
LAURENCE MORONEY: So Su, you've
been a Googler for five years.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.450
SU FU: Mhm, yes.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: Working
as a software engineer.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:11.380
SU FU: Yes.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: Can
you tell us all about it?

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.110
SU FU: Sure.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.220
I joined Google
about five years ago.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.490
So I started from Android.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.640
I'd been working on
Android Hangouts, and then

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.980
Android Messages.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.620
And it's been very
challenging and rewarding,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.740
since there are
hundreds of millions

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.392
of people can use the
feature that you're building.

00:00:28.392 --> 00:00:30.600
LAURENCE MORONEY: Android
Hangouts and Messages, wow!

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.485
So you've really been hitting
lots and lots of users.

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:35.360
SU FU: I hope so.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.640
Yeah.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.260
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.760
And then from that,
now you've moved

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.050
on to services infrastructure?

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.021
Could you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:41.520
SU FU: Yes.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.280
So I joined the service
infrastructure team

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.590
about a year ago.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.010
It's been exciting,
and quite challenging

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.220
as well, since it's unlike
Android applications.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.250
Service infrastructure
is a little more hidden,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.120
that the end customers--

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.120
service producers may
not even meet them,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.540
or interact with them.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.220
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So what exactly

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.000
is services infrastructure?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.405
If I am, like, a developer,
how do I interface with it,

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:12.280
or how do I use it?

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.860
Or--

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.360
SU FU: Sure.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.860
Yes.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.640
So service infrastructure is
Google's foundational service

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.660
platform that Google uses
to build our own APIs

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.930
and services.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.980
Now, as an external
service producer,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.970
you can utilize our Google
service infrastructure

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.385
to manage your own APIs and
also publish your services.

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:34.260
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.790
So if I'm a developer
and I'm building

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.340
some kind of application, and
I want to use Google services,

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.020
there's so many
good ones, right?

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.750
How would I go about getting
started using them on service

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.840
infrastructure platform?

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.340
SU FU: Yes.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.620
So you can use
service infrastructure

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.595
through cloud endpoints.

00:01:48.595 --> 00:01:49.470
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.080
SU FU: So basically you can--

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.450
so cloud endpoint is the
API management platform

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.470
in that shell.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.080
And then you can--

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.440
it can help you create,
deploy, monitor,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.350
protect your APIs and services.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.660
All you have to do
is-- you can write

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.810
your API and your services in
any language or any framework,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.660
but you need to also write a
service configuration, which

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.290
may have a service name, title,
RPC API definitions, and also

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.370
how your service may behave.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.100
For example, for each user,
what is the quota limit for it?

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.260
Or what kind of
API metrics do you

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.350
want to gather for your APIs?

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.390
And then you just push
that service configuration

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.192
to the service infrastructure,
and we do all the work for you.

00:02:42.192 --> 00:02:43.150
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.350
SU FU: So during
runtime, your service

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.670
may have API calls to the
service infrastructure

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.470
for pre-condition checks.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.580
For example, whether this
user calling your service

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.925
has enough quota limits
to call the service.

00:02:58.925 --> 00:03:00.050
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, nice.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.550
SU FU: Yes.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.712
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:03:01.712 --> 00:03:03.420
And then the details
of creating all this

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.336
are in the documentation,
and we'll put a link

00:03:05.336 --> 00:03:07.230
to that in the comments below.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.560
But also, isn't it-- like, if I
want to consume existing Google

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.130
services-- like maybe
translation, or Maps,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.130
or something like that--

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.841
that's all run by the services
infrastructure team, too.

00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:17.340
SU FU: Yes.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.690
So basically the
service infrastructure

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.660
is used for almost all Google
internal services and APIs.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.320
So all these-- like Maps
APIs, or translation APIs--

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.250
are built--

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.560
I mean, are managed
and published

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.780
using our service
infrastructure, which

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.000
is also One Platform, the
T-shirt that I'm wearing.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.180
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.470
Yes, nice green T-shirt.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.493
I thought it was Android, but
now I see it's One Platform.

00:03:42.493 --> 00:03:44.909
[CHUCKLING] Good thing we're
not filming on a green screen

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.121
today.

00:03:47.121 --> 00:03:48.870
So that's one of the
things that I thought

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.850
was really neat about
this, was that the things

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.460
that we do for managing,
scalability, and quota, and all

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.380
of that for our
services are also

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.350
available for your
services as a developer.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.850
SU FU: Yeah.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:58.560
Exactly.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.760
Like monitoring, logging,
authentication, billing,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.800
and quota management.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.820
All those things is
what we're providing

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.180
to the service producers.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.180
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
what's it like, day to day,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.490
being a software
engineer on all of this?

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.990
SU FU: I mean--

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.490
so for this new project--

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.170
or I mean, for the
service infrastructure,

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.680
so that end users will see
the end-to-end experience.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.402
It's awesome.

00:04:22.402 --> 00:04:23.360
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.410
And now, outside of doing
software engineering,

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.910
you also have a 20% project
working with the TensorFlow

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:28.530
team, right?

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.029
SU FU: Yes.

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:31.980
Thank you, Laurence, for
presenting this experience

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.910
to me and opportunity to me,
to work on this new YouTube

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.621
channel, Coding TensorFlow.

00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:39.120
Yes.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.860
So I'm very passionate
about AI, and also Google

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.162
has this amazing AI platform,
TensorFlow framework, for--

00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:49.620
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I've heard of it.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.120
I have.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.360
SU FU: Yes.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.280
So that everyone can--

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.590
I mean, everyone can use AI
and use their imagination

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.800
and build their own things,
and their own applications.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.690
And I really want to promote
this in the Chinese market.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.521
China has a big
market in AI as well.

00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:11.270
LAURENCE MORONEY: I
mean, with AI becoming

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.030
such an emergent thing,
not just as a technology,

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.340
but also as a new tool
for software developers,

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.871
and with so many software
developers in China,

00:05:18.871 --> 00:05:21.120
that it's really nice to be
able to reach out to them.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.302
And what's your
experience been like?

00:05:23.302 --> 00:05:25.010
Have you had feedback
from developers who

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.520
have been watching your videos?

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.020
SU FU: Yeah.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.630
They're surprised because I am
a "software engineer" at Google,

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.930
but I also do this advocate
thing for TensorFlow.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.380
I think the interesting
idea is, Google really

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.060
provides this culture that
allows me to do anything

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.880
that can excite me.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.780
So working as a full-time
engineer in the service

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:56.280
infrastructure team, also
promoting AI for developers.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.382
So it's been very rewarding.

00:05:58.382 --> 00:05:59.840
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And that's great.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.298
And your first batch of videos
were around TensorFlow Lite.

00:06:02.298 --> 00:06:04.670
So TensorFlow working on
Android and iOS phones.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.770
And what's your next
set going to be?

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.510
SU FU: Yeah, it's
going to be Javascript.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.718
LAURENCE MORONEY: JavaScript?

00:06:09.718 --> 00:06:11.210
So TensorFlow in the browser?

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.360
SU FU: Yeah, exactly that.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.600
You can build your
AI models and run it

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.520
in a browser using
JavaScript, or Node.js.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.670
So it's pretty neat.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.628
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:06:20.628 --> 00:06:22.125
SU FU: It's pretty light.

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:23.250
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice pun.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.860
So thank you so much.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.437
One final question, though,
would be if-- for developers,

00:06:27.437 --> 00:06:29.270
if they want to learn
more about what you're

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.800
doing with
TensorFlow, or if they

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.630
want to learn more about
services infrastructure,

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.810
where would you point them?

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.310
Or what advice
would you give them?

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.810
SU FU: Yes.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.600
So, for service
infrastructure, we

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.690
have pretty concise
documentation.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.950
We can paste a link
in the YouTube videos.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.210
And also, for the
TensorFlow Lite,

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.450
we do, and the
JavaScript, we do--

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.770
LAURENCE MORONEY: Coming soon.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:52.190
SU FU: Yeah.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.550
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.440
And, like, they're
available-- the Chinese ones

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.856
for the Chinese audience are
on our WeChat channel, right?

00:06:56.856 --> 00:06:57.550
SU FU: Yes.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.000
WeChat, and-- since
WeChat is so popular,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.485
everyone is on it,
including TensorFlow.

00:07:02.485 --> 00:07:03.860
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Even I'm on it.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.151
SU FU: Yeah, even you're on it.

00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:08.570
And thanks for the Chinese
advocates at Google.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.980
They provide this WeChat
post depicting the TensorFlow

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.110
Lite, and also the videos.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.860
And as is in WeChat, we
also posted the videos

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:24.020
on Bilibili, which is a video
sharing platform for comics

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.612
and animation.

00:07:24.612 --> 00:07:25.820
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, really?

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.050
SU FU: Yes, but it's
been very popular.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.770
A lot of people are watching
them for development.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:32.880
It's surprising.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.040
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.940
I'll have to check that one out.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.910
I hadn't seen that.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.770
Comics and animation are
two of my favorite things,

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.436
and now we've got
TensorFlow there, too.

00:07:38.436 --> 00:07:39.380
Thank you so much, Su.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.540
And thanks, everybody, for
watching this episode of Coffee

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.290
with a Googler.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.360
If you have any
questions for me,

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.810
or if you have any
questions for Su,

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.400
just please leave them

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.774
