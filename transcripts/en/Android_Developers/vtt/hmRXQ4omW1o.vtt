SPEAKER: There is no higher
form of user validation

00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:04.710
than having customers
support your product

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.400
with their wallets.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.510
But the path to a
profitable business

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.550
is not always an easy one.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.800
To help you choose the
best monetization strategy,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.560
Google and Udacity have
created App Monetization,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.920
an online course that presents
strategies and best practices

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.020
on how to make your
apps profitable.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.580
This course includes
viewpoints from e-commerce

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.210
to games and insights
from leading start-ups

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.856
in multiple industries.

00:00:28.856 --> 00:00:30.230
By the end of this
course, you'll

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.740
be able to choose and
implement a monetization

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.010
strategy relevant
to your product,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.000
set performance
metrics and monitor

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.380
the success of a
strategy, and know

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.660
when to pivot your existing
monetization strategy.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.975
