RICK KLEFFEL: Ladies and
gentlemen, we are privileged

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.200
to have a man who has a habit
of seeing the future of

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.330
America, writing a book about
it, and telling us where we're

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.340
going to be in about five years,
when we don't know it's

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.500
already happened.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.740
He did so--

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.860
god--

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.760
longer ago than I would care to
admit, when he gave us all

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.780
"The Electric Kool-Aid Acid
Test." He did it again when he

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.080
told us just what was "The Right
Stuff." He did it again,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.490
when he said, "I Am Charlotte
Simmons."

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.140
Now he's back again.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.440
He's one of America's
best authors.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.010
He's a man who has seen the
future and the present.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.310
It's Tom Wolfe.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.350
His new book is "Back
to Blood." Thank you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.460
for joining me, Tom.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.710
TOM WOLFE: You're welcome.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.250
And if you'd really like to see
a vision of the future, go

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.630
to my website.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.840
It's called Analog.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.580
You'll have radios again that
you can adjust the volume by

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.310
just turning.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.600
Didn't anybody ever
see that before?

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.850
You turn a wheel.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.510
It's very handy.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.220
But I'm not going to--

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.210
I have a feeling it
may not even go.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.490
RICK KLEFFEL: One of the things
that struck me as I

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.190
read this book was that, in
fact, this is something you do

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.530
have a habit of doing.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.920
Is finding out what America's
really about, and going there,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.000
and telling us two
stories at once.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.650
How America got that way, in the
midst of a thrilling story

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.060
about characters we
really care about.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.630
And I'm wondering, what took you
to Miami to show us this

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.820
particular vision of America?

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.880
TOM WOLFE: I was really
interested in immigration.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.780
And this was at a time when
most of the immigration

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.720
stories-- and sometimes they
were great stories-- about how

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.585
people got in to the
United States.

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:01.460
But that had been
done to death.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.250
And I was curious about
what did immigrants do

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.790
once they were here.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.280
And I was first interested in
the Vietnamese in California,

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.000
who, for the most part, I guess,
are still in the Los

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.760
Angeles region.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.630
But I then saw that the San
Jose Mercury, which is

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.130
northern California, has a
second edition, which is

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.370
called the Viet Mercury.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.690
I really would like to get
to know the Vietnamese.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.460
Then I discovered I can't speak
the language, and I

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.360
can't even begin to read
the Viet Mercury.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.030
But I was interested
in immigration.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.270
And people say, what are
you interested in now?

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.580
And I'd say, well, I'm
interested in immigration.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.180
And they'd say, oh
that's great.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.230
And then their heads
would fall off.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.110
They'd go to sleep like
a horse, standing up.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.900
But I had faith in
that subject.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.500
And then I heard about Miami.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.990
Of course, I'd heard of Miami
before, but not in connection

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.810
to immigration.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.870
Miami is really immigration
central for the United States.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.680
It's the only city--

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.360
I think it's the only city in
the world, as far as I know--

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.430
in which more than half the
population is recent

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.390
immigrants, many within
the last 50 years.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.350
And people from another
country, with another

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.570
language, and another culture
politically, control this vast

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.280
metropolitan area of Miami.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.630
Of course, I'm talking
about the Cubans.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.640
It's interesting, just
how unusual that is.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.810
Russians are coming in in
great numbers right now.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.750
And they tend to live where
Miami Beach joins the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.470
mainland, north of
South Beach.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.210
I consider this book
are great triumph.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.770
It hardly mentions South
Beach at all.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.560
Very few contemporary books
on Miami do that.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:15.959
And realizing that I really knew
nothing about Miami, I

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.339
still thought it was a tourist
resort, I decided the only way

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.800
to find out just to go there.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.390
And I had good luck.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.020
There was a former journalist
for the Miami Herald, a second

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.170
generation Cuban named Oscar
Corral, wrote me out of the

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.010
blue, and said, I think you'll
find it interesting here.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.960
And so I went.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.470
And I find if you can
get along with--

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.600
Oscar is great-- but if you can
get along with one person

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.660
for five hours anywhere you go,
that first will probably

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.680
introduce you to
somebody else.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.210
And it goes from there.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.470
A, I never tried to report
in a white suit.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.340
Everbody would say, hey!

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.940
Tom Wolfe is here!

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.490
Talk to me.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.710
I wear a blue blazer.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.040
But come to think of it,
I guess I do stand out,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.020
because I have a--

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.590
anybody here know
what this is?

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.680
RICK KLEFFEL: Polka dot tie.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.930
TOM WOLFE: Right, a tie.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.360
There are parts of America
where these are unknown.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.710
I just discovered
them recently.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.840
And if anybody would like them,

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.875
I'll tell you my supplier.

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:27.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.130
TOM WOLFE: Anyway.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.640
RICK KLEFFEL: Now Tom, one of
the things that struck me

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.180
about reading this book, and
thinking of all your other

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.750
books going back, is that before
there was a Google,

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.940
your books were designed to be
read by somebody who has

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.130
Google to hand, to summon up.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.830
To go, oh my god.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.890
Could that really be true?

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.620
They're filled with these kind
of details that call out their

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.380
attention to us.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.400
I'd like to talk about some of
the finding those kind of real

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.670
life details, and putting them
in your fiction, and putting

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.190
them in your nonfiction, and
telling a story with these

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.740
great little bits.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.930
And also, did you use
Google when you were

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:10.800
writing this book?

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.820
TOM WOLFE: Oh my god.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.850
I'm one out of eight billion,
I think, who do use Google.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.550
Think of all the times
I didn't go

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.660
New York Public library.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.150
I sat home.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.665
I have to ask, though,
about Google.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.970
When I look things up, I've
learned more about ornithology

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.350
by using Google all the time.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.350
You can always recognize
the dove--

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.500
it's flying through
a commercial--

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:48.950
it has a staggered flight.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.160
And even swans taking off.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.790
I've seen a lot of swans.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.000
They can take off very,
very rapidly.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.460
There are other things to learn,
other than the facts

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.390
that you're looking for.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.570
And it's very attractive
to see these birds.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.850
RICK KLEFFEL: So you're one of
the many authors who find

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.170
Google to be something of a
mixed blessing, in that it

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.760
offers you--

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:12.910
TOM WOLFE: Oh, no.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:13.900
It's not mixed it all.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.700
I learn about other things.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.170
RICK KLEFFEL: So you--

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.420
TOM WOLFE: Birds.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.050
Anyway, I'm not comfortable
with something I'm writing

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.920
about, even in a novel.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.760
Until I was 57 years old, I
wrote nothing but nonfiction.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.930
So I paid my dues in
nonfiction work.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.050
And it was fun, because at
that time, things were

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.180
happening in nonfiction that
hadn't happened before.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.000
I still think, probably the--

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.250
I shouldn't say this.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.270
Here's the way you
get around it.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.670
You really want to praise
somebody highly, you say, he's

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.420
one of the two.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:57.000
Then all the other writers can
say, oh yeah, I was the other.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.370
Anyway, I think Michael Lewis,
who's a nonfiction writer, is

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:06.614
one of the two greatest writers
in America today.

00:08:06.614 --> 00:08:10.360
I'm not saying that for
my own benefit.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.000
He's fabulous.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.850
He knows how to tell a
story in nonfiction.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.820
Which is actually not
all that hard.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:22.200
There are just four devices that
can make nonfiction sound

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.200
like the most gripping novel
you've ever read.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.360
One is scene-by-scene
construction.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.880
So instead of going from a scene
to some long essay about

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.900
something or other, you go to
another scene, and another

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.150
scene, and another scene.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:46.370
The second is extensive
dialogue.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.670
You can't always get that.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.300
When I wrote a book on
astronauts, I really wasn't

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:56.320
there when John Glenn made
the first orbital trip.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.240
But two things helped.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.810
One, astronauts at that time
had to go through detailed

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:05.490
question and answer sessions,
because at the time, NASA did

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.750
not know what they were
going to find.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.170
And I talked them into
declassifying those.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:12.750
RICK KLEFFEL: Really?

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.520
TOM WOLFE: Yes.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.170
They started scratching their
heads, well, I don't know why

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.420
we keep these declassified.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:25.490
Also, I use something that I
call the downstage voice.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.240
If you're really stymied
for accurate--

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.610
and even in writing
a novel, I want

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.860
this stuff to be accurate--

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:41.710
you could write in the third
person narrative as if you're

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:47.720
a voice of someone or some
typical character in the book.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.530
At one point, I was writing
about Junior Johnson, a stock

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.520
car driver.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.250
And he's in a practice
run around the

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.090
North Wilkesboro Raceway.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:03.990
And he was the fastest
driver that was in

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.640
NASCAR at the time.

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.690
And so I suddenly say, "great
smokin' blue gumballs!

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.810
There goes Junior Johnson!"
That was to indicate the

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.610
excitement that he created.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.570
And it was me speaking.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.220
It wasn't anybody
in the scene.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.100
That's a helpful thing.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:30.720
Dialogue is the most readable
form of prose that there is.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.590
And you can go on and on in
dialogue, and in long

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.550
sentences, anything.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.130
People will still find
it easy to read.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.490
Now, the movies can do both of
those things better than the

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.790
written word.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.310
Scene-by-scene construction
and dialogue.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:53.860
But there are two things the
written word does better than

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.660
anything that has yet
been invented.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.960
I signed all these releases
that said that you'd give

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.510
whoever it is right for every
device they can think of, and

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.640
it says "and anything invented
in the future." Well, suppose

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:14.420
there's some sexual apparatus
you read by.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.740
I don't want be--

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.010
I almost crossed that out.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:20.440
I don't want to be involved
in that kind of stuff.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:27.310
TOM WOLFE: Anyway, notation
of status details.

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:28.760
Movies cannot handle that.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.010
I'll give an example.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.410
I don't what the hot
loafers are today.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:35.610
But it was Gucci loafers.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.240
They were expensive.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.350
They were considered
high class.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:44.850
But you can show on the screen
a pair of Gucci loafers--

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:45.400
RICK KLEFFEL: Nobody's
going to know what

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:45.960
the hell they are.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.230
TOM WOLFE: Yeah.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:47.720
They want to know why that
camera's lingering on those

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.970
dumb pair of shoes.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:56.450
They have a golden crossbar
that links in the middle.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:04.030
But in writing, it's nothing
to point these things out.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:10.060
And in the Godfather, when they
want to show that this

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.350
one character-- he's not
a mafia character--

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.910
one character is decadent.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.460
They have him living in a house
that would have made the

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.470
Borgias shrink.

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.320
Oh my god, look at
the size of that.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:29.550
And there's a famous scene,
where they cut off the head of

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.510
one of his race horses.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.140
And they sneak into the room
while he's asleep, and they

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.980
put it on the bed, so that he'll
wake up, and he'll see

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:43.020
his great thoroughbred head
at the foot of the bed.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:48.280
But to let you know he's
decadent, they have to get him

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:54.380
silk salmon-colored sheets,
a bed that you could play

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.440
soccer, and with every
sort of trimming.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.620
In writing, you do not have
to go to all that trouble.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:08.380
As I say that 98% of life is
concerned, for everybody, with

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.970
status, as I call it.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:11.460
RICK KLEFFEL: Class.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.700
And that's a big part
of this book.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.100
TOM WOLFE: Even people doing
things that are absolutely

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:23.360
solitary, like going
to the bat-room.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.462
I used to call it
the bat-room.

00:13:25.462 --> 00:13:28.030
At home, with family, I just
say, I've got to go check on

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.870
the Batmobile.

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:29.570
What are you talking about?

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:30.760
It's in the bat-room.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.430
Anyway, that's child talk.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:34.680
I'm sorry.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.070
Just think about it some time.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:46.500
The things that you do in total
privacy of any kind that

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.610
you do because of your idea of
where this puts you in the

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:51.570
social order.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:55.710
And it doesn't mean you want to
rise in the social order.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.590
I grew up in the South,
and I've known a

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:58.710
lot of good old boys.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.030
I really have.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.570
And they don't realize how they
think they're dressing

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:04.990
really casually.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.960
But they all dress casually
the same way.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:14.710
The big overalls, and the
clodhoppers, and there was a

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:18.230
kind of t-shirt, really the
worst kind of plaid shirt you

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.160
could possibly buy.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.660
RICK KLEFFEL: Now, Tom.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.940
What's the fourth way that you
were going to tell us?

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.330
TOM WOLFE: The fourth
is you're going

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.900
to write every scene--

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.390
we've got scenes going here--

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:33.650
from the point of view
of one person.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:37.450
And for example, when I was
writing "The Electric Kool-Aid

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.090
Acid Test"-- which took me into
these parts quite often--

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:49.160
because of the reporting I'd
done, I had some scenes where

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.630
some information was given to
me by this person, and other

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.820
information was given to
me by that person.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:58.120
And so I would be inside
of their heads.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.840
It's written in the
third person.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:05.880
But as a novelist, constantly
you're inside somebody's head,

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.570
watching what's going on.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:11.830
It's a very effective device.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:13.850
It's a controversial device.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:18.140
But I think, if you had been
with a person long enough, and

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.130
you really trust them to the
extent that they are telling

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:29.910
you the truth, not just piping
up, I think it's worth using.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.530
In "The Electric Pool Acid
Test," people wondered, well,

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:35.710
why is this whole section in
Sandy Lehmann-Haupt's name?

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:40.820
Oh, and this part is in Mountain
Girl's frame of mind.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.540
And that was because I didn't
have information from

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.750
everybody for all these
different scenes.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.433
But I still think it--

00:15:47.433 --> 00:15:51.210
Sandy Lehmann-Haupt,
for example--

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:52.600
Sandy won't mind because
this was already

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.850
published in the book--

00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:00.540
had had a lot of troubles
with schizophrenia

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.310
and things like that.

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:07.910
And drugs like LSD--

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:13.080
which, incidentally, was
invented by academics because

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:18.140
it was thought to mimic the
symptoms of schizophrenia.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.900
So you start taking a little
of that, and you're already

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.190
troubled, and life becomes--

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.060
RICK KLEFFEL: Challenging.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.940
TOM WOLFE: Challening.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.270
It does.

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:32.110
Everything, I insist--

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.080
and nobody listens--

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.570
in fiction or nonfiction
is reporting.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.390
You cannot make up what
goes on in this world.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.300
You cannot.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.320
RICK KLEFFEL: So that means you
didn't make up the Pissing

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.660
Monkey syndrome, which is
something that I had to look

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:49.550
up on Google.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.746
So tell us about the Pissing
Monkey syndrome, and the part

00:16:52.746 --> 00:16:53.720
it plays in this book.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.750
TOM WOLFE: I didn't go check
it out in terms of science.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:02.240
But one of the characters
tells about this.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.370
He's a psychiatrist.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.890
I guess he's telling
what he knows.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:07.800
I don't know if any of you--

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.900
I never have-- have ever
had a pet monkey?

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.660
A pet male monkey.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.329
If you're are male, and
you have gotten this

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:19.220
pet into your home--

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:23.444
in particular something like a
spider monkey, which are small

00:17:23.444 --> 00:17:26.770
but very agile--

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:31.550
that monkey, that little
male monkey, will start

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.450
pissing on your head.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:33.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:36.240
TOM WOLFE: This to
show dominance.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.320
You'll be sleeping.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:42.445
And I don't know how he gets up
to the overhead light, but

00:17:42.445 --> 00:17:44.920
it's pissing on you.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:53.280
And if you try to make up to the
monkey with good things to

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.930
eat, and a lot of stroking
and all this stuff, it

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:57.880
only makes it worse.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:58.870
You're obviously a pushover.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:59.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.260
TOM WOLFE: A real chump.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.290
And you get drenched
day and night.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:07.470
You're just getting dressed,
getting ready to have some

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.000
meeting to go, and psssshhhh!

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.865
The only thing that works is to
seize the monkey, and throw

00:18:13.865 --> 00:18:18.474
him in the toilet, and
flush the toilet.

00:18:18.474 --> 00:18:23.558
And at first, he'll yell,
kind of like a Eeee!

00:18:23.558 --> 00:18:23.796
Eeee!

00:18:23.796 --> 00:18:24.272
Eeee!

00:18:24.272 --> 00:18:25.080
Eeee!

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.640
But when he gets down to Eeh.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.130
Eeh.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:29.276
Ehh.

00:18:29.276 --> 00:18:31.470
You know you've won.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:35.390
And now you have outpissed
him with this machine.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.746
He doesn't know where
it's coming from.

00:18:37.746 --> 00:18:40.760
And after that, he couldn't
be nicer.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:45.320
And this comes into
play in this book.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.640
RICK KLEFFEL: It's one of
those things that you're

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.570
probably going to only
find on Google.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:54.160
Tom, this is a kind
of a raunchy book.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:00.340
And one of the most incredible
scenes that you unfurl is the

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.820
Columbus Day Regatta.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.440
Did you go to a Columbia Day--

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:03.780
TOM WOLFE: I did.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:03.940
RICK KLEFFEL: --Regatta?

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:04.220
TOM WOLFE: Yeah.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:04.690
RICK KLEFFEL: Oh my god.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:06.320
And it's a real thing?

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.910
TOM WOLFE: It's a real thing.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:15.050
A Columbus Day Regatta is a
sailboat race in Biscayne Bay.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:18.510
And I guess the Atlantic
comes in there.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:22.270
It's from one key, the name
of which I do not know, to

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.000
another, which is called
Elliott Key.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.650
Elliott Key is a state park, but
there's almost nothing on

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:32.080
it to recommend it, other than
the Columbus Day Regatta.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.550
When this Regatta started,
it was serious sailors.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.480
Afterwards, they would always
have a party on Elliott Key.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.930
And this party was,
apparently, a

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.110
great little party.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.680
And people who were not involved
in racing at all

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.990
would come out, and they'd
join the party.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:53.150
And it got bigger and
it got bigger.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.720
And when I went, and when the
people from the last 15 years

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.900
went, nobody had a clue as
to who won the race.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.650
They still have the race.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.570
Nobody knew the name
of a boat.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:07.310
Nobody had even saw one.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.340
They were there for the party.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:17.080
And it gradually became an
astounding orgy in which, for

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:23.000
example, pornographic movies are
shown on schooner sails.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.210
Schooner sails are bigger
than other sails.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:32.090
And we're talking
real hardcore.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:34.980
Things that you might
think of as--

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:37.596
I won't say the numbers, but--

00:20:37.596 --> 00:20:38.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:40.910
TOM WOLFE: --six by
two, let's say.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:44.070
If you're lucky.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:48.960
Are 6 and 1/2 feet long, and
they're wide enough to walk

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.180
through it.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.020
There was a door.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.180
And it goes.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.800
And at first it's weird.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.490
You can't tell exactly
what orifice of the

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.810
human body is opening.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.110
They're all so big.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:03.780
You expect to see an explorer
walk into one of these.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.900
RICK KLEFFEL: It sounds like
the ship in alien.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.870
TOM WOLFE: Well, it's
alien, all right.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:14.720
And then there are always-- and
this is a great feature of

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.140
Columbus Day Regatta--

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:21.390
the nude waterski crowd.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:24.760
Mostly girls without
at stitch on.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.310
And people will watch
that for hours.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:28.375
Watching them go by.

00:21:28.375 --> 00:21:31.270
And they always smile
toward the audience.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:32.180
And there's a--

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.560
Well, I won't go into this.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:37.850
But there's some males who make
it worth your attention

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.100
to be viewed.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:49.360
They'll take 14, 15, I'd even
say 20 boats, lashed together,

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.220
to create one gigantic deck.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.960
Of course it's a kind
of up and down deck.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.420
But it becomes one big party.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:02.390
And in fact, after a while it
kind of gets dangerous,

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:05.910
because everybody's drunk, that
they don't really look

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:09.500
out for these little boat
going around, too.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:14.270
And then finally, there are
people who get laid into, and

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.380
they're just having
at it on the deck.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.080
It caught my attention.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.660
RICK KLEFFEL: It sounds like
very definitely a difficult

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.340
feat of journalism to go
uncover such an even.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:33.090
TOM WOLFE: Well, you have
to pay the price.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:34.570
Anyway.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:41.980
And one of my characters is a
psychiatrist whose specialty

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.110
is treating pornography
addiction.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:52.560
Which is a bigger problem than
most people realize.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.740
This is hard to believe.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.460
But about one half of all the
hits on the internet are

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.420
pornographic.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.150
Just think about that.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.300
And often--

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.210
RICK KLEFFEL: We are at a
monument to such hits, to a

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.720
certain degree.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.970
TOM WOLFE: It wouldn't
happen here.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:11.500
RICK KLEFFEL: What's the Frank
Zappa line? "It can't happen

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:13.720
here."

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:18.860
TOM WOLFE: And the real toll
it's taken on business people,

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.480
who get this addiction.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.390
They're afraid to
do it at home.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:25.550
They can't find any
sanctuary at home.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:30.450
So more and more, the business
day, nine to five, is take--

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:36.562
Don't anybody kid you.

00:23:36.562 --> 00:23:42.020
What always accompanies male
pornography watching is

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.810
masturbation.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:47.420
And even the coarsest bureaucrat
doesn't really want

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.290
to be seen doing this.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.400
RICK KLEFFEL: That's not an
image-enhancing experience.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.130
TOM WOLFE: So he has to
go somewhere else.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:02.380
He's leaving the business
to that extent.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.830
Oh, the pissing monkey got
into that, because the

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:09.860
psychiatrist, the one who told
about the pissing monkey.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:11.370
RICK KLEFFEL: Well, it's a
natural progression from

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.480
pissing monkeys to
pornography.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.900
TOM WOLFE: In general, though,
I just found that if you just

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.960
keep looking.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.210
And I think if you just settle
in for 30 days, anywhere in

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:22.820
the United States, you're going
to see something that

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:26.120
you could not have imagined,
and something that would be

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.630
interesting to the
general public.

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:33.570
Part of that's because, despite
the crash of 2008,

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:37.150
this is still a rich country
compared to any other country

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:37.970
in the world.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:42.030
And people now have the
money to express

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.770
themselves in some way.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:51.160
Las Vegas, for example, the
Strip and all that, was built

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.260
by gangsters.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:58.360
And their idea of a great
resort was Miami.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:03.610
So Las Vegas happened to be
in the Mojave Desert.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:05.550
But the first great hotel built
there was called The

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:10.180
Flamingo, because that's what
they have in Florida.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:12.100
And the interesting part
about that is not

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.330
that they're gangsters.

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:17.770
It's that they never finished
high school.

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:20.130
I've never heard of a member of
the mafia who ever finished

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:21.930
high school.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:23.930
Don't tell anybody
I said that.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:24.770
I've never heart--

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:26.663
RICK KLEFFEL: You know, it's
going out on YouTube, so--

00:25:26.663 --> 00:25:28.090
TOM WOLFE: Oh yeah,
that's right.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.080
I never heard one.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:35.480
And so we are talking about
creators from a stratum of

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:40.340
society that creators never
came from before.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:46.380
And they really did create
the modern Las Vegas.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.600
Another example of just the
wealth of this country--

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.020
every year, the state of North
Carolina, when the cotton

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.770
crops are due, brings in
10,000 so-called guest

00:25:56.770 --> 00:26:02.100
workers, mostly from Mexico,
because there's not a living

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:06.300
native-born North Carolinian of
any origin whatsoever who

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.410
will pick cotton anymore.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:11.880
People would rather sit on the
corner with a hatful of

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.030
pencils than to pick cotton.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.900
It's the worst work
in the world.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.370
I joined a niece of mine
for about 10 minutes.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.730
That was all it was for
my cotton picking.

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:25.220
It's in the hottest weather
you can imagine.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:29.720
The cotton balls have all
these prickly ends.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.570
Oh, and Sparta, North Carolina,
which I wrote about

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:39.170
a novel called "I Am Charlotte
Simmons." Sparta is in the

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.920
Blue Ridge mountains
of North Carolina.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.610
It's too hilly to grow crops.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.320
It's impossible, except
for one crop--

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.940
Christmas trees.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.370
And probably a third of the
Christmas trees in America

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:55.210
come from Sparta,
North Carolina.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:56.490
I was on farms--

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.810
they call them farms--

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:01.250
of Christmas trees that were
going to be 500,000 Christmas

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:04.670
trees growing in one place.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:08.180
It takes about 12 years
for them to mature.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:12.390
But every year, at least once,
sometimes twice, somebody has

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:15.920
to cut that Christmas tree in
the shape of a Christmas tree.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:20.370
Otherwise, it's going to
be a great big bush.

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:24.380
And the way they do it is with
delicatessen knives.

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:29.600
A machetes is too big, and
it hacks at things.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.320
But delicatessen roast
beef knives.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.330
They're about this long.

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:34.950
They're real thin.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.110
You've got people out
there with these.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.450
And guess who does
it all today?

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:42.870
Latin Americans, I
would say mostly.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:45.350
They're probably
mostly Mexican.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:50.830
Now, they have turned out
to be hard workers.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:53.370
They want to send
money back home.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:54.660
And it's terrible work.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.930
There's no machine you
can bring into a

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.170
Christmas tree farm.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:02.645
You just have to go through
all those prickly--

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.710
well, they're like
thorns almost.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:12.670
RICK KLEFFEL: Well, you give us
a great vision of a Miami

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:17.010
where most of the population
is not white,

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:18.660
where it's run by Cubans.

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:22.790
And you also have a lot
of fun with the media

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:24.850
in this, and art.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:26.610
You do some fun things
with art.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:28.660
Is a really a no-hands
art movement?

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:29.650
TOM WOLFE: Yes, there is.

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:32.780
I'll tell you, it's
a very powerful

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.340
movement in terms of--

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:34.800
RICK KLEFFEL: Really?

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.300
TOM WOLFE: --the art critics.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.010
Jeff Koons--

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:40.630
you may know his work.

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:42.170
He builds-- pff.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:48.500
"Builds." He has elves build
45-foot-high bunny rabbits,

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.650
with various vegetation growing
on them to give them a

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:53.802
kind of look like fur.

00:28:53.802 --> 00:28:55.820
He doesn't touch that,
of course.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.230
RICK KLEFFEL: It sounds
like a giant Chia Pet.

00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:59.870
TOM WOLFE: Yeah.

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:02.680
He also had some photographs.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.140
I think he actually
married her.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.810
A very famous Italian prostitute
called "La

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:08.300
Cicciolina".

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:12.350
And she was famous because she
had messed up somebody's

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.590
political career.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:15.800
And they were together.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:25.220
And he would have photographs
taken of himself and La

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:31.420
Cicciolina exploring
about every orifice

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.070
in the human body.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.680
I mean these were unbelievable
scenes.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:39.570
These were sent to elves in
Switzerland, who created them

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:40.620
out of glass.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:43.900
They're kind of like Limoges.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.470
RICK KLEFFEL: So that's real?

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.900
TOM WOLFE: That's real.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:46.400
Absolutely.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.770
RICK KLEFFEL: Oh my god.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:51.255
TOM WOLFE: And they fetch--

00:29:51.255 --> 00:29:52.385
A, he never touched
the camera.

00:29:52.385 --> 00:29:56.310
And I doubt if he even mails
them to the elves.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:58.190
He has people who
do that for him.

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:05.340
These objects are
three-dimensional and glass.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.700
But so what that he didn't
touch, that he had nothing to

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:09.110
do with it?

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:13.300
They sell for fantastic
prices.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:18.860
1.7 million for him and La
Cicciolina in glass.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.200
It is not uncommon.

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:21.990
RICK KLEFFEL: Did
you attend the

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:25.360
Superbowl of art criticism?

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.100
TOM WOLFE: Oh, I did.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.630
RICK KLEFFEL: Did you have
an AA to show you

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.020
which ones were valuable?

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.620
TOM WOLFE: Oh, actually,
I did.

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:38.680
RICK KLEFFEL: So this is an
event where people go in.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.660
It's millionaires lining
up, as you

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.240
describe it, like maggots.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.680
TOM WOLFE: Well, the most
noted ones were actually

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.300
billionaires.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.380
There were 12 in line
when I went there.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.700
I had to wangle my way
to be in that line.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:58.710
It's the most privileged line at
the Miami Art Basel, which

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:06.500
is an international art show
of supposedly serious art.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.320
And these--

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.390
and I'm not kidding--
billionaires get in line.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:16.580
And these are people who are not
young, but they're wearing

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:22.810
basketball shoes so that they
can get into the booth of the

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:25.590
artist that they really
want first.

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.750
And the fact that they're going
to rush in and pay $17

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.770
million for something
is no problem.

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:33.766
That is not a deterrent.

00:31:33.766 --> 00:31:35.540
RICK KLEFFEL: This is Black
Friday for millionaires.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.790
TOM WOLFE: Yeah.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.020
I couldn't believe it, so I
wrote it, to make sure I

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.230
didn't forget it.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:46.960
It's an extraordinary thing.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:56.530
But all it they all have, as
you alluded, advisers they

00:31:56.530 --> 00:32:00.890
call AAs who tell them
what they like.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.410
You like that.

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:08.470
And it's just no telling what
that may turn out to be.

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:11.330
Oh, there's also tenure art.

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:13.060
We mustn't forget tenure art.

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:18.140
T-E-N-U-R-E. These are artists
who do conceptual pieces, such

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.230
as one that I saw, and
actually rather

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:21.830
enjoyed, in a way.

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:23.150
The artist--

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.360
"artist"--

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:28.350
had a heavy chain, the length
was about this long.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:32.030
On either end, he had attached
big polyurethane bags filled

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:34.250
with vegetables.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:38.070
And the first part of the piece
of art is you come out,

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:42.060
and he lays the chain on
the top of a pond.

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:45.090
Naturally, it sinks right
to the bottom.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:48.470
And then he invites you back in
about two months, and you

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:49.990
go out to the pond.

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:55.460
And now, the vegetables have
all rotted, filling the

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.790
polyurethane bags with gas.

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:00.930
And now the chain is floating
on the surface.

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:04.010
And I will admit, it's pretty
wonderful to, if you saw it

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.170
sink the first time.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:10.720
But now this, obviously, cannot
be sold to anybody.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.320
Another piece I saw an action
was a pig roast.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.220
And the Caja China-- that's
a Cuban grill.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:23.600
And the whole piece of the
artwork was seeing them

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.030
prepare the pig, and seeing
the pig roasting.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.640
and we're talking about
an 8-hour show now.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:34.670
And then afterwards, everyone
who's there eats the pig.

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:37.180
That's another piece
of tenure art.

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:39.910
The idea is, if you do enough
of these things that attract

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:43.640
attention, and maybe get you
into some of the magazines,

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:49.510
you have a pretty good shot at
joining the fine arts faculty

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:51.975
of a good university.

00:33:51.975 --> 00:33:56.140
And if you can hang in there for
six years-- that's all it

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.010
takes now--

00:33:58.010 --> 00:33:58.980
that's tenure.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.580
You have tenure.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:07.455
And when you retire, you have
a pretty level pension.

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:14.699
Depending on your needs
and wants and desires,

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:16.510
your life is set.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.750
RICK KLEFFEL: I don't need
much more and two bags of

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:20.790
vegetables and a chain link.

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:21.500
TOM WOLFE: It's been done.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.920
It's been done.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:26.949
The important thing is
it hasn't been done.

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:28.510
Well, I've given up.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.170
I found this all great,
because for a

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:32.370
writer, it's all gold.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:33.489
It's absolutely gold.

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:36.690
One of the main terms at Yale
today in the fine arts

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:39.780
department is de-skilled art.

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.540
The idea is that all
of this drawing--

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.960
[AUDIO CUTS OUT]

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.499
TOM WOLFE: --three dimensional
effects, it's very--

00:34:46.499 --> 00:34:49.610
[AUDIO CUTS OUT]

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.810
TOM WOLFE: --the reader, that
person who's done in an

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:55.250
outline, that person
doesn't exist.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.590
And the three dimension.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:58.820
Come on, touch the damn thing.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.750
It's just absolutely flat.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.760
That's deception.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.690
So what you have to do is have
honest art, which is

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:08.880
de-skilled.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.825
You've just got to take
the skill out of it.

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:16.330
This I really shouldn't
say, but I think

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:19.750
that describes Picasso.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.220
RICK KLEFFEL: Well, he shows
up in your book, too.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.620
TOM WOLFE: He does pop in.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:26.880
I have said this before, so
I shouldn't repeat it.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.200
But if I couldn't--

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.110
I'm talking about me.

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.980
I'm not talking about
some journal--

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.760
RICK KLEFFEL: Don't worry.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.500
YouTube's going to repeat
it for you.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:40.470
TOM WOLFE: If I could not draw
better than Picasso, what I

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:46.160
would do is create a movement
called cubism.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:50.290
And so that they don't think I'm
trying to draw a skilled

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:55.555
face, I put both eyes on one
side of the head, and then the

00:35:55.555 --> 00:35:59.180
nose goes out somewhere
that noses never go.

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:05.780
See, the problem with Picasso
was he left art school because

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.560
at 15, he felt there
was nothing more

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.530
they could teach him.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:12.380
Unfortunately, it was that next
some semester they began

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:17.375
to teach anatomy and the third
dimension, perspective.

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:23.660
So he had to do the
best he can.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.040
Look at early.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:29.190
He had more or less realistic in
the so-called Blue Period.

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:32.010
Take a look at the fingers.

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:34.970
They look like a clump of a
asparagus bought at the

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:36.250
grocery store.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:38.190
They're all the same length.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:41.300
If he can, he hides them.

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:44.210
Matisse also could
not do hands.

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:48.830
And sometime, if you're just
rummaging through a book of

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.500
art, and you come to Matisse,
just look at all the hands

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.040
that are stuck behind
the back.

00:36:55.972 --> 00:36:58.780
I just think it's wonderful.

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:01.720
People think I knock art.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:02.140
I don't.

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:05.060
I never make a single
aesthetic judgment.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:08.106
I just tell how it happened.

00:37:08.106 --> 00:37:08.775
I swear.

00:37:08.775 --> 00:37:10.800
RICK KLEFFEL: Here, let me
help you with this guy.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.700
Now in this book,
we have a great

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.820
look at American culture.

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:23.470
And one of the things you give
us are how any single act that

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:27.340
any of us does can be turned
into a dozen different acts

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:30.790
depending on who's telling the
story, and how it's been told.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:33.680
At the center of this book is
Nestor Camacho, who does

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:36.920
something that seems, at the
moment, quite valiant and

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:37.620
incredible.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:42.700
But in the aftermath, it just
gets spun 10 different ways by

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.420
10 different news
organizations.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:48.860
Talk about putting us in those
news perspectives.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:52.740
Did you intern yourself, so
to speak, with the Cuban

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.710
newspaper, and the American
newspaper, and the bloggers,

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.935
and all the other people that
you talk about in the book?

00:37:57.935 --> 00:38:00.900
TOM WOLFE: Fortunately, I
spent 10 years on the--

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:02.070
I guess it was fortunate--

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:04.085
10 years on newspapers.

00:38:04.085 --> 00:38:07.930
I felt I kind of knew the
drill from the newspaper

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:09.280
perspective.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:13.830
In this particular case that
Rick's referring to, my

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:16.450
central character's name
is Nestor Camacho.

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:21.100
Nobody ever understands Cuban
first names, males

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.190
particularly.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:26.480
Nestor was a great hero the
Trojan wars, but it drives him

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:31.830
crazy, everybody, in Americano,
calls him

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:36.960
"Nest-er." It ends in E-R.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.700
And I'll point out,
it's very unusual.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.240
He's on the Miami
Marine Patrol.

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.880
Beyond the patrol is a step
up from walking a beat or

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.740
something, or driving a beat.

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.710
And he is in the probation
period.

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:55.060
So on this safe boat,
they're called--

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.550
wackiest looking boat you've
ever seen, but they go 45

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:58.990
miles an hour on the water.

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:02.750
They're for saving
people and boats.

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:07.770
So he's on with two Anglos.

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:09.680
I have to say, the Cubans
would never use

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:10.600
the word like gringo.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.670
They will say Americano if
they're speaking among

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:14.350
themselves.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:18.240
In general, it's Anglos
and Latinos.

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.340
At the beginning of Florida--

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.550
Southern Florida's the only
place on the face of the earth

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:24.830
where anybody was ever
called a Latina, a

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:27.300
Latino, or an Anglo.

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:30.950
And an Anglo is of
European origin.

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:34.460
But if he's not completely
white, he's not an Anglo.

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:38.010
It all has to do with
skin color.

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:42.430
Anyway, there are these two
Anglos, or Americanos, who

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:44.030
outrank him on the boat.

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:50.290
He is the third man, the young
man, he's on probation.

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:57.000
And they're having a
conversation, and he says

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.250
something that sounds
to the two

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:01.150
Americanos as rather uppity.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:03.940
I'm thinking of the Sergeant,
or the man in chief.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:09.500
And Nestor's on probation,
and he goes, oh my god.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:14.470
This is bad, if I get washed
out of probation.

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:18.830
So they are called to a
situation in which there's a

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:21.520
Cuban refugee atop
a schooner mast.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.310
So he's up about 75, 80 feet.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:30.090
The boat is stopped right
near a causeway.

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:34.230
Miami has lots of causeways
go across Biscayne Bay.

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:37.290
And they've stopped, because
they're not sure that the mass

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:41.470
will clear the bridge.

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:43.480
And so they're trying to
figure out what to do.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:48.290
And this Cuban refugee, who
has obviously paid about

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:52.210
$5,000, is brought
in by a cigarette

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:53.280
boat, they're called.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.850
Those are the really fast,
small, good-looking boats.

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:58.140
70 miles an hour.

00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.640
RICK KLEFFEL: Did
you ride on one?

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.520
TOM WOLFE: I would have gladly
done it, but I didn't ride on

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:02.400
one of those.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.980
I did ride on the marine
patrol boat.

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:05.330
RICK KLEFFEL: Oh, really?

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:05.630
TOM WOLFE: Yeah.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.370
Oh, yeah.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:09.230
I'd never heard of it myself.

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:10.540
RICK KLEFFEL: Sounds like fun.

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.850
TOM WOLFE: It was.

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:15.760
That thing is really
hell on wheels.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.660
But it's the safe boat.

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:17.960
It wasn't going to turn over.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:26.360
So they get there, and it turns
out that if a Cuban

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:30.850
touches American soil, or
anything edifice that's

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:36.660
jutting out from it, like a
jetty or a bridge, he cannot

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.000
be sent back to Cuba.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.020
If he's done something bad,
he can be prosecuted.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.940
But he cannot be sent back.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:48.550
But if you don't do that, you're
called a wetfoot, and

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.730
you're sent back.

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:54.870
Now, this fellow he apparently
wasn't--

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:58.410
well, he was a little bit
deranged or confused.

00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:01.530
And he sees this ladder that
goes up, and he figures it

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:03.860
goes up to a dock.

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:07.230
In fact, it goes onto the
deck of a schooner.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:11.180
If you're on a schooner,
you're still a wetfoot.

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:16.280
Even if the schooner is owned
by the governor of Florida,

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.810
you're in bad luck.

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:23.600
So this Camacho speaks
Spanish.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.180
Like a lot of second generation
Cubans, he speaks

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.890
12-year-old Spanish.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:33.530
When they get a little older,
they'd rather see American

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:37.760
television, learn
American ways.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.830
Their parents may be
kind of stuck--

00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:40.240
RICK KLEFFEL: Sure.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.520
It's easier to be immersed.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:48.110
And then the immigrant has
climbed up the mast, trying to

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:51.090
maybe jump onto that causeway.

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:51.440
TOM WOLFE: Yeah.

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.750
And he was a little frightened
by the reaction of the owners

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:55.355
of the ship.

00:42:55.355 --> 00:42:58.220
So he goes up on this mast.

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.700
He's 75 feet up in the air.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:05.320
And so the two Anglos, or two
American crewman who outrank

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.770
him said, you speak Spanish.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:14.020
Go on up there and tell
him to come down.

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.700
He's tying up traffic
on the causeway.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:20.920
It's just a block of traffic.

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:25.740
Because he's threatened with
being washed out of probation,

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:29.560
he doesn't dare tell them that
he cannot speak anything above

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.660
12-year-old Spanish.

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:37.040
So he's very powerfully built.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.880
Incidentally, I don't know if
anybody here, any male who

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:42.920
really wants to be powerfully
built, but you cannot top rope

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.300
climbing without using
your legs.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.140
RICK KLEFFEL: That's a big
theme of this book.

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:47.900
Get out there and rope
climb, guys.

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.500
TOM WOLFE: To climb ropes,
you can't use your legs.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:50.990
Can't use your legs.

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:54.040
Anyway, he does this, because
the quickest way to go up,

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.600
it's much quicker to go up
without using your legs, if

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:01.370
you have the strength, than
to stop or use them.

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:04.140
So he climbs all the way
up, and he gets within

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:05.950
10 feet of the guy.

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:12.160
And he realizes if you
are fleeing from a

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.000
credible threat in Cuba--

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.770
that's the word, a
credible threat--

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:21.330
they're not going
to arrest you.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:25.420
Miami police never arrest
an illegal immigrants.

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:27.580
They leave that up to the
federal government.

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:29.455
They have enough people to make
enemies with as it is.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:36.860
So he's practically up to the
guy, and he doesn't know the

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:38.300
word for threat.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.440
And this may seem strange,
because it's the same word as

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.060
in English.

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:45.290
He also does not know the word
"credible," or credible.

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:48.880
Because it's just not a word
a 12-year-old uses.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:50.580
RICK KLEFFEL: Sure.

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:54.300
TOM WOLFE: He's actually
26 in this scene.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.890
So he gets up there, and
he doesn't know what

00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:58.550
to say to the guy.

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:01.870
So he starts flashing
the peace sign.

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:05.440
And that only frightens--

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.430
they could be devil's horns.

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:08.810
Who knows what he's flashing
at the guy.

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:12.830
So he doesn't respond-- in fact,
he tries to get up out

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:16.050
of this little bosun chair that
he's nestled in at the

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:17.820
top of the mast.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:22.060
And he gets up, and he starts
trying to get away by going

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:25.975
down the jib.

00:45:25.975 --> 00:45:28.435
RICK KLEFFEL: The triangulation,
right?

00:45:28.435 --> 00:45:28.830
To the bow.

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:30.660
TOM WOLFE: That cable that
goes to the bow.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:37.290
And he's not strong enough,
this fellow from Cuba.

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:43.320
And so Nestor, my friend, climbs
down, hand-over-hand

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:47.140
down, and then wraps his legs
around the this guy.

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:50.670
He's not very big, maybe
120, 130 pounds.

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:56.750
And carries him down, all the
way down the jib line, which

00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:58.080
leads you, actually,
into the water.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.840
Because it juts out
over the prow.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.000
And they fall into the water.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.040
The guy fights him.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:03.690
He's fighting him.

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:06.050
He think he's going to take him
and turn him in and send

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:07.300
him back to Cuba.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:14.720
And at first, his police
brethren say, my god--

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.570
Police don't use the
word "bravery." Jet

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:18.820
pilots don't either.

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:24.320
They'll say, that was an
unacceptable level of risk in

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:24.880
that operation.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.180
TOM WOLFE: That's about
as close as they get.

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:31.540
But anyway, they were all proud
of him, the police--

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:35.360
who are mostly Cuban.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:35.590
so.

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:39.260
He's really happy, and
then he goes home.

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.620
It's now after midnight.

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:43.690
It was the four to
midnight shift.

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:48.300
And he expects to get all
this adulation at home.

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:51.430
And instead, he walks in,
here's his father.

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:53.540
His arms crossed like this.

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:54.770
RICK KLEFFEL: "Aye, Carmillo."

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:58.500
TOM WOLFE: Aye, Carmillo
Camacho.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:59.750
That's the last name.

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:10.070
I and your woman who became your
mother spent 12 days at

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:14.020
sea on a homemade dinghy.

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:17.000
We had to make it an apartment
because the block wardens

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.130
would have detected it if we
had tried to do it outside.

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:22.870
We almost died 100 times.

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:25.680
We finally made it, thank
god, to Key West.

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.140
We came aland, and we all live--
and your grandparents,

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.650
too, who were living
in that house.

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:32.750
And happy to do this.

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:34.990
You've drag our name
through the mud.

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.850
Poor guy.

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:38.590
"They ordered me!" Ah, yes,
they ordered people in

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:39.840
Germany, too.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:42.990
He couldn't get away
with that, they

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:44.620
ordered me to do it.

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.890
And then everybody turns
against him.

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:49.680
RICK KLEFFEL: This is a
book that is really

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.180
involved with guilt.

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:52.850
There's a lot of guilt
in this book.

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:54.570
You really have a lot
of fun with guilt.

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:57.490
You know, I've just got to say
that you had a lot of fun in

00:47:57.490 --> 00:47:58.930
this book, didn't you?

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:00.550
Writing this book, putting
this together.

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:03.110
You must have spent
a lot of time.

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:04.900
It sounds like this
is a book that you

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.160
had a good time writing.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:06.700
TOM WOLFE: Oh, no.

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:08.500
I've never had a good time
writing anything.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.320
I think it's the hardest
work in the world.

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.870
The only thing that gets you
through is that, maybe

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:16.860
somebody will applaud
when it's over.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.610
RICK KLEFFEL: Well, now, these
people are going to applaud.

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:19.370
But I think some of them--

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:21.330
TOM WOLFE: No, you don't
have to applaud.

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:22.300
You haven't read the book.

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:23.590
RICK KLEFFEL: Some of them might
have some questions.

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:24.570
Does anybody out there have any

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:28.040
questions for Mr. Tom Wolfe?

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.520
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for coming.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.610
Aspiring novelist.

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:32.680
Written one really bad book.

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.180
I'm hoping that the next
one isn't as bad.

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:42.700
Any advice for going from short
stories up to something

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:47.160
all encompassing and substantial
as this?

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.685
TOM WOLFE: Well, first of all,
you can't make a living on

00:48:48.685 --> 00:48:50.940
short stories.

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:52.060
It's very hard.

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:53.360
AUDIENCE: That's why I'm
a software engineer.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:57.240
TOM WOLFE: It's very hard.

00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:01.790
But in my case, what gets me the
point of writing something

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:07.400
that long is I will hear
of a certainly milieu.

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.970
And except for my book on the
astronauts, is always been

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:13.890
things I heard through
conversation.

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:16.460
That way, I figure
it'll be new.

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:20.080
If it's new for me, it's
probably new for most people.

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:23.130
And wherever that's happening,
I will go.

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:27.450
My motto is "leave the
building." I'll go there and

00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:32.600
try to just learn as
much as I can.

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.220
Like the man from Mars.

00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:35.200
I don't know what
you're doing.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.020
I'm really interested.

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:38.222
And it's true.

00:49:38.222 --> 00:49:41.780
That's what I'm like
when I'm there.

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.760
And I think it's important--

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.950
and this may sound like--

00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:50.690
but it's not hot air.

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:53.030
It's important to have
a concept of life.

00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:55.770
I really believe that.

00:49:55.770 --> 00:50:02.140
In my case, it's the theory of
status as was developed by Max

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.890
Weber, German sociologist.

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:08.610
But there are people who have
done great things with, let's

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:09.860
say, Christianity.

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:16.320
There's so many pieces to great
literature that come out

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:16.920
of a belief.

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:21.780
Marxism has not done badly, that
many of the good writers

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:27.630
in America in the 1930s and
the '40s were Marxists.

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:29.830
The thing about Marxism
that's good--

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:31.270
not much else is--

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:38.930
is that it forces you to
recognize class distinctions.

00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:41.910
And class is not a very
accurate word

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:43.160
in the United States.

00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:48.380
But still, it forces
you do it.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:52.360
And you suddenly become
conscious of a working class.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:56.280
You become conscious
of a bourgeoisie.

00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:02.710
And oddly, they never
get after the

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:04.555
plutocrats very much.

00:51:04.555 --> 00:51:06.330
I don't know why.

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:07.980
Sometime, look at some
Marxist literature.

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:09.590
They kind of leave them alone.

00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:12.430
But the bourgeoisie--

00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:18.070
But it is a way of noticing how
society is put together.

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:23.820
Max Weber, I think, made
the Marxist breakdown--

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:27.970
he wasn't a Marxist, but
much more subtle.

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:36.490
Because I think most of us feel
that we are in a certain

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:49.480
status group, and that we live
by a set of values that are

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:55.850
natural to this group, which,
if chiseled in stone by God,

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:58.400
would make you supreme.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:02.590
Not you, your group.

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:06.000
The essential thing
is the group.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.270
And in a case like mine,
I'm in a group

00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:13.340
of people who write.

00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:15.400
I include even journalists
in the

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:23.980
group, and serious writers.

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:27.690
But then, I also grew up
in Richmond, Virginia.

00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:30.040
And every now and then, without
my knowing it--

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.290
I'll give a good example.

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:41.370
When these two Virginians--

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:48.330
Pat Robinson the evangelist,
and the evangelist from

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:51.720
Lynchburg, Virginia,
Jerry Falwell--

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:58.190
When they came out protesting,
at a really key point early in

00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:05.040
the game, same-sex marriage
as an absolute violation.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.150
Oh, it was worse than that.

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:08.870
It was different from that.

00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:19.670
They blamed September 11,
2001 on homosexuality.

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:22.850
And my god, they were torn
to bits by [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:23.910
And I said, wait a minute!

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:25.570
These two guys are not bad.

00:53:25.570 --> 00:53:29.710
Pat Robinson went to the
college I went to.

00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:30.650
Maybe they're wrong.

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:32.315
But they're not evil.

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:37.340
Many of us have a duel.

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:40.170
We'll find ourselves being loyal
to our backgrounds, when

00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:42.630
we'd never even thought
about it.

00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:45.870
But there tend to
be these groups.

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:50.820
People who are in the arts,
believe me, they have a real

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:52.440
different set of values.

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.110
RICK KLEFFEL: We have another
question over there.

00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:56.620
LOGAN: Hi, my name is Logan.

00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:57.930
Thank you so much for coming.

00:53:57.930 --> 00:53:59.170
It's an honor to
have you here.

00:53:59.170 --> 00:53:59.840
TOM WOLFE: Well,
you're welcome.

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:01.930
LOGAN: As someone who's spent
his career interested in

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:04.740
class, and observing class in
America, I was wondering if

00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:07.180
you could speak a little bit
about this election cycle.

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.900
I feel like that's something
that's really come up a lot.

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:12.670
And even in the last six months,
and before that with

00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:14.240
Occupy Wall Street, it's
very relevant.

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.230
So I'd love to hear your
opinion about that.

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:21.140
TOM WOLFE: They've tried, and
the press has tried to help,

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:27.340
too, to turn this into
a class election.

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.710
The 1% against the 99%.

00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:34.990
Somewhere, the lower
class disappeared.

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:38.270
Everyone talks about
the middle class.

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:40.350
What's this middle class?

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:41.520
I don't get it.

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:42.710
Whatever you want it to be.

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:43.860
It includes,

00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:46.280
RICK KLEFFEL: Tyrannosaurus
rex, brontosaurus--

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:51.000
TOM WOLFE: Anybody who is
employed even as an intern is

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.145
part of the middle class now.

00:54:54.145 --> 00:54:58.160
And on both sides, we hear--

00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:02.980
Mitt Romney and his
first rally I saw.

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:06.640
I mean, my god, are his
beginnings humble.

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.630
Obama, the same way.

00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:10.280
Oh my god, are his beginnings
humble.

00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:11.780
And he's come up from nowhere.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:14.290
So has Mitt Romney.

00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:20.560
This is not a sign of a
class-ridden society.

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:26.940
If your credentials have to
include failure, obscurity,

00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:30.170
that's not a class-ridden
society.

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:31.870
In England--

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:34.370
probably the same thing's
true now--

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:39.180
when people go to visit the
poor, they dress up.

00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:40.550
In a way, I suppose, to
show them what they

00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:42.220
could become someday.

00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:45.770
In this country, if we have a
contractor coming over to do

00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:48.450
some demolition in the house,
everybody takes off their

00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:53.830
jackets, their neckties, the
shirts they put on, their

00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:55.962
turtleneck sweaters.

00:55:55.962 --> 00:56:02.570
They don't want to look wrong
when these working men arrive.

00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:04.230
Of course, the working men say,
oh, these poor people,

00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:06.460
they're reduced to rags.

00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:10.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:10.310 --> 00:56:11.980
TOM WOLFE: Thomas Jefferson
took care of class in this

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:14.380
country, and it has
never reappeared.

00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:19.110
When America was finally
recognized by England, and the

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:24.330
British ambassador arrives for
this historic meeting in the

00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:29.060
White House, he's wearing some
kind of military cap from god

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:29.540
knows when.

00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:31.565
He has a ceremonial sword.

00:56:31.565 --> 00:56:34.630
It's about this long,
but it's a sword.

00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:36.260
All sorts of trappings.

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:39.450
Jefferson meets him in
his bedroom slippers.

00:56:39.450 --> 00:56:40.250
It wasn't the bedroom.

00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:43.460
But he comes out in his bedroom
slippers to the great

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:45.862
portico as you go in
the White House.

00:56:45.862 --> 00:56:50.085
And dinner, here's the British
ambassador and his wife, and

00:56:50.085 --> 00:56:54.540
all these dignitaries, mostly
American, who are there.

00:56:54.540 --> 00:56:55.840
And he says, well,
this dinner's

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:59.050
going to be pell mell.

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:01.170
They say, what do you
mean, pell mell?

00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:03.650
He said, well, if you see a seat
you like, and you're near

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:07.020
it, take it.

00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:09.750
And they found that all the
tables were round so that

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:11.700
there was no head
of the table.

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:15.940
This was all thought
out by Jefferson.

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:20.940
And the only person who's taken
to a seat, and assigned

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:23.520
seat, was the wife
of ambassador.

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:27.190
And Jefferson seated
her next to him.

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:28.950
Everybody else, including
the ambassador, had

00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:30.800
to rush to a seat.

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:33.400
And if it was occupied,
well, it was too bad.

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:37.016
It was this pell mell system.

00:57:37.016 --> 00:57:42.820
And these things were all done
by Jefferson to say, that old

00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:45.070
stuff is over.

00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:46.640
We are not in Europe.

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:50.600
He made John Marshall, the Chief
Justice of the United

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.950
States take the ribbons--

00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:56.440
he had noticed in Europe, the
Chief Judge would often have

00:57:56.440 --> 00:58:01.020
these golden ribbons across
the black robe--

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:03.760
he made Marshall take his off.

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:06.050
We're not going to
have that stuff.

00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:08.860
RICK KLEFFEL: What we are
going to have is this.

00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:13.750
An America that has gone
"Back to Blood," and

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:16.160
YouTube, as it were.

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:19.830
TOM WOLFE: I explained that I
don't mind horror fiction when

00:58:19.830 --> 00:58:20.790
people are thinking
of buying my book.

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:23.610
But it's not wet blood.

00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:25.990
It's bloodlines.

00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:26.520
RICK KLEFFEL: Bloodlines.

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:28.215
TOM WOLFE: I should
warn you of that.

00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:32.620
RICK KLEFFEL: Ladies and
gentlemen, we have been graced

00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:34.330
to have with us Tom Wolfe.

00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:36.840
He is the author of "The
Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,"

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:39.625
"The Right Stuff," and his
newest novel is "Back to

00:58:39.625 --> 00:58:40.840
Blood." Thank you
for joining me.

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.080
And thank you for
joining me, Tom.

00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:43.080
It was a pleasure.

00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:43.800
TOM WOLFE: Thanks.

00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:44.700
I enjoyed this.

00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:45.950
Thank you very much.
