00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280
however at Google we wanted to
 

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.280
however at Google we wanted to
standardize on this output so that

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:03.290
standardize on this output so that
 

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:05.080
standardize on this output so that
there's more consistency in the
