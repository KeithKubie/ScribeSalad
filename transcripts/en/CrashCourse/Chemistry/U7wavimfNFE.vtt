00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
There are some of you out there, taking chemistry,

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.840
and feeling a little bit like there's an international body whose job is simply to make your life more difficult,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.020
to force you to cram tons of information into
your head,

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.849
to suck all the wonder and excitement out
of learning about how the world works

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.430
at this beautiful, fundamental level of chemicals.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.930
You are not actually imagining this.
That organization actually exists.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.619
It's called the International Union of Pure
and Applied Chemists or IUPAC,

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.050
and really, they’re looking out for your
best interests,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.560
in just the same way that my mom was looking
out for my best interests

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.390
when she said that I couldn’t go to the
“Violent Femmes” concert with Megan Cross.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.680
And yeah, I hated my mom for, like, a full year after that but she was right, that girl was trouble.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.100
So yes, you are allowed to hate IUPAC for
changing the name of ‘cinnamaldehyde’,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.560
the aldehyde that makes cinnamon smell like
cinnamon to ‘trans-3-phenylprop-2-enal’.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.480
Yes, they’re sucking all the fun out of the world, but trust me when I say, they’re doing it for your own good.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:03.120
[Theme Music]

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.180
‘Cinnamaldehyde’ is a lovely name for
a lovely aldehyde,

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.640
just like ‘cadaverine’ is a creative name
for a rancid-smelling amine.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.780
‘Citronellol’, ‘angelic acid’, ‘vanillin’,
they’re beautiful names,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.900
but there are tens of thousands of regularly
used organic compounds,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.860
and we can’t come up with pretty names for
all of them.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.730
More important than that, though, there’s
no way to

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.070
translate those names into chemical formulas
and IUPAC hates that.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.730
They’re like, “Cinnamaldehyde, yeah, sure,
gives cinnamon its lovely smell,

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.380
but we think ‘trans-3-phenylprop-2-enal’
is way better of a name!”

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.990
And it actually is, because if I say ’trans-3-phenylprop-2-enal’
to somebody properly educated,

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.790
they can just write down the chemical structure
without even thinking about it.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.400
And that’s, like, almost a kind of magic, where words go from relating to reality as we experience it

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.210
(this chemical comes from cinnamon so name
it after cinnamon)

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.580
to relating to the actual physical reality of the universe, and that’s a magic worth knowing.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.880
IUPAC created a language that could be understood
by everyone with minimal,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.000
even zero misinterpretation and that’s no
easy feat.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.260
That’s why, as we’ve discussed organic
chemistry,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.980
when we start counting carbons, we make sure
that the first thing named on the molecule

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.920
is the lowest possible carbon,

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.100
not because there’s something special about lower numbers but because they had to make a rule,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.580
otherwise one chemical could be named two
different ways.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.830
Let’s go through the process of naming a
chemical, it’s a multi-step process.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.820
Step 1: how long is the carbon chain?

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.160
Five carbons will have ‘pent-’, seven
‘sept-’, three ‘prop-’, one ‘meth-’

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.690
Don’t feel weird if you have to look these
up.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.010
I, for example, had no idea that a twenty-three
carbon atom chain had the prefix ‘tricosa-’,

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.480
until I looked it up just now.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.860
The only tricky thing here is to make sure
you find the longest carbon chain.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.920
Sometimes, a hexane can look like a pentane
with an ethane sticking off of it.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.780
So now that you know your longest carbon chain, you’ve got your prefix, time to figure out the suffix.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.880
If there’s nothing but hydrogen and carbon,

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.600
your suffix just depends on whether you have
any double bonds or triple bonds;

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.260
you know these, propane, propene, propyne.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.320
Then there are a ton of other groups that
can change the suffix.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.760
Like last week we talked about alcohols and
aldehydes and ketones,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.500
but we didn’t talk about how they affect
nomenclature and boy do they.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.240
When working with functional groups, each one adds a particular suffix to the end of the name of a compound.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.840
Usually, these are pretty easy to remember because they come straight off the name of the functional group.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.560
Alcohols add an ‘-ol’, so for methane
you drop the ‘e’ and you get methanol;

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.840
ethane, you get ethanol.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.860
Aldehydes, instead of ‘-ol’ you add ‘-al’,
so from ethane you get ethanal.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.260
Ketones, add '-one', so a ketone of a hexane
would be hexanone,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.350
and amines, you just add '-amine' to the end
so methenamine or propanamine. Super easy.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.569
For caboxylic acids, you have to identify
it's an acid, so you end in acid, that's obvious,

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.420
but instead of adding '-ylic' you add '-oic'.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.880
As far as I can tell, this is just because ethanoic acid is much more fun to say than ethanylic acid.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.709
Going over that again: alcohol, on an ethane,
is ethanol, aldehydes add '-al' giving ethanal,

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.800
ketones add '-one' pronounced 'eth/an/own',
amines, add amine for ethanamine,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.450
and carboxylic acid, on an ethane, is ethanoic
acid.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.930
And of course, there are literally dozens of other named functional groups that will change the suffix.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.650
It's terrible, that's why they're on Wikipedia.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.520
So if you got a functional group, there's
a name that defines the suffix of the molecule,

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.130
and that is called the parent functional group.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.880
Now it is perfectly possible that a molecule
will have two different functional groups,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.400
so how do we know which one is the parent?
Which one defines the suffix?

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.750
Well, different groups have different precedence.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.870
The most weighted of all is the carboxylic
acid functional group,

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.640
so no matter what else is on a six carbon chain, if there's a carboxylic acid, then it's a hexanoic acid.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.860
That precedence is decided by a list that
was, you guessed it,

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.960
created by IUPAC to minimize confusion by
creating yet more rules.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.639
The list is linked in the description.

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.080
OK, so now we have created our base name for
the molecule;

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.680
it's time to start looking at what else is
attached to it.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.700
Any side chains or functional groups sticking
off the side have to be identified and named.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.600
If it's a six carbon chain with a carboxylic acid on it and an alcohol on one of the other carbons,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:01.080
our name has to do two things: identify that the hydroxyl group is there and identify where it is.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.480
If it's got a double bond, we likewise have to identify that it is there and where it is, all with our words.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.020
Use your words! Also, use your numbers.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.220
Counting out carbons can be a little confusing
but try it both ways, in both directions,

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.300
to make sure that you get the lowest possible
number on the group that defines your suffix.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.220
All right, enough of the talking, let's try
to do some actual examples here.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.920
I mentioned earlier angelic acid.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.340
It's not actually particularly angelic, it was just named after a flower it was derived from.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.280
But it's actually found all over the place
in nature,

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.230
so 'angelic acid' tells us pretty much nothing
about the molecule, except that it's acidic.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.330
So in order to figure out the structure I
have to look it up.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.060
That's no fun, but here it is.
Let's figure out a better name for it.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.720
Count up the carbons, 1-2-3 if you count that chain, 1-2-3-4 if you count this one so it's a butane derivative.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.080
Actually it's a butene derivative because
it has that double bond.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.320
It's also got the carboxylic acid though,
so let's go ahead and call it butenoic acid.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.580
Except that there's a methyl group sticking
off so it's methylbutanoic acid.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.780
Of course, with that name, without any numbers, no one has any idea where anything is on the chain,

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.320
so, time to number.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:10.870
From this direction, 1-2-3-4
we get 3-methylbut-2-en-4-oic acid,
which is obviously wrong.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.980
Mostly because that parent functional group, the one that defines the suffix, is supposed to be as low as possible

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.240
and in fact it is as high as possible, so
that can't be right.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.780
Also it just sounds terrible.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.440
Numbering the other way, 1-2-3-4, the carboxylic
acid is on carbon 1 (that's pretty ideal).

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.030
The double bond and the methyl group are both
on the second carbon, much better,

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.090
and thus it is named 2-methylbut-2-enoic acid.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.360
Two important notes here, if the parent functional group is on carbon one we just leave the number off.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.480
And two, there's a double bond in this molecule and we haven't identified whether it's cis or trans,

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.590
and we can't do that so we haven't actually
completely named it.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.610
We should stick a cis in front of the name because the carbon chain continues on the same side,

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.440
not the opposite side as it would be in the
trans form.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.550
Of course, it works both ways, that's the
beauty of it,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.570
you can build a name from a molecule and a
molecule from a name.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.370
Earlier, I told you that cinnamaldehyde was
trans 3-phenylprop-2-enal.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.360
Can you build it? Well, start with the three carbon chain, because of that prop, and count out the carbons, 1-2-3.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.780
We know, because it's prop-2-enal with that
'e'

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.900
there's a double bond from the second to third
carbon and we know it's trans.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.050
We also know that there's a phenyl group on
the third carbon.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:20.310
The word ends in a non-numbered '-al', so finally we can stick an aldehyde on carbon number one,

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.280
and yeah, that was actually pretty easy!

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.070
Now look, IUPAC does it's best but past a
certain point of complexity,

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:32.100
no one expects anyone to know all this by heart unless you work for them and name compounds for a living.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.220
That's why we have the internet and textbooks
and libraries to go look things up.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.020
Because I'm a dork, I actually find these things to be kinda delightful puzzles and they're often super fun for me,

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.660
but taken one or two steps beyond the level
of complexity we have here,

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.320
my personal viewpoint is that you're better off looking it up than memorizing the novel-sized list of

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.380
functional groups, names, precedence lists,
prefixes and suffixes.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:59.780
As long as you can recognize why trans 3-phenylprop-2-enal
is in fact a superior name to cinnamaldehyde,

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.460
and no, I am not going to do the cinnamon
challenge. Ever.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.720
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.490
if you were paying attention you learned that
IUPAC is

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.030
the international organization responsible
for your unhappiness,

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.880
and that their goal is to create a system
where

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.410
every organic compound has one and only one
name to prevent confusion.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.250
They do this by giving prefixes to compounds
for the number of carbons in a chain,

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:26.630
suffixes based on parent functional groups, and ranking functional groups somewhat arbitrarily for precedence.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.889
You also learned that you have to number your
carbon chains,

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:31.789
so that your parent functional group has the
lowest possible number,

00:08:31.789 --> 00:08:35.550
and that double bonds require you to label
the molecule as either cis or trans,

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:39.550
and hopefully, you learned that this is a
kind of word magic worth learning.

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:43.649
