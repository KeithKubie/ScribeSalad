just to prove that he is not using the

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.969
 
so he's not looking at the screen at all

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
so he's not looking at the screen at all
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.530
so he's not looking at the screen at all
and yet he's still able to play the game

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540
and yet he's still able to play the game
 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.380

cut out a lot of the game mechanics and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040
cut out a lot of the game mechanics and

cut out a lot of the game mechanics and
higher-level strategies that you might

so in racing games for example there are

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730
so in racing games for example there are
 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.309
so in racing games for example there are
no concepts of cutting corners or they

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319
no concepts of cutting corners or they
 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.270

information and so here our goal was to

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310

give people who are blind an authentic

give people who are blind an authentic
 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.589
