00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.530
Why is it, that we’re incapable of smelling
our own houses?

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.029
Turns out, it’s your brain’s fault.

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:07.829
THANKS A LOT, BRAIN.

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:16.129
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and have you
ever arrived home from vacation, only to have

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.670
your nostrils assaulted as soon as you open
the door?

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.700
“Why does my house smell so bad?” you
might say, as you furiously scramble to find

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.590
the source - but what you may not realize,
is that maybe your house always smells bad.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.910
Maybe you don’t notice it, because you’ve
gotten used to it - which is an even more

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.910
terrifying thought.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.780
But it turns out, that’s exactly what happens.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.320
It’s called “sensory adaptation,” and
Pamela Dalton, a cognitive psychologist at

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.530
Monell Chemical Senses Center, has devoted
decades of her career to studying this phenomenon.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.690
She explains it, by using the example of a
chemical air freshener.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.170
When you first start to use one, the odor
molecules travel through your nose and hit

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.420
your odor receptors, which then send signals
up to your olfactory bulb in the brain’s

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.420
limbic system.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.760
This is the part of your brain associated
with emotion and behavior, but it’s also

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.890
used to detect incoming threats.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.510
Obviously, a chemical air freshener poses
no threat, and your brain recognizes that,

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.170
so almost immediately, it starts to switch
off the receptors in your nose - and that’s

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.899
why the intensity of the smell starts to fade
quickly.

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:11.899
But why does this happen?

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.790
Is it to preserve resources?

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.719
Well, we’re not exactly sure.

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.680
But the leading theory, is that by adapting
to the smells in our environment, it allows

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.319
us to quickly detect new changes, that could
be potentially threatening.

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.459
So if your house was musty, for example, and
that was all you ever smelled - then you might

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:29.999
be unaware if something else in your house,
started rotting.

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:34.409
It makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint
- but then why is this phenomenon exclusive

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.549
to our sense of smell?

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.340
It’s not like staring at something for a
long time, makes you go temporarily blind.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.399
And yeah, you can start to tune out noises
after a while - but if somebody comes up to

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.979
you and starts talking, you immediately snap
out of it.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.329
With smells, though, you can’t really do
that - once you’re used to the way something

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.450
smells, the only way to actively detect it
after a while - is to leave the area and come

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.450
back.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.799
Interestingly, though, there is another way
to slow down the adaptation process, and that’s

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.119
physical activity - or really, anything that
increases blood flow.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.299
Dalton points out that scientists who work
at perfumeries - will sometimes run and up

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.849
and down stairs, to regain their sense of
smell.

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:10.920
Although perfumery is probably one of the
few careers where you’d need to actually

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.870
smell things all the time, it is worth noting
that being overly concerned about smells - can

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.480
actually make you more sensitive TO them.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.379
In her interview, Dalton recalls a study in
which she exposed 3 groups of people to the

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.799
same scent - telling the first group it was
a “rainforest extract,” the second group

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.670
that it was a standard scent used by her lab,
and the third group, an industrial solvent.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.120
Sure enough, the people who thought they were
smelling industrial solvent, were also the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.110
slowest to adapt to the scent.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.129
Which coincides with the fact that we adapt
to smells we consider non-threatening.

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.400
It really is quite amazing, just how efficient
the human body is.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.860
And speaking of the human body, let me remind
you all that I host another show here on Discovery

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.040
called Anyhoo, and wouldn’t you know - I
just recorded an episode about scientists

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.909
successfully calculating the ideal proportions
for various body parts.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.470

perfect belly button looks like - then click
