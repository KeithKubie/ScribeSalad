00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.850
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome everybody
to one more Talks at Google

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:06.110
today.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.200
Our guest is Jan Jarboe Russell.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.120
She is a journalist.

Her newest book is "The
Train to Crystal City."

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.380
Jan Jarboe Russell is a Nieman
Fellow, a contributing editor

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.340
for the "Texas Monthly."

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.900
She has written for
the "San Antonio

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.280
Express News," "The New
York Times," "Slate,"

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.940
and other magazines.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.530
Jan is the author also of

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.330
Russell, Jr.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.720
In "The Train to
Crystal City," you'll

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.540
encounter the secret history
of an American internment camp

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.630
in Crystal City, Texas, where
men of German, Japanese,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.320
and Italian descent and
their families, many of whom

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.040
were US citizens, were
ripped from their homes

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.340
across the United
States and Latin America

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.710
and deposited in Crystal
City without due process.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.300
Please welcome Jan
Jarboe Russell to Google.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.420
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL:
Thank you so much.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.570
I am from Texas.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.400
And I do bring greetings
and gratitude to Google

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.160
for connecting us to our world.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.660
You know, Texas can be a
kind of dry and arid place

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.290
in all ways, intellectually
as well as the land area.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.170
And so I was asked by
a poet friend of mine

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.880
to tell you that Google
is like the sap of a very

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.710
nice tree, lots and
lots of things going on.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.060
In 2010, when I started
work on this book,

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.230
I just never thought that the
book would be so of the moment.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.640
But ironically, the
presidential rhetoric

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.420
that we're hearing
today is remarkably

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.990
similar to the kind
of debates that we

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.020
were hearing after the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.340
Then, it was the
Japanese, the immigrants

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.500
from what they call Axis
Nations-- Japan, Germany,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.880
and Italy.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.280
And those were the ones
that were targeted.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.550
But now, of course, it's
Latinos and Muslims.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.840
The Enemy Alien Act of
1798 gives the president,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.480
then and now, the
power to simply take

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.360
a person who is a legal
or an illegal immigrant

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.390
from a country that
we are at war with.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.600
So this rule, this law,
is still in effect.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.630
And it means that the next
president could indeed

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.050
set up internment camps
if he wanted to, certainly

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.680
could build a wall.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.040
And so while this history may
seem remote to some of you,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.890
it is, in fact,
absolutely current

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.300
in terms of legal
and other matters.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.160
As many of you know, after
the attack on Pearl Harbor,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.390
Roosevelt shifted
his whole emphasis

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.430
from The New Deal, which
was the policies that were

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.120
at home, to the war effort.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.090
And he was much more aggressive
and angry at the Germans

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.900
and the Italians
and the Japanese

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.430
than we have yet to know.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.920
Most everyone knows, of course,
about the 120,000 Japanese

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.130
and Japanese-Americans that
were taken during the war.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.980
But we now know that there were
a lot more Germans and Italians

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.910
as well taken, and that there
were more in internment camps

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.930
than we knew.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.510
I personally have found
80 different camps.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.920
And so in this picture,
this was the photograph

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.920
of the Roosevelts' December
1942 Christmas card.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.550
And in this picture, Eleanor
has fought against internment

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.930
of citizens and had in
fact, come to San Francisco

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.810
and told the Japanese,
don't worry about a thing.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.020
And Roosevelt, he
thought that Germany

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.440
would get us into the war.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.900
In fact, he said, Germany first.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.300
And so he told his
attorney general,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.850
I don't really care that
much about the Italians.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.420
But I'm really worried
about these Germans.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.470
But the Italians, they're
just a bunch of opera singers.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.440
So he was very, very
angry at the Germans

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.200
and wanted to intern a
whole lot of them, something

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.770
that we didn't know.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.740
This is the history
of the camp that you

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:07.730
do know, the evacuation of
the people from the West Coast

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.320
that were Japanese-Americans.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.880
If you had 1/16 of an ounce of
Japanese blood in your veins,

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.460
you were considered
Japanese and taken

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.890
to what were called the
10 relocation camps.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.830
This is a very
important photograph

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.450
by the great photographer,
Dorothea Lange, who documented

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.360
the evacuation of the Japanese.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.300
And it's about one
of the characters

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.660
in my book from San
Francisco, the Fukuda family.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.560
This is Mrs. Fukuda.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.430
This is her daughter Makiko
and some of her other children.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.040
The reasons I like
this is that it

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.050
brings to mind the details of
the photograph, the humanity

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.060
of these people.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.270
She was pregnant.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.900
And so that's why she
looks a little large.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.340
But see how carefully
that they are dressed.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.340
The Japanese could only
take what they could carry.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.430
They lost everything else.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.810
And so you see what
she is carrying here.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.570
This man in the photograph
is now 80 years old

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.370
and lives in San Francisco,
having survived the war.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.770
And by the same token, you
see the army people here

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.030
that are also well-dressed
and putting them on the bus.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.600
She went to Santa
Anita Race Track,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:34.440
where she gave birth to her
last son in a horse stable.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.470
And you know, if that,
the smell of horse

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.670
manure, in that stable.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.740
and that was her last pregnancy.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.550
She was married to
Reverend Fukuda, who

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.750
has had the Konko Church
in San Francisco, which

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.420
still is in an existence
in San Francisco.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:03.140
They took the ministers
of all three countries

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.540
first because they
were considered

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.430
leaders of their country.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.900
So Fukuda who was arrested
because he was a preacher.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.750
And none of the
enemy alien fathers

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.250
were charged with any crime.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.680
They did not know how long
their internment would be.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.050
And they had no way to
hire a lawyer or anything.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.170
They were arrested not
because the government found

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.130
them personally to be
saboteurs, but because they

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.690
were citizens of the country
that we were suddenly

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.090
at war with.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:44.940
I love this photograph of
Mrs. Fukuda and her son, Nob,

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.450
because you can see
her magnificent face

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:53.130
and her humanity as she
is being carted off.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:58.000
My book, "The Camp in Crystal
City," served two purposes.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.120
One of them could be
considered humane.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.190
And that is that when enemy
alien fathers were arrested,

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.700
they lost everything.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.910
They lost their businesses.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.290
They lost their homes.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.580
And if they were
Japanese, the families

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.720
could go to the
relocation camps.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.300
If you were Italian or
German, you had nowhere to go.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.580
You could either go to
county relief or whatever.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:30.130
So the government said, we need
to get these families together.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.909
And so they created the
only internment camp

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:37.580
of multiple nationalities
in Crystal City, Texas.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.470
And while that seems to
be a humanitarian thing

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.590
to do, of course, there's no
such thing as a good internment

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.670
camp.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:51.090
The second reason was
even more hard to believe

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.390
and more mind-boggling.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:58.430
The camp in Crystal City served
as the center of Roosevelt's

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:00.730
prisoner exchange program.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.900
Over the course
of the war, there

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.600
were six different
prisoner exchanges,

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.540
where we traded people
from Crystal City, which

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.470
became the center of
the exchanges, all

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.570
of the exchanges.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.530
We traded German
fathers and mothers

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.560
and their American-born children
for ostensibly more important

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.290
Americans that were
trapped in Germany.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.630
The same happened in Italy.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.800
And he created this
camp in Crystal City.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.920
The State Department created it.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.570
It was called Quiet Passage.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:41.055
And they put these
people in these camps.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.670
And in order to be reunited
with their families,

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.720
they each had to sign a paper
saying that if the government

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.870
needed you to go back to
your country of origin

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.090
that you would.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:01.950
And that was the price for being
reunited with their parents.

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.540
My book tells the
stories from the point

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.100
of view of two teenaged
girls and their families,

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:17.950
both of whom became barter
in the prisoner exchange.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:19.560
They were American-born girls.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.600
The first was Ingrid.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.990
This is the Eiserloh family.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.390
And they are from
Cleveland, Ohio.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:28.890
This is Ingrid.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.230
This is Ensila.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.130
This is Lothar.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.180
And this is Johanna.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.650
Their father Matthias
had been arrested.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.630
The FBI had three categories
for who could be arrested.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.610
Category A was if you were
a member of the Nazi party,

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:49.680
you were arrested, or
the equivalent of that

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.100
in the Japanese and
Italian communities.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.305
Category B was if you had an
occupation which our government

00:10:57.305 --> 00:11:00.510
thought might be
useful to our enemies,

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.880
then you were arrested.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.200
And that was how
Matthias became arrested.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:12.080
He was an engineer, an
honorable occupation.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.180
And he was an engineer
in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.770
And he had built a lot
of roads and bridges.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.500
And the FBI, when I got
his FBI file declassified,

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.030
it said that if he could
build these roads and bridges

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.600
that he could blow them up.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.960
And so he was arrested
and taken away.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.630
And this particular
photograph of the family

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.410
is the last photograph
they had in their home

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:42.370
because four months after
Matthias was arrested,

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:43.800
they didn't have any more money.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.320
In those days, Johanna
had had a little farm.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.180
But she had no real job.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.930
And so they were either
going to go to county relief,

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.010
or they could go
to Crystal City.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:59.130
And so, of course, they
decided to go to Crystal City.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:03.060
This is Sumi Utsushigawa.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.790
And this is her in the middle.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:10.150
And she lived up here on
First Street in San Francisco.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:17.340
Her father Tom and her
mother Nobu were, of course,

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.980
Japanese immigrants
to this country.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.430
At that time, Japanese were
not allowed to become citizens

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:28.450
under the 1925 Immigration Act.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:33.500
And so Tom settled
in Little Tokyo.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:39.510
And he became the most
successful photographer

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:45.090
in San Francisco.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:51.160
And in those days, a camera was
a little bit like an iPhone.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:57.130
And they were contraband
for Japanese people.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:00.500
They were not allowed
to have cellphones

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.570
because the government had an
idea that, for instance-- maybe

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.620
some of you knew this--
that some of the crops that

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.320
were growing in the
San Joaquin Valley

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:14.156
were pointed as arrows
to military bases.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.290
And they didn't want people
taking photographs of this

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.470
to send to the Japanese.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.470
Now, there were no indication
that that was the case.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:31.890
But that was the day when
fear and scapegoating--

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.040
I guess that never goes
away, fear and scapegoating--

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.730
came to be.

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:39.110
And so Tom was taken.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.920
I wanted to tell you a
little bit about the camp.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.010
The camp was secret
because according

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.200
to the Geneva Convention, if
you build an internment camp,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:55.410
it shouldn't be any more than
one group, like only Japanese.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.510
Well, from the
beginning, this one

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:02.450
was going to be multiple
nationalities of Germans,

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:03.910
Italians, and Japanese.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.930
And because Roosevelt was trying
to create a pool of people

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.320
to exchange in prisoner
exchange, what you're

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:16.160
trying to constantly do is
trade a low-value target

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.890
for yourself.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.050
So we're trading
those low-value people

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.860
into Germany, Japan, and Italy.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:29.200
And in return, we're hoping to
get a high-value target, which

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.630
Roosevelt had already said
that that was POW's, prisoners

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:37.480
of war, and anyone that
was an American businessman

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.980
or a missionary or
an American teacher

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.560
that he was going to
try to get them out.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.340
So when ordered to do that,
under the terms of the Good

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.920
Neighbor Policy
of Latin America,

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:53.965
he convinced 12
Latin-American countries

00:14:53.965 --> 00:14:57.720
to take the properties
of Germans, Italians,

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.270
and Japanese.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:04.280
And then those people were
put onto American ships.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.080
And they were taken to
the Port of New Orleans.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:16.510
This is about 2,000 Germans,
about 1,050 Japanese,

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:20.220
and about 500 Italians.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.720
They were taken to the
Port of New Orleans, where

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.540
they were arrested
as illegal aliens

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.980
and sent to Crystal City.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.730
I interviewed more
than 70 children

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:38.810
who were alive and lived and
were children in the Crystal

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:43.110
City camp, including
several of these people that

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.010
were from Latin America.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:49.400
For instance, Carmen
Mochizuki lived in Peru.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.320
Her father was working at
a sake factory in Peru.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.270
And this whole thing happened.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.630
They arrived in New Orleans.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:02.170
And she remembers that they
were sprayed with things

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.280
to make sure they weren't
carrying any disease.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.740
And then they were
put on the train

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.230
to be taken to
Crystal City, Texas.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:12.580
And she thought--
her mother said,

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.380
I think we will be killed there.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.930
And that's her first
memory of her whole life.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.510
And they weren't killed there.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:24.290
But they were traded into
Japan at the end of the war

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.840
as part of the prisoner
exchange program.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.070
This is Earl Harrison.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.980
He was the head of the INS.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:32.670
He was the one who
found the location.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:36.140
What they were looking
for was something

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.600
far from a military
installation,

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.340
far from the East
and West Coasts,

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.780
and someplace that not
everybody knew about.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:48.410
Crystal City, Texas is 35
miles from the Mexican border.

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.956
It is a tiny little town.

00:16:51.956 --> 00:16:54.470
And when Earl
Harrison got there,

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:58.110
there was tumbleweed rolling.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.410
The main street was a dirt road.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:05.540
But there was a migrant workers
camp there that had 198 acres.

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.990
And the migrants were
Mexican migrants.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:09.550
And they weren't there.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:13.800
And so in his diary, he
said that Crystal City was

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.250
as close to Siberia
as we have in America

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.670
and therefore, a perfect place
for the Crystal City camp.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.359
190 acres.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:28.500
This is Joseph O'Rourke, who
was the commandant of the camp.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.080
He was a border patrol agent
from Buffalo, New York.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.540
And as an aside, he was kind
of down and out at that point.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.630
He was a Catholic
guy from Buffalo.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.440
And his wife was perhaps
a little too Catholic.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.940
And they had split up.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:47.340
And he had a bit of
a drinking problem.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.670
And so he came to Crystal City.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.610
And it actually
turned his life around

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:55.040
because he became very close
to the children in the camp.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.910
As I said, this is an
overview of the camp.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.250
You can see how it is.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.570
It had six guard towers.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:06.980
And the guards or border patrol
agents are Texas Rangers.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.150
And they had their guns
trained on the people

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.050
in the camp at all times.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:16.486
The penalty for escape
from the camp was death.

00:18:16.486 --> 00:18:20.390
In the whole history of the
camp, which opened in 1942

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:24.600
and did not close until
1948, three whole years

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.280
after the war was over-- in
the entire history of the camp,

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.300
there was never an
attempt at escape.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.620
It had six guard towers.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.740
And this is the barbed wire.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.910
I mean, most internment
camps or concentration camps

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:41.060
look the same.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:46.470
They have guard towers
and barbed wire fences.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:53.290
And Texas Rangers patrol
the area outside the fence.

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:59.835
This is O'Rourke on his horse
patrolling inside the fence.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.120
There's nothing black
or white about my book

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:11.590
because the odd thing about it
is that as internment camps go,

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.620
this was a humane
internment camp.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.950
Nobody went hungry
in Crystal City.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.250
There was plenty of food because
everybody worked in the camp.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:24.330
They all grew their own food.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:28.840
And the kids that are now
in their 80's and 90's were

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.360
so grateful to be reunited
with their families,

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.300
even behind barbed wire.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.960
This is a picture of some
Japanese kids playing

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.090
on the Japanese side of camp.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:47.370
But the thing was,
like other camps,

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:52.010
there was a dossier on
every person, which was good

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.060
because when I got the records
from the National Archives,

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.690
everybody was accounted
for week by week,

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:03.920
day by day, so I was able to
bring them alive in the book.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.890
But every morning they had
to get out for family camp.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.890
So they had a count.

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.510
So they had people that came
and counted them to make

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:13.842
sure they were still there.

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:20.930
Each family got 500 square feet.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:23.560
And so if you had a
family of one child,

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.110
you probably did
fine in that camp.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:32.750
But if you had seven children,
they had to sleep outside.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:37.180
All of the incoming
mail was censored.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:41.790
And no one was allowed in
the camp except the guards.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.600
So their relationship
to the outside world

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.930
was completely nonexistent.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.860
Having said that, there were
three schools in the camp.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:57.265
This is Sumi, my main
Japanese-American girl.

00:20:59.845 --> 00:21:03.950
And she went to what was
called the American School.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:09.030
And that was taught by
Texas certified teachers.

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:12.000
And there was also
a German school

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.580
taught by German internees,
and an Italian school.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.790
And there was a school
taught only in Spanish

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:25.020
for all the people
from Latin America.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:25.560
That's Sumi.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.590
They had a Girl Scouts
in their schools.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.840
And there they are.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.310
Everybody was divided.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.630
There was very
little interaction

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.240
between the Germans
and the Japanese.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.670
And especially, they
did not get along.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:44.860
There was a lot of problems in
the camps between the Germans

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.180
and the Japanese.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:50.270
These are German barbers.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.460
They were paid for their work
in what was called camp tokens.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.870
They were little, small tokens.

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.440
And they redeemed these
at the general store

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.640
for various items.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.820
They made their own mattresses.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.290
They made their own clothes.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:14.810
And this is Japanese camp
women who were making something

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:15.670
with sewing.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.060
The kids that I interviewed said
that the worst thing about it

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:28.120
was how hot it was-- 125
degrees in the summer--

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.760
and also that the place was
crawling with rattlesnakes

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.670
and scorpions.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:36.100
And so there were deaths
from rattle snakes,

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.930
including children.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.780
And there were other
kinds of deaths, too.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.480
Some of the people
from Latin America

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.930
did bring whooping cough
and those kind of things.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.240
And that kind of deal
spread through the camp.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.200
Anyway, but the Japanese, what
they really hated was they

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.750
didn't like American food.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.880
And so they asked
O'Rourke-- he had

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.832
a spokesman for the Japanese,
a spokesman for the German.

00:23:01.832 --> 00:23:04.040
And the Japanese spokesman
went to O'Rourke and said,

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.570
well, we just can't
stand this American food

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:08.920
of beef and chicken.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.860
We would like to
build a tofu factory.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.340
And so after that,
O'Rourke went and learned

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.560
about how to make--
with the Japanese,

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.550
he learned what was needed.

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:23.100
We're a long way from any
ocean in Crystal City.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.530
And one of the things that
is needed to make tofu

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.160
is sea water.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.980
And so they finally
figured it out.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.980
And they used a victory hut.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:37.250
And they built the first tofu
of factory in Texas, for sure.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:40.370
And the Japanese were
very, very happy.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:46.190
And the wives brought their
tofu every day to their kitchens

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.780
and cooked.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.920
And when the Germans found
out, they were furious

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:55.530
that the Japanese got the
tofu, and said, we want beer.

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:59.510
And so they built a small
beer hall in the camp.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:01.220
And this is the beer hall.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:07.110
And this was a place that
O'Rourke, the commandant,

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.040
frequented very often.

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:11.400
Supposedly, there was a
rule that you could only

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.840
brew beer once a week.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:17.290
But this was an often
violated rule in the camp.

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:21.290
Because it was so hot,
they had to create

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:26.080
a giant-- it functioned
as a reservoir

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:31.230
to water the citrus
yards and everything.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:35.330
And then, because it was so hot,
ostensibly allowed the children

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.670
to swim in this.

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:42.860
And that's the only thing that
saved the kids in the camp.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:46.080
All of the kids remembered
the days of swimming.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:53.850
These are Germans building
the swimming pool.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:59.560
And this is just Japanese
internees that had gone by

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.390
and picked up a Christmas tree.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:06.740
And just an indication of
what daily life was like.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:11.030
But by far, the most
mind-boggling aspects-- and I

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.890
wanted to get to it
quickly before I stop--

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:18.460
was the fact that Crystal City
was the center of prisoner

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.090
exchange.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:23.180
In order to create
this pool of internees,

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:27.730
they had to gather
increasing numbers of people.

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:31.530
I was not aware that prisoner
exchange has been going on

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.640
since the and in
every war we've ever

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:39.810
fought, beginning in the
American war for independence

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.140
against the British.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:43.990
And this has gone
on in every war.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:49.800
And it always comes out
many, many years afterwards.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:55.710
And of course, to find out
that we needed six of them

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:57.880
during the war, and
all from Crystal City,

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.660
was very shocking to me.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.690
The first one was
in June of 1942,

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.960
only six months
after Pearl Harbor.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.820
And in that thing, you can
feel pretty good about it

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.220
because a lot of the
people we got back

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:17.480
were our diplomats that
were trapped in Japan

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:22.450
and a lot of missionaries that
were there and businessmen.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:28.890
And in return, they got
a lot of these kids,

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:32.950
these Japanese kids, and their
parents from Crystal City.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.960
And two more large
exchanges from Crystal City

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.840
came in February and December.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.110
In '43, there were still more.

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:46.780
But I wanted to focus on the
very last exchange of the war

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:52.760
because it shows how
all of these kids that

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:59.020
were the American-born kids who
were traded for other Americans

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:04.070
were collateral damage in
the war, in military terms.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:08.230
And they were just at the
wrong place at the wrong time.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:16.090
But as everybody in this room
knows, things often go awry.

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:23.180
And they went awry
on January 2nd, 1945.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.116
I focus on this.

00:27:25.116 --> 00:27:26.820
This is Ingrid Eiserloh.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.890
You saw her in the other thing.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:33.940
She and her family were
part of the last exchange.

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:40.530
On January the 2nd, 1945,
her family left Crystal City.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:46.720
They took the train to New
York with about 2,000 others.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:50.610
And they got to the
New York Harbor.

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:56.180
And they were boarded
onto a Swiss steamship

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.720
called the Gripsholm.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:02.180
All of the prisoner
exchanges, the ships

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.830
were neutral nations so that if
it had been an American ship,

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.830
it would have been blown up.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:11.570
So they took a
23-day sea journey

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:18.510
across to the port of
Marseille in France.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:23.940
And once they got out of
that situation in there,

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.420
they were under
French supervision.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:32.700
So then after that,
they took a train

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.455
into a little city
called Kreuzlingen,

00:28:36.455 --> 00:28:39.010
which is on the Swiss side.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:42.090
And just across is
the German border.

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:45.770
And none of the kids
that were exchanged

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:49.609
knew they were being exchanged
until I was able to give them

00:28:49.609 --> 00:28:52.150
the documents that showed that
they were part of the prisoner

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:54.600
exchanges because
they were kids,

00:28:54.600 --> 00:29:00.750
and they did not know why they
were sent to these countries.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.780
But what the documents from
the State Department show

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.980
is that Kreuzlingen
was the exchange point.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:11.750
And when the kids from Crystal
City and their families

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:16.040
got out, another train
came in from Germany.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:21.570
So it was supposed to be German
people in the United States

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.060
being exchanged for Americans.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:29.380
But at this point
in the war, there

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.640
weren't very many
Americans left in Germany.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.580
Roosevelt had done
practically nothing

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:39.340
to help save the Jews in
the concentration camps.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.600
But at this stage,
the State Department

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:44.610
said that they
would take Jews from

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:50.480
Bergen-Belsen concentration
camp who were exchange Jews

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.120
and free some of them.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:30:00.730
So as a result, although
Ingrid did not know it,

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.040
she, an American,
who was supposed

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.830
to be a German-- I know
this is complicated--

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:12.370
was traded for a German Jew who
was supposed to be an American.

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:19.830
Once Ingrid's parents stepped
into Germany-- at this point,

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:25.540
Germany was on its heels-- they
had to walk or catch the train,

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:29.890
when they could catch the train,
180 kilometers to Idstein,

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:33.170
Germany, which is where
her grandparents lived.

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:36.640
While they were all
almost to Idstein

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:41.100
and they were on a
train from Frankfurt,

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:50.830
eight P-38 Americans fliers
above fired on that train.

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:55.070
The Germans, who had machine
guns at the front of the train,

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:59.600
at the end of the train, they
killed two of the pilots.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:05.830
And her mother, Johanna,
who had worked so hard

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:09.600
to try to become an
American herself,

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.210
gathered her
children up and said,

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:16.220
the irony of American
flyboys shooting

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.560
at my American children.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:24.900
And so everything got
very, very screwed up.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:30.200
Sumi, she was sent to Sendai.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:35.550
And then this is her coming
back at the end of the war.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:39.530
This woman right here,
this was a photograph

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.240
of some of the Jews.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.990
I'm sorry it's blurry,
but it's very old.

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:47.270
After these few
Jews got out-- there

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:51.770
were really only 100 Jews that
got out from Bergen-Belsen.

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:55.080
We weren't taking Jews
into this country.

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:59.570
And so they were taken
to a displaced persons

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:02.150
camp in Algeria, Phillipeville.

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:05.460
This was the girl,
Irene Hasenberg,

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.430
who was traded for Ingrid.

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.110
I'll show you a better picture.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:14.410
And these other children
were from Bergen-Belsen who

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:18.280
were on that during the trade.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.140
This is Irene today.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:28.610
And this is Jacob,
who also was there.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:36.603
When I went to visit Irene,
she was a big surprise to me.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:47.180
She was a PhD in global health.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:50.960
And her husband is in
neuroscience at Ann Arbor.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:57.130
And she was so stunned
that when I showed her

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:59.290
the papers for
Berlin, which showed

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:04.190
her being traded for Ingrid.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:08.630
And she said, are you telling me
that President Roosevelt traded

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.790
an American girl
for a Jewish girl.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:13.590
And I said, yes, I am.

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:17.390
And she said, I can
hardly believe it.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:21.580
And she was 30 years stateless.

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.960
After the Phillipeville,
she did manage

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.240
to get a sponsor in New York.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.120
And she has led an
incredible life.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:34.750
And almost all of the
children from Crystal City who

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:40.110
were traded made it back
to the United States.

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:43.160
Once the United States
occupied their villages

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:46.710
in Japan and in
Germany, they began

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:49.440
working for the US government.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.120
And they kept their
families alive.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.150
Ingrid had a very
difficult-- this is

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:57.880
Ingrid at the end of her life.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:04.860
She died on Pearl
Harbor Day in 2015.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:10.380
And so she had a
very difficult life.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:14.270
She never graduated
from high school.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:18.820
And she had a very different
life than Irene did.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:24.260
I just wanted to say that over
the course of this research,

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:28.600
began to wonder why
did some people thrive,

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:33.159
like Irene, the Jewish
girl from Amsterdam,

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:38.219
and why did other people
like Ingrid not thrive.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:41.159
And Sumi was also
one that thrived.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:44.770
And over the years
of talking to them,

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:49.130
I was really inspired by all
of the American-born children

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:52.670
in Crystal City, who
shockingly never gave up

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:57.730
on their country, which
had, in fact, betrayed them.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:01.730
I was very inspired by the
Japanese idea of the word

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:06.130
"gamon," G-A-M-O-N, which
means finding some kind

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:09.410
of a practice, whether
it's Buddhist meditation

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:17.670
or calligraphy or Judo or Kendo
to help them stay in the moment

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:21.590
in the face of
unendurable suffering.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:26.770
I was inspired
by-- I saw children

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:31.370
who tried to honor their father
and mother at the same time

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:37.490
that their father and mother had
been cast out by their country.

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:39.890
I will have to say,
the American officials

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:42.920
at Crystal City,
Harrison and O'Rourke,

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:48.540
did try to save our national
honor by treating the internees

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.890
as humanely as possible.

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:53.870
But in the end, it
was Irene Hasenberg,

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:56.170
that German-Jewish
girl that was freed

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:59.860
in the '45 trade
for Ingrid, that

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:03.580
provided seminal
lessons for me about how

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:08.940
to deal with so-called
enemies in a humane way.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:12.380
I asked Irene where she
had gotten the stamina

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.040
to go on living.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:18.930
Her father John, who had
been a banker in Amsterdam,

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:23.570
had really struggled to stay
alive and get his family out

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:24.620
of Bergen-Belsen.

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:30.360
They became exchange Jews
because before the Nazis took

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:34.320
over Amsterdam,
he had gotten them

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:37.760
false passports from Ecuador.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:45.110
And so those false passports
were their way out.

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:47.400
But on the train,
the second night

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.430
after leaving Bergen-Belsen,
he was so weak

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:55.990
that he died in Irene's
arms on the train.

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:59.720
Before he died, he
told Irene, he said,

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.080
I'm not going to make it.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.430
But I want you to promise
that you will do everything

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:07.800
in your power to stay
alive because life

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.710
itself is the reason to go on.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:14.490
And we do not want to give
the Nazis the privilege

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:18.490
of killing one more Jew.

00:37:18.490 --> 00:37:20.620
She has led that good life.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:24.540
And I remember when
I interviewed her,

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:28.880
I asked her how she had
forgiven her enemies.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.620
And here's what she said.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:36.050
"Enemies are people whose
stories you haven't yet heard

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:39.680
and whose faces you
haven't yet seen."

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.980
My gratitude goes to the
characters in my book

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:47.740
that after 75 years
of holding silence

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:51.350
had the courage to
tell their stories

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:56.690
and show their faces and
triumph over adversity.

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:58.890
Thank you very
much for your help.

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:00.200
Thank you so much.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.610
Anybody have any questions?

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:02.221
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:02.221 --> 00:38:02.720
Thank you.

00:38:05.402 --> 00:38:06.200
Questions?

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.919
Questions?

00:38:07.919 --> 00:38:09.460
AUDIENCE: Are you
aware of the camp--

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:12.440
MALE SPEAKER: Hold
on a second please.

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.250
AUDIENCE: Are you aware of the
camp that was outside of Reno?

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:17.004
There was one for
Germans and Italians.

00:38:17.004 --> 00:38:19.170
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL: I don't
remember the name of it.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:21.890
But I did know there
was a camp there.

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:24.390
It was mainly men in that camp.

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:26.750
It was an all-male camp.

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:28.080
And that one.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.507
AUDIENCE: That's the only
one I'd ever known about.

00:38:30.507 --> 00:38:31.590
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL: Right.

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:35.920
AUDIENCE: And my mother's
family was from Switzerland.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.746
But they had an Italian name.

00:38:38.746 --> 00:38:42.100
And so my great-grandfather
used to say things, like, yeah,

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.970
during the war, everybody
was becoming a Swiss Italian

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:48.330
during that time.

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:51.430
But I know here, we have
a lot of Japanese people

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:53.180
who were interned.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:56.110
And what I don't know
if it's in your book,

00:38:56.110 --> 00:39:02.330
but a lot the times they
would sign their property

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:05.790
to Caucasian people, if
that's the word I can use,

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:07.540
white people, whatever.

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.281
And they were able to give
it to them after the fact.

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:12.580
So that did happen.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.690
I'd be interested to know
if it's in your book.

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:16.057
But it's a bit odd.

00:39:16.057 --> 00:39:17.890
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL:
Yeah, it is in the book.

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:20.950
And sometimes, they got the
property back from the people.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:23.900
And sometimes, the
people took the property.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.080
And so that was it.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.550
And also, right here
in San Francisco,

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:32.000
Joe DiMaggio's father
was a fisherman right

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.790
here in San Francisco.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:35.390
AUDIENCE: My friend's
father knew him.

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:36.473
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL: Right.

00:39:36.473 --> 00:39:42.070
And when Joe DiMaggio heard that
his father had been targeted

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:48.120
to be interned and
sent back to Italy,

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:54.100
he contacted the head of
the Yankees and his father

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.080
was not arrested.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:59.600
But he was confined to
this area and was not

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:02.410
allowed to continue
with his fishing trade.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:10.890
So it tells you the
level of fear and anxiety

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:12.950
that was going on at that time.

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:18.014
AUDIENCE: Does your
book talk about the 442?

00:40:18.014 --> 00:40:19.180
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL: The 442.

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.700
In fact, Sumi, one
of my characters,

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:27.880
married a member of the
442, the all Japanese--

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:31.161
it was called the
all Nisei division.

00:40:31.161 --> 00:40:36.730
That is the most decorated
division during World War

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:39.510
II were the Japanese.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:41.600
AUDIENCE: Because the
Italians were the number one

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.050
ethnic group in World War II.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.840
As a matter of fact, the name
GI Joe is not just a doll.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.970
But the Japanese used to call
the soldiers Joe because they

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:51.900
were all named Joe.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.070
It was Giuseppe.

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:55.640
So I don't understand.

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.500
I mean this Roosevelt,
I mean, he really

00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:59.950
goes down as the worst
president we ever had.

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:01.130
He really was a bad man.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:01.992
He wasn't good.

00:41:01.992 --> 00:41:03.700
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL:
Well, I'll tell you--

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.730
AUDIENCE: I mean, he took
our gold away if you had it.

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:06.229
You know?

00:41:06.229 --> 00:41:08.650
I mean, he takes your gold away.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:11.620
He puts in a
taxation system that

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.014
has only destroyed this nation,
as far as I'm concerned.

00:41:14.014 --> 00:41:15.430
MALE SPEAKER: Is
there a question?

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:17.776
AUDIENCE: The question is,
how do you portray him?

00:41:17.776 --> 00:41:19.650
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL:
Well, I have to tell you,

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:25.050
I think that most historians
consider his internment

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:29.420
policies the biggest
mistake of his presidency.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:35.040
And I was very stunned
at how extensive it was.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.590
And I'd like you decide
what you think about it.

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:40.760
My father fought
in World War II.

00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:45.570
And I remember that he
was incredibly frightened

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:47.190
of Japanese people.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:51.890
And so everybody has a different
history on this subject.

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:55.350
But I'm not preaching in this.

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:56.680
I say, this is what happened.

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.740
And I think the events
speak for themselves.

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.594
Yes.

00:42:00.594 --> 00:42:02.510
AUDIENCE: Do you know
how many people in total

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:04.480
went to the Crystal
City internment?

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.480
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL: Yes.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.730
AUDIENCE: And how many
of them were exchanged?

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:08.730
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL: Yes.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:09.580
You do?

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:11.700
Oh, how many went?

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.490
Oh, I don't have
exactly the number.

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:21.270
But there were 6,000 people in
Crystal City over the course

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:22.760
of the camp's life.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:29.180
And most of them
were like 501 times.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.100
So I haven't added
up the exact total.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:34.360
But it's in the book.

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.319
Yes, sir?

00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:37.610
AUDIENCE: You can't tell us
everything, right? [LAUGHS]

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:38.510
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL: No, no.

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:39.060
It's in the book.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.520
I just don't
remember the number.

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.260
AUDIENCE: I'm just joking.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:41.760
I apologize.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.230
I haven't read your book yet.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:45.520
It's an amazing lecture.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.520
My question is,
in your research,

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:52.940
have you found any criteria
of who was traded and why?

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.240
Was there a list?

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.640
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL: Yes.

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:59.840
Well, first of all, the
criteria was the first thing

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:05.790
you had to do-- Roosevelt
gave J. Edgar Hoover the power

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:12.120
to create a list, a black
list, in 1939, long before we

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.700
were even in the war.

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:15.530
But he knew war was coming.

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:21.990
And so that's why he was able
to get these 12 different Latin

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:24.720
American countries signed on.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:29.490
And so essentially,
what he was trying to do

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:32.160
was find low-value people.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:38.770
So American children are low
value in the prisoner exchange.

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:43.880
You don't have to trade
American soldiers.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.750
They're high value.

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:47.980
I mean, this is an
astonishing fact.

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.730
And Latin Americans, who
aren't even citizens of ours,

00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:53.840
who don't know
anything, are even lower

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.670
than American children.

00:43:55.670 --> 00:44:00.890
So he set out a criteria of
who we wanted to get back

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:03.060
from these Axis nations.

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:06.890
And then, what we did
was we tried to do that.

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:10.770
And there were a few really
bad guys in Crystal City.

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:15.260
For instance, Fritz Kuhn, who
was the head of the American

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:19.010
Nazi Party, was a
prisoner with his family

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:21.900
in Crystal City, Texas.

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:26.230
Germany wanted him back
because he had apparently

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.290
gotten a lot of
money that he had

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:31.920
been funneling before the
war effort into Germany.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.030
So Germany wanted him back.

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:36.940
Roosevelt said, hell, no.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:43.150
And he did not send Kuhn back
until after we had won the war.

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:46.380
So it was all that
kind of calculation.

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:51.400
And during all this period--
this is not in my book--

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.670
but that was also when
Roosevelt purchased

00:44:54.670 --> 00:45:00.504
Guantanamo Bay, which he
purchased for a military place.

00:45:00.504 --> 00:45:01.420
AUDIENCE: It was then?

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.360
I thought it was way before.

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:09.020
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL: No,
during the war years.

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:11.724
AUDIENCE: I thought we had
Guantanamo before that.

00:45:11.724 --> 00:45:13.890
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL: I don't
remember the exact date,

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:16.130
but I think it was
during all of this

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:18.940
when he was negotiating
the so-called Good Neighbor

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.332
Program.

00:45:20.332 --> 00:45:22.320
AUDIENCE: Well,
in your book, does

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.010
it talk about anybody
who was an American that

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:29.860
sided with the Japanese military
because I know that that

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.420
happened because
I'm from San Jose

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.045
and there was a lot
of Japanese people.

00:45:33.045 --> 00:45:34.890
And they've told
me stories about--

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:38.260
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL: No, well,
I didn't get into that other

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:46.630
than to say-- I did get into
the fact that by the time

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:51.140
the fathers, who had been
in these all-male camps,

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:55.590
got reunited with their wives
in Crystal City, whatever

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:59.250
loyalty they had to the
US was by-and-large gone.

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:04.330
And so there was a lot
of terrible discussions

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:08.530
between the firstborn
sons of Japanese

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:11.560
and the firstborn
sons of Germans.

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:16.930
And by this time-- I don't
know about the Italians--

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:21.590
because American-born
sons were stating,

00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:23.050
this was their country.

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:24.100
Right?

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:30.320
And yet their fathers had
made this decision to go back.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.110
And they didn't want to go back.

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:35.810
So there was a lot of
terrible family discussion

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:37.512
about that there.

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:41.720
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:43.050
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL: Yes.

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:45.240
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that people were

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.614
trapped in the Axis countries.

00:46:47.614 --> 00:46:49.363
Can you define that a
little bit, what you

00:46:49.363 --> 00:46:50.790
mean by "trapped"?

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:52.990
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL:
Well, "trapped"

00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:55.130
might have been
a Roosevelt term.

00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:58.870
By trapped, that they
weren't allowed to leave once

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:00.280
war began.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.050
And the truth is,
however, many missionaries

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:05.320
didn't want to leave.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:08.500
And so they hesitated too late.

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.950
In the run-up to the war from
the point of view of Germany

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:17.160
and Japan, I don't think even
the Japanese knew what was

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.270
in store for them beforehand.

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:21.650
So there wasn't enough
time to get out.

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:24.570
But in Germany, people
knew that war was coming.

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:27.890
And some of them
just didn't leave.

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:32.100
And once war did come, they
wouldn't let them leave.

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:35.229
And so that's what I
meant by "trapped."

00:47:35.229 --> 00:47:36.520
AUDIENCE: A 10-second question.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:41.240
Can you tell us a little bit
about the importance of having

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.950
access to archival documents.

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:43.950
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL: Yes.

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:45.970
AUDIENCE: I know it's
easy in the United States.

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:49.610
But what about some of the
other places like Salzburg?

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:52.660
History has not yet been
properly researched.

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:54.900
And access is not
as easy as here.

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:58.690
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL: I can
just say that, for me, it

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:04.890
took me forever-- I petitioned
Berlin for the names of people

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:07.860
that were traded, and Japan.

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:10.820
And I finally got
the list from Berlin.

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:17.020
But Japan won't give
anything at all about it.

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.080
And it's a completely
closed thing.

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:23.550
And it's ridiculous
for me now that to have

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:28.090
any document that's in the
National Archives about the war

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:32.090
not out because
it's past 75 years.

00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:32.950
Right?

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:38.020
And yet, it is still hard to
get information from the State

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:39.065
Department out.

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:44.530
And there's some information
about the prisoner exchange

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:46.890
program I can't get at all.

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.500
And so what I did get,
the only reason I got it

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.150
is that it was in
the Crystal City

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:55.490
file, which was
not in the State--

00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:57.377
the list of people leaving.

00:48:57.377 --> 00:48:58.960
That's the reason,
when I first looked

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.910
at these-- why were they--
all the kids would say to me.

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:04.400
And then we went to Japan.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.840
And then we went to Germany.

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.600
Why did you go to
Germany and Japan?

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.200
I don't know.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.000
If you're 12 years
old, you don't know.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:12.670
You don't know.

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:17.810
And they were just stunned that
they had been actually traded

00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:19.320
for somebody else.

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.520
Ingrid, when I told her,
I was worried about how

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:26.820
Ingrid would feel about Irene.

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:32.080
I had never discussed the
issue of Jews with Ingrid.

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.680
And this is a kind
of a personal thing.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.660
But when I got
there to her house--

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:41.020
she lived in Honolulu
with her daughter--

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:44.350
I showed her the list
from Berlin, which said,

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:46.160
Irene Hasenberg.

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:51.150
And then I showed her the same
place for the United States,

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:53.700
which said Ingrid Eiserloh.

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.830
And that these were
the matched pair.

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:58.840
And she looked at me.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:01.320
And you know, she
had felt very badly.

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.060
She had been a strong
father's daughter.

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:07.360
She'd wanted to please
her father at any length.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:11.070
And that had not worked
out well for her.

00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:13.120
And she looked.

00:50:17.350 --> 00:50:19.340
And first, she said,
are you telling me

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:23.400
that I was traded
for a German Jew?

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.220
And I said, yep.

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:27.310
And then she said,
well, then everything

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:29.675
that happened to our
family during the war

00:50:29.675 --> 00:50:33.180
is worth it because how
many German-Americans

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:39.126
can say that they had any hand
at all in helping a German Jew?

00:50:39.126 --> 00:50:42.190
And she was incredibly moved.

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:46.120
And she died three weeks later.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:52.430
So it was a very, very-- it was
a very sad and also emotional

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:54.240
thing.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.770
Yes.

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:58.610
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:00.430
I look forward to
reading your book.

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:04.490
My question is about how you
want about doing the research

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:08.850
and how perhaps, other
people like myself, could.

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:10.920
My great-grandfather was
actually an immigrant

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.280
from Japan and was
interned in Crystal City.

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.930
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL:
What was his name?

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:16.097
AUDIENCE: Kaso-ochi Okizaki.

00:51:16.097 --> 00:51:18.180
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL: Well,
I might have information

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:20.360
about him I could look and see.

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.090
What was his occupation?

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:25.310
AUDIENCE: He was a farmer.

00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:27.550
And I believe the
reason he was interned

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:34.630
is he was one of the leaders
with the JSCL before the war.

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:38.400
So I think my cousin
has, actually,

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.840
through the Freedom of
Information Act actually gotten

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.920
some files.

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:46.490
But my great-aunt
and two of my uncles

00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:51.110
who were Americans citizens
did join him in Crystal City.

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:53.830
I was wondering were there
files on the kids as well?

00:51:53.830 --> 00:51:57.210
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL: Yes,
once you entered the camp,

00:51:57.210 --> 00:51:58.960
there are dossiers in the camp.

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:04.180
And those files are now open
at the National Archives

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:08.880
in Washington, in the building
on Independence Avenue.

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:16.710
And you can find-- each person
had a dossier at all times.

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:23.300
For instance, I was so
freaked out about it

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.580
since my book has to be true.

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:29.060
Time, they couldn't
tell you when did

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.100
they arrive in Crystal City.

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:33.580
When did they leave?

00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:34.820
Things like that.

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:40.320
And those dates are all
on that dossier of it.

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:46.430
In fact, Ensi Eiserloh
was only a little girl.

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:50.380
And she was run over by a truck.

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.050
But she had gotten in
between the wheels.

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.790
And that was noted in her file.

00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:57.740
So that's in my book.

00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:05.250
There were two Japanese-Peruvian
girls who drowned at the pool.

00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:10.400
The whole medical file
was in the archives.

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.810
So yes, you can find it out.

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:14.000
It's interesting.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.420
One of the things
I didn't make clear

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:19.900
is that the men who were
at Crystal City, who

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:25.010
were charged as enemy
aliens-- they weren't charged.

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:27.900
They were taken because
of their occupation.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.070
And if they were a
leader-- for instance,

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:34.160
if they were a leader of
even an agricultural co-op,

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.340
they were taken.

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:39.570
But certainly, for any
kind of political leaning

00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:41.590
in the Japanese,
they were taken.

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:46.600
I mean, Roosevelt saw
red after Pearl Harbor,

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:50.790
much more than Bush did after
9/11 because Roosevelt had

00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:52.706
been the Secretary of the Navy.

00:53:52.706 --> 00:53:57.900
And the Japanese had taken the
whole Navy out, practically,

00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:59.150
at Pearl Harbor.

00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:01.620
He was one mad hen.

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:04.600
And so, he would
have been, if he

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:12.710
was a leader in the community--
there were 250 Buddhist priests

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:13.830
in Crystal City.

00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:15.710
That's a lot of
Buddhist priests.

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:18.890
Every Buddhist priest
that was on the West Coast

00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:21.425
was there, and in Honolulu.

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:29.220
And so it wasn't a
[? loyalty task. ?]

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:32.340
It was where you were
in space and time

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:35.670
and who your affiliation was.

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:37.630
And in so many
ways, the Japanese

00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:39.200
held onto their culture.

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:44.570
But in so many ways, German
culture in the United States--

00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:46.910
you couldn't listen
to Beethoven.

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:51.950
You couldn't speak German,
even in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:56.040
That was considered bad.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.910
And the Germans and
the Italians have never

00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:03.020
received an apology from
the government or any money.

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:04.860
And at this point,
the kids that were

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:07.480
in the camp that were
German-Americans,

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:11.450
they wanted an apology
for their parents.

00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:15.300
But none of them have ever
asked for money for reparations.

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:24.610
But I sent my book
to President Obama

00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:28.020
and asked for an apology
for these children

00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:31.430
in Crystal City, who
were completely innocent.

00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:34.180
And so far, no answer.

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:39.370
But we give
apologies to anybody.

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:42.010
I don't know why we couldn't--
and we've apologized to Japan

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:44.340
about a million jillion times.

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:48.700
And I think we should
apologize to these kids that

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:51.810
were in Crystal City.

00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:53.274
MALE SPEAKER: And with that--

00:55:53.274 --> 00:55:54.940
JAN JARBOE RUSSELL:
Thank you very much.

00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:56.160
OK.

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.390
Thank you for bringing me.

00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:59.681
I just love this place, Google.
