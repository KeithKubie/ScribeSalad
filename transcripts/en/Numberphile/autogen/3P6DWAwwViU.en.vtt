00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790
big number and that's tree 3 it
 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.030
big number and that's tree 3 it
absolutely puts Graham's number to shame

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040
absolutely puts Graham's number to shame
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.580
absolutely puts Graham's number to shame

where tree 3 comes from well it comes

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
where tree 3 comes from well it comes
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.849
where tree 3 comes from well it comes
from a game of trees there are three

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859
from a game of trees there are three
 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.320
from a game of trees there are three
different types of seed we're gonna have

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
different types of seed we're gonna have
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.349
different types of seed we're gonna have
a green seed mathematicians wouldn't

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359
a green seed mathematicians wouldn't
 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.849
a green seed mathematicians wouldn't
call these seeds they call them nodes

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859
call these seeds they call them nodes
 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.880
call these seeds they call them nodes
but we'll call them seeds ok and a black

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890
but we'll call them seeds ok and a black
 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.400
but we'll call them seeds ok and a black
seed and a red seed and what we're going

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410
seed and a red seed and what we're going
 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.780
seed and a red seed and what we're going
to try and do is we're going to try to

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790
to try and do is we're going to try to
 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.080
to try and do is we're going to try to
build a forest okay one tree at a time

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
build a forest okay one tree at a time
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.270
build a forest okay one tree at a time
the first tree can't have more than one

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
the first tree can't have more than one
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.030
the first tree can't have more than one
seed the second tree can't have more

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040
seed the second tree can't have more
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.310
seed the second tree can't have more
than two seeds the third tree can't have

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
than two seeds the third tree can't have
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.200
than two seeds the third tree can't have
more than three seeds and so on okay and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
more than three seeds and so on okay and
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.910
more than three seeds and so on okay and
that's rule number one the other rule is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920
that's rule number one the other rule is
 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.279
that's rule number one the other rule is
that if you build a tree if you find

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289
that if you build a tree if you find
 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.260
that if you build a tree if you find
that an earlier tree could have been

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270
that an earlier tree could have been
 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.959
that an earlier tree could have been
contained within that tree the whole

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
contained within that tree the whole
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.410
contained within that tree the whole
forest dies okay so let's just sort of

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420
forest dies okay so let's just sort of
 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.119
forest dies okay so let's just sort of
illustrate what we mean so let's try and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129
illustrate what we mean so let's try and
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.889
illustrate what we mean so let's try and
build a tree for example so we might

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
build a tree for example so we might
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.889
build a tree for example so we might
start off with you know a green seed and

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899
start off with you know a green seed and
 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.469
start off with you know a green seed and
then we branch up and we get a black

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
then we branch up and we get a black
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.050
then we branch up and we get a black
seed and then maybe maybe we have two

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
seed and then maybe maybe we have two
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.120
seed and then maybe maybe we have two
branches and you know we can have

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
branches and you know we can have
 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.660
branches and you know we can have
another green seed maybe and we can saw

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670
another green seed maybe and we can saw
 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.940
another green seed maybe and we can saw
these trees right we said the first go

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950
these trees right we said the first go
 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.410
these trees right we said the first go
the first tree shouldn't have more than

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
the first tree shouldn't have more than
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.330
the first tree shouldn't have more than
one seed the second tree should have

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340
one seed the second tree should have
 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.859
one seed the second tree should have
more than two seeds and so on we also

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869
more than two seeds and so on we also
 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.350
more than two seeds and so on we also
said if you build a tree that an earlier

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360
said if you build a tree that an earlier
 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.730
said if you build a tree that an earlier
tree could have been contained within it

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
tree could have been contained within it
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.800
tree could have been contained within it
then the forest dies so what do we mean

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810
then the forest dies so what do we mean
 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.230
then the forest dies so what do we mean
by contained well the mathematical term

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
by contained well the mathematical term
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.760
by contained well the mathematical term
that we're really talking about here is

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
that we're really talking about here is
 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.140
that we're really talking about here is
in embeddable

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
in embeddable
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.270
in embeddable
don't worry about what infant bed is

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280
don't worry about what infant bed is
 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.499
don't worry about what infant bed is
let's just try to understand what we

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
let's just try to understand what we
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.450
let's just try to understand what we
mean by one tree being contained in

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
mean by one tree being contained in
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.520
mean by one tree being contained in
another tree okay so let me let me show

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530
another tree okay so let me let me show
 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.889
another tree okay so let me let me show
you we've got a tree here already so we

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
you we've got a tree here already so we
 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.719
you we've got a tree here already so we
could draw another tree for example we

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729
could draw another tree for example we
 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.480
could draw another tree for example we
could draw this tree and I think you'd

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
could draw this tree and I think you'd
 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.429
could draw this tree and I think you'd
be quite happy if you said that this

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439
be quite happy if you said that this
 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.929
be quite happy if you said that this
tree was contained in this tree because

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939
tree was contained in this tree because
 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.249
tree was contained in this tree because
you can sort of see you've got that

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259
you can sort of see you've got that
 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.139
you can sort of see you've got that
there and you've got that there and

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149
there and you've got that there and
 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.330
there and you've got that there and
you've got that there so that tree is

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340
you've got that there so that tree is
 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.249
you've got that there so that tree is
kind of contained in that tree there's

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259
kind of contained in that tree there's
 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.300
kind of contained in that tree there's
something else that you have to when you

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
something else that you have to when you
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.620
something else that you have to when you
say a tree is contained in another

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630
say a tree is contained in another
 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.420
say a tree is contained in another
there's an important property that they

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430
there's an important property that they
 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.420
there's an important property that they
have to satisfy and that's that they

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430
have to satisfy and that's that they
 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.700
have to satisfy and that's that they
must preserve the nearest common

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
must preserve the nearest common
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.229
must preserve the nearest common
ancestor so what do I mean by that I

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
ancestor so what do I mean by that I
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.030
ancestor so what do I mean by that I
mean this red seed and this

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040
mean this red seed and this
 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.160
mean this red seed and this
main seed their nearest common ancestor

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170
main seed their nearest common ancestor
 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.589
main seed their nearest common ancestor
is this black seed and that seems true

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599
is this black seed and that seems true
 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.020
is this black seed and that seems true
here this red seed this green seed their

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030
here this red seed this green seed their
 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.699
here this red seed this green seed their
nearest common ancestors this black seed

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709
nearest common ancestors this black seed
 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.459
nearest common ancestors this black seed
so indeed this tree is contained in this

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.469
so indeed this tree is contained in this
 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.830
so indeed this tree is contained in this
tree okay do another example is this

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840
tree okay do another example is this
 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.539
tree okay do another example is this
tree contained in this tree at some

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549
tree contained in this tree at some
 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.520
tree contained in this tree at some
level you might think that it is green

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530
level you might think that it is green
 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.640
level you might think that it is green
green red green green red so you might

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650
green red green green red so you might
 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.009
green red green green red so you might
think that this tree is indeed contained

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019
think that this tree is indeed contained
 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.229
think that this tree is indeed contained
in this tree but it's not and the reason

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239
in this tree but it's not and the reason
 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.149
in this tree but it's not and the reason
it's not is because of the nearest

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159
it's not is because of the nearest
 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.160
it's not is because of the nearest
common ancestor this red in this green

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170
common ancestor this red in this green
 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.750
common ancestor this red in this green
their nearest common ancestor is a green

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760
their nearest common ancestor is a green
 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.879
their nearest common ancestor is a green
is this green one here this red in this

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889
is this green one here this red in this
 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.410
is this green one here this red in this
green their nearest common ancestors is

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420
green their nearest common ancestors is
 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.080
green their nearest common ancestors is
this black so this tree is not contained

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090
this black so this tree is not contained
 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.059
this black so this tree is not contained
in this tree I want to do one last

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069
in this tree I want to do one last
 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.710
in this tree I want to do one last
example just so we get this point

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720
example just so we get this point
 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.690
example just so we get this point
probably understood so let me draw my

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700
probably understood so let me draw my
 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.789
probably understood so let me draw my
new tree okay so I've got two trees here

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799
new tree okay so I've got two trees here
 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.300
new tree okay so I've got two trees here
this one in this one I want to ask is

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310
this one in this one I want to ask is
 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.030
this one in this one I want to ask is
this one contained in this one all right

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040
this one contained in this one all right
 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.740
this one contained in this one all right
now it doesn't look obviously that it is

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750
now it doesn't look obviously that it is
 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.649
now it doesn't look obviously that it is
but actually it is you could take this

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659
but actually it is you could take this
 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.679
but actually it is you could take this
guy you could take this guy and you

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:11.689
guy you could take this guy and you
 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.259
guy you could take this guy and you
could take this guy okay that's your

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269
could take this guy okay that's your
 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.830
could take this guy okay that's your
black black red black black red and also

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840
black black red black black red and also
 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.319

they preserve the ancestry rule because

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329
they preserve the ancestry rule because
 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:21.819
they preserve the ancestry rule because
the nearest common ancestor of this

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829
the nearest common ancestor of this
 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.659
the nearest common ancestor of this
black and this red is the black then

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669
black and this red is the black then
 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.699
black and this red is the black then
your common answers yes then there is

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709
your common answers yes then there is
 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.199
your common answers yes then there is
common ancestor so even though they have

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209
common ancestor so even though they have
 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.059
common ancestor so even though they have
other ancestors the nearest common

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069
other ancestors the nearest common
 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.430
other ancestors the nearest common
ancestor is this black guy right and

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440
ancestor is this black guy right and
 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.719
ancestor is this black guy right and
that's that's the that's what's

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:34.729
that's that's the that's what's
 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:36.460
that's that's the that's what's
important and this this is shared by the

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470
important and this this is shared by the
 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.530
important and this this is shared by the
other graph and so we can say that this

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540
other graph and so we can say that this
 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.599
other graph and so we can say that this
graph is contained in this one okay

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609
graph is contained in this one okay
 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.399
graph is contained in this one okay
those the rules are we happy with the

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409
those the rules are we happy with the
 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.369
those the rules are we happy with the
rules first rule is three number one

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379
rules first rule is three number one
 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:46.869
rules first rule is three number one
shouldn't have more than one seed tree

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879
shouldn't have more than one seed tree
 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.460
shouldn't have more than one seed tree
number tution and more than two seeds

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470
number tution and more than two seeds
 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.869
number tution and more than two seeds
tree number three - no more than three

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879
tree number three - no more than three
 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.309
tree number three - no more than three
seeds we're going to make a forest of

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319
seeds we're going to make a forest of
 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.740
seeds we're going to make a forest of
trees and a minute we write down a tree

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750
trees and a minute we write down a tree
 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.250
trees and a minute we write down a tree
that contains an area tree forest dies

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260
that contains an area tree forest dies
 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.050
that contains an area tree forest dies
so let's so let's first play the game

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060
so let's so let's first play the game
 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.849
so let's so let's first play the game
with only one type of seed I say it's

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859
with only one type of seed I say it's
 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.250
with only one type of seed I say it's
the green seed well the first tree has

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260
the green seed well the first tree has
 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.679
the green seed well the first tree has
to have one seed at most so I'm going to

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689
to have one seed at most so I'm going to
 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:09.520
to have one seed at most so I'm going to
just do it okay that's it can I write

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530
just do it okay that's it can I write
 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.530
just do it okay that's it can I write
down anything else there's no way I can

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540
down anything else there's no way I can
 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.050
down anything else there's no way I can
the next I'm stopped I have to stop now

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060
the next I'm stopped I have to stop now
 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.849
the next I'm stopped I have to stop now
right clearly if I could draw this tree

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859
right clearly if I could draw this tree
 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.879
right clearly if I could draw this tree
for example right but clearly this this

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889
for example right but clearly this this
 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.310
for example right but clearly this this
is contained in this so this has to stop

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320
is contained in this so this has to stop
 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.600
is contained in this so this has to stop
at one that tells me that tree one is

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610
at one that tells me that tree one is
 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.270
at one that tells me that tree one is
one okay so this game stops at one now

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280
one okay so this game stops at one now
 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.649
one okay so this game stops at one now
let's do it with two I'm gonna use green

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:32.659
let's do it with two I'm gonna use green
 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.990
let's do it with two I'm gonna use green
and red okay okay so tree number what

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000
and red okay okay so tree number what
 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.550
and red okay okay so tree number what
doesn't matter it's gonna have to be out

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560
doesn't matter it's gonna have to be out
 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.709
doesn't matter it's gonna have to be out
of the red or the green doesn't make any

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:38.719
of the red or the green doesn't make any
 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:40.450
of the red or the green doesn't make any
difference I'll choose the green okay

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460
difference I'll choose the green okay
 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.490
difference I'll choose the green okay
next one what am I gonna do next well I

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500
next one what am I gonna do next well I
 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.189
next one what am I gonna do next well I
definitely can't draw say it's you know

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199
definitely can't draw say it's you know
 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.990
definitely can't draw say it's you know
two greens or something like that I

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000
two greens or something like that I
 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.490
two greens or something like that I
could do I could do this I could write

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500
could do I could do this I could write
 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.709
could do I could do this I could write
down another red just a red seed like

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:50.719
down another red just a red seed like
 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:52.149
down another red just a red seed like
that but what could I what could I draw

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:52.159
that but what could I what could I draw
 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:53.890
that but what could I what could I draw
an X well anything I draw next is going

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900
an X well anything I draw next is going
 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.450
an X well anything I draw next is going
to have to contain either the green

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460
to have to contain either the green
 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.459
to have to contain either the green
siedel or the red seed so it's going to

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:57.469
siedel or the red seed so it's going to
 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.070
siedel or the red seed so it's going to
contain so I mean just draw an example

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080
contain so I mean just draw an example
 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.439
contain so I mean just draw an example
down so something like this so whatever

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449
down so something like this so whatever
 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.779
down so something like this so whatever
happens you know I'm gonna be able to

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789
happens you know I'm gonna be able to
 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.490
happens you know I'm gonna be able to
contain one of these guys in this next

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500
contain one of these guys in this next
 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.649
contain one of these guys in this next
one this game has stopped at two could I

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:08.659
one this game has stopped at two could I
 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:10.420
one this game has stopped at two could I
have gone any further than two though is

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430
have gone any further than two though is
 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.709
have gone any further than two though is
that the longest game I could have

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:11.719
that the longest game I could have
 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:15.070
that the longest game I could have
played it's not there is a longer game

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080
played it's not there is a longer game
 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.600
played it's not there is a longer game
you could have played so let's play it

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610
you could have played so let's play it
 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.969
you could have played so let's play it
okay so I starts off with my green seed

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979
okay so I starts off with my green seed
 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.800
okay so I starts off with my green seed
then if I drawn two red seeds

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810
then if I drawn two red seeds
 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.110
then if I drawn two red seeds
okay that's fine I think but can I carry

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120
okay that's fine I think but can I carry
 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.740
okay that's fine I think but can I carry
on yes I can I can draw a red seed

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750
on yes I can I can draw a red seed
 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.709
on yes I can I can draw a red seed
because remember the rule is you can't

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:35.719
because remember the rule is you can't
 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:38.350
because remember the rule is you can't
if you draw down a tree that contains an

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360
if you draw down a tree that contains an
 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.959
if you draw down a tree that contains an
earlier tree that's not allowed but this

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:40.969
earlier tree that's not allowed but this
 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:42.879
earlier tree that's not allowed but this
tree doesn't contain either of these two

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889
tree doesn't contain either of these two
 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.459
tree doesn't contain either of these two
okay so I've actually managed to make

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:45.469
okay so I've actually managed to make
 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:48.159
okay so I've actually managed to make
this game last two three three trees and

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169
this game last two three three trees and
 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.680
this game last two three three trees and
actually I can't go any further so that

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690
actually I can't go any further so that
 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:57.879
actually I can't go any further so that
tells me that tree two is three so what

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889
tells me that tree two is three so what
 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:05:59.980
tells me that tree two is three so what
this tree thing is telling us is the

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990
this tree thing is telling us is the
 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.450
this tree thing is telling us is the
length of the longest game that you

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460
length of the longest game that you
 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.559
length of the longest game that you
could play this way so now Brady you've

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:05.569
could play this way so now Brady you've
 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:06.969
could play this way so now Brady you've
got a bit of time on your hands now

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979
got a bit of time on your hands now
 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.050
got a bit of time on your hands now
we're going to use three different types

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060
we're going to use three different types
 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.939
we're going to use three different types
of seed three different colors red black

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:09.949
of seed three different colors red black
 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:13.240
of seed three different colors red black
and green okay well what's the longest

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250
and green okay well what's the longest
 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.179
and green okay well what's the longest
game we could play well you could start

00:06:16.179 --> 00:06:16.189
game we could play well you could start
 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:18.850
game we could play well you could start
off with it green maybe you could maybe

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860
off with it green maybe you could maybe
 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.709
off with it green maybe you could maybe
do this red have you wanted to you know

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:22.719
do this red have you wanted to you know
 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:26.019
do this red have you wanted to you know
what else could you do you could do this

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:26.029
what else could you do you could do this
 

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:29.499
what else could you do you could do this
guy I suppose something like this I mean

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:29.509
guy I suppose something like this I mean
 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:30.820
guy I suppose something like this I mean
there's all sorts you could start to

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830
there's all sorts you could start to
 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.619
there's all sorts you could start to
write down a mate you go on and on and

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:32.629
write down a mate you go on and on and
 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:34.719
write down a mate you go on and on and
on right what's the longest game you

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:34.729
on right what's the longest game you
 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.129
on right what's the longest game you
could play the longest game you could

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139
could play the longest game you could
 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:38.050
could play the longest game you could
play

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060
play
 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.710
play
is three three it's the answer now how

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720
is three three it's the answer now how
 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.930
is three three it's the answer now how
big is that number now one thing you

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940
big is that number now one thing you
 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.510
big is that number now one thing you
might ask is is it infinite it's not

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520
might ask is is it infinite it's not
 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.610
might ask is is it infinite it's not
infinite it's definitely finite it's

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620
infinite it's definitely finite it's
 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.129
infinite it's definitely finite it's
just really really really really really

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139
just really really really really really
 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:53.080
just really really really really really
you're really really really I can't
