Go to Stufftoblowyourmind.com to enter the
Science Awards contest and a chance to win

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.700
a $10,000 college sponsorship, sponsored by
BASF, THE chemical company.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.500
You know what's better than a 3D-printed pizza?

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.500
Nothing.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.900
Nothing in the world is better than a 3D-printed
pizza.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.030
Sorry everyone else.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.410
Just pack up and go home.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:30.550
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - with a story
that is sure to warm the cockles of even the

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.700
coldest, deadest heart.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:40.170
A group of engineering students from an Illinois
high school used a 3D printer to make a prosthetic

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.569
hand for a 9-year-old girl who was born without
fingers on her left hand.

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:50.319
A regular prosthetic hand costs up to $50,000
- which is an insane amount of money, so the

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:53.579
girl's father approached the school, asking
for help.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.289
Students found a 3D printout online that can
be used to create fingers, and then pieced

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.959
the hand together, adding flexible cords that
allow it to bend and grab items.

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:05.820
The girl now has a brand new functioning hand
- and the total cost?

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.820
$5.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.270
Damn I love a good bargain.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.290
Of course this isn't the first time a 3D printer
has created working body parts - and it's

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.470
actually more common than you think!

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.189
Last month, a group of doctors in Holland
performed the first successful skull transplant

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.610
- using a plastic, 3D printed skull.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.790
The patient who received it, suffered from
a condition that thickens the bone structure

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.530
- causing headaches, blindness, and eventually
death.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.300
The procedures took 23 hours in total - and
the woman has now regained her sight, and

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.300
returned to work.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.300
Absolutely incredible.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.170
And here's a weird one: 3D printed eyes.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.250
A company called Fripp Design and Research
in the UK prints up to 150 prosthetic eyes

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.250
every hour.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.590
And while they obviously don't work the same
as a real eye - they are significantly cheaper

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.300
and more readily available than standard glass
eyes.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.850
The same company also produces an array of
other facial prosthetics, including noses

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.850
and ears.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.920
They scan a patient's face, and then 3D print
a perfect replica using starch powder, silicone,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.940
and pigments.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.060
Not only is it cheaper than leading prosthetics
- it's more patient-friendly, because it doesn't

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.840
require an invasive facial mold to create.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.450
The Wake Forest Institute For Regenerative
Medicine is another place that's leading the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.740
way in 3D prosthetics.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.700
They recently created a bioprinted kidney
- by depositing kidneys cells cultivated from

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.639
a biopsy, into a biodegradable shell.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:32.379
The kidney is then incubated for a period,
and transplanted into a patient - so as the

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.950
functional tissue grows, the shell slowly
degrades.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.709
Wake Forest has also paved the way for synthetic
skin grafts.

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.689
And they're currently developing a printer
that could print skin straight onto the wounds

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.090
of burn victims.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.939
First they use a scanner to determine the
size and depth of the wound.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:54.409
And then an ink, made of enzymes and collagen,
is layered in between tissue and skin cells

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.529
- the same way it would be in healthy skin.

00:02:57.529 --> 00:03:01.989
Their goal, is to have portable skin graft
machines ready within 5 years, so they can

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.019
use it on soldiers who have been burned in
war.

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.499
It may be another decade or so until we see
3D-printed kidneys and other major internal

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:14.420
organs put into humans, BUT - let me reiterate
just how incredible the potential for this

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.459
is.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.549
Transplant waiting lists would be a thing
of the past!

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.200
Lose your arm in a boating accident?

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.529
It's cool bro, I'll just print another one!

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:26.180
And better than any of that - it brings us
one step closer, to being cyborgs.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.459
If you can think of any use for 3D printers
that's cooler than what I just listed, I wanna

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.459
know about it.

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.269
