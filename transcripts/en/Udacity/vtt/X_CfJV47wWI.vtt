00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's ask this question a slightly different way.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's put in that you're the lucky one who got a ride in the spaceship

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and your friends stuck back on lame old planet earth.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Once again though, let's say your friend is going to wave to you every 8 seconds.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now--now that the roles are reversed and you're in the spaceship and your friends are on earth,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I want to know an answer to the same question--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
how much time will lapse on your clock between waves?

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Can you enter your answer here in seconds?
