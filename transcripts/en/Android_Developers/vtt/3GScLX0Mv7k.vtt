Ringgold: When I grew up,

00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.375
there were no cars
in the street.

00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:06.333
Very few people had cars.

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.458
I was born in 1930 in Harlem

00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:10.500
on 146th Street,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.667
and now, my work
is all over the world.

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:15.250
The Guggenheim, the Tate--
everywhere.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.833
[singing]

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:19.458
Interestingly enough,
I never thought of myself

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:20.917
becoming an artist.

00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:22.167
I just thought of artist

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:23.292
as something that you do.

00:00:23.292 --> 00:00:25.125
Everybody does it.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.667
Look at that.
Aren't they beautiful?

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:28.792
The art of a people

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:32.583
comes from what they are seeing
around them,

00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:37.042
and I saw so many
beautiful color combinations

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:41.625
and I interpreted
what I was looking and seeing.

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:45.417
Anyone can fly.
All you got to do is try.

00:00:45.417 --> 00:00:49.125
The most important thing
to me in life

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:51.083
is inspiration.

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:54.917
I want to inspire others,

00:00:54.917 --> 00:00:56.708
and I want to be inspired.

00:00:56.708 --> 00:00:57.833
Isn't that something?

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:03.833
[drum music]
