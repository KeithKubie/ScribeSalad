00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.375
Last time we were talking about
the general interactions that

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:27.822
are present in a chemical bond.
The nuclear-nuclear repulsion.

00:00:27.822 --> 00:00:30.156
The electron-nuclear
attractions.

00:00:30.156 --> 00:00:33.000
The electron-electron
repulsions.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.154
And we talked about how the
competition of those three

00:00:37.154 --> 00:00:41.856
interactions are what gave rise
to this interaction potential

00:00:41.856 --> 00:00:45.148
that we drew.
It is the competition between

00:00:45.148 --> 00:00:49.381
those interactions that
determines what the bond length

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:52.986
of a molecule is.
It is the competition between

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:57.140
those interactions that
determines what the well depth

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.000
is, where the bond strength is
in a chemical bond.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.742
Well, today what we're going to
do is move on and talk about a

00:01:06.742 --> 00:01:09.463
specific model for chemical
bonding.

00:01:09.463 --> 00:01:13.739
And the model we're going to
talk about is that of Lewis

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:15.916
diagrams.
Now, interestingly,

00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:19.493
this is a model that is
non-quantum mechanical.

00:01:19.493 --> 00:01:23.458
This was invented 20 years
before quantum mechanics,

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:24.002
by G.
N.

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:25.246
Lewis.
Somehow G.

00:01:25.246 --> 00:01:26.723
N.
Lewis recognized,

00:01:26.723 --> 00:01:31.000
and I don't know how he
recognized --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.655
That's genius,
I guess.

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:36.793
But he recognized that the key
to chemical bonding was a

00:01:36.793 --> 00:01:41.156
sharing or an overlap of two
electrons, one from each atom.

00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:45.595
And he represented these ideas
using these Lewis diagrams in

00:01:45.595 --> 00:01:49.733
which he took the valence
electrons, the total number of

00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:55.000
valence electrons in the two
atoms that were forming a bond.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.895
And he redistributed them so
that one electron from each atom

00:02:00.895 --> 00:02:07.086
that was making this bond shared
an electron and the rest of the

00:02:07.086 --> 00:02:12.098
valence electrons were
distributed amongst those two

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:18.289
atoms such that each atom had an
octet of electrons around them.

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:22.907
Each atom had a rare gas
electron configuration.

00:02:22.907 --> 00:02:29.000
And that's the basis of this
idea of Lewis diagrams.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.395
The idea of the Octet Rule.
There's no chalk today.

00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:37.000
I've got a piece.
Okay, the Octet Rule.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.836
For example,
if you have a fluorine atom

00:02:45.836 --> 00:02:51.442
with its seven valence electrons
here coming together with

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:57.442
another fluorine atom with its
seven valence electrons to make

00:02:57.442 --> 00:03:02.932
a fluorine molecule.
Well, the idea is that each one

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:07.094
of these extra electrons now on
the fluorine,

00:03:07.094 --> 00:03:12.202
or these unpaired electrons,
are shared between the two

00:03:12.202 --> 00:03:14.851
fluorines.
The result is now,

00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:19.486
given the sharing,
that this fluorine has an octet

00:03:19.486 --> 00:03:25.067
of electrons around it and this
fluorine now has an octet of

00:03:25.067 --> 00:03:29.875
electrons around it.
They have this octet

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:34.656
configuration which is the lower
energy filled-shell

00:03:34.656 --> 00:03:37.937
configuration.
Now, that's the case,

00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:42.718
of course, for all the elements
except for hydrogen.

00:03:42.718 --> 00:03:47.781
In the case of hydrogen,
we're coming in with one atom.

00:03:47.781 --> 00:03:52.562
Say it's combining or reacting
with a chlorine atom.

00:03:52.562 --> 00:03:57.250
Well, in this case,
this electron from the hydrogen

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.000
is going to be shared with this
electron from the chlorine.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.846
And now, again,
this chlorine has this octet

00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:10.261
around it.
But the hydrogen,

00:04:10.261 --> 00:04:14.019
of course, is just two
electrons around it.

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.044
Its inner gas configuration is
that of helium,

00:04:18.044 --> 00:04:23.054
and so it is satisfied with
just two electrons around it.

00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:27.706
With this sharing idea,
Lewis could really understand

00:04:27.706 --> 00:04:32.000
the stoichiometry of many
compounds.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.083
He understood why hydrogen gas
was H two and not a

00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:39.291
hydrogen atom.
He understood why nitrogen gas

00:04:39.291 --> 00:04:42.208
was N two and not a
nitrogen atom.

00:04:42.208 --> 00:04:46.364
He could understand why oxygen
was O two and not an

00:04:46.364 --> 00:04:49.427
oxygen atom.
Now, these Lewis diagrams have

00:04:49.427 --> 00:04:53.510
absolutely nothing to do with
orbitals or wave functions,

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.739
which we actually know to be a
more accurate description of

00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:02.779
chemical bonding.
We're going to get to them.

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:08.544
Lewis diagrams work 90% of the
time to tell you where the

00:05:08.544 --> 00:05:14.617
electrons are in a molecule.
It works so well and it is easy

00:05:14.617 --> 00:05:20.588
that chemists have used these
Lewis diagrams before quantum

00:05:20.588 --> 00:05:26.044
mechanics and have continued to
use them after quantum

00:05:26.044 --> 00:05:30.133
mechanics.
They use them because it's easy

00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:32.886
and it works.
It allows you to understand

00:05:32.886 --> 00:05:35.776
where the electrons are in a
chemical bond,

00:05:35.776 --> 00:05:38.597
on which atoms the electrons
are centered,

00:05:38.597 --> 00:05:42.382
where the lone pairs are,
where those electrons that are

00:05:42.382 --> 00:05:46.030
in the molecule that actually
don't participate in the

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.819
chemical bond.
For example,

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.021
here in HCl,
these two electrons,

00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:52.774
these two electrons,
these two electrons,

00:05:52.774 --> 00:05:55.939
they aren't participating in
the chemical bond.

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:00.000
We call these electrons here
lone pairs.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.341
That's an important definition
that we're going to use.

00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:07.316
So we're going to look at this
system.

00:06:07.316 --> 00:06:11.095
Again, it's easy.
The alternative is solving the

00:06:11.095 --> 00:06:15.115
SchrÃ¶dinger equation,
which you don't want to do if

00:06:15.115 --> 00:06:18.412
you don't have to do,
because that's hard.

00:06:18.412 --> 00:06:22.592
You cannot do that quickly.
So that's the value here.

00:06:22.592 --> 00:06:27.015
It's going to give us a
framework, these Lewis diagrams,

00:06:27.015 --> 00:06:32.000
to kind of organize a lot of
chemical reactions.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.079
To kind of organize our ideas
of bonding and what will react

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:43.040
with what.
Let's start doing this.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:49.160
And to that we're going to have
a set of rules here.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.600
And let me put this front
screen down.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:00.079
Actually, on the side screen,
could you put my rules up

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:02.000
there?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.644
All right.
The basic idea in Lewis

00:07:19.644 --> 00:07:25.938
structures is that we're going
to take the total number of

00:07:25.938 --> 00:07:32.233
valence electrons and the two
atoms that are going to form

00:07:32.233 --> 00:07:36.296
this bond.
We are going to share electrons

00:07:36.296 --> 00:07:40.074
between the two atoms,
and then take the rest of the

00:07:40.074 --> 00:07:44.592
valence electrons and distribute
them amongst the two atoms in

00:07:44.592 --> 00:07:49.037
that molecule such that each
atom has an octet configuration.

00:07:49.037 --> 00:07:53.481
To draw a Lewis diagram you're
going to have to know what the

00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:56.148
valence electrons are.
In particular,

00:07:56.148 --> 00:08:00.000
how many valence electrons each
atom has.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.015
This you have to know really
off the top of your head.

00:08:05.015 --> 00:08:10.031
And this is just a quick list
of the number of valence

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:12.492
electrons.
Carbon has four,

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:15.615
nitrogen has five,
oxygen has six,

00:08:15.615 --> 00:08:17.981
etc.
Let's, as an example,

00:08:17.981 --> 00:08:22.050
illustrate how to draw these
Lewis diagrams.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:27.444
Here are our set of rules.
We are going to go through them

00:08:27.444 --> 00:08:31.966
step-by-step.
As you get better at this,

00:08:31.966 --> 00:08:36.127
you won't have to go through
these rules in such detail.

00:08:36.127 --> 00:08:39.380
But for now,
when we're just learning how to

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.633
do it, I think this is a very
effective way.

00:08:42.633 --> 00:08:45.508
So let's start.
Let's take an easy one.

00:08:45.508 --> 00:08:48.988
We want to draw the Lewis
structure of methane.

00:08:48.988 --> 00:08:53.527
The first thing you have to do
is you have to figure out what

00:08:53.527 --> 00:08:57.839
the skeletal structure is.
You have to kind of figure out,

00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:02.000
as a first pass,
what is bonded to what.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.522
And now I'm going to give you
some hints.

00:09:05.522 --> 00:09:08.691
First of all,
hydrogen, if you have a

00:09:08.691 --> 00:09:12.389
hydrogen atom.
That's always what we call a

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:16.264
terminal atom.
Terminal means that it is only

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:21.194
bonded to one other atom.
Chlorine atoms also are usually

00:09:21.194 --> 00:09:24.628
only terminal atoms.
Hydrogen always is.

00:09:24.628 --> 00:09:30.000
Fluorine is 99% of the time
only a terminal atom.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.484
In the case of methane,
which you know has four

00:09:33.484 --> 00:09:37.424
hydrogens and one carbon,
if the hydrogens have to be

00:09:37.424 --> 00:09:40.757
terminal, well,
then there is only one choice

00:09:40.757 --> 00:09:43.030
here.
You put the carbon in the

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.227
center.
So that's our skeletal

00:09:45.227 --> 00:09:48.106
structure.
Number two here on our Lewis

00:09:48.106 --> 00:09:51.893
diagrams, it says count the
total number of valence

00:09:51.893 --> 00:09:53.939
electrons.
So let's do that.

00:09:53.939 --> 00:09:57.878
Hydrogen has one valence
electron, but there are four

00:09:57.878 --> 00:10:01.949
hydrogens.
Carbon has four valence

00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:05.084
electrons.
The total number of valence

00:10:05.084 --> 00:10:10.338
electrons in our molecule here
is eight, and I am going to draw

00:10:10.338 --> 00:10:15.423
those eight valence electrons.
Number three here in our rules

00:10:15.423 --> 00:10:20.677
says count the total number of
electrons that you would have to

00:10:20.677 --> 00:10:25.423
have if each of the atoms had an
inner gas configuration.

00:10:25.423 --> 00:10:30.000
These are the number that we've
got, eight.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.583
And now we are calculating how
many we would like to have in

00:10:35.583 --> 00:10:40.315
the optimal situation if each
atom has an inner gas

00:10:40.315 --> 00:10:42.965
configuration.
Let's do that.

00:10:42.965 --> 00:10:47.886
Well, hydrogen wants two.
And we have four hydrogens,

00:10:47.886 --> 00:10:51.388
so four times two.
Carbon wants eight.

00:10:51.388 --> 00:10:57.160
If each of these atoms had an
inner gas configuration we would

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.429
need 16 electrons.
Step four says to calculate the

00:11:02.429 --> 00:11:06.583
number of bonding electrons,
the way you do that is by

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:11.129
taking the total number of
electrons that you would have to

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:15.754
have if each atom had a noble
gas configuration and subtract

00:11:15.754 --> 00:11:20.221
from it the total number of
electrons that you actually do

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:22.651
have.
So we're going to take 16,

00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:26.570
subtract from that eight.
We're going to have eight

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:31.428
bonding electrons.
The way I'm going to represent

00:11:31.428 --> 00:11:36.204
the eight bonding electrons,
or bonding electrons in general

00:11:36.204 --> 00:11:41.304
is that I am going to draw a red
square around my electrons that

00:11:41.304 --> 00:11:45.433
are bonding electrons.
Up here these are the valence

00:11:45.433 --> 00:11:49.804
electrons that I've got.
It says eight of those valence

00:11:49.804 --> 00:11:54.661
electrons are bonding electrons,
so I am going to draw a box.

00:11:54.661 --> 00:11:59.438
Those are my bonding electrons.
Step five says to assign two

00:11:59.438 --> 00:12:04.566
bonding electrons to each bond.
Well, let's do that,

00:12:04.566 --> 00:12:07.777
assign two bonding electrons to
each bond.

00:12:07.777 --> 00:12:12.006
Well, if we put two there,
two there, two there and two

00:12:12.006 --> 00:12:17.018
there, then we've used up all of
our valence electrons and all of

00:12:17.018 --> 00:12:20.072
our bonding electrons in that
structure.

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:24.692
Number six says if you've got
bonding electrons that remain,

00:12:24.692 --> 00:12:29.000
well, the answer is no,
we used them all up.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.726
And number seven says do we
have any valence electrons left?

00:12:33.726 --> 00:12:35.808
The answer is no,
we don't.

00:12:35.808 --> 00:12:38.852
We've used them all up.
So we are done.

00:12:38.852 --> 00:12:42.857
And you can see that.
The hydrogen has an inner gas

00:12:42.857 --> 00:12:46.943
configuration around it,
the carbon has an inner gas

00:12:46.943 --> 00:12:50.307
configuration,
an octet of electrons around

00:12:50.307 --> 00:12:52.870
it.
Hey, we're done with methane.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.235
But you could have done that
anyway, right?

00:12:56.235 --> 00:12:56.956
Yes?
Yeah.

00:12:56.956 --> 00:13:02.250
Here is another one.
Oh, one other concept here.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:06.916
In this particular structure,
carbon is the central atom.

00:13:06.916 --> 00:13:11.833
What I mean by a central atom
is an atom to which everything

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:15.416
else is bonded.
Sometimes we're going to ask

00:13:15.416 --> 00:13:20.333
you to write a Lewis structure,
and we are going to tell you

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:25.666
what atom is the central atom so
you know to put it in the center

00:13:25.666 --> 00:13:30.000
and everything else gets
connected to it.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.898
Let's do a higher one.
Here is this molecule.

00:13:33.898 --> 00:13:37.354
It is going to be hydrogen
cyanide, HCN.

00:13:37.354 --> 00:13:42.582
The first thing you have to do,
according to our rule number

00:13:42.582 --> 00:13:45.772
one, is to draw a skeletal
structure.

00:13:45.772 --> 00:13:51.177
You have a choice here of how
to draw that skeletal structure.

00:13:51.177 --> 00:13:56.316
You can put the nitrogen in the
center or the carbon in the

00:13:56.316 --> 00:14:00.475
center.
Hydrogen is not going to go in

00:14:00.475 --> 00:14:05.259
the center because we know the
hydrogen is terminal always.

00:14:05.259 --> 00:14:09.879
What you often do is a first
pass when you're drawing the

00:14:09.879 --> 00:14:13.674
skeletal structure,
is that you put the element

00:14:13.674 --> 00:14:17.552
with the lowest ionization
energy in the middle.

00:14:17.552 --> 00:14:20.605
That is what our rule number
one said.

00:14:20.605 --> 00:14:25.225
Element with lowest ionization
energy goes in the middle.

00:14:25.225 --> 00:14:28.029
That often is true,
but not always.

00:14:28.029 --> 00:14:33.197
This is a first pass.
I am going to show you a little

00:14:33.197 --> 00:14:37.379
bit later some cases where this
won't be true and how we are

00:14:37.379 --> 00:14:41.065
going to determine that the
lowest ionization element

00:14:41.065 --> 00:14:44.822
doesn't go in the center.
We're going to have a way to

00:14:44.822 --> 00:14:47.232
figure this out.
But for right now,

00:14:47.232 --> 00:14:50.989
if you had no other choices,
that's what you would do,

00:14:50.989 --> 00:14:54.959
you'd write a structure with
the lowest ionization energy

00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:59.000
element in the center.
Okay, so we did that.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.653
Number two, calculate the total
number of valence electrons in

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:06.629
this molecule.
Well, hydrogen brings one

00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:11.435
valence electron into the party,
carbon brings four and nitrogen

00:15:11.435 --> 00:15:14.640
brings five.
We have a total of ten valence

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.539
electrons.
I am going to draw those ten

00:15:17.539 --> 00:15:21.049
valence electrons.
While you are learning to do

00:15:21.049 --> 00:15:25.550
this, you might also want to
draw ten valence electrons like

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:29.406
this.
Next step, calculate the total

00:15:29.406 --> 00:15:33.497
number of electrons each atom
would have to have if,

00:15:33.497 --> 00:15:36.545
in an ideal world,
they had a noble gas

00:15:36.545 --> 00:15:40.957
configuration without sharing.
Well, the total number of

00:15:40.957 --> 00:15:45.770
electrons that we would have to
have is two for the hydrogen,

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:49.540
eight for the carbon and eight
for the nitrogen.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.711
A total number of 18.
Step four says we calculate the

00:15:53.711 --> 00:15:59.122
number of bonding electrons.
To do that we subtract the

00:15:59.122 --> 00:16:03.612
total number that we would have
to have for an inner gas

00:16:03.612 --> 00:16:07.204
configuration,
18, from the total number that

00:16:07.204 --> 00:16:09.897
we actually do have,
which is ten.

00:16:09.897 --> 00:16:12.918
The result is eight bonding
electrons.

00:16:12.918 --> 00:16:17.489
I am going to now draw this red
square around the valence

00:16:17.489 --> 00:16:21.408
electrons that are going to be
bonding electrons.

00:16:21.408 --> 00:16:24.346
Here it goes,
we've got eight bonding

00:16:24.346 --> 00:16:29.000
electrons and two electrons left
out here.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.391
We will see that in a moment,
where they go.

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:35.783
Number five,
assign two bonding electrons to

00:16:35.783 --> 00:16:38.150
each bond.
We'll put two there,

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.516
we put two there,
that's great.

00:16:40.516 --> 00:16:43.671
We've now used up four bonding
electrons.

00:16:43.671 --> 00:16:46.984
We've got four more bonding
electrons left.

00:16:46.984 --> 00:16:50.061
Our next step is,
do we have any bonding

00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:52.111
electrons left?
We sure do.

00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:56.292
We've got four of them.
In that case you start to make

00:16:56.292 --> 00:17:02.620
double bonds or triple bonds.
A double bond is one in which

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:07.590
four electrons are shared.
A triple bond is one in which

00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:12.560
six electrons are shared.
In general, which atoms do you

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.265
make double bonds or triple
bonds between?

00:17:16.265 --> 00:17:20.060
Well, in general,
double bonds form between

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.222
carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen and sulfur.

00:17:23.222 --> 00:17:27.018
Triple bonds usually restrict
it to carbon,

00:17:27.018 --> 00:17:30.924
nitrogen and oxygen.
In this case,

00:17:30.924 --> 00:17:33.625
we've got a carbon and a
nitrogen here,

00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:36.327
we've got four extra bonding
electrons.

00:17:36.327 --> 00:17:40.592
Well, what we are going to do
is we are going to put these in

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:43.080
between the carbon and the
nitrogen.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.279
We're going to have a triple
bond right there.

00:17:46.279 --> 00:17:49.478
We took care of all our bonding
electrons now.

00:17:49.478 --> 00:17:53.317
Step seven, do we have any
valence electrons remaining?

00:17:53.317 --> 00:17:56.303
We sure do.
We've got two valence electrons

00:17:56.303 --> 00:18:00.000
remaining.
What do we do with them?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.602
Well, we assign them as lone
pairs.

00:18:02.602 --> 00:18:06.353
We look to see which atoms
don't have an inner gas

00:18:06.353 --> 00:18:08.955
configuration.
Well, hydrogen does.

00:18:08.955 --> 00:18:12.859
The carbon does now.
It's got eight electrons around

00:18:12.859 --> 00:18:15.002
it.
But the nitrogen doesn't.

00:18:15.002 --> 00:18:18.599
It only has six.
So we're going to put those two

00:18:18.599 --> 00:18:21.585
extra valence electrons,
as a lone pair,

00:18:21.585 --> 00:18:25.259
here on the nitrogen.
And now the nitrogen has an

00:18:25.259 --> 00:18:28.780
octet around it.
These two electrons are called

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:34.391
lone pairs.
They don't participate in the

00:18:34.391 --> 00:18:38.250
chemical bonding.
We did that one.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:44.447
Next one, thionyl chloride.
It is Cl two SO.

00:18:44.447 --> 00:18:49.826
How do you do this one?
Well, as a first guess,

00:18:49.826 --> 00:18:56.141
the halogens usually are
terminal atoms so they are not

00:18:56.141 --> 00:19:02.033
bonded to anything else.
That's usually the case.

00:19:02.033 --> 00:19:05.000
Not always, especially for
chlorine.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.983
We're going to put the
chlorines out on the ends

00:19:08.983 --> 00:19:12.457
somewhere.
So then do we put oxygen in the

00:19:12.457 --> 00:19:17.542
center or sulfur in the center?
Well, we're going to pick the

00:19:17.542 --> 00:19:22.966
lowest ionization energy element
and will put that in the center.

00:19:22.966 --> 00:19:27.288
That is going to be sulfur.
So we will try this as a

00:19:27.288 --> 00:19:31.943
skeletal structure.
Count the total number of

00:19:31.943 --> 00:19:35.595
valence electrons.
Chlorine brings seven valence

00:19:35.595 --> 00:19:39.559
electrons into the party,
and there are two chlorine

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:41.424
atoms.
Sulfur brings six.

00:19:41.424 --> 00:19:45.155
Oxygen brings six.
We've got a total number of 26

00:19:45.155 --> 00:19:48.497
valence electrons.
Let me draw them all out.

00:19:48.497 --> 00:19:53.082
Step number three is calculate
the total number of electrons

00:19:53.082 --> 00:19:57.746
that we would have to have for
each atom to have an inner gas

00:19:57.746 --> 00:20:02.423
configuration.
We've got four atoms here.

00:20:02.423 --> 00:20:07.457
Each one of them has got eight.
We're going to have 32.

00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:12.957
That's what we would need for
an inner gas configuration for

00:20:12.957 --> 00:20:16.220
each atom.
Let's calculate the total

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:21.161
number of bonding electrons.
Well, that's 32 minus the

00:20:21.161 --> 00:20:24.796
number of valence electrons.
That's six.

00:20:24.796 --> 00:20:30.016
Of those 26 valence electrons,
let me draw my bonding box

00:20:30.016 --> 00:20:35.362
around six of them.
Next step is to assign those

00:20:35.362 --> 00:20:38.906
bonding electrons.
That's going to be easy.

00:20:38.906 --> 00:20:42.112
Put two there,
two there and two there.

00:20:42.112 --> 00:20:46.753
That means we've just used up
our six bonding electrons.

00:20:46.753 --> 00:20:51.224
Do we have any more left?
No, there aren't going to be

00:20:51.224 --> 00:20:55.275
any double bonds here.
However, we've got lots of

00:20:55.275 --> 00:21:00.000
valence electrons left.
We've got 20 of them.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.123
We're going to have to make
lone pairs with those 20 excess

00:21:04.123 --> 00:21:07.606
valence electrons.
We're going to have to make ten

00:21:07.606 --> 00:21:11.232
lone pairs so that each atom has
an octet around it.

00:21:11.232 --> 00:21:14.573
So let's do that.
We're going to put six of them

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:18.056
around the oxygen,
so now the oxygen has an octet,

00:21:18.056 --> 00:21:19.905
another six,
there they go,

00:21:19.905 --> 00:21:23.175
another six around the
chlorine, there they go,

00:21:23.175 --> 00:21:26.516
another six around this
chlorine, there they go.

00:21:26.516 --> 00:21:30.000
And, finally,
we've got two left.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.097
Well, that's going to have to
go onto sulfur to make an octet.

00:21:35.097 --> 00:21:37.270
There it goes.
We are done.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:41.949
We've used up all of our
valence electrons and we have an

00:21:41.949 --> 00:21:46.211
octet around each one of the
atoms in that molecule.

00:21:46.211 --> 00:21:50.557
So that's the basic procedure
for writing these Lewis

00:21:50.557 --> 00:21:53.899
diagrams.
But now, I talked about putting

00:21:53.899 --> 00:22:00.000
the lowest ionization energy
element in the center sometimes.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.214
And I talked about you've got
try this skeletal structure

00:22:07.214 --> 00:22:11.852
first.
How do we really know if we've

00:22:11.852 --> 00:22:19.325
drawn the right Lewis diagram?
Well, the way we're going to

00:22:19.325 --> 00:22:24.993
tell is by this concept called
Formal Charge.

00:22:24.993 --> 00:22:32.723
Formal charge is a measure of
the extent to which an atom has

00:22:32.723 --> 00:22:42.000
gained or lost an electron when
it has formed a chemical bond.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.516
So compared to when it is an
atom, the formal charge tells

00:22:47.516 --> 00:22:53.709
you how much of an electron that
has been gained by it or lost by

00:22:53.709 --> 00:22:56.903
it.
I will make that a little more

00:22:56.903 --> 00:23:01.548
real in just a moment.
How do you assign a formal

00:23:01.548 --> 00:23:05.208
charge?
Well, we've got a recipe for

00:23:05.208 --> 00:23:07.575
this.
That formal charge is the

00:23:07.575 --> 00:23:10.414
following.
You count up the number of

00:23:10.414 --> 00:23:13.096
valence electrons on the free
atom.

00:23:13.096 --> 00:23:17.671
We're going to call that V.
We're going to subtract from it

00:23:17.671 --> 00:23:22.562
the number of electrons that are
lone pairs on that atom in the

00:23:22.562 --> 00:23:26.427
molecule, so V minus L.
And then the third step is

00:23:26.427 --> 00:23:30.292
you're going to subtract
one-half of the number of

00:23:30.292 --> 00:23:35.995
bonding electrons that atom has.
Or, one-half the number of

00:23:35.995 --> 00:23:39.142
electrons that it shares in that
molecule.

00:23:39.142 --> 00:23:41.598
So it's V minus L minus S over
2.

00:23:41.598 --> 00:23:44.515
S is the number of electrons it
shares.

00:23:44.515 --> 00:23:48.813
That's the formal charge.

00:23:48.813 --> 00:23:52.037
Let's illustrate this.
Let's take this ion,

00:23:52.037 --> 00:23:55.260
CN minus.
I already drew the Lewis

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:58.638
structure here,
so now what we're going to do

00:23:58.638 --> 00:24:03.473
is we're going to calculate the
formal charge for carbon and the

00:24:03.473 --> 00:24:09.000
formal charge for nitrogen
within this Lewis structure.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.190
Formal charges depend on the
Lewis structure.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:14.904
Ready?
Let's do it.

00:24:14.904 --> 00:24:19.666
For carbon, V is 4.
We have four valence electrons.

00:24:19.666 --> 00:24:24.714
In this structure L is 2.
L is the number of lone pair

00:24:24.714 --> 00:24:29.000
electrons.
Look at in this structure.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.411
Here are these electrons,
the lone pair that don't

00:24:32.411 --> 00:24:35.544
participate in the bond.
We have two lone pair

00:24:35.544 --> 00:24:37.145
electrons.
It's minus 2.

00:24:37.145 --> 00:24:41.044
And then we have to subtract
from that minus one-half the

00:24:41.044 --> 00:24:44.734
number of shared electrons.
Well, the number of shared

00:24:44.734 --> 00:24:47.518
electrons in the case of the
carbon is 6.

00:24:47.518 --> 00:24:50.651
We've got a triple bond here.
That's 6 over 2,

00:24:50.651 --> 00:24:53.367
that's 3.
The formal charge on carbon in

00:24:53.367 --> 00:24:57.753
this Lewis structure is minus 1.
What we often do is put a minus

00:24:57.753 --> 00:25:02.000
1 somewhere near that carbon and
circle it.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.158
That is the formal charge on
the carbon.

00:25:06.158 --> 00:25:11.808
What that means is that the
carbon has gained one more

00:25:11.808 --> 00:25:15.966
electron than it usually has as
an atom.

00:25:15.966 --> 00:25:21.084
It's a little bit more
negatively charged in this

00:25:21.084 --> 00:25:26.415
molecule than it is in the atom.
Let's do nitrogen.

00:25:26.415 --> 00:25:31.000
Nitrogen, valence electrons
five.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.078
Then minus the number of lone
pairs.

00:25:34.078 --> 00:25:37.420
Well, that's 2.
Here is that lone pair.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:42.521
And then it's minus one-half
the number of shared electrons

00:25:42.521 --> 00:25:45.687
or bonding electrons.
Well, that's 3.

00:25:45.687 --> 00:25:48.677
The result is a formal charge
of 0.

00:25:48.677 --> 00:25:53.778
And so what we would usually do
is we'd write a zero with a

00:25:53.778 --> 00:25:58.000
circle around it near that
nitrogen.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.803
So the formal charge on carbon
is minus 1, the formal charge on

00:26:02.803 --> 00:26:07.607
nitrogen is 0 in this structure,
but now you've got to check to

00:26:07.607 --> 00:26:10.242
make sure you did everything
right.

00:26:10.242 --> 00:26:14.038
And here is the check.
The check is that the total

00:26:14.038 --> 00:26:17.060
charges here,
minus 1 plus 0 is minus 1,

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:21.709
the sum of the formal charges
has to equal the overall charge

00:26:21.709 --> 00:26:24.963
on the molecule.
Minus 1 plus 0 is minus 1.

00:26:24.963 --> 00:26:30.000
That does equal the overall
charge on the molecule.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.140
So we did everything right.
That is an important thing to

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.537
check.
That's how you calculate formal

00:26:38.537 --> 00:26:41.291
charge.
Now, how do you use it?

00:26:41.291 --> 00:26:45.698
Well, first of all,
before I tell you how you use

00:26:45.698 --> 00:26:51.206
it, let me just emphasize that
formal charge is not oxidation

00:26:51.206 --> 00:26:54.144
number.
Oxidation number does not

00:26:54.144 --> 00:27:00.697
depend on the Lewis structure.
Formal charge depends on the

00:27:00.697 --> 00:27:04.744
Lewis structure.
You're going to talk about

00:27:04.744 --> 00:27:08.501
oxidation number with Professor
Drennan.

00:27:08.501 --> 00:27:12.548
If you don't know what it is,
that is okay.

00:27:12.548 --> 00:27:16.209
You will learn about it in a
few weeks.

00:27:16.209 --> 00:27:21.893
But if you do know what it is,
I just want to emphasize that

00:27:21.893 --> 00:27:27.000
formal charge is not the
oxidation number.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.918
How do we use formal charge to
make sure that we've got the

00:27:32.918 --> 00:27:37.306
correct Lewis structure?
That's what you do.

00:27:37.306 --> 00:27:40.979
[LAUGHTER] You use the formal
charge.

00:27:40.979 --> 00:27:47.204
What you do is you realize that
structures with lower absolute

00:27:47.204 --> 00:27:52.714
values of formal charge are the
more stable structures.

00:27:52.714 --> 00:27:58.530
Structures which have formal
charges on the atoms that are

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:04.479
lower are more stable.
Structures where the number of

00:28:04.479 --> 00:28:08.942
electrons that the atom has
gained or lost in forming a

00:28:08.942 --> 00:28:12.661
molecule is smaller are the
stable structures.

00:28:12.661 --> 00:28:17.041
This is really important
because you're going to often

00:28:17.041 --> 00:28:21.586
have a situation where you've
got two different skeletal

00:28:21.586 --> 00:28:24.975
structures.
You've obeyed all of the rules

00:28:24.975 --> 00:28:30.016
for drawing the Lewis diagrams
of those two different skeletal

00:28:30.016 --> 00:28:33.840
structures.
Those two different

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.006
arrangements of atoms.
But only one of those

00:28:38.006 --> 00:28:41.203
structures is going to be
correct.

00:28:41.203 --> 00:28:47.015
And the one that is correct is
going to have the lower set of

00:28:47.015 --> 00:28:50.503
absolute values of the formal
charge.

00:28:50.503 --> 00:28:54.862
So let's illustrate this.
Let's take this ion.

00:28:54.862 --> 00:28:59.221
It's the thiocyanate ion,
NCS minus,

00:28:59.221 --> 00:29:05.100
as I have written it here.
Now, if you were just told

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:09.623
you've got an ion that has
nitrogen, carbon and sulfur in

00:29:09.623 --> 00:29:12.774
it, you might say,
well, how do I start?

00:29:12.774 --> 00:29:16.974
Well, you could start by
putting the element with the

00:29:16.974 --> 00:29:20.044
lowest ionization energy in the
center.

00:29:20.044 --> 00:29:22.871
That would be a good place to
start.

00:29:22.871 --> 00:29:26.749
You should do that.
But what we're going to do is

00:29:26.749 --> 00:29:32.000
we're going to look at all three
possibilities here.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.628
We're going to look at a Lewis
structure where the carbon is in

00:29:36.628 --> 00:29:39.988
the middle, where the sulfur is
in the middle,

00:29:39.988 --> 00:29:43.199
and now where the nitrogen is
in the middle.

00:29:43.199 --> 00:29:45.737
And we drew these Lewis
structures.

00:29:45.737 --> 00:29:50.067
I've already drawn them here
for you according to our rules

00:29:50.067 --> 00:29:53.651
posted here on these walls.
But only one of these

00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:57.608
structures is correct.
And we're going to use the idea

00:29:57.608 --> 00:30:01.416
of formal charges to determine
which one is correct,

00:30:01.416 --> 00:30:05.000
which one has the lowest
energy.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.439
If we take this structure and
we calculate the formal charge

00:30:10.439 --> 00:30:14.127
for nitrogen,
we will find it is minus 1.

00:30:14.127 --> 00:30:17.907
The formal charge on the carbon
here is 0.

00:30:17.907 --> 00:30:21.687
The formal charge on the sulfur
here is 0.

00:30:21.687 --> 00:30:25.652
So I already did these
calculations for you.

00:30:25.652 --> 00:30:31.000
If you sum up the formal
charges we get minus 1.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.311
The overall charge on this ion
is minus 1.

00:30:34.311 --> 00:30:37.543
We did it right.
We did everything right.

00:30:37.543 --> 00:30:41.259
You should check your formal
charges like this.

00:30:41.259 --> 00:30:44.651
Let's do the same thing for
this structure.

00:30:44.651 --> 00:30:48.771
We calculate the formal charge
on carbon is minus 2.

00:30:48.771 --> 00:30:51.356
The formal charge on sulfur is
2.

00:30:51.356 --> 00:30:54.587
The formal charge on nitrogen
is minus 1.

00:30:54.587 --> 00:30:58.545
Let's sum these up.
When we do that we get a minus

00:30:58.545 --> 00:31:02.981
1.
It indeed matches the overall

00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:07.504
charge on the ion.
Let's calculate the formal

00:31:07.504 --> 00:31:11.514
charges for each atom here.
Sulfur is 0.

00:31:11.514 --> 00:31:14.803
Nitrogen is 1.
Carbon is minus 2.

00:31:14.803 --> 00:31:19.018
Overall charge minus 1.
We did that right.

00:31:19.018 --> 00:31:24.570
Now, which one of these
structures is the lowest energy

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:26.214
structure?
Ready?

00:31:26.214 --> 00:31:33.000
I'm going to ask you to raise
your hand or to scream.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.334
Is it structure number one?
Yes.

00:31:36.334 --> 00:31:39.561
Is it structure number two?
No.

00:31:39.561 --> 00:31:43.003
Is it structure number three?
No.

00:31:43.003 --> 00:31:47.199
You're right.
It's structure number one.

00:31:47.199 --> 00:31:51.394
It has the lowest set of formal
charges.

00:31:51.394 --> 00:31:56.235
Minus 1, 0, 0.
Only one atom here has a formal

00:31:56.235 --> 00:32:02.210
charge other than zero.
These two structures have

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:05.393
formal charges that are minus 2
or 2.

00:32:05.393 --> 00:32:09.637
I don't think that there is a
structure on earth,

00:32:09.637 --> 00:32:13.881
well, maybe there is,
that has a formal charge of

00:32:13.881 --> 00:32:19.009
minus 2 or 2 that will make it
the lowest energy structure.

00:32:19.009 --> 00:32:22.987
If you've got a structure with
a minus 2 or 2,

00:32:22.987 --> 00:32:26.347
that's very,
very likely not the lowest

00:32:26.347 --> 00:32:31.956
energy structure.
This is a powerful tool to know

00:32:31.956 --> 00:32:37.584
if you have drawn your skeleton
correctly, so remember this.

00:32:37.584 --> 00:32:42.640
It's really important.
On an exam, we're going to tell

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:47.790
you to draw the Lewis structure
with the lowest energy.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:53.418
You're going to have to try
several of them to see which one

00:32:53.418 --> 00:33:00.000
has the lowest set of absolute
values for the formal charge.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Question?

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.113
Number of valence electrons on
the carbon is 4 minus the number

00:33:29.113 --> 00:33:32.000
of lone pairs on the carbon is
4.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.449
That's 2.
4, is that your question?

00:33:35.449 --> 00:33:37.579
Yeah.
Other questions?

00:33:37.579 --> 00:33:40.724
Okay.
Here is another use of the

00:33:40.724 --> 00:33:44.985
formal charge.
This is also determining the

00:33:44.985 --> 00:33:50.362
skeletal structure here,
but you will see a problem in

00:33:50.362 --> 00:33:54.724
just a moment.
Here is another special case.

00:33:54.724 --> 00:34:00.000
We have CH three NHO minus.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.596
How do you draw,
in this case here,

00:34:03.596 --> 00:34:09.413
that skeletal structure?
Could I have some lights on the

00:34:09.413 --> 00:34:11.000
board here?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.541
CH3 here, this is what we call
a methyl group.

00:34:26.541 --> 00:34:33.000
It is always terminal since the
hydrogens are always terminal.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.025
So the structure looks like
this.

00:34:36.025 --> 00:34:39.996
And the carbon,
then, is bonded to the next

00:34:39.996 --> 00:34:43.778
element over.
If you see a structure like

00:34:43.778 --> 00:34:48.410
this, where you've got lots of
different elements,

00:34:48.410 --> 00:34:52.570
the first pass,
just take these elements in a

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:55.690
row.
The CH3, this methyl group is

00:34:55.690 --> 00:35:01.260
bonded to the nitrogen.
The next one is hydrogen,

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:06.504
but we know we're not going to
put the hydrogen between the

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:12.199
nitrogen and the oxygen because
the hydrogen is always terminal.

00:35:12.199 --> 00:35:17.715
So the hydrogen is either going
to go here, or the hydrogen is

00:35:17.715 --> 00:35:21.783
going to go here.
And that's the question that

00:35:21.783 --> 00:35:25.219
we're going to ask here,
on this slide,

00:35:25.219 --> 00:35:29.920
is this the correct structure,
or is this the correct

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:34.818
structure?
I drew the skeletal structures,

00:35:34.818 --> 00:35:38.909
I drew the Lewis diagrams.
Which one is right?

00:35:38.909 --> 00:35:43.545
Well, if I go and calculate the
formal charges here,

00:35:43.545 --> 00:35:48.909
I would find that the formal
charge on oxygen is minus 1 and

00:35:48.909 --> 00:35:53.090
that the formal charge on all
other atoms is 0.

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:57.272
In this structure,
if I go calculate the formal

00:35:57.272 --> 00:36:03.000
charge on the nitrogen in this
structure is minus 1.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.941
And then the formal charges on
all the other atoms are 0.

00:36:07.941 --> 00:36:12.176
We've got a problem here.
We've got two different

00:36:12.176 --> 00:36:16.676
structures, and they have
absolutely the same set of

00:36:16.676 --> 00:36:21.088
formal charges in terms of the
absolute magnitudes.

00:36:21.088 --> 00:36:25.852
We have only one atom that has
a minus 1 formal charge,

00:36:25.852 --> 00:36:31.411
only one atom that has one more
electron that it usually does in

00:36:31.411 --> 00:36:36.000
its unbonded state,
in its atomic state.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.976
So which one of these is
correct?

00:36:38.976 --> 00:36:43.534
Well, it turns out that this
structure is correct.

00:36:43.534 --> 00:36:48.930
It is correct because of this.
It is correct because we put

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:54.325
the formal charge on the most
electronegative atom which is

00:36:54.325 --> 00:36:57.767
oxygen.
Oxygen is more electronegative

00:36:57.767 --> 00:37:02.047
than nitrogen.
That is the other key here,

00:37:02.047 --> 00:37:06.293
is that if you've got two
structures, same sets of formal

00:37:06.293 --> 00:37:10.616
charges, and you have a choice
of putting the minus formal

00:37:10.616 --> 00:37:13.649
charge on an atom,
you put it on the most

00:37:13.649 --> 00:37:17.516
electronegative atom.
That is going to be the lowest

00:37:17.516 --> 00:37:21.156
energy structure.
In general here we talked about

00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:24.796
the electronegativities.
The electronegativity of

00:37:24.796 --> 00:37:29.118
fluorine is greater than oxygen,
is greater than nitrogen,

00:37:29.118 --> 00:37:35.376
is greater than carbon.
That is something that you will

00:37:35.376 --> 00:37:39.950
need to know.
So we've seen how this formal

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:46.594
charge now is useful in figuring
out whether or not we had the

00:37:46.594 --> 00:37:50.732
right skeletal structure to
begin with.

00:37:50.732 --> 00:37:54.000
Now, here is another --

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.133
-- utility of formal charge.
Let's look at this structure

00:38:04.133 --> 00:38:07.897
NO3 minus.
Well, I know ahead of time that

00:38:07.897 --> 00:38:11.292
we're going to put this nitrogen
in the center.

00:38:11.292 --> 00:38:15.278
If you just had NO3 minus and
you didn't know anything,

00:38:15.278 --> 00:38:19.780
you would have to play around
with some structures and look at

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:22.954
formal charges,
but I have already done that

00:38:22.954 --> 00:38:26.128
playing around,
so I know to put nitrogen in

00:38:26.128 --> 00:38:29.154
the center.
But let's do the Lewis diagram

00:38:29.154 --> 00:38:32.673
for this.
We count up the valence

00:38:32.673 --> 00:38:35.584
electrons.
We've got six for every one of

00:38:35.584 --> 00:38:38.276
the oxygens and five for the
nitrogen.

00:38:38.276 --> 00:38:42.788
And now, this one is important,
we added an extra electron when

00:38:42.788 --> 00:38:45.335
we counted up the valence
electrons.

00:38:45.335 --> 00:38:49.265
That extra valence electron
comes because this is an O3

00:38:49.265 --> 00:38:52.394
minus.
We have an extra electron on

00:38:52.394 --> 00:38:56.178
NO3, so we have to count it in
our valence electrons.

00:38:56.178 --> 00:39:00.399
If this was NO3 plus,
we would subtract one right

00:39:00.399 --> 00:39:03.839
here.
But this is NO3 minus,

00:39:03.839 --> 00:39:08.185
so we've got to add one.
That's 24 valence electrons.

00:39:08.185 --> 00:39:11.362
Let me draw them all out.
Number three.

00:39:11.362 --> 00:39:16.377
Let's calculate the number of
electrons that we would have to

00:39:16.377 --> 00:39:20.306
have if each atom had a noble
gas configuration.

00:39:20.306 --> 00:39:24.068
That would be 32 because we've
got four atoms.

00:39:24.068 --> 00:39:29.000
Let's calculate the number of
bonding electrons.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.713
Well, that's 32 minus 24 or
eight.

00:39:31.713 --> 00:39:35.907
So, of those 24 valence
electrons, eight of them are

00:39:35.907 --> 00:39:38.867
bonding electrons.
Let's assign them.

00:39:38.867 --> 00:39:41.334
Well, here is two,
here is two,

00:39:41.334 --> 00:39:43.472
there is two.
That's great.

00:39:43.472 --> 00:39:46.761
We used up six.
Do we have any remaining?

00:39:46.761 --> 00:39:48.816
We sure do.
We've got two,

00:39:48.816 --> 00:39:53.503
so we're going to have to make
one of these a double bond.

00:39:53.503 --> 00:39:57.944
So we've got one double bond
there between nitrogen and

00:39:57.944 --> 00:40:01.949
oxygen.
Now, we've got a lot of

00:40:01.949 --> 00:40:06.101
remaining valence electrons.
We've got 16 that are

00:40:06.101 --> 00:40:09.491
remaining.
We're going to distribute them

00:40:09.491 --> 00:40:14.661
around the oxygens in order to
make an octet around each atom.

00:40:14.661 --> 00:40:16.694
There we go.
We did that.

00:40:16.694 --> 00:40:21.186
And so now we've used up all of
our valence electrons.

00:40:21.186 --> 00:40:24.067
Let's calculate the formal
charges.

00:40:24.067 --> 00:40:30.000
The formal charge on the singly
bonded oxygen is minus 1.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.569
I put a minus 1 there.
I'm going to put a minus 1

00:40:33.569 --> 00:40:36.320
there.
The formal charge on the doubly

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.071
bonded oxygen right in here,
that's 0.

00:40:39.071 --> 00:40:42.864
I'm going to put a 0 there.
The formal charge on the

00:40:42.864 --> 00:40:44.648
nitrogen, well,
that's 1.

00:40:44.648 --> 00:40:48.961
I'm going to put a 1 there.
If I sum up the formal charges,

00:40:48.961 --> 00:40:51.935
I get a minus 1.
That does agree with the

00:40:51.935 --> 00:40:55.802
overall charge on this molecule,
NO3 minus.

00:40:55.802 --> 00:41:01.227
So we did everything right.
But now you see something a

00:41:01.227 --> 00:41:03.372
little strange here,
right?

00:41:03.372 --> 00:41:06.012
And that is,
for whatever reason,

00:41:06.012 --> 00:41:10.550
I picked this nitrogen and
oxygen to make a double bond.

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:15.005
But I could have also made the
double bond between this

00:41:15.005 --> 00:41:18.882
nitrogen and oxygen.
And if I had calculated the

00:41:18.882 --> 00:41:22.429
formal charges,
I would have identically the

00:41:22.429 --> 00:41:26.967
same set of formal charges.
Or, I could have picked this

00:41:26.967 --> 00:41:32.000
oxygen and nitrogen to put in
the double bond.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.014
If I calculated the formal
charges, I'd have the same set

00:41:37.014 --> 00:41:41.134
of formal charges.
So we've got three different

00:41:41.134 --> 00:41:46.238
structures, all which have the
same set of formal charges.

00:41:46.238 --> 00:41:51.522
What are we going to do here?
Which one of these is correct?

00:41:51.522 --> 00:41:55.194
Well, when you've got this
situation here,

00:41:55.194 --> 00:42:00.029
this is a hint that you've got
what we call a resonance

00:42:00.029 --> 00:42:03.941
structure.
So if you have the same

00:42:03.941 --> 00:42:08.584
skeletal arrangement and you've
just got three different

00:42:08.584 --> 00:42:13.058
structures, and the electrons
are in different places,

00:42:13.058 --> 00:42:16.435
and the same set of formal
charges exist,

00:42:16.435 --> 00:42:21.162
this is a hint that you have
something called a resonance

00:42:21.162 --> 00:42:24.538
structure.
What is a resonance structure?

00:42:24.538 --> 00:42:29.303
Well, here is the bottom line.
In NO3 minus,

00:42:29.303 --> 00:42:35.219
if you look at the structure of
that ion, you would not find

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:41.536
that one of the nitrogen-oxygen
bonds was a double bond and that

00:42:41.536 --> 00:42:47.753
the other two were single bonds.
A double bond is stronger than

00:42:47.753 --> 00:42:52.265
a single bond.
A double bond is shorter than a

00:42:52.265 --> 00:42:56.276
single bond.
So if you do the appropriate

00:42:56.276 --> 00:43:02.493
experiment, you can tell whether
or not you have a shorter or a

00:43:02.493 --> 00:43:08.000
longer bond.
You can tell whether you have a

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.354
weaker or a stronger bond.
The bottom line is,

00:43:12.354 --> 00:43:17.193
that when you look at this
molecule experimentally,

00:43:17.193 --> 00:43:23.000
you do not see one bond that is
shorter and stronger than the

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:29.096
other two nitrogen-oxygen bonds.
What you find is that all three

00:43:29.096 --> 00:43:34.976
bonds are equivalent.
All three bonds have the same

00:43:34.976 --> 00:43:41.135
strength and the same length.
You find that the length of the

00:43:41.135 --> 00:43:47.192
nitrogen-oxygen bonds are a
little bit shorter than those of

00:43:47.192 --> 00:43:53.350
a single bond and you find that
the nitrogen-oxygen bonds are

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:59.201
uniformly, all three of them,
a little bit stronger than a

00:43:59.201 --> 00:44:05.492
nitrogen-oxygen single bond.
But not quite a double bond.

00:44:05.492 --> 00:44:10.833
What you find is that all of
these three bonds is like a bond

00:44:10.833 --> 00:44:14.216
and a third.
So what is happening here?

00:44:14.216 --> 00:44:19.468
What is happening here is that
this extra pair of electrons,

00:44:19.468 --> 00:44:24.810
instead of being localized on
just one of the nitrogen-oxygen

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:29.083
bonds, those extra pair of
electrons are actually

00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:33.000
delocalized over all three
bonds.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.487
And we call that a resonance
hybrid.

00:44:36.487 --> 00:44:41.867
We denote that resonance hybrid
in this way, with three

00:44:41.867 --> 00:44:46.450
different structures with
double-headed arrows.

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:50.136
This does not mean,
this is important,

00:44:50.136 --> 00:44:54.619
that the structure is
flickering between here,

00:44:54.619 --> 00:45:00.000
here and here.
That's not what is happening.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.625
Rather, these two extra
electrons are delocalized over

00:45:05.625 --> 00:45:11.994
all three bonds such that the
bond is like a bond and a third

00:45:11.994 --> 00:45:15.497
rather than one bond or two
bonds.

00:45:15.497 --> 00:45:21.441
This is called a resonance
structure, a resonance hybrid.

00:45:21.441 --> 00:45:26.960
And you will be clued in that
you've got this kind of

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:33.435
resonance hybrid if you're able
to write three structures with

00:45:33.435 --> 00:45:40.742
the same set of formal charges.
You will know to do this.

00:45:40.742 --> 00:45:44.034
Okay.
Have a nice cool weekend.

00:45:44.034 --> 00:45:45.234
See you Wednesday.
