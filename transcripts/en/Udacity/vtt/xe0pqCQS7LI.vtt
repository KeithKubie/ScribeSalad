00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.810
Okay so we just have one lesson
that covers law ethics and

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.020
privacy so we not talking about
any of these in great detail.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.970
As I said, I only talked about two of
the laws, I didn't get into privacy.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:22.440
But we do want to very briefly talk
about some of ethics related to.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.170
Online activities.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.440
So what's the difference
between laws and ethics?

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.100
We know that ethics have
to do with sort of,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.820
an individual's sense of
what is right and wrong.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.630
On the other hand, laws are sort of
societal, we as a society decide state,

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.520
local, or federal, whatever it
is laws that say what is wrong.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.020
If you did that, you would have
certain kind of sanctions.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.870
Laws may not cover certain things,
but your sense of right and

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.060
wrong might say well I
should not be doing this.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.610
And we talking about that.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.100
In the context of what we do online or
what we do in cyber space.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.200
Before we sort of go further,
it's worthwhile pointing out

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.020
that when it comes to your ethical
sort of your sense of right and wrong,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.390
of course there is no external
arbiter or enforcement agency like

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.200
law where we have police and
the courts and things like that.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.110
So what's sort of the example of an
ethical code that you could think about?

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.070
So what happens if you
discover a vulnerability in

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.100
a commercial product that's used
by lots and lots of people?

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.050
What is ethical disclosure
of this vulnerability?

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.970
So here is the idea and the dilemma.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.890
If you disclose it,
it's disclosed to the bad guys.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.190
The bad guys can then exploit it.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.950
And then can go and

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.520
attack the system in which you have
discovered a vulnerability, okay?

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.430
So that said, maybe disclosing
it is not a great thing,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.250
the other way to think about this
is that if you don't disclose it

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.230
that doesn't mean that the bad guys
actually you want to find out about it.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.140
And if you don't disclose it, then,
there's no pressure on the vendor who

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.330
actually produced this
commercial system or

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.910
product to actually do
something about it, okay?

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.640
So, by disclosing,
you sort of fix in with problem or

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.110
vulnerability we have,
hopefully in a timely fashion.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.380
But at the same time, you're also making
this information available to bad guys.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.060
So that's where do you draw the line?

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.490
What's the ethical thing to do here?

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.850
So of course, we have our personal
notion of right and wrong.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.180
So, it could be sort of your
personal thing or it could be a code

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.310
of conduct defined by some professional
society that you may be a member of.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.310
So ACM or I triple E,
or even Georgia Tech.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.154
So ethical standards are, in a court
of conduct, doing the right thing.

00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:11.580
Knowing what's right and
what is wrong of course, laws and

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.890
ethics go together to help
us understand what is that

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.050
we can do without doing anything
illegal or doing anything wrong versus

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.750
what is that should not be done
because that's the wrong thing to do.
