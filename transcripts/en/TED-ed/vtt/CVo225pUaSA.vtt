00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:07.882
Homer's "Odyssey",

00:00:07.882 --> 00:00:10.135
one of the oldest works 
of Western literature,

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:12.897
recounts the adventures 
of the Greek hero Odysseus

00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:16.337
during his ten-year journey home
from the Trojan War.

00:00:16.337 --> 00:00:19.167
Though some parts 
may be based on real events,

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:23.851
the encounters with strange monsters,
terrifying giants and powerful magicians

00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:26.294
are considered to be complete fiction.

00:00:26.294 --> 00:00:29.667
But might there be more to these myths
than meets the eye?

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:32.140
Let's look at one famous episode 
from the poem.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.293
In the midst of their long voyage,

00:00:34.293 --> 00:00:38.782
Odysseus and his crew find themselves
on the mysterious island of Aeaea.

00:00:38.782 --> 00:00:42.926
Starving and exhausted, some of the men
stumble upon a palatial home

00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:47.454
where a stunning woman welcomes them
inside for a sumptuous feast.

00:00:47.454 --> 00:00:51.313
Of course, this all turns out to be 
too good to be true.

00:00:51.313 --> 00:00:54.684
The woman, in fact, 
is the nefarious sorceress Circe,

00:00:54.684 --> 00:00:57.903
and as soon as the soldiers
have eaten their fill at her table,

00:00:57.903 --> 00:01:02.183
she turns them all into animals
with a wave of her wand.

00:01:02.183 --> 00:01:04.353
Fortunately, one of the men escapes,

00:01:04.353 --> 00:01:07.503
finds Odysseus 
and tells him of the crew's plight.

00:01:07.503 --> 00:01:10.356
But as Odysseus rushes to save his men,

00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:12.762
he meets the messenger god, Hermes,

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:15.560
who advises him to first consume
a magical herb.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.608
Odysseus follows this advice,

00:01:17.608 --> 00:01:20.968
and when he finally encounters Circe,
her spells have no effect on him,

00:01:20.968 --> 00:01:25.275
allowing him to defeat her
and rescue his crew.

00:01:25.275 --> 00:01:28.747
Naturally, this story of witchcraft
and animal transformations

00:01:28.747 --> 00:01:32.754
was dismissed as nothing more 
than imagination for centuries.

00:01:32.754 --> 00:01:36.866
But in recent years, the many mentions
of herbs and drugs throughout the passage

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:39.344
have piqued the interest of scientists,

00:01:39.344 --> 00:01:41.216
leading some to suggest

00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:45.510
the myths might have been 
fictional expressions of real experiences.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.680
The earliest versions of Homer's text

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.490
say that Circe mixed baneful drugs
into the food

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.183
such that the crew might utterly forget
their native land.

00:01:56.183 --> 00:01:59.647
As it happens, one of the plants growing
in the Mediterranean region

00:01:59.647 --> 00:02:02.846
is an innocent sounding herb
known as Jimson weed,

00:02:02.846 --> 00:02:05.762
whose effects include pronounced amnesia.

00:02:05.762 --> 00:02:09.868
The plant is also loaded with compounds
that disrupt the vital neurotransmitter

00:02:09.868 --> 00:02:12.723
called acetylcholine.

00:02:12.723 --> 00:02:15.553
Such disruption can cause 
vivid hallucinations,

00:02:15.553 --> 00:02:17.251
bizarre behaviors,

00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:20.748
and general difficulty distinguishing
fantasy from reality,

00:02:20.748 --> 00:02:22.133
just the sorts of things

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:26.396
which might make people believe 
they've been turned into animals,

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.181
which also suggests that Circe
was no sorceress,

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:34.670
but in fact a chemist who knew how
to use local plants to great effect.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.302
But Jimson weed is only half the story.

00:02:37.302 --> 00:02:39.513
Unlike a lot of material in the Odyssey,

00:02:39.513 --> 00:02:44.232
the text about the herb that Hermes
gives to Odysseus is unusually specific.

00:02:44.232 --> 00:02:46.157
Called moly by the gods,

00:02:46.157 --> 00:02:49.360
it's described as being found
in a forest glen,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.799
black at the root 
and with a flower as white as milk.

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.174
Like the rest of the Circe episode,

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:58.827
moly was dismissed 
as fictional invention for centuries.

00:02:58.827 --> 00:03:03.006
But in 1951, Russian pharmacologist
Mikhail Mashkovsky

00:03:03.006 --> 00:03:05.736
discovered that villagers 
in the Ural Mountains

00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:09.202
used a plant with a milk-white flower
and a black root

00:03:09.202 --> 00:03:12.730
to stave off paralysis 
in children suffering from polio.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.473
The plant, called snowdrop,

00:03:14.473 --> 00:03:17.814
turned out to contain a compound
called galantamine

00:03:17.814 --> 00:03:21.564
that prevented the disruption
of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine,

00:03:21.564 --> 00:03:24.263
making it effective in treating
not only polio

00:03:24.263 --> 00:03:28.077
but other disease, such as Alzheimer's.

00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:30.106
At the 12th World Congress of Neurology,

00:03:30.106 --> 00:03:33.725
Doctors Andreas Plaitakis 
and Roger Duvoisin

00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:38.899
first proposed that snowdrop was, in fact,
the plant Hermes gave to Odysseus.

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.909
Although there is not much direct
evidence that people in Homer's day

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.256
would have known about 
its anti-hallucinatory effects,

00:03:45.256 --> 00:03:48.881
we do have a passage from 4th century
Greek writer Theophrastus

00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:53.602
stating that moly 
is used as an antidote against poisons.

00:03:53.602 --> 00:03:55.396
So, does this all mean

00:03:55.396 --> 00:03:59.409
that Odysseus, Circe, and other characters
in the Odyssey were real?

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.272
Not necessarily.

00:04:01.272 --> 00:04:05.124
But it does suggest that ancient stories
may have more elements of truth to them

00:04:05.124 --> 00:04:07.364
than we previously thought.

00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:10.192
And as we learn more
about the world around us,

00:04:10.192 --> 00:04:12.628
we may uncover some of the same knowledge

00:04:12.628 --> 00:04:15.707
hidden within the myths 
and legends of ages passed.
