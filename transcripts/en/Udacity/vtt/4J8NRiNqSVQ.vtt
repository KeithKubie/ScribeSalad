00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.850
This wonderful app developer
out of the United Arab Emerits,

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.720
the company is called Megabit.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.620
And he creates games, basically.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.000
But he started out
making his first game,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.540
in his first year, he made like $2,000.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.610
And he is living at
home with his parents.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.980
And his parents are like why
are you doing this as a business?

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.760
This is crazy.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.982
I can't believe you're spending all
your time building these apps, right?

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:24.247
You should go back to school,
become an engineer.

00:00:24.247 --> 00:00:26.242
You know, maybe, become a doctor.

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:27.930
You know, whatever it may be.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.890
And he was like no, no, no.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.720
I really love doing this.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.400
So he started doing it more.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.530
And then the second year,
he made probably like $14,000 and

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.140
he was like well, at least,
I'm going up, right?

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.570
And kept building, and
kept moving, chugging along.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.280
And a year later,
he made close to $250,000.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.710
And his parents were like, stay in it.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.035
Do everything you can to stay.

00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:51.270
[LAUGH] Now his brother's
helping him out.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.310
And he is looking to hopefully,
create close to $1 million this year.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.020
So it just shows you monetization,
even though you start very small.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.090
There's no guidebook
to what's successful.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.989
Really understanding your users, and
then trying to build off of that.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.130
So you can grow your business.
