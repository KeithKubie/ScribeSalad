00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.000
 Now, ASAPSCIENCE offers you periodic table elements. 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.260
 There are hydrogen then helium, then lithium, beryllium, 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.100
 Boron and carbon are everywhere, 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.300
 Nitrogen fills the air. 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.860
 With oxygen so you can breathe, 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.480

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.100
 This is a periodic table, inactive inert gases, halogens and alkali react strongly! 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.880
 Every time we see new exterior casings 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.000
 While electrons are added, when moving to the right. 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.160
 The iron is 26. 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.580

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.760
 This is a periodic table, stable inert gases, halogens and alkali react strongly! 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.920
 Each period we will see new outer casings, while the electrons rotate to the right.
