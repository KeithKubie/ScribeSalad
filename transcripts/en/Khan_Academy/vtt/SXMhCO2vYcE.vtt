00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.750
- [Instructor] In other videos
we have already talked about

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.630
the idea of GDP in some depth.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.850
Gross domestic product,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.700
a measure of the aggregate
goods and services

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.760
produced in a country in a year.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.930
But what we're going to
discuss in this video

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.140
is how good a measure GDP is

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.740
and in particular some
of the things that GDP

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.270
does not measure.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.991
So in general what's the
motivation for wanting to know

00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:30.950
the aggregate goods and
services produced by a country?

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.350
Well you could view it as a
sign of economic activity,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.980
so it's economic,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.990
economic activity.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.070
You could view it as the size
or influence of an economy.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.480
Size/influence

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.810
of economy.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.430
And then if you take GDP and you divide

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.180
by the number of people in a country,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.370
you get things like GDP per capita.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.650
GDP per capita,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.600
what you could view
really as GDP per head.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.710
And this you could view as

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.500
well that's an indicator of well-being,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.430
with the idea that well
if there's just more

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.180
goods and services produced per person,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.810
that maybe people in
that country are going

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.300
to be better off.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.310
But as we already touched on,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.550
what is it not measuring?

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.050
Well one thing that GDP does not measure

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.600
is non-marketed goods.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.620
What do I mean by non-marketed goods?

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.760
So let's say that I have
to go to the airport,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.200
so this is the airport
here, my best drawing.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.530
That's a terminal, there's a plane.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.560
That's the point of this
isn't to draw an airport,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.970
but you get the idea, that's an airport.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.240
And I need to go from
my house to the airport.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.110
If I call up a taxi or an Uber

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.970
or Lyft or something like that

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.200
and I take it to the airport,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.360
so they drive me to that airport,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.770
that fare that they charge me,

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.810
that will be included in GDP.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.640
On the other hand if I were to get my wife

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.400
to drive me to the airport,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.100
all of a sudden that would
not be counted in GDP,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.390
even though the exact same
service has been performed.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.870
Someone took me in their car from my house

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.360
to the airport.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.210
And that's because my
wife or your roommate

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.670
or your best friend giving you a ride

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.550
is a non-marketed service.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.420
They're not trying to sell that service.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.540
They're just doing that to you as a favor.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.490
But it was a service provided to you,

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.200
but it would not be captured in GDP.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.550
One that is often talked
about is child care.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.940
If, that's my best drawing
of a child really fast,

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.130
if you hire a babysitter
or if you hire a nanny

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.720
to take care of your child,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.640
that should be included in GDP.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.900
Although if you yourself
take care of your child,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.410
that will not be included in GDP

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.243
because once again,

00:02:55.243 --> 00:02:57.350
you taking care of your child would be

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.070
a non-marketed service.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.090
Now the other thing that
GDP does not include

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.460
are illegal activity or you could even

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.950
say under the table activity,
some of which is not illegal.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.410
For example if someone were
to pay their babysitter,

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.340
and if it doesn't get
registered in taxes someplace,

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.750
well even that will not be
reflected in the GDP number.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.560
It's not an illegal activity,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.973
but it should've officially
been registered with the IRS

00:03:23.973 --> 00:03:26.170
and then it would've been counted as GDP,

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.900
but in this case, it wouldn't have.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.400
And also of course you have black markets,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.029
illegal activity that for sure would not

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:35.720
be included in GDP.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.100
If someone were to illegally sell you

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.710
fireworks, let's say they're
banned in your state,

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.250
and of course they're not gonna report it

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.083
to the government.

00:03:44.083 --> 00:03:46.940
Well of course that good and/or service

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.760
is not going to be reflected in GDP.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.430
But you might say okay that's all right,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.250
you're gonna miss some things,

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.760
but directionally if GDP is growing,

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.950
especially if GDP per capita is growing,

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.550
surely that is a good thing.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.070
And in general you're probably right.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.600
It probably is a good thing,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.720
but there's also things
that GDP is not capturing.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.300
It is not capturing even
if you were able to measure

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.680
non-marketed goods and services

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.660
or under the table or illegal activity,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.690
it doesn't capture things like

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.150
let's say pollution.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.250
You could have a country whose GDP

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.870
is growing very very fast,

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.040
but in the process,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.320
the country gets very very polluted.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.520
Maybe that makes the
quality of life go down

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.750
in certain areas.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.670
Health is another issue.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.900
In general countries with
a high GDP per capita

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.370
usually do have good health care,

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.140
mainly because they have more
resources for health care.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.410
But you wanna look at that.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.720
How is the health trending in a country?

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.430
And then you could even
think about stuff like stress

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.890
or a feeling of community or support.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.840
These are all things that would affect

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.740
any human being's well-being,

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.300
but they are not of
course captured in GDP.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.500
Now to appreciate the different ways

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.780
of ranking countries in an
attempt to get at well-being,

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.790
you could first of all
look at GDP rankings.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.230
So here are rankings by
the World Bank for 2016.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.540
You can see the United States is on top

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.010
with 18.6 almost trillion dollars of GDP

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.430
as measured by the World Bank,

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.180
and you see the ranking.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.320
Now if you wanted to go by per capita,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.210
because you say hey this doesn't tell you

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.490
how many people are there.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.390
What matters is how much
productivity divided

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.610
by the number of people if
you really wanna measure

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.380
per person well-being.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.530
Well then you might look
at something like this,

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.170
GDP per capita.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.100
And notice here, the United
States is still quite high,

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.370
but it's nowhere near
as high as Luxembourg.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.680
The reason why Luxembourg
didn't show up on the other list

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.890
is it is a very very small country.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.180
It's population is very small compared

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.060
to the United States.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.890
Same thing for Switzerland or for Macau.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.080
Now another thing to appreciate is,

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.220
this GDP per capita just
takes the nominal GDP

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.940
and divides it by the
number of people there are

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.030
in a country.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.560
But it does not measure or indicate things

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.060
like wealth inequality.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.610
It's not that every person in Luxembourg

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.150
gets exactly $103,000 worth
of goods and services.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.670
Depending on the country,

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.090
there might be more of a middle class

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.070
or less of a middle class.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.060
There might be more wealth inequality

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.510
or less wealth inequality,

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.990
and once again that is
not captured by GDP.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.210
Also even the GDP per capita

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.690
doesn't really tell you
how much you can buy

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.660
with that per capita GDP.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.010
And so that's why people
look at things like

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.890
purchasing power parity.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.540
This is a sense of per capita GDP,

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.420
but adjusted for how much you could buy

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.150
with those resources that
are measured in U.S. dollars.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.420
So now all of a sudden, Qatar at the top.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.930
Qatar was pretty high,

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.880
but I guess you can buy
more and get more goods

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.430
and services with that
nominal GDP per capita

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.360
as measured in U.S. dollars in Qatar

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.680
than you could say in the United States.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.540
So I will leave you there.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.860
There's no such thing as an
absolutely perfect measure

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.440
of economic activity,
much less well-being,

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.970
but GDP is the best measure that we have,

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.320
although I encourage
you to think of others.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.905
For example, the UN has
tried to measure happiness.

00:07:23.905 --> 00:07:26.530
They have this ranking of happiness.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.000
They have an annual
World Happiness Report.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.510
And I'm not gonna go
into all of the details,

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.120
but beyond GDP,

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.130
it also considers things like health

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.600
or other measures of well-being.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.850
And as you can see,

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.110
the countries at the top here tend to have

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.880
fairly high GDPs,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.290
but this ranking is not
the same as the ranking

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.310
that we saw on the GDP per capita

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.970
with the purchase power parity.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.100
And so these are all very
interesting things to think about.
