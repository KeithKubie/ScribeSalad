00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.660
- [Instructor] The function F is defined

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.290
over the real numbers.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.100
This table gives select values of F.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.122
We have our table here.

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:11.640
For these X values, it gives
the corresponding F of X.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.400
What is a reasonable estimate
for the limit of F of X

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.060
as X approaches one from the left?

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.440
So pause this video

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.930
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.900
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.020
So the first thing that is
really important to realize

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.810
is when you see this X approaches one

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.560
and you see this little
negative superscript here,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.320
this does not mean
approaching negative one,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.810
so this does not mean negative one.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.410
Sometimes your brain just sees a one

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.740
and that little negative sign there,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.410
and you're like oh,
this must be a weird way

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.243
of writing negative one,

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:45.610
or you don't even think about it,

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.810
but it's not saying that.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.860
It's saying, this is saying,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.510
let me put a little arrow here,

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.700
this is the limit of F of X

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.700
as X approaches one from the left,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.420
from the left.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.270
So from the left, how do we know that?

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.580
Well that's what that
little negative tells us.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.510
It tells us we're approaching one

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.060
from values less than one.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.330
If we were approaching one from the right,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.080
from values greater than one,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.930
that would be a positive
sign right over there.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.270
So let's think about it.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.950
We want the limit as X
approaches one from the left,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.700
and lucky for us on this table,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.540
we have some values of X
approaching one from the left.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.790
0.9, which is already pretty close to one,

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.750
then we get even closer
to one from the left.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.210
Notice, these are all less than one,

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.000
but they're getting
closer and closer to one.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.990
And so what we really wanna look at

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.356
is what does F of X approach

00:01:44.356 --> 00:01:49.356
as X is getting closer and closer to one,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.020
from the left, from the left.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.124
And a key realization here is,

00:01:56.124 --> 00:01:58.560
if we're thinking about general limits,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.150
not just from one direction,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.090
then we might wanna look at

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.300
from the left and from the right,

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.330
but they're asking us only from the left,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.550
so we should only be
looking at these values

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.500
right over here.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.020
In fact, we shouldn't even
let the value of F of X

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.830
at X equal one confuse us.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.520
Sometimes and oftentimes,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.340
the limit is approaching a different value

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.780
than the value of the
function at that point.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.000
So let's look at this.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.822
At 0.9, F of X is 2.5.

00:02:25.822 --> 00:02:28.570
When we get even closer
to one from the left,

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.132
we go to 2.1.

00:02:30.132 --> 00:02:32.800
When we get even closer
to one from the left,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.360
we're getting even closer to two.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.990
So a reasonable estimate for
the limit as X approaches one

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.862
from the left of F of X,

00:02:40.862 --> 00:02:44.940
it looks like F of X right over here

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.060
is approaching two.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.200
We don't know for sure,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.660
that's why they're saying,
what is a reasonable estimate.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.830
It might be approaching 2.01

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.520
or it might be approaching 1.999.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.930
On Khan Academy these will often be

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.010
multiple choice questions,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.890
so you have to pick the
most reasonable one,

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.230
it would not be fair if they
gave a 1.999 as a choice

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.660
and 2.01,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.510
but if you were saying,

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.540
hey, maybe this was
approaching a whole number,

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.260
then two could be a reasonable
estimate right over here.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.450
Although it doesn't have to be two,

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.530
it could be 2.01258,

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.550
it might be what it is
actually approaching.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.010
So let's try another example here.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.610
Here it does look like
there's a reasonable estimate

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.310
for the limit as we approach
this value from the left.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.120
So now, it says the function F

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.210
is defined over the real numbers.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.240
This table gives select values of F,

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.920
similar to the last question.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.050
What is a reasonable
estimate for the limit

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.600
as X approaches negative
two from the left?

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.630
So this is confusing.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.300
You see these two negative signs.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.690
This first negative sign tells us

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.000
we're approaching negative two.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.080
We wanna say, what happens
we're approaching negative two,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.630
and we're gonna approach
once again from the left.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.870
So lucky for us, they have values of X

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.170
that are approaching
negative two from the left,

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.770
so this is X approaches
negative two from the left,

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.820
so that is happening right over here.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.950
So that's these values.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.050
So notice, this is negative 2.05,

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.890
then we get even closer, negative 2.01,

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.450
then we get even closer, negative 2.002,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.670
and these are from the left

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.190
because these are values
less than negative two,

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.700
but they're getting closer
and closer to negative two.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.900
And so let's see,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.250
when we're a little bit
further, F of X is negative 20,

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.890
we get a little bit
closer, it's negative 100,

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.040
we get even a little bit
closer, it goes to negative 500.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.540
So it would be reasonable,
and we don't know for sure,

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.480
this is just giving us a few sample points

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.650
for this function,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.273
but if we follow this trend,

00:04:40.273 --> 00:04:44.220
as we get closer and
closer to negative two,

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.350
without getting there,

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.380
it looks like this is getting unbounded.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.020
It looks like it's becoming
infinitely negative.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.370
And so technically, it looks like this is,

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.033
I would write this is unbounded,

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.108
and so if this was a
multiple choice question,

00:04:59.108 --> 00:05:01.380
technically you would say the limit

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.193
as X approaches negative two
from the left does not exist,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.590
does not exist.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.020
If someone asked the other question,

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.570
if they said, what is the limit

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.190
as X approaches negative two

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.093
from the right of F of X,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.880
well then you would say,

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.940
alright, well here are values
approaching negative two

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.250
from the right,

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.340
so this is X approaching
negative two from the right,

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.390
right over here.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.450
And remember, when you're
looking at a limit,

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.880
sometimes it might be distracting

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.810
to look at the actual value
of the function at that point,

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.100
so we wanna think about what is the value

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.370
of the function approaching,

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.380
as your X is approaching that value,

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.330
as X is approaching, in
this case, negative two,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.430
from the right.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.820
So as we're getting closer and closer

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.510
to negative two from values
larger than negative two,

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.590
it looks like F of X is
getting closer and closer

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.700
to negative four,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.740
which is F of negative two,

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.110
but that actually seems
like a reasonable estimate.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.550
Once again, we don't
know absolutely for sure,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.290
just by sampling some points,

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.280
but this would be a reasonable estimate.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.470
And in general, if you are
approaching different values

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.910
from the left than from the right,

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.610
then you would say, a that point,

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.010
the limit of your function does not exist,

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.910
and we have seen that in other videos.
