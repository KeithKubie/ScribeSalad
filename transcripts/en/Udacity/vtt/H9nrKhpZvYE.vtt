00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.689
For this first one, translations represent movements. Just like vectors can be

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:08.071
summed together to make a single movement vector, translations can be multiplied

00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:11.668
together to get a single translation. The order that we add the vectors doesn't

00:00:11.668 --> 00:00:15.250
matter. Likewise, translation order among translations doesn't matter. So the

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.660
answer is yes. Rotation order certainly does matter. Reversing the order will

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.529
normally change the effect. So this second question's answer is no. For scaling,

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.980
each access scale is independent of the others. If you stretch an object along

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.955
the y-axis, its x and z coordinates do not change. Because each is independent,

00:00:31.955 --> 00:00:35.376
there is no danger of the scales interacting with each other. Each axes' scale

00:00:35.376 --> 00:00:39.831
factors can simply be multiplied together. Multiplication is commutative, so the

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:44.280
scales can be done in any order. Yes. For this last question, say you rotate

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.484
around the y-axis and translate along the same axis. The rotations can be done

00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:52.731
in any order, since each is just an angle change around the y-axis. The rotation

00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:56.726
affects the x and z coordinates of any point transformed. Translation affects

00:00:56.726 --> 00:01:00.298
only the y coordinates. Since these are independent values, rotations and

00:01:00.298 --> 00:01:04.422
translations along the axis can be evaluated in any order. So the answer here is

00:01:04.422 --> 00:01:04.733
yes.
