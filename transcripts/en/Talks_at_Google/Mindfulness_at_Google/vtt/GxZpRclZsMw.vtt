00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:02.980
MARC LESSER: Hello.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:03.706
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:00:03.706 --> 00:00:04.497
MARC LESSER: Hello.

00:00:04.497 --> 00:00:06.780
Hello.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.000
Why don't we start with
two minutes of sitting, OK?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.340
If you're eating,
don't worry about it.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.630
You can mindfully eat.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.780
So I want to suggest putting
things away and finding a way

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.689
to sit where you can
be alert and relaxed.

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.730
Literally we're going to
do this for two minutes.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.063
I'm going to time it.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:55.180
Simply noticing what it's like
sitting here in this chair,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.840
noticing the transition
from whatever activity

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.360
you were doing to stopping,
to arriving, to being here.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.880
Again, simply
noticing sensations

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:18.760
of butt on chair, feet on
floor, noticing your shoulders,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:28.090
noticing that you are
breathing, holding up your chin,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.160
maybe relaxing, relaxing
the muscles in your face,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.370
relaxing the jaw,
just seeing what's

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.070
possible to just
fully arrive here now.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:55.030
Checking in with your body,
checking in with your breath,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.540
noticing your thoughts, whether
your thoughts are coming

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.610
quickly or your mind is calm,
just noticing and seeing

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:12.350
if you can come back to
the breath, the body,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.270
perhaps even checking
in with your own heart,

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.040
what is your deepest
feelings, mood, aspiration,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.200
however you define heart.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.987
Great, and let's gently
bring our attention

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.820
being back here with
each other in the room.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.660
Well, I want to
start with a poem.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.440
"When your eyes are tired,
the world is tired also.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.980
When your vision has gone, no
part of the world can find you.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.730
When your vision is gone, no
part of the world can find you.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.680
Time to go into
the darkness where

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.550
the night has eyes
to recognize its own.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.810
There, you can be sure
you are not beyond love.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.390
There in the night,
in the darkness,

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.840
you can be sure you
are not beyond love.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.490
The dark will be
your womb tonight.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.770
The night will
give you a horizon

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.330
further than you can see.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:43.260
You must learn one thing-- the
world was made to be free in.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.310
You must learn one thing-- the
world was made to be free in."

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.440
This is part of a
poem by David Whyte.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.730
And I particularly
love this line.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.060
And his description of when
he was writing this poem

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.300
was that he was by himself in
a cabin, dark, rainy night,

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.950
and he wrote the line "You
must learn one thing,"

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.370
and didn't know what was
going to happen next.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.440
And he could feel the hairs
on the back of his neck,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.920
and what appeared
were the words,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.720
"the world was made
to be free in."

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.540
And I realize part of why I
love this poem and this line

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.970
so much is that I think
feel like this has really

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.560
been the burning question
for much of my life,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.020
is what does it mean to be free?

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.420
What does it really
mean to be free?

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.870
What stops us from being free?

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.110
And the subject here is
poetry and pragmatism as a way

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.710
into understanding and
practicing mindfulness.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.970
And in a way to me,
this word "mindfulness"

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.290
really means the
practice of freedom.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.960
It's the practice of
how we can be free.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.640
And there's so many very
practical day-to-day ways

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.620
in which we're not free.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.640
Several years ago I was
driving down to Google

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.401
to teach a Search
Inside Yourself Class.

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:21.320
Actually, this was one I
was co-teaching with Meng.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.050
And as I was driving down
from my home in the North Bay

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.380
down to Mountain
View, I could feel

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.490
myself getting more
and more anxious.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.180
And I started
remembering that I was

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.070
going to be rated by every
person in the classroom, one

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.270
to five, on how
well I interacted,

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.340
how knowledgeable I was.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.980
And the more I thought
about that, the more anxious

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.310
I was getting.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.720
And while I was driving
down, I slipped in a lecture

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.720
by David Whyte.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.170
And I was listening lecture.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.280
I felt myself becoming
freer and freer.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.670
And I thought, screw
those Google people.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.640
I don't care.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.130
I don't care how they rate me.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.990
I'm just going to completely
show up and be there as fully

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.940
and with as much love and
freedom as I possibly can.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.190
And I got out of my
car, and Meng and I

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.730
started teaching this class.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.790
And during the break an hour
into it, Meng turned to me

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.450
and said, what happened to you?

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.520
He said, you're
usually pretty good,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.570
but you were really good today.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.290
And I told him that story.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.300
And I felt like I was able
to, in that moment, just

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.200
show up and be free.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.150
So there's something very
freeing about poetry.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.950
And to me, although I'm
reading some poetry,

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:55.660
there's also something very
inspirational, aspirational

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.810
about poetry.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:03.110
And in a way, our lives are all
inspirational, aspirational,

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.400
mysterious.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.130
We don't really know what it
means to be a human being.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.160
We don't really know
what consciousness is.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:17.610
And in terms of leadership,
I think of a wonderful quote

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:23.560
by the author of "The Little
Prince" in which he says,

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:29.310
if you want to build a
ship, don't teach people

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.580
to gather wood and to use
tools and order them about.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:40.650
Instead, teach them to yearn
for the vastness of the sea.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.520
Teach people to yearn for
the vastness of the sea.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.130
And to me, this is
how I would describe

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:52.810
a core part of leadership
and using poetry and using

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:53.800
mindfulness.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.470
So mindfulness is this wide,
wide, poetic, beautiful sense

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.620
of how we can live in the world.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.500
But at the same time,
what about the pragmatic?

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.550
What about the world of
stuff, the world of buildings,

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:18.190
the world of data and research,
the world of org charts?

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.680
And I would say that this,
too, is mindfulness practice

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.270
and that it's also a
path toward freedom

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.860
and that we don't need to
choose between the poetic

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.980
and the pragmatic.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.929
And it's not that we want
to find some middle ground.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:42.179
In fact, I think part of what
we want to do, I believe,

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:47.840
as mindfulness practitioners,
is to really embrace the poetry,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.220
to embrace the mystery, the
inspirational, the feelings.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.670
What is it that brings us alive?

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.550
What is it that most
brings you alive?

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:03.842
In fact, in that poem that I
read, the very last lines are,

00:09:03.842 --> 00:09:07.290
"anything that does
not bring you alive

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.030
is too small for you."

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:13.240
Anything that does not bring
you alive is too small for you.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.340
So I think this is a huge part
of stepping into mindfulness

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.260
practice is noticing, paying
attention to feelings,

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.760
paying attention to
what brings you alive.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:29.940
And at the same time, we have to
take care of our communication,

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.660
being pragmatically clear.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:37.960
We have to take care of things
like money, like making sure

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:45.310
that we understand the practical
parts of being a human being.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.300
And I want to mention, want
to bring in the organization

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.230
that I'm now the CEO
of, which is silly.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.950
It's a silly organization.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.570
And its SIYLI, Search Inside
Yourself Leadership Institute.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.260
And the mission
and vision of SIYLI

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:07.520
is that all leaders in the world
are wise and compassionate.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.074
You just got it.

00:10:09.074 --> 00:10:10.010
[LAUGHS_]

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:17.050
All leaders in the world
are wise and compassionate,

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:21.740
thus creating the
conditions for world peace.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.930
Very poetic, right?

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.090
All leaders in the world
are wise and compassionate,

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.810
thus creating the
conditions for world peace--

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:34.720
so poetic, aspirational,
kind of impossible,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.830
sounds like, how could this be?

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.290
But there's a pragmatic
element to it.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.810
We're really looking
at, what does

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.680
it mean to train wise and
compassionate leaders?

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.390
How will we know
if we succeeded?

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:54.580
What does it mean to help create
the conditions for world peace?

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.090
How can we actually
make a difference

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:06.250
in things like violence
and bias and inequality?

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.650
Can we actually be part
of measuring and helping

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.730
to make a difference
in solving some

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.290
of these large, large issues?

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.380
But also, I think
the starting point

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.900
is, how can we make
ourselves more peaceful?

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.230
How can we become more peaceful?

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:27.580
How can we bring peace
to our daily lives,

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.030
whether it's at Google
or the people we interact

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.420
with in the grocery
store or outside?

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.320
In all our
relationships, how can we

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.630
make ourselves more peaceful?

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.470
And again, there's
very much a poetic part

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:45.190
of that as well as
a practical part.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.760
The poetic part is the
aspiration, the aspiration

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:54.770
to be more aware, to
see our blind spots,

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:59.340
to bring more compassion into
the world, to help others.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.930
Again, to me in a
way these are where

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:07.320
the poetic and the practical
seem to come together.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.465
And again, this is the sense
of mindfulness practice.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.360
In a way there's a
balance piece to it,

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.350
but there's also a way in which
to be fully inspirational,

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.580
mysterious, poetic.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:29.550
So I want to encourage
everyone to bring more poetry

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:33.090
into your life, even if it's
just listening to poetry,

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:36.540
but looking at what is
it that brings you alive.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.920
What is it that fully
brings you alive?

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:45.410
I had a teacher of mine
when I was a young Zen

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.320
student living at
Green Gulch Farm.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.710
A teacher named
Harry Roberts used

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:54.980
to say that being a human
being is very simple.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:59.676
We just need to ask and
answer three questions.

00:12:59.676 --> 00:13:02.050
Very simple being a human
being-- three questions we just

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.430
need to ask and answer.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.590
What do you want?

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.860
What you have to do to get it?

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.360
And can you pay the price?

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.360
And Harry would then,
after saying this,

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.330
let out this huge
belly laugh, saying,

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:21.160
real simple, very few people
ask the first question,

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.770
what do you want?

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.050
What do you want?

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:28.610
And there's something
both extremely poetic,

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:33.420
inspirational, mysterious about
just asking that question,

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.080
like how do you
know what you want?

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.520
It's a dangerous question.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.120
What if you really
each day ask yourself,

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.220
what's really important to me?

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.040
What's really in my heart?

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:51.270
And then the "What you
have to do to get it?"

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.140
is kind of practical.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.790
Then it's like,
OK, what do you do?

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.420
What do I actually do?

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.060
Like maybe I have
to go to law school.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.660
Maybe I have to learn a
different kind of mathematics

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.080
or coding or something
in order to be

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.860
able to fulfill whatever
that question is.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:15.110
Maybe I need to learn to
dance or learn a language.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:17.070
Maybe I need to take a risk.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.220
And then also the third
part, can I pay the price,

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.220
is also very, very practical.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:28.300
So to me, this image is
this, what do you want?--

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:34.610
the balance of being both
very poetic and very practical

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.040
at the same time.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:43.710
So there's something
really powerfully

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:50.200
difficult and challenging
about being in this human form.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.970
One of the things that
I'm fond of saying

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.920
is that being a human
being is a tough gig.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.430
Being a human being
is a tough gig.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:05.660
And here we are,
we're born, there's

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:12.345
all kinds of difficulties that
most of us have in growing up.

00:15:12.345 --> 00:15:16.900
I think part of what
brought me to this question

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.130
about what does
it mean to be free

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:25.590
was for me growing up with
a manic depressive father

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:31.120
and in a family where things
like feelings and difficulties

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.240
and even mental illness were
all swept under the rug,

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.590
that it wasn't something that
anyone ever talked about.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:39.730
Yet I could feel it.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.670
I could feel the trauma of that.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.430
I could feel in my body the
lack of freedom of that.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:49.480
And I notice these
days when I walk

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.220
into a room, which, it's
very often these days I walk

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.880
into room of very
successful business people

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:02.220
who on the surface I
really have it together.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:07.140
I did a workshop not too
long ago with 150 salespeople

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.850
from a large tech
company who flew

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.200
in from all around the
world for a Search Inside

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.880
Yourself workshop.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:18.000
And this was a
jacket-and-tie culture.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.150
And I noticed little
by little by little

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.454
as we were having
conversations--

00:16:22.454 --> 00:16:23.870
they were talking
with each other,

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:27.180
we were practicing mindfulness,
practicing meditation--

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.380
they started to all kind
of follow apart a bit.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.050
And you kind of
see that there was

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:39.160
this humanness underneath the
gloss of having it together.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.970
And one of the
assumptions that I make

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.910
and one of the
assumptions that I think

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.650
is a really important
assumption in mindfulness

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:51.090
and in Search Inside Yourself,
is that the more we can bring

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.150
in this humanness,
the more we can bring

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:59.830
in the poetry combined
with the pragmatic,

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.010
the more we'll actually
be able to get done,

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.904
as leaders and as people
and organizations.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.500
For many, many
years, I think it was

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.910
thought that we needed
to take the humanness out

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.550
of organizations.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.030
There was an expression
about leaving your soul

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.520
in the parking lot.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.510
And these days, I think part of
why organizations like Google

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:28.870
and many others all
around the world

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:32.040
are embracing
mindfulness practice

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:37.050
is because there's now more
agreement and this big aha,

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:42.380
that actually we're no longer
working on assembly lines.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.000
We're now working
in places where

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.510
people need to communicate with
each other, where everything

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.895
is done in teams.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.620
So I want to bring in the how.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.950
So I feel like I'm raising
a variety of questions

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:07.990
around the importance of
poetry, the importance of asking

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.370
yourself the question, what
does it mean to be free?

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.000
What is freedom?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.630
And what's the relationship
between mindfulness practice

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:18.880
and freedom?

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.435
Well, in one way,
mindfulness practice

00:18:21.435 --> 00:18:23.750
is the practice of freedom.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.550
It's the practice
of being completely

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:30.460
present for whatever is.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:35.240
So like my story of
driving down to Google,

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.780
I wasn't pushing
aside my anxiety.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:44.310
I could really feel my anxiety,
but I could see that, in a way,

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.180
those feelings were getting
in the way of me just

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.880
being present, of
just showing up.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.800
So how can we just show up?

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.280
How can we just be
with difficult feelings

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.070
and joyful feelings?

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.170
How can we totally
embrace and be

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:07.750
free in our own bodies and our
own skin with our own feelings?

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:13.050
And these seven principles,
some people in this room

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:16.320
it's going to be familiar to.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.940
One of the programs that
we have here at Google

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.220
is called the Train
the Trainer program,

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.550
in which we're working
with small groups of people

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:29.170
who are training to teach the
Search Inside Yourself program.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.910
And at one of those
early sessions,

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:36.440
we had a full day with these
Train the Trainer Google

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:41.830
employees to teach them
how to teach meditation,

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.080
how to become a
mindfulness teacher,

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:46.210
how to be a meditation teacher.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:49.910
And we brought in a man
named Norman Fisher, who

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:53.660
is a leading Zen teacher
and who was at this meeting.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:59.620
And he was asked to speak
about how people could learn

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.870
to become mindfulness
and meditation teachers.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.760
Actually, I still remember
it was a very funny scene.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.090
We were sitting at a table,
and on one side of me was Meng,

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.340
and then the other
side of me was Norman.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:16.440
And I had the agenda
in front of me.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.050
And I pushed it
over to Norman, who

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.030
I think didn't
realize he was going

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.050
to be asked to give a talk.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.540
And I kind of sort
of nudged Norman

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.430
and showed him that
his talk was coming up.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.260
And he got out a
napkin an a pen and he

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.490
started making some notes.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:35.540
And I was kind of
watching this happen.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.660
And Norman's little
scribble actually

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:43.000
turned into what I'm calling
the seven principles.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.010
And so these were initially
the seven principles

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.120
for how to become a
meditation teacher.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.160
But as Norman was
describing these

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:55.900
and afterwards, I
thought, actually, this

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.130
is how I want to live my life.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.690
And this is how I want us all
in the Search Inside Yourself

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.470
Leadership Institute
to work together.

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:11.960
And we've kind of customized,
revised Norman's original seven

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:16.020
principles and turn them
into how to live your life.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:23.080
So to me, these principles
are the how to transcend

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.680
and to totally, fully
embrace and integrate

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.230
the poetry and pragmatism
of everyday life, the poetry

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:32.590
and pragmatism of
being a human being.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:36.110
And in a way, to get
a sense of the depth

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:39.620
and breadth of this
word "mindfulness."

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.000
I think when I see
mindfulness in the press

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.180
and when people talk
about it, in a way it's

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:47.570
becoming smaller and smaller.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:48.685
And I want to open it up.

00:21:48.685 --> 00:21:51.260
I want to present that
actually mindfulness

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:56.200
is a lifetime endless
practice filled

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.700
with poetry, and at
the same time also

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:03.710
a very pragmatic
practice, right?

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:08.850
Count your breath and let
yourself be expensive.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:14.460
And in a way, when I think of
poetry and pragmatism, in a way

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:19.660
it's a methodology, a way, a
path of uncrusting your heart,

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.380
opening your heart,
opening your mind,

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:27.410
allowing yourself
to be fully alive.

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:34.430
So, seven principles-- The first
principle is love the work.

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:36.080
Love the work.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.630
So what is the work?

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:42.830
The work is the work
of being present,

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:47.640
the work of opening
your own awareness

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.970
and helping other people.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.140
Maybe in a way it's that simple.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:56.220
In some way, what if our main
focus, our main intention

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:00.490
in our daily life here at
work or wherever we are,

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:05.210
is becoming more aware, opening
up to seeing our blind spots,

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.750
seeing what stops
us from being free,

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:12.500
trying to become more present,
more feeling, bringing

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.380
our own awareness to
what we're feeling,

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:20.230
and looking for
opportunities to help others?

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:24.220
So in the context of becoming
a mindfulness and meditation

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:29.660
teacher, the work in a way is
to love meditation practice

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.910
and to love the work of bringing
the lessons from meditation

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.070
practice into one's daily life.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:43.240
So this is the work, love the
work of being a human being.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.500
Second is do the
work, to actually

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:52.460
have a sitting practice, have a
mindfulness practice, to spend

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:57.460
time becoming more aware
of your own feelings,

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:01.980
your own sensations,
tuning in to others.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:08.420
This is a sense of what it
means to actually do the work.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.090
The third principle of
these seven principles

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:16.050
is don't become an expert.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:17.925
Now of course, we all
want to become experts.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:24.510
And you can become an expert
in a particular field.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:29.140
But when it comes to the
field of mindfulness,

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:33.650
when it comes to the field
of poetry and pragmatism,

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:40.980
the idea is to continually
uncrust our minds

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:47.050
and uncrust our hearts, to be
able to see that we're never

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:50.502
going to become
experts in mindfulness.

00:24:50.502 --> 00:24:52.210
And in a way, one of
the beautiful things

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:55.640
about mindfulness,
in a way it's moving

00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:00.110
from a sense of attainment
to non-attainment,

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:04.370
from a sense of grasping
to continually letting

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:06.390
go-- letting go.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:14.530
There's an expression,
opening the hand of thought--

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.390
so in our minds we
want to become experts,

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.130
we want to know,
we want to succeed.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:24.500
And those are all very
natural human desires.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.080
But how can we let it go?

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:32.150
There's a saying that comes from
the Zen world-- in the expert's

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:37.090
mind, there are very
few possibilities.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:40.540
In the beginner's
mind, there are many.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:44.230
Beginner's mind-- many,
many possibilities.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.220
In the expert's, there are few.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:51.060
So again, just noticing,
noticing our own desire

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:57.020
to become an expert and looking
to see how we can let it go.

00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:02.680
The fourth principle is
to let your own pain in,

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.020
to feel your own pain.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.640
And I would add to that
to feel your own joy,

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.680
to feel your feelings, to
feel your feelings completely.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:18.190
There's tremendous wisdom
in our emotional life.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.340
There's a beautiful
little video that we

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.460
show during the
Search Inside Yourself

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.520
program of Daniel Goleman
looking at the brain

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.270
science of our emotional
life, and in which

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:34.680
he uses the words "the
wisdom of the emotions

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.150
is not just a pretty
phrase," that there's

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:41.250
some real, wonderful,
amazing wisdom

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.780
in our own emotional lives.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.310
And the fifth of
these seven principles

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.320
is to feel the pain
of others, right?

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:58.240
So if you want-- whether it's
becoming a meditation teacher

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:04.690
or becoming a leader or someone
who's working effectively

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:08.400
on a team, it's tuning
into the feelings of others

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:13.440
and noticing that
everyone brings

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:19.020
a certain pain, a certain
difficulty, a certain anxiety.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:23.440
It's part of being a human being
and just being able to tune

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:23.940
into that.

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:32.390
The sixth principle is to depend
on others-- depend on others.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:38.830
Everything we do in our
lives, we don't even see it,

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:42.290
because it's so-- a
little bit like fish

00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:45.650
not seeing the water
that they're swimming in.

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:49.440
To me, depending on others
is like that, that whether it

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.070
comes to this room
or the wonderful food

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:56.260
that we just ate over in the
cafe, even the clean air,

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.650
to be able to have
clean air, requires

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:01.310
that others help to
keep the air clean.

00:28:05.576 --> 00:28:08.160
I'm going to tell little story
about depending on others,

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:14.530
which was when I once co-taught
a one-day workshop, a Search

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:17.560
Inside Yourself workshop
here at Google in which I was

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:21.230
co-teaching with a
Google employee, who

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.780
was teaching for the first time.

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:28.790
And we were about to walk
out onto the stage like this,

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:34.160
and there were maybe 50 or
60 executives in the room.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.790
And as we were about to walk
out, she turns to me and says,

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.660
I think I'm going to
either vomit or faint.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:47.090
I don't know what I'm
doing up here teaching

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:49.220
mindfulness and
emotional intelligence.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.030
I feel like a fraud.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.130
I'm really, really
frightened, and I

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:56.950
don't think I can go out there.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:02.630
And I said, well,
I get nervous, too.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:06.510
And I'm nervous about
going out there.

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:11.910
But let's depend on
each other out there.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:15.560
I said, what if my job
when we go out there

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.630
is to make you look
good, and your job

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:21.610
is to make me look good?

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:23.846
And I said, and you
have a much tougher job.

00:29:23.846 --> 00:29:24.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.860
But if you forget what
you're going to say,

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.750
if you get nervous, if you
drop it, I'll be right there.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:32.790
I'll be right there.

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.830
And she gulped.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:39.600
And we went out, and she
went out, started talking,

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.950
and I could see she was
just completely relaxed.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:45.920
And we gave each
other a little hidden

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.450
thumbs up as we
made eye contact.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.940
And to me, it was
just a beautiful way

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.470
that-- it actually
calmed me down,

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:57.820
her being so transparent
and willing to share

00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:59.110
her nervousness.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:03.930
And it was a way to really
to make it explicit,

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:06.430
the way that we were
depending on others.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:08.490
And I think, again,
I would encourage

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:13.890
you to allow yourself to see
how you depend on others.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:21.180
I recently not too long ago
had hip replacement surgery.

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.100
I had one of my hips replaced.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:30.930
And one of the amazing things
about it was for a week or so,

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:35.820
not being able to get dressed by
myself or get in and out of bed

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:41.915
and feeling the
vulnerability and beauty

00:30:41.915 --> 00:30:44.840
of just depending
on someone else.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.870
And I'm not sure exactly
why-- I think it was partly

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:50.480
because of that and partly
because of the surgery,

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.590
but I found myself
falling apart quite a bit.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:59.010
I would hear a song
and just start to cry.

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:05.050
Or I'd hear a line from a movie,
and I would just be weeping.

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:08.610
And it just felt
actually so wonderful.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:11.020
In fact, I find myself
a little grasping,

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:14.250
because I want to be
like that all the time.

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:20.870
And there's something very, very
enlivening about falling apart,

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:23.610
depending on others
to pick you up.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.500
People will pick-- it's amazing.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:29.120
So often we don't
want to fall apart.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.670
We don't want to
depend on others.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.390
A lot of us don't even
like to ask for anything

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:35.300
or make a request.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.800
So there's something
very beautiful,

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.520
something very powerful
about depending on others.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.960
And the last practice
is keep making

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:52.320
it simpler-- really hard
one, a really hard one.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.510
Keep making it simpler.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:01.060
Things seem to get so
complicated, very, very,

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.370
very easily without
us even being

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:07.974
aware of how
complicated it can be.

00:32:07.974 --> 00:32:09.140
But what about the practice?

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.580
And this is what I love
about mindfulness practice,

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.150
mindfulness meditation
practice, is

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:18.740
what could be
simpler than bringing

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:22.500
your attention to your breath,
noticing that you're breathing?

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.850
So when things get
very complicated,

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:28.660
even during a very
busy, complex day,

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:32.440
you can always
actually just stop

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.200
and pause and bring your
attention to your breath,

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.740
to your body.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:39.600
Ask yourself, what am I feeling?

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:45.190
And it actually could take about
5 or 10 seconds to do that.

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:49.220
And it can actually
be a big time saver.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.040
It doesn't take any extra time.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.350
That time is going to happen.

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:59.270
You could be anxious and frantic
and not do that, and then it

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:02.430
often-- the things that
take the most time, I find,

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:05.800
in the world of work are
unraveling the stupid things

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:10.025
that I've said or that
somebody else has said.

00:33:10.025 --> 00:33:14.930
And so to keep it
simple, this is

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:20.730
the tool of our business life.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:23.770
Stephen Covey used to
talk about sharpening

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:29.350
the saw, this image of the
carpenter that doesn't have

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:33.620
time to stop and sharpen their
saw because they're too busy.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.300
And then they're
sawing and sawing

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.120
and sawing with this dull blade
and not getting anything done,

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:41.160
but they still can't
stop-- too busy.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.230
So in this case, what
I love about that image

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:45.580
is that we are the saw.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.660
And to me, mindfulness practice
and mindfulness meditation

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:54.410
practice is stopping to sharpen
the saw so that whatever

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:59.590
we do actually has more
impact, more possibility, more

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.810
effectiveness.

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:07.930
And in a way, a core practice
has to do with the question,

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:12.040
are we building walls, or
are we building bridges?

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:17.730
In each moment of your life, to
notice are you building walls,

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.960
or are you building bridges?

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:25.480
And bridges with yourself--
are you being true to yourself?

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.560
Are you being true
to your own feelings?

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:33.480
Are you deeply asking that
question, what do you want?

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.590
Do you pay attention?

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:38.900
Do you allow your own
feelings, intuition, to arise?

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:42.929
So there's that bridge
to your own feelings,

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:46.889
and then are you
actually noticing

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:49.780
that the world isn't
all you, that there

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:54.020
are a lot of people out
there who depend on you

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.300
and who you depend on?

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.860
So are you building walls?

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.360
Are you crusting your heart?

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.830
Is your heart
getting more crusted?

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:07.890
Is your own thinking
getting more concretized?

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:11.470
Or are you developing
more flexibility?

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:14.880
And I want to
encourage you-- again,

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.530
the seven principles are
actually things you can do.

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:22.410
And poetry and
pragmatism are kind

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:29.280
of the container for holding
these seven practices.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:36.380
And I want to end by
reading a short poem.

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:48.030
And this is a poem by Rilke,
the German poet Rilke.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:52.080
I live my life in
growing orbits,

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.440
which move out over the
things of the world.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.040
I live my life in
growing orbits,

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:02.170
which move out over the
things of the world.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:06.190
Perhaps I can never
achieve the last.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:09.150
But that will be my attempt.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:12.510
Perhaps I can never
achieve the last,

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:16.630
perhaps I can never get
to the furthest orbit.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:20.110
Perhaps I'll never
be able to be as wide

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:22.510
and perhaps I'll never
be able to achieve

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:25.000
as much as I want to achieve.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.220
But that will be my attempt.

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.900
I'm circling.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.910
I'm circling around God.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:36.440
I'm circling around
an ancient tower.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.170
And I've been circling
for 1,000 years.

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:43.410
I've been circling
for 1,000 years.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:48.300
And I still don't
know if I'm a falcon

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:52.440
or a storm or a great song.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.780
And I still don't
know if I'm a falcon

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:59.340
or a storm or a great song.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:03.100
So you can see, I've chosen
to be a falcon this morning,

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.610
circling around.

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:09.570
So to me, this is poetry, right?

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:12.950
I'm reading poetry, very poetic.

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:16.370
But there's something to me
very practical about when

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:21.460
we sit down, when we sit down
in a chair or on our cushion,

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:26.370
and we bring our attention
to our breath and our body,

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:29.490
or when we get up
from our cushion

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:32.630
and we go off into
the world, being

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:36.700
curious and present
and interested.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.500
We don't know what will happen.

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:45.100
We don't even know,
really, who or what we are.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.900
And it's a beautiful thing.

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:52.630
It's a beautiful thing to not
know whether you are a falcon

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:54.490
or maybe you are a storm, right?

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:56.660
Some days are stormy.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:02.930
Or a great song-- not just
a song, but a great song.

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:06.340
So I want us to try something.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.790
Actually, how about if everybody
stands up for a second?

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:15.280
And how about finding a partner?

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.780
Find someone in the room,
maybe that you don't know.

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:21.350
But find someone without
talking and have a seat.

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:21.865
Have a seat.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:36.460
Each person is going to speak
for three whole minutes.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.880
During your three
minutes, the other person

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.220
is not going to ask you
questions or interrupt.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:45.890
This is called-- we're going
to do mindful listening here,

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:46.740
three minutes.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.739
And then it will switch.

00:38:47.739 --> 00:38:49.580
The other person will
have three minutes.

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:51.990
I'm fond of saying,
if you run out

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:54.469
of something to say
in your three minutes,

00:38:54.469 --> 00:38:55.677
just sit there uncomfortably.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.940
Don't just stop and have
the other person go.

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:01.490
It's OK.

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:04.210
Actually, is one of
the wonderful things

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:05.820
about meditation
and mindfulness.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:09.590
You can always choose to
do nothing, and it's OK.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:12.436
This is a place
where doing nothing

00:39:12.436 --> 00:39:13.560
can be a comfortable place.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:18.010
And if it's uncomfortable,
great-- great-- uncomfortable--

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:19.340
uncomfortable.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:23.040
We're not trying to
avoid discomfort.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:23.980
It's OK.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.060
It's really OK.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.190
That is so freeing.

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:29.890
It's so freaking
freeing if you can

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:32.360
let go of needing to be
comfortable all the time.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:40.520
OK, so my suggested question,
suggested topic is just talk

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:48.050
for three minutes about how
might you describe the poetry

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:50.980
and pragmatism of your own life?

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.210
Three minutes, however
it comes up for you.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:56.140
How might you-- just talk.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.620
And I want to
suggest-- pretend you

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.584
know what you're doing here.

00:40:00.584 --> 00:40:01.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:05.000
You might have no idea
what the assignment is

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.780
or what the hell is--?

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.960
But just pretend.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:14.320
And speak with as much
conviction and clarity

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.750
as you can muster.

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:18.640
Here's how my life
is poetic, and here's

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.910
how my life is pragmatic.

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.462
One other topic
possibility is anything

00:40:24.462 --> 00:40:25.420
you want to talk about.

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:26.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:28.534
You might actually--
I don't know

00:40:28.534 --> 00:40:30.200
what's happening in
your life right now.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.980
You might not, either.

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:35.410
But sometimes it can
just be a great gift

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:38.934
having someone listen to
you for three minutes.

00:40:38.934 --> 00:40:40.850
So there might be something
that's up for you.

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:44.570
So feel free to talk
about whatever you want.

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:46.070
So let's just take a breath.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:49.100
Let's all just breathe
together and relax.

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:52.730
Whatever you've prepared to
say already, forget about it.

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:56.800
Trust that you'll know when
it's your turn to speak.

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.840
So how about if the person
with the shortest hair

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:03.790
is going to be Person A.
Person with the shortest hair

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:06.985
is Person A. So Person A,
you have three minutes.

00:41:06.985 --> 00:41:09.360
I'll ring a bell at three
minutes, and then we'll switch.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.437
So go ahead.

00:41:10.437 --> 00:41:14.910
[CHATTER]

00:41:45.227 --> 00:41:48.706
[BELL RINGING]

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:56.560
OK, so the first
person should finish.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.030
And then let's go right
to the second person.

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:02.480
You have three minutes to talk
about poetry and pragmatism,

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.452
OK?

00:42:04.452 --> 00:42:08.396
[CHATTER]

00:42:27.623 --> 00:42:31.074
[BELL RINGING]

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:38.010
OK, let's finish, and
thank your partners.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:40.710
And then let's come on back.

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:44.570
We have a few minutes
for comments, questions

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:49.670
about how that-- I'm really
curious how that went,

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:55.008
but anything else anyone
wants to add, ask, comment on.

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.875
See, I'm not comfortable
with silence.

00:43:03.875 --> 00:43:05.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:12.410
AUDIENCE: I think is very
interesting how one thing leads

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:14.650
to another one and
you start opening up.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:16.750
I think at some
point-- I don't know

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:18.380
what happened to
other people, but you

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:19.940
need to close the
doors, because you

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.160
realize that you are getting
deeper and deeper into things

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.340
that you didn't think
about two minutes ago-- I

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:30.110
mean six minutes ago.

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:33.200
So I thought that was very
interesting, that part.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.910
MARC LESSER: So the part about
just noticing the opening up.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:41.240
AUDIENCE: Yes, and I think we
both were very open about what

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.970
we were talking-- I
don't think we really

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:44.730
knew what we were talking about.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:45.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:47.120
But it was sincere.

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.230
You could feel it.

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:49.920
That's what I mean.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:53.290
You could feel the sincerity.

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:56.720
AUDIENCE: From one
view, these two things

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.852
could be viewed as a
paradox and both seemingly

00:44:00.852 --> 00:44:03.310
oppositional to each other yet
coexisting at the same time.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:05.690
And I know you've written
a lot about paradox.

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:08.810
I'm wondering if you could
speak a little bit about how

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:12.875
the usefulness of paradox and
now it shows up in our lives.

00:44:12.875 --> 00:44:17.220
MARC LESSER: Yeah, I
think I once-- there's

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.260
this wonderful quote that's
"if it's not paradoxical,

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:21.684
it's not true."

00:44:21.684 --> 00:44:24.100
And I Googled to see who said
it, and it said Marc Lesser.

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:27.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.920
I know someone else
said it before me.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:35.860
But in some way, being
a human being is just

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:39.750
incredibly
paradoxical, in that we

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:42.200
don't know-- how
did we get here?

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:43.390
How did we get here?

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:44.810
What are we doing here?

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:46.860
What is consciousness?

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:48.740
So there's that.

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:50.580
There's the big paradox.

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:56.220
But then in
everything we do, like

00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.740
some of my favorite
paradoxes are

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:03.700
"be confident and
question everything."

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:08.626
Fight for change
and accept what is.

00:45:08.626 --> 00:45:13.030
Like, of course-- of course
we have to fight for change.

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:15.820
If you're always finding,
though, it's not so good.

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.220
If you're always
accepting, not so good.

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:20.040
We have to do both.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:26.580
So I think yes, there's
something very poetic

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:31.130
about the human condition--
so we should fully

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:34.730
go there-- and practical, right?

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:38.220
Like we have one minute left.

00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:44.370
I was noticing my
shoes could be shinier.

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:46.492
Matt, you've got
the shiniest shoes.

00:45:46.492 --> 00:45:47.950
You might have
holes in your socks,

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:49.630
but your shoes are really shiny.

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:51.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:54.240
To notice the paradoxes
and to embrace them

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.410
and in a way to see--
right, so I wrote a book

00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:00.440
on this called "Know
Yourself, Forget Yourself."

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:03.450
That's what I think of as
also a very core practice.

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:05.090
Know yourself, right?

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:07.100
We want to know
ourselves, right?

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:10.570
It comes from--
there's a famous Zen

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:13.860
guy from the 13th
century named Dogen

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:17.420
who said, to study the
way-- and it's funny.

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:21.470
Even "the way"-- the
way means to study

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:23.340
what it means to
be a human being.

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.670
To study what it means
to be human being

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:27.900
is to study the self, right?

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:29.620
You study the self.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:34.320
Then the next line of this piece
of writing, "to study the self

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.015
is to forget the self."

00:46:36.015 --> 00:46:37.810
It's like, huh?

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:39.585
But it's so like,
yeah, because we

00:46:39.585 --> 00:46:41.460
don't want to go around
being self-conscious.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:42.960
It's not about being
self-conscious.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.010
It's about being free, right?

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:48.840
But you have to-- you can't
just go right-- a lot of people

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.360
try to go right to
self-forgetting.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:51.400
It doesn't work so well.

00:46:55.010 --> 00:47:00.025
I sometimes see it
as a PES disease

00:47:00.025 --> 00:47:03.170
is what they call it-- Premature
Enlightenment Syndrome.

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:04.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:08.700
This sense that, oh,
I don't have a self.

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:14.080
Well, that's not-- so we want
to have a really healthy self.

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.420
And we want to be able to
not be so self-conscious,

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:18.420
to find freedom there.

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:21.935
And then the other
line, to study the way

00:47:21.935 --> 00:47:22.930
is to study the self.

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:25.680
To study the self is
to forget the self.

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:30.200
To forget the self is to
become intimately connected

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.720
to all people and all things.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:35.600
It's to lose any
sense of separation.

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.270
So in a way, that's a
wonderful path of practice,

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:43.360
self-study, self-forgetting,
drop all disconnect.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:47.580
See that there
is-- again, that's

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.010
in a way the real
freedom is to see

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:53.460
that our separateness
is an illusion.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.940
It's a very compelling illusion.

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.270
But it's an illusion.

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:59.660
Our separateness is an illusion.

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:02.240
And maybe that's a really
good note to end on.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:03.240
Thank you all very much.

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:07.190
