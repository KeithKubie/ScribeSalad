are they cruel then for entertainment
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.109
are they cruel then for entertainment
well but then you have to explain the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
well but then you have to explain the
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.240
well but then you have to explain the
entertainment motivation like there's a

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250
entertainment motivation like there's a
 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.219

with the problem of malevolence it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
with the problem of malevolence it
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.490
with the problem of malevolence it
skirted over and you can't do that if

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500
skirted over and you can't do that if
 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.170
skirted over and you can't do that if
you're talking about psychopathy it's

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180
you're talking about psychopathy it's
 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.550
you're talking about psychopathy it's
like malevolence is the bloody issue

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
like malevolence is the bloody issue
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.200
like malevolence is the bloody issue
here and so the other issue with this

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210
here and so the other issue with this
 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.940
here and so the other issue with this
psychopath is that he's irredeemable

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
psychopath is that he's irredeemable
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.260
psychopath is that he's irredeemable
right that's the idea I don't think we

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270
right that's the idea I don't think we
 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.480
right that's the idea I don't think we
know enough to make such claims now and

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
know enough to make such claims now and
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.399
know enough to make such claims now and
that doesn't I know the psych office a

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
that doesn't I know the psych office a
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.780
that doesn't I know the psych office a
literature quite well and I have great

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
literature quite well and I have great
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.700
literature quite well and I have great
respect for their primary research is in

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
respect for their primary research is in
 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.230
respect for their primary research is in
the field I want to make that perfectly

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
the field I want to make that perfectly
 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.149
the field I want to make that perfectly
clear but we're talking at a different

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
clear but we're talking at a different
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.100
clear but we're talking at a different
we're talking we're approaching the

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110
we're talking we're approaching the
 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.300
we're talking we're approaching the
problem from a different level of

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
problem from a different level of
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.980
problem from a different level of
analysis here something like a spiritual

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
analysis here something like a spiritual
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.350
analysis here something like a spiritual
level of analysis and I don't think that

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360
level of analysis and I don't think that
 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.540
level of analysis and I don't think that
there's an easy easy translation from

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550
there's an easy easy translation from
 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.920
there's an easy easy translation from
the descriptive psychometric

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930
the descriptive psychometric
 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.610
the descriptive psychometric
theatrical to the spiritual level they

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620
theatrical to the spiritual level they
 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.630
theatrical to the spiritual level they
don't match and I'm more likely to say

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640
don't match and I'm more likely to say
 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.550
don't match and I'm more likely to say
let's not assume the soul is doomed from

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560
let's not assume the soul is doomed from
 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.020
let's not assume the soul is doomed from
birth right and I'm loathe to think that

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030
birth right and I'm loathe to think that
 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.470
birth right and I'm loathe to think that
there are people born irredeemable

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480
there are people born irredeemable
 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.280
there are people born irredeemable
although I do think there are

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290
although I do think there are
 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.309
although I do think there are
irredeemable people you know the death

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319
irredeemable people you know the death
 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.780
irredeemable people you know the death
penalty issues interesting in that

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790
penalty issues interesting in that
 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.059
penalty issues interesting in that
regard you know because I've read a lot

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069
regard you know because I've read a lot
 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.910
regard you know because I've read a lot
about really terrible people and I've

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920
about really terrible people and I've
 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.589
about really terrible people and I've
also read a lot about what really

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599
also read a lot about what really
 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.360
also read a lot about what really
terrible people said about themselves

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370
terrible people said about themselves
 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.520
terrible people said about themselves
and many of them wished for the death

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530
and many of them wished for the death
 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.369
and many of them wished for the death
penalty and so it's absolutely clear

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379
penalty and so it's absolutely clear
 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:51.960
penalty and so it's absolutely clear
that there are things that you can do

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970
that there are things that you can do
 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.860
that there are things that you can do
that deserve the death penalty but that

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870
that deserve the death penalty but that
 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.089
that deserve the death penalty but that
doesn't mean that the state should have

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099
doesn't mean that the state should have
 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.099
doesn't mean that the state should have
the right to impose it that's a

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109
the right to impose it that's a
 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:02:59.879
the right to impose it that's a
different question

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889
different question
 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.950
different question
so yeah

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960
so yeah
 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.679
so yeah
[Applause]
