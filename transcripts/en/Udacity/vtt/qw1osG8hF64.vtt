00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let me show you how that actually works when we use SSH.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here I'm using SSH to log into udacity.com.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What I see is a message that says the authenticity of the host can't be established.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That means I don't already know a public key for the host.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We can see because I don't already have a public key for udacity.com--

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that it cannot establish the authenticity of the host--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
it's showing me this finger print, which is a way for it to be more easy for a human to view the key,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
rather than seeing all the bites in the key.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If I was very paranoid and careful, what I would do is call up an administrator that I trust

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
at Udacity and say is this the finger print for our public key.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If I'm less paranoid or more impatient,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
then I could connect, and once I connect that public key is going to be stored.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It's added to the list of hosts that I have.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm not going to actually continue connecting, but now I have a secure channel

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
encrypted with some key that's been agreed to using the SSH protocol

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to send my password to the Udacity host knowing that it couldn't be intercepted.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But this only has value if I really knew that this was the public key.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Otherwise, I could be talking to anyone.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
What's happened as a result of this is now that key has been added to my collection of keys.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Now if I look in the file. ssh/known_hosts, I'll see that I have udacity.com here.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
What's been stored is the IP address I was talking to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
as well as this is the public key that's stored for udacity.com.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
If I try it again, you'll see that it does connect. It has a secure channel now.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It's verified it by checking that the public key that the server sent matched this one.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
What's more fun is if I modify this file.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I'm going to make a little change to the public key. Let's change that 4 to a 3.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Now let's try connecting again.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
What happens now is we get a very large yelling message with lots of capital letters,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
saying that the host identification has changed,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that the host I'm trying to connect to sent back a public key that's different from the one I've stored.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It means that someone could be doing something very nasty.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
In this case it means that I just modified the key file,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and they're talking about possibly being eavesdropped on.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It's really not the case that it would be eavesdropping.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It must be an attack in the middle. This is a bit of poor wording in the error message.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
It's possible the key changed or something else happened.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So they don't allow you to continue with the connection at this point.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
You could modify the file to create a new key, but it's worried enough that something

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
has gone wrong that it won't let you connect.
