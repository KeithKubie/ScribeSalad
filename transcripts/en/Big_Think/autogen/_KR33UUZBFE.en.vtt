Grace is a way that you live your life.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.809
We all go through life and we have these different
journeys and we meander in different ways

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.720
in and out and ebb and flow, but grace is
a way of appreciating the people that are

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.910
around you, the things that are around you
and how you interact with them in a way that's

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.730
meaningful, that's purposeful, that's intentional.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.660
You live it in an intentional way you don't
just hey write someone off and just keep moving,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.720
everyone has a purpose on this planet and
we can learn something from everyone.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.239
I mean I learn something every day from my
dog.

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.620
I learned patience.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.769
I learn things from people that I would have
never of expected to learn something the janitor

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.460
or whomever it is.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.839
And so moving through life in this graceful
way of embracing everything around you so.

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.920
Before I could read my mother read to me every
night two books: The Little Engine That Could,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.950
I think I can, I think I can, and Curious
George looking up curiosity.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.550
And I'll never forget I was this little kid
on the football team, the smallest kid probably.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.290
I could run fast but no one ever expected
me to play in the NFL and I never imagined

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.880
to play in the NFL because I was just this
small little kid.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.610
But having this never give up I think I can,
I think I can mentality is a gritty way of

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.670
ensuring that you're going to reach the dreams
and goals that you have.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.010
Sometimes people don't have expectations for
you because they see you are from a certain

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.690
neighborhood or a certain ZIP Code or whatever
and you're looked at as this kid, "Well you're

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:10.759
never going to be an astronaut because you're
from that ZIP Code."

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:18.080
And college, the SATs to get you in college
only predict the first and second year success,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.820
it doesn't predict if you're going to graduate
or how well you're going to do past the first

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.200
and second year.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.150
So if we're going to try to build this civilization,
future civilization, Mars, moon, wherever

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.270
we're going to go we want to do it with as
many people as we can that have these creative

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.500
ideas and our diversity.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.800
And that means that we've got to make sure
that we educate everyone.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.740
And I have a graphic that says you have three
little boys all standing on a box, they're

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.380
trying to look at the game.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.160
The little boy in the blue shirt he can't
see the game because he's too short, that's

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.170
equality.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.420
But justice is when you have what you need.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.230
When he gets two boxes he can see the game.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.810
One of the kids doesn't even need a box, but
he gets a box anyway.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.959
So let's not be equal, let's give justice
and give you what you need so that you can

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.040
see the game.
