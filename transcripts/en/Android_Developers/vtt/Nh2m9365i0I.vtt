00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.330
MAXIM MAI: Thank you so
much for being here today.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.430
And most of all, thank you so
much for giving up your spot

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.840
in the sun outside to come
back, sit down, and come

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.240
on this journey with us to
learn about sustainable growth.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.770
I'll be joined shortly onstage
by my formidable colleague

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.490
Marie Loridan and later by
the amazing Andy Carvell,

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.600
formerly of SoundCloud.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.150
But first, let's
talk a little bit

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.860
about what this
session is about.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.240
So what do I mean by
saying sustainable growth

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.050
solves most problems?

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.450
And I'll tell you a
little bit about my goals.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.210
So my first goal for today
is to introduce all of you

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.360
to a very simple yet
powerful framework

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.900
that you can use to
systematically accelerate

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.390
the growth trajectory
of your app.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.400
And the second goal for today is
to share with you some insights

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.440
of partners or developers--
some of them are in the audience

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.330
today-- that are using growth
tools, techniques, and tactics

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.530
to accelerate their app.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.280
And hopefully you'll
walk away inspired

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.240
and try some of these
methods yourself.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.810
But first of all, let's all
accept the growth challenge.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.930
So what do I mean by that?

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.230
I want you to come
on a journey with me

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.320
to kind of understand
the importance of having

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.470
a structured approach
to growth for your app.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.110
Let's have a show of hands here.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.300
Who in the audience here
considers her or himself

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.980
a growth-hacking expert?

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.470
We should have at least one.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.040
Because we have Andy
in the audience.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.850
Oh, OK, I see you're
all shy, maybe still

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.950
very full from lunch, and
hopefully not half asleep yet.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.130
OK, so we don't have any
growth hacking experts.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.930
That's excellent.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.520
You came to the right talk.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.699
So expert or not,
I hope that you all

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.000
agree with me when
I say that one

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.820
of the important factors
in why growth, or achieving

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.360
sustainable growth in the
long run, is so difficult

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.230
is that the individual
tactics and tools

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.420
and techniques that
people are using

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.760
are not only complex
in themselves,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.950
but importantly, they're
also very interconnected.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.110
And so it's tempting to obsess
about one or two or three

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.440
individual tactics and
master them, but kind of

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.860
lose sight of the big picture.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.820
And so for example, let's
look at performance marketing.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.680
So there was a recent study
that showed that marketers

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.340
are using dozens of
channels and ad formats

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.990
to reach their users.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.340
So this is just looking
at paid marketing.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.240
And for me, that already looks
like a very, very complicated

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.720
subject to master-- just
performance marketing.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.880
But of course, we haven't
even thought about

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.360
or haven't even looked at
all of the organic ways

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.400
of driving users to your app,
and the interdependencies

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.890
between those.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.040
Also for us at least, or
when I think about growth,

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.190
growth involves much, much
more than user acquisition.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.190
So in fact, I'm
certain that almost all

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.530
of you here in
the audience today

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.490
are working on strategies to
better engage and retain users.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.350
In fact, at the recent Play
event earlier in the year,

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.300
we did roundtable discussions.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.580
And there, developers--
almost every single person

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.840
I talked to-- told me that they
obsess about the onboarding

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.060
experience in their app to make
sure that new users sign up

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.120
or activate push
notifications to then later

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.210
be able to target them better
with life cycle marketing

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.370
campaigns.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.010
Now, those are just
two things-- so

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.160
onboarding experience, or
first-time user experience,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.450
and lifecycle marketing.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.430
But there are a
lot of other things

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.460
that people are
doing to drive growth

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.040
and engagement and retention
and, ultimately, usage

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.080
of their app.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.470
And of course,
eventually, all of us

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.120
will care about revenue
and/or growing revenue.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.160
But of course, how much
you focus on revenue

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.250
depends on the lifecycle stage
of the venture that you're

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.640
working on or the
maturity of your product.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.670
So one way that people
are optimizing or growing

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.870
their revenue is by optimizing
their pricing strategy.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.080
But it's much more than
just deciding on a price.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.050
So developers-- top
developers like Netflix--

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.840
they're using a lot of
very subtle strategies.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.740
And they're experimenting
with things like price tiering

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.420
and price anchoring to
influence purchase decisions.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.770
And a lot of you are
doing that as well.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.679
So pricing is only
one of the many things

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:15.470
that people are thinking
about when they're

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.330
thinking about growing revenue.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.790
You have to think about,
how do you capture value

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.740
in the first place
from partners?

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.080
How do you have your
office strategy?

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.280
How do you process payments?

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:33.560
So I work with a lot of you,
and a lot of top partners

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.710
personally, on a lot of
these topics and issues.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.800
And I think it gets fairly
complex fairly quickly.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.320
And luckily, there are a lot
of people in the growth hacking

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.630
community, growth
professionals, that

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.040
are looking for ways to
put some sort of structure

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.530
on growth, on this wild
field, on this complex topic,

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.320
and trying to understand
all of the interdependencies

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.030
and enable them to
prioritize better

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.500
and to ultimately accelerate
their growth strategy.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.530
So one of these people will
be on stage later-- Andy.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.170
And a couple of people around
him in the growth hacking

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.800
community have been thinking
a lot about one of these tools

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.570
to structure growth.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.130
And I want to give you a very
brief introduction to a growth

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.040
hacking framework.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.080
So the first thing
that you should do

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.080
is actually to take a step back.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.520
And so just before looking
at any of the tools, tactics,

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.180
and techniques, think about your
high-level business objectives,

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.060
whatever they are.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.600
So if you're early
in your venture,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.870
maybe you're just
trying to validate

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.310
a minimum viable product.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.310
Or you're trying to
double sales on mobile.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.870
Or you're maybe
looking for investment,

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.650
and you want to raise
a round of investments.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.360
Now think about how
those high-level business

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:11.400
objectives-- what do they
mean for your growth strategy,

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.750
for how you define
growth for yourself?

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.070
And you will start to
notice that you'll probably,

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.020
without looking at
anything individual,

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.500
be interested to
focus more strongly

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.660
on one of these three things.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.770
Maybe you'll focus on all.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.050
But it will sort of give
you an initial idea on where

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:37.020
you might want to focus.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.720
Also, of course,
important are not

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.240
just your business objectives
but also your resources

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.020
and your constraints.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.320
And I'll talk about that
a little bit later on.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.930
So let's talk about
how to apply that.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:57.070
So tactics-- all the
things I mentioned earlier

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.390
are your kind of tools,
tactics, strategies that

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.520
are available for you to use.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.780
And this, by the way, is
not an exhaustive list.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.290
There are many, many other
things that people are doing.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.630
But when you're
evaluating an activity,

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.390
think about, how does
this particular activity

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.660
fit into my overall strategy?

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:23.990
So you can do that for the
activities that foster user

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.600
acquisition or accelerate
user acquisition.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.900
You can do that for
activities that increase

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.010
engagement and retention.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.240
And you can do that
for growing revenue.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.370
And I'm not saying you should
be doing all of these things.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.159
You should be looking at
every single tactic in light

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:44.900
of your overall objectives,
your resources, and maybe

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.280
your constraints.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.910
But then once you have sort
of assembled your toolset

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.550
for growth, there's
another important thing

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.050
that you need to do.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.380
And that is build the right
business intelligence tools

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.580
and infrastructure to be
able to track your progress.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:04.350
And I can't emphasize
how important this is.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.840
Because when you
invest in these areas,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.900
you're using resources that
you might use for other things

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.920
instead.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.540
So you need to be able to
track the impact that you're

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.930
having, that your teams are
having, on these individual

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:18.470
areas.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.690
So you might want
to assign one or two

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.320
actionable and measurable KPIs
to each of those investments.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.990
So maybe when you're thinking
about optimizing your Play

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.600
listing, think about the visit
to in-store conversion rate

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.300
and how all the things
that you're doing

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.460
are impacting that
in the long run.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.870
Or when you're thinking
of your onboarding flow,

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:41.610
define a metric that captures
your activation rate-- how

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.725
good you are at activating
users, how good you are

00:09:45.725 --> 00:09:47.960
at introducing the
product to your users

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.860
when they install the app.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.400
Or when you're thinking
about growing revenue,

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.460
you might think, OK, here
are my payment processors.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.310
What's the percentage
of failed payments?

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:00.900
And how can I
increase the coverage

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.930
when I enter new markets?

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.860
So that's very
important-- the KPIs

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.400
and being able to measure them.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.270
Now let's think
of one-- I'd like

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.640
to explain a very simple
application of this framework.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.780
It's not an exercise
in pretty drawings.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.320
But think of the concept
of a growth card, right?

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.110
So you've selected the
activities you want to do.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.590
You've got your KPIs.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.970
And you can measure them.

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.700
Now try to benchmark against
either internal goals

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.220
or industry averages.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.800
So you might actually find--
let's go back to the Play Store

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.040
optimization example.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.250
You might actually find
that your conversion rate

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.470
is actually very good
compared to country benchmarks

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.210
or industry benchmarks.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:52.270
You might find that maybe
your activation rate is OK.

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.840
It's not super great.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.620
But compared to the goals
you set for yourself,

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.390
it's quite good.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:02.660
But then you might find that
payment is really an issue.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.670
And I'm just using
these as examples.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.940
But this is how having a
scorecard to guide your growth

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:16.100
strategy can be very, very,
very useful and helpful.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:21.810
So that's enough theory for
one afternoon after lunch.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.570
Now I would like to talk
a little bit about what

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.470
our top Android
developers are doing

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:32.770
with some of these
techniques to drive growth.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.330
Now, I'll be focusing mostly
on the organic techniques.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.700
That's what I do in my day job.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.810
And then Marie will come
up and talk a little bit

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:42.430
about paid techniques.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:48.100
So first up, I'd like to
talk a little bit about Clue.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.400
So this is a period tracking
and female health app.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.890
And they're based
here in Berlin.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:12:01.270
So late last year, they
went through an exercise

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.420
quite similar to
the growth framework

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.170
that I introduced just before.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.500
So we were trying to figure
out, where are the bottlenecks,

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.950
or which areas needed more
investment to accelerate

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.630
the growth curve on Android?

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.370
And one of the things
that we identified

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:23.110
was that the in-store
conversion rate was quite low,

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.600
or was lower than
it needed to be.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.630
So the folks at
Clue really came up

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:32.080
with a long-term strategy of
running lots of little Play

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.910
listing experiments to
increase the conversion rate.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.730
And over the course
of about six months,

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.250
they increased the
conversion rate by 24%.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.320
And that's huge.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.770
So that means that 24%
more users install the app

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:51.760
without spending anything
more on advertising or doing

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.230
any PR work or anything.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.180
So that's just with the
users that are already

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.100
arriving on the Play listing.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.850
So just to give
you one quick test,

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:04.950
so which of the two
images do you think

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:10.992
had a higher visit to download
conversion rate, the left one

00:13:10.992 --> 00:13:11.700
or the right one?

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.904
So have a show of hands for
the left one, on your left.

00:13:15.904 --> 00:13:17.070
OK, so that's the black one.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.510
OK, and the others?

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:21.210
OK, yeah, so the
white one-- there's

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:25.120
actually two factors there
that got tested individually.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.970
The white phone drove a
higher conversion rate

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.600
and larger image.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.645
So that's a really,
really cool insight here.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.580
The next thing I
want to talk about,

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.450
in terms of the toolsets
that you have available,

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:46.150
is an example from a non-profit,
which is ShareTheMeal,

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.420
also based here in Berlin.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:53.280
And these guys, I'm sure, also
did a very sophisticated growth

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:53.910
analysis.

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.290
But one of the
restrictions that they have

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:57.880
is that they're a non-profit.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:01.510
So they can't actually spend
any money on advertising.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.190
So they sort of evaluated
their constraints

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.560
and then thought, well, one
of the things we can do,

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.780
and we can do very well,
is public relations.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.410
And I think it's a tool
that's often overlooked,

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.060
because it's hard to do well.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.710
But when you do it well, it
can be very, very powerful.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.420
So it's also hard to track.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.530
But they have to
track the impact.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:28.110
So they estimate about
50% of all total installs

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.210
were driven by public relations.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:33.670
And a couple of the
insights there are you

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.480
need to really focus on
excellent messaging and having

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.680
the right hooks, and also
to combine public relations

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:47.080
with other initiatives, such
as partnerships work, or maybe

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.860
press work partnerships, and
maybe viral hooks, something

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.816
like that.

00:14:52.816 --> 00:14:55.970
I also want to talk a
little bit about virality.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.171
So I'm sure you guys
all know Dubsmash.

00:15:00.171 --> 00:15:01.670
I don't know if
anyone from Dubsmash

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.460
is here today-- I think so.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.790
No-- or maybe you
don't want to say.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:13.390
So Dubsmash is a social
video messaging platform.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:17.020
And basically what it does is
it allows you to create videos

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.860
for yourself that are dubbed.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.930
And you can lip sync to songs.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.940
And this is really, really fun.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:27.690
And in a way, virality is
built into the product, right?

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.920
It's not very fun looking
at yourself singing along

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:31.790
to songs.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:36.320
So sharing and reaching
other users is built in.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.030
And it has been
hugely successful.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.200
And growth has been phenomenal.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.960
But the point I want to make
is that even if virality

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.890
isn't built into your product--
so if your product isn't

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:50.930
the perfect fit for
viral mechanics--

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.450
there are a couple of
things that you can look out

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:58.700
for to make sure that you make
sharing as easy as possible.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.760
So there are really two factors.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.940
One has a very fun name.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.610
It's called the K factor.

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:09.830
And it basically describes,
how many new users does

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.600
one user bring into the app?

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.340
So that's something
that you might

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.940
want to work on improving
by making it easier

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.370
to share with other users.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:25.310
So that can have a really nice
impact on your organic growth.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.530
Another factor that you
might want to look at

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.300
is the cycle time.

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.880
And that just means,
how short or how long is

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.440
the interval between me sharing
with friends and those friends

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.510
coming back to the
app or installing

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.940
the app for the first time
and then sharing again?

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:45.590
So shortening that time can also
be a very, very, very powerful

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.620
factor of increasing the
viral growth of your app.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:53.000
So think about making sharing
easy, accessible, encouraging,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.260
incentivizing sharing.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:01.390
One final thing I want to talk
about in this quick session

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.790
is cross-promotion.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:08.950
So cross-promotion, if you
already have a popular app,

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.740
can be a very,
very powerful tool.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:15.420
So Freeletics did
this very well.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:21.220
So for me, cross-promotion isn't
just injecting an interstitial

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.050
and showing it to all
your existing users

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.650
to promote a new product.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.349
But doing it in a clever
way works very well.

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:30.970
So for example, Freeletics
injected nutrition information

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:35.050
to the activity stream for
all their bodyweight users.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.590
And so that got
people who were just

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:41.390
interested in fitness
interested in nutrition as well.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:44.120
And some of them clicked
through to the app.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.890
And there are various
other subtle ways

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:49.180
of using cross-promotion
to promote a new product.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.970
And this was very, very, very
successful for Freeletics.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.520
So when they launched
the nutrition app,

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:59.420
almost all of the sales
were made to existing users

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.640
of existing apps.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:06.820
So that's my part talking
about organic tactics.

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:10.330
I'd now like to ask Marie
onstage to talk a little bit

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.174
about performance marketing.

00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:14.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.094
MARIE LORIDAN: Hi, everyone.

00:18:23.094 --> 00:18:26.160
At Google I/O, we
announced that mobile app

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:31.250
install ads had driven
over 2 billion installs.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.720
This number is now 3 billion.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.610
This is truly growth hacking.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:38.780
How did we achieve that?

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.070
At Google, we take our
promotion very seriously,

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:48.340
and have been heavily
investing in building us

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.810
the tools that will help you
drive installs and also make

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:57.700
sure that your users stay
active within the app.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.950
You've heard earlier
in the opening

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:04.910
that we had launched universal
app campaigns last year

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.840
as a very simple
way to actually show

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:12.070
your ads on the full set of
our inventory, which includes

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.770
Google Search, the Google
Play Store, our Google Display

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:18.970
Network, and YouTube.

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:22.220
What you need to run
universal app campaigns

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.000
is only four lines of text.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.720
Then we do the rest for you.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:33.310
We generate creatives using
your Play Store assets.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:37.510
And we use, for
example, your app icon.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:43.090
Then we run the ads and
optimize them for you

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.760
automatically through our
machine learning solution

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.160
or conversion optimizer.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.370
So this has been
extremely successful

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:55.435
and helped a lot of advertisers
to drive installs with success.

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.910
Now I'd like to do
a show of hands.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.600
But because I feel the energy
is a bit down after lunch,

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.390
I'd like you to stand
up if you already

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.530
used paid marketing before.

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.460
Can you please
stand up if you've

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.170
used performance marketing?

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.650
So let's say about
half the room.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:25.873
All right, now you-- oh,
everybody sit down, OK.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.000
So hopefully you moved.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.500
And now you're
energized again-- right.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:40.500
So obviously, if you stood up
or if you didn't, universal app

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:44.400
campaigns is truly something
I encourage you to look at.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.580
We have very
sophisticated players

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:52.060
using it in the industry,
and also smaller players.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:57.420
So this is really something I'd
like you to take away today.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:02.190
Now we're going to explore a
couple of different campaign

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:06.270
types that can be used and
help you drive installs and app

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:08.040
engagement.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:13.330
So the first one I'm going
to talk about is video.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:17.280
So video campaigns are really
good if you want especially

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:22.490
to build up brand awareness,
and also drive installs.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.920
For the most successful
advertisers out there,

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.240
we've noticed that usually
videos will trigger users

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.762
with higher lifetime value.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.980
Here, we have the
example of Yousician.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:41.370
So if you want to become
Jimi Hendrix tomorrow,

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.570
use Yousician.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:45.370
You'll learn how to play guitar.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:50.460
What they did is they used
videos in their ad campaigns.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.490
And they managed to
increase their installs

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:58.650
over 136% as a results.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:03.870
They launched the campaigns in
over 50 different countries.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:08.100
A couple of tips to make
sure that your videos can

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.640
be very successful--
for app promotion,

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.240
you need very short videos.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.860
So that's the first point.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.850
We recommend less
than 20 seconds.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:20.670
Second tip-- make
sure that you're

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:25.980
showing the brand in the
first second of the video.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:31.320
Third tip-- you make sure that
you also show the users how

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.700
to use the app.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.140
So use a demo.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.720
Very easily use
screenshots from your app

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.460
so that the user can
understand actually

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.790
what your app is about.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:45.580
Finally, and last tip
for successful videos,

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.050
make sure you have a clear
call to action at the end.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.420
The users need to click
at the end of the video

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:56.730
to be redirected to the store
and then install your app.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.560
With that, I'm going
to move forward

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.380
to the second campaign type
I'm going to talk about,

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.480
which is search.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:10.290
So search is enabling you
to drive installs at scale

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:13.350
and will allow
you to reach users

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:18.360
that are going to look
for apps similar to use.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.480
So here, you can see Gett.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:27.540
Gett is a taxi
service application.

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.990
They ran search campaigns both
on the Google Search Network

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.410
and the Google Play Store.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:36.750
And they saw an
increase up to 60%.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:44.190
I think in Russia, they
saw lower CPIs of 60%.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.050
So this was very
successful for them.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:48.630
And at the same
time, they managed

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:52.200
to exceed their return
on investment by 150%.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:59.850
The next campaign type
I'd like to talk about

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:03.600
is once you've decided
to go beyond installs.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:08.580
So we all know that user
engagement and making sure

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:14.770
that users stay active within
the app is extremely important.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:18.240
So here the idea is really
to shift from the installs

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.660
to actually start
monitoring and optimizing

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:26.790
for in-app events or
in-app activities.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:29.340
This example is
the one of Happn.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.790
Has anyone used Happn here?

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:35.910
It's a dating app, so all right.

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:39.210
So what they did is they
actually decided to do that.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.500
They wanted to keep
monitoring installs,

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.590
but move a bit away further
than the funnel and start

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:50.550
optimizing for registrations.

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.890
So they started building
up this Play campaign

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.950
to optimize for registration.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.890
And they managed
to decrease by 68%

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:03.420
the cost per registration in
one of their most expensive

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.560
segments, which
was women over 25.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.600
So this really
worked well for them.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.610
If I take another
example-- and I'm

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.310
thinking about
education apps today--

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:19.270
then optimizing for
registration might be important.

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.330
Other things that you
might want to optimize for

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:25.840
is a tutorial
completion, for example,

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:30.610
or is also optimize
for users who

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.980
are reaching a certain
number of classing

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:37.180
within your app, or
purchases, ultimately.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.710
Retailers are the same.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:40.870
They will try to
track different things

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:44.570
and optimize for different
things-- for example, a product

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:45.930
view.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:49.960
They might also want to
optimize for a search performed

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.250
within the app.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:56.140
They might want to optimize
for an item added to a basket,

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.170
and ultimately even go
to the end of the funnel

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:00.507
and optimize for purchase.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:08.530
Finally, the last piece I'd
like to talk about is engagement

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.704
and how to drive successful
engagement campaigns.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.350
So for engagement,
you need to be

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:22.630
very clear with regards to the
strategy you want to adopt.

00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:24.960
There could be
several strategies.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.300
If you're a gaming
application, you

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:31.590
might want to go after the
users that have achieved level

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:34.110
5 within your game or above.

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:38.640
Because you know those users are
going to be the most profitable

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.570
for you, the ones driving
the most lifetime value.

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:44.820
You could also
very simply decide

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.540
to re-engage all the
users who have already

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.400
installed your app.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.260
In the case of
Foodpanda, which is

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.970
one of our Berlin-based
partners, what they decided

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:00.660
to do through their
engagement display campaigns

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:06.460
is to optimize and go after the
users who had installed the app

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.420
or who had already
made a purchase.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.510
And this was
extremely successful--

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:18.930
71% decrease in cost per
install and 37% more sales

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:22.590
when they were comparing the
results of their app campaigns

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:26.010
to their previous run
desktop campaigns.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:31.080
So it was very, very successful
and paid off a lot for them.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.600
So with that, the recap,
there are a couple

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.470
of ways to run paid
acquisitions today and re-engage

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:42.390
your users-- through universal
app campaigns, video campaigns,

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:47.430
search, optimizing beyond the
install for in-app events,

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.530
and finally run
re-engagement campaigns.

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:53.112
Thank you, and with that,
I'm handing over to Max.

00:27:53.112 --> 00:27:57.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:58.560
MAXIM MAI: Thank you.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.000
Thank you, Marie.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.870
So I hope that there was
something interesting

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.360
there for everyone--
some inspiration,

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.617
some ideas, or something that
partners or developers here

00:28:10.617 --> 00:28:11.700
in the audience are doing.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.740
So I want to remind you,
we're all here today.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:14.550
So let's chat.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:17.070
So if you found anything
or heard anything

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.560
that was interesting, I'm
sure that Sebastian is very

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.550
interested in chatting to you.

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:27.810
Listen to his-- or if
you're interested in PR,

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:28.740
he's an expert in it.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:33.900
So think about what
was useful there.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.620
And think of how you can
apply it to your project,

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.780
to your app.

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:43.380
Now I want to recognize the fact
that growth strategy doesn't

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.250
happen in a vacuum.

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:48.150
So it's very, very,
very important

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.690
to have a great team and
a culture to support that.

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.930
So we were talking
to some of what

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.210
we thought were very
successful developers

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.200
and experts in the area.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.100
So think of that.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:06.450
Of the 76 million total
installs that Runtastic

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:12.120
has generated on Play, 95%
were generated organically.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.580
I think that is a
phenomenal number.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:18.630
And the head of growth
at Runtastic, Mario,

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.670
is very, very proud of that KPI.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.970
Because it's a
very good indicator

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:27.660
that they're doing something
right with their growth team

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.650
and with their growth strategy.

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.520
So the first lesson,
when I talked to him,

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:39.690
that he had for me was, if
you want to do growth right,

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.150
it can't be a strategy so much.

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:46.170
It has to be at the
core of the culture.

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:48.670
And it has to inform
everything you do.

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:50.500
So what does he mean by that?

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.640
Well, it means that
their growth culture

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:57.060
is codified in a set of
principles at Runtastic.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.280
So one of the
principles, for example,

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.530
is, growth is never done.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:05.820
Or another principle is,
math and metrics don't lie.

00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.800
But they don't tell everything.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.950
So growth culture
is encapsulated

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:11.940
in these principles.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.900
And these principles then
inform all the processes

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.250
that people at Runtastic--
how people at Runtastic work.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:22.680
It informs how the
teams are staffed

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.110
and what tactics
those teams employ.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:28.890
So he shared with me
this very high-level view

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:33.930
of how their product managers,
designers, and engineers work

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:39.390
together to create their app.

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:43.060
And I think it encapsulates
well the principles at work.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.890
So it applies data.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:48.170
But it doesn't rely
on data entirely.

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:50.790
The feedback is
also qualitative.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:53.490
And it also means that
growth is never done.

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.520
So you have these
continuous feedback loops

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.780
of how they do development.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:01.220
Another key thing I think that
you need to remind yourself

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.800
is that growth strategy
is very cross-functional.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.810
It's a cross-functional
endeavor.

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:09.300
And so the quality
of your execution

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.030
will depend on assembling
the right skill

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:17.310
set and the right people in your
team to actually execute well.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:20.520
So I hope that,
as I said before,

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:24.120
you chat to other developers
here and really try

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:29.010
to get to the bottom of how
other people in the industry

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.310
are set up to drive growth.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:34.400
One last thing I
want to emphasize

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.790
is the importance of
continuously tracking

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.500
your progress, whether
you use a growth

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.710
scorecard or some other device.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:46.860
It's important with
successful growth strategy

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:50.040
to flag problems
early on so that you

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.530
know whether the
investments you're making

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:55.860
are bringing you closer
to the goals you've

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.700
stated for your KPIs.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.670
And also, re-evaluate your
growth strategy continuously

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:05.150
as internal and
external factors change.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:09.010
So that was the first
part of this presentation.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.970
Before I call on Andy,
I just want to give you

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:12.380
a very quick summary.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:15.960
So first we looked at how
complex the whole topic

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.070
of growth is.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:20.210
But then we luckily introduced
a very simple tool, the growth

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.770
framework, to deal with this.

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:25.830
And the first step is to look
at your high-level business

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.350
objectives to define
what growth means

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:30.140
for you and for your business.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.430
And then, really focus
only on the techniques

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:35.080
that makes sense for you--
the tactics and the tools

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.570
that make sense for you.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.960
And importantly, be
able to track the impact

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.180
that you're having.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.680
Also, define really
good KPIs for you

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.060
that are measurable
and actionable.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:50.490
And have some sort of way
of making sure you visualize

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:51.890
whether you're on track.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:55.920
And then, continuously look
at the data as it comes in.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.370
And track your progress to
make sure you're on track.

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:02.360
And make changes as necessary.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.580
Now Marie and I-- we
covered the framework.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.190
We gave you some examples.

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:10.020
I am thrilled to
hand over to Andy,

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.670
who until recently was a
product manager at SoundCloud.

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:17.560
And he is currently
a growth hacker.

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:24.620
Please, I hope he'll share with
you some interesting insights

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.840
of how SoundCloud lives
and breathes growth.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.440
So thank you very much.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:32.636 --> 00:33:33.510
ANDY CARVELL: Thanks.

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:35.630
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:36.820
It's a beautiful day.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:41.130
So thanks for being in here and
not outside in the sunshine.

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:44.610
Yeah, so as Max said, I actually
just finished at SoundCloud

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:48.380
literally on first of September.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:51.210
I'm now working with
another ex-SoundClouder.

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:53.460
We set up a mobile
growth consultancy.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.510
So we're helping companies with
exactly this kind of stuff,

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:59.220
like applying the Mobile
Growth Stack framework,

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:04.300
and also writing about growth
topics at mobilegrowthstack.com

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.720
But I spent the
last 4 and 1/2 years

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.000
at SoundCloud working
on mobile growth.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.400
And the last year
and a half of that

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.340
was leading a
cross-functional team

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:15.885
focused on user
retention, which I'm

00:34:15.885 --> 00:34:18.010
going to talk about a little
bit today and tell you

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:21.510
why I think it's the most
important growth metric.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:24.110
And I'll just give you
a little bit of insight

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:28.170
into some of the things that we
did at SoundCloud to increase

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:31.070
retention.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:36.230
So retention-- it's
really scary when you look

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:37.710
at this graph on the right.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:40.130
This is a graph that
I often refer to.

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:45.150
It was published by Andrew
Chen in one of his blog posts.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:48.860
And it shows the average
retention of Android apps

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.380
in the Play Store.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.710
And it shows the blue
line there at the top.

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:55.520
That's apps in the top 10.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:00.090
And what you see on
this curve is that even

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:05.030
a top 10 app loses 50% of its
users in the first 90 days.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:07.410
And if the app is
not in the top 10,

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:10.630
it's likely to be retaining
users significantly poorer

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:11.130
than that.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:13.860
It's a really tough
game to retain users.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:19.860
Because the switching cost for
a user to switch to another app

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.590
or just to discard your
app is basically zero.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:26.480
So it's a constant challenge
to keep your users engaged

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.172
and retained.

00:35:28.172 --> 00:35:30.380
And of course, if you're
spending money on marketing,

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.227
it's really scary to
think that actually you're

00:35:33.227 --> 00:35:35.310
paying to acquire users
who are probably not going

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:36.960
to stick around.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.300
So anything you can do
to improve retention

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.260
gives you compound growth
over the long term.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.490
And it's going to also be a
multiplier on your acquisition

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:47.230
efforts.

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:50.500
So at SoundCloud, the way
that we looked at retention

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:54.070
was-- I mean, you can
think about retention

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:59.900
in terms of when you look at
your users in any given period.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:01.540
So for example,
here's an example

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.940
from the May users
at SoundCloud.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.040
They broke into these
three different buckets.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.590
So you can think
about you always

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:11.560
have some new users
who just arrived.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.500
And then at SoundCloud
we talked about repeat

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.494
and returning users.

00:36:15.494 --> 00:36:16.910
So I'm going to
just take a moment

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:19.790
to explain the difference
between those two buckets.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:23.860
So a repeat user is somebody
who was here in the last period.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.230
And he's here again this
period, or she is here again

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:27.410
this period.

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:31.780
So this is a loyal user
who is currently engaged

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.884
and is using your app regularly.

00:36:34.884 --> 00:36:36.550
What you often find
is that there's also

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:40.750
a large bucket of what we
refer to as returning users.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:45.736
So these are users who were
not seen in the last period.

00:36:45.736 --> 00:36:47.110
So they were not
seen last month.

00:36:47.110 --> 00:36:48.550
But they're here this month.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:51.279
But they signed up more
than one month ago.

00:36:51.279 --> 00:36:53.320
And this bucket actually
is usually pretty large,

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.690
particularly if your app's
been around for a while.

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:57.500
And these users
haven't necessarily

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.850
churned, in the sense
that they've really

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:01.690
abandoned your app.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:04.190
They might just be
very casual users.

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:08.020
Maybe they use your app
once or twice a month,

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.600
or a few times a year.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.030
And depending on your app and
the particular kind of use case

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:15.610
that you're solving,
maybe that's OK.

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:17.350
But probably most
apps, you really

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:20.080
want users coming back every
week or even every day,

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.880
or even multiple times per day.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.920
So really the way that we
approached it at SoundCloud

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.560
was that we wanted
people listening

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:30.250
to music on SoundCloud every
day, preferably for many hours.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.590
And so really it was all
about growing that repeat user

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:35.620
bucket-- turning new
users into repeat users

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:39.620
and then keeping them
there, and then reactivating

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:41.500
users who had lapsed.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.270
But reactivation
is really tough.

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:46.310
And I'll talk a bit
more about that later.

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:52.960
So how do we approach this
idea of keeping users engaged,

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.070
keeping users from
dropping out of this loop?

00:37:56.070 --> 00:38:00.550
And the way that I sort
of conceptualize it

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:02.380
is that you're building
growth machines.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:05.870
You want to build
repeatable loops, processes,

00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:08.830
which through
testing you've proven

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:12.670
to have a strong impact--
or a positive impact

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:15.170
at least-- on your
retention numbers.

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:19.210
So this could be-- I'll talk
about activity notifications

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:21.010
as a prime example
of this in a minute.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:23.590
But there are other
things you can do.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:27.760
It could be a loyalty scheme
with points or gamification,

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.260
something like
this, anything you

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:34.000
can do that basically you can
put it on sort of autopilot.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.380
Once you've tested it and
optimized it and iterated

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.650
on it to a certain level,
it just keeps going.

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:42.230
And it keeps pushing some users
into a higher engaged state.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:44.260
And it's basically
interacting with users

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.613
ideally before they churn.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.390
And so I'll talk a little bit
about activity notifications,

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.160
which was actually
one of the projects

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.920
that I spent most
of the last year

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.420
really building
up at SoundCloud.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.380
It was to build up a new
activity notification

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.350
infrastructure for the company.

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:06.820
So what are activity
notifications?

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.650
They're real-time
notifications--

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:12.559
could be push, which was
actually the first channel

00:39:12.559 --> 00:39:13.600
that we deployed them to.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.350
But it can also be over email.

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:16.416
Could be SMS.

00:39:16.416 --> 00:39:18.040
The channel is less
important, I guess,

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:21.020
than the concept,
which is that you're

00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:23.440
getting in touch with the
user to tell them something

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.080
hopefully interesting
and relevant to them

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.332
in a timely fashion about
something that's happened when

00:39:29.332 --> 00:39:30.290
they're not in the app.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:31.750
Now, this is not
always applicable

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:33.020
to every app scenario.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.762
But at SoundCloud,
for example, there

00:39:34.762 --> 00:39:37.220
are plenty of things that happen
when you're not in the app

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.290
that you might be interested in.

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:40.250
It could be that artists
that you're following

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:41.590
have released new tracks.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:43.520
And you might want to
be told about them.

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.920
Because you might want to
come and listen to them.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.050
It could be that I've
created a playlist,

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:49.270
and somebody has
interacted with it.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:52.090
Somebody has liked it or
reposted it somewhere.

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:56.440
And so these kind of social
interactions, social signals--

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.665
or just new content.

00:39:57.665 --> 00:39:58.790
New content is a great one.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:00.920
And it definitely was
the highest performer

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.459
for SoundCloud in terms of
being able to tell people

00:40:04.459 --> 00:40:06.250
that, hey, there's new
music that you might

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:07.786
want to come and listen to.

00:40:07.786 --> 00:40:11.130
That was fantastic in
terms of performance.

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:14.650
So just to give you some idea,
with the new notifications

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:18.770
that we rolled out, we built
out five new notification types.

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:21.940
And between that
combination, we were

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:25.360
able to increase
retention by around 5%--

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:32.240
absolute percentage points,
which is pretty significant.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.380
So what did we actually build?

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:39.900
It's more than just
coding these notifications

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:42.190
to say, OK, tell the user
that something happened.

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:45.000
What we actually
wanted to build was

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.150
a measurement and experimental
framework around that such

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:51.537
that we're actually
able to test and iterate

00:40:51.537 --> 00:40:53.620
on these notifications,
and to measure the impact.

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:56.070
Measurement is really a
tough thing with retention.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:59.690
Because everything
affects retention.

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:01.150
Any product change
that you make is

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:02.730
likely to affect your retention.

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.270
Your acquisition mix will
also affect your attention.

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:10.450
So it's really important when
you're running any initiative

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:13.480
that you hope to improve
retention that you always

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.980
have some kind of
control group that

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:17.047
is not exposed to
whatever change

00:41:17.047 --> 00:41:18.130
that you're going to make.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:20.232
And that control
group is basically

00:41:20.232 --> 00:41:21.690
representing
everything else that's

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:22.731
going on in the platform.

00:41:22.731 --> 00:41:25.650
Because it's quite a
volatile number typically.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.670
So we always had a
group of users who never

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:30.300
received any notifications.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:34.110
And then we would test our new
notifications with test groups

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:38.290
and A/B test all the while
with copy, with timing,

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:42.400
with the different kind
of mix and combination

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.770
of notifications
that we would send.

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:46.940
So there's a lot of
experiments to run.

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.569
And just as Max was
saying, it's something

00:41:49.569 --> 00:41:50.610
that's never really done.

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:53.460
It's never really finished.

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:56.710
So yeah, SoundCloud
will continue

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:58.420
to iterate on these
notifications,

00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:59.400
to build out new types.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.560
And I think the next
phase, now that we

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.550
have a pretty cool
notification system,

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:09.160
is that they'll start to
add a layer of intelligence

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.230
on top of that,
so getting smarter

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:14.740
about optimizing for
relevance of notifications,

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:17.800
which is super important.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.650
And so sort of final
points just on how

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:22.840
to build good
notifications-- it's

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.144
really all about
personalization.

00:42:25.144 --> 00:42:26.560
And again, this
kind of comes back

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.400
to the point about iteration.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:33.750
So we have a
reactivation notification

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:36.610
that we send to users
when we haven't seen them

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:39.940
in the app for five
days at SoundCloud.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:43.000
Because we figured out--
again, through testing--

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.610
that five days was a good
time to interact with the user

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:48.250
before they're really
likely to churn completely.

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:52.420
But they're already sort of at
risk of churn at that point.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.900
So we'd send them
a notification.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.130
And probably like
a lot of people

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.469
who start off with
re-activation,

00:42:58.469 --> 00:43:00.010
we started with
something very basic.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:04.300
It was like, hey, come back and
find more music on SoundCloud--

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:08.730
basically just a very generic,
we miss you, kind of message.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:12.690
Yeah, perhaps unsurprisingly,
the click rate was super poor.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:14.920
The impact was
still worth having.

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.507
But it was pretty minimal.

00:43:17.507 --> 00:43:19.590
And so we thought, OK, how
can we iterate on that?

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:23.670
So what we ended up with,
which is performing way better,

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.560
was kind of a three-tiered
approach, where we look at, OK,

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.790
has this user shown some kind
of engagement within the app

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:33.750
that we can use in our
re-activation message?

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:36.879
So we looked at, has
a user liked a track?

00:43:36.879 --> 00:43:38.920
Because that's a really
high level of engagement,

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.880
if they've actually
hit the Like button.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.550
And so if a user liked
a track in the past,

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:46.320
we look at the last
track that they liked.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.340
And in that
re-activation message,

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:52.497
we say, hey-- not just come
back and find some more music

00:43:52.497 --> 00:43:53.080
on SoundCloud.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.205
But we say, hey, come back
and find some more music

00:43:55.205 --> 00:43:59.170
from Artist X-- Artist X
being the creator of the track

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:00.840
that they liked.

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.691
And if they haven't
liked a track,

00:44:02.691 --> 00:44:04.690
then we look at the last
track that they played.

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:05.880
And we use that as a signal.

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.463
And we personalize
it in the same way.

00:44:07.463 --> 00:44:10.000
So if I listened to a Britney
Spears track as my last track,

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.041
then we'd say, hey, come
back and find more music

00:44:12.041 --> 00:44:13.360
from Britney Spears.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:17.380
And we found that by using what
you know about the user's usage

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:21.880
history in those messages, you
can really increase the click

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.110
rate dramatically.

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:26.050
I think it was something like a
5x increase in our click rate,

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:29.800
albeit from a very low base.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.222
Yeah, time of day can
also be pretty important.

00:44:32.222 --> 00:44:34.990
It's probably a good idea not
to be sending push notifications

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:38.087
to people in the
middle of the night.

00:44:38.087 --> 00:44:39.920
Of course, if it's a
real-time notification,

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.770
if it's important
enough, maybe some people

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:43.650
want to be woken up.

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:47.750
But yeah, again, it's
something to test.

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.640
And yeah, really
importantly-- also

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.380
to give users granular
control over notifications.

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:56.860
If they can just opt in or out
of notifications in general,

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.729
that's going to really
limit your boldness

00:45:00.729 --> 00:45:02.020
when you're testing new things.

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.306
Because you'll be worried
about people opting out

00:45:04.306 --> 00:45:05.680
of push notifications
altogether,

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.340
which is a valid concern.

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.270
If you give users
the option to opt out

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:13.010
of every individual
class of notifications--

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:16.110
so in other words, say I want
to be told about new tracks.

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:17.980
But I don't care if
people are following me.

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.500
I don't want to be
notified about that.

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.920
By giving people that
granular level of control,

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.230
you can be more experimental
and try bigger ideas.

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:28.530
Because it's likely that
they'll just opt out

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:30.190
of that particular
type of notification

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:31.870
rather than all of
your notifications.

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:37.555
So you can minimize and mitigate
against negative impact.

00:45:37.555 --> 00:45:38.500
Yeah, that's it.

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:42.300
That's my short lessons
learned on building an activity

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:44.090
notification system.

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:45.280
And thanks very much.

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.080
