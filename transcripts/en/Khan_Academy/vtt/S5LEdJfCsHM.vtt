00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:02.494
- [Voiceover] So, this is a
fun deductive reasoning problem

00:00:02.494 --> 00:00:04.769
that's being forwarded
around the Internet.

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:06.679
Several people have
actually forwarded it to me,

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:08.934
and so, I thought it would be
a fun thing to work through.

00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:11.819
The grammar isn't perfect,
but the problem is a fun one.

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:13.465
So, it says Albert and Bernard just,

00:00:13.465 --> 00:00:16.045
it should say became friends with Cheryl

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:18.466
and they wanted to know
when her birthday is.

00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.965
Cheryl gives them a list
of 10 possible dates

00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:22.590
and we have our 10 dates here.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.028
Cheryl then tells Albert and
Bernard separately the month

00:00:25.028 --> 00:00:28.260
and the day of her birthday, respectively.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.636
So, just to make sure we're
parsing that sentence correctly,

00:00:30.636 --> 00:00:32.464
she gives Albert,

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:36.734
she tells Albert the
month of her birthday.

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:39.146
And she gives Bernard, she gives Bernard,

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:41.526
the day of her birthday.

00:00:41.526 --> 00:00:44.870
And, I think we, it's fair
to assume that Albert knows,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.455
he's been given the month and he knows

00:00:46.455 --> 00:00:48.203
that Bernard's been given the day.

00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:50.487
And Bernard's been given the
day and he knows that Albert

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:51.866
has been given the month.

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.226
And we should also assume
that they are good logicians.

00:00:54.226 --> 00:00:57.002
That they are going to
do very logical things.

00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:58.927
And then, we have this dialogue.

00:00:58.927 --> 00:01:01.629
Albert says, I don't know
when Cheryl's birthday is,

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.352
but I know that Bernard does not know too.

00:01:04.352 --> 00:01:05.449
That's fascinating.

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.279
And then, Bernard says,

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:10.439
at first I didn't know
when Cheryl's birthday is,

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.002
but now I know, but now I know.

00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:15.867
Fascinating, and then Albert says,

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:18.726
then I also know when
Cheryl's birthday is.

00:01:18.726 --> 00:01:21.682
So, when is Cheryl's birthday?

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:23.795
So like always, pause the video.

00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:26.186
See if you can work
through this on your own.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.013
It's a fun problem to tackle,

00:01:28.013 --> 00:01:29.475
and I'll give you a little bit of a hint.

00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:32.178
Diagram out, write the
information that each,

00:01:32.178 --> 00:01:34.006
that Albert knows and
how does the world look

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:35.327
from Albert's point of view.

00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:36.485
And then, write out how the world looks

00:01:36.485 --> 00:01:38.781
from Bernard's point of
view and then tell us,

00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:40.540
and then think about what these,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.779
what you can deduce from these sentences.

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:45.837
So, I'm assuming you've had a go at it,

00:01:45.837 --> 00:01:46.917
so let's just do what I just said.

00:01:46.917 --> 00:01:48.644
Let's diagram out the world from each

00:01:48.644 --> 00:01:50.289
of their points of view.

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.862
First, from Albert's point
of view, A for Albert.

00:01:53.862 --> 00:01:55.997
So, he's been given the month.

00:01:55.997 --> 00:02:00.017
so he's been given either
May, and if it's May,

00:02:00.017 --> 00:02:02.248
he says, well then if
it's May it's gonna be,

00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:04.554
the actual day is gonna be 15, 16, or 7,

00:02:04.554 --> 00:02:09.554
the 15th, 16th or 19th,
15th, 16th or 19th.

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:13.270
He was told, or he was
told the month June.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.155
And if he was told the
month of June, then he says,

00:02:16.155 --> 00:02:21.000
well I don't know if the
date is 17 or 18, 17 or 18.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.871
If he was told the month of
July, if he was told July,

00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:26.738
he'd say, well I don't
know whether the date is

00:02:26.738 --> 00:02:28.995
the 14th or the 16th.

00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:31.475
And if he was told the month August,

00:02:31.475 --> 00:02:32.835
if he was told the month August,

00:02:32.835 --> 00:02:34.050
he'd be thinking to himself,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.514
well, the date's either gonna be

00:02:35.514 --> 00:02:39.803
the 14th, the 15th, or the 17th.

00:02:39.803 --> 00:02:40.859
Now, let's think about the world

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.135
from Bernard's point of view.

00:02:43.135 --> 00:02:46.752
&gt;From Bernard's point of view,
he's been given the date.

00:02:46.752 --> 00:02:49.271
So, if he's been given the date the 14th,

00:02:49.271 --> 00:02:51.912
if he was told the
14th, then he would say,

00:02:51.912 --> 00:02:54.167
all right, let's see, May's not an option.

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:56.942
June wouldn't be an option,
July would be an option

00:02:56.942 --> 00:02:59.421
and August would be an option,
'cause there's a July 14.

00:02:59.421 --> 00:03:00.416
and an August 14.

00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:02.427
There's no May 14th or June 14th.

00:03:02.427 --> 00:03:04.256
So he would say, well, I'm not sure.

00:03:04.256 --> 00:03:05.477
If he was told it was the 14th,

00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:09.781
then it's either gonna be July or August.

00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:13.662
If he was told the 15th,
then it would be, let's see,

00:03:13.662 --> 00:03:16.140
May would be an option,
there's a May 15th here,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.619
or August would be an
option, there's no June 15th

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:20.205
or July 15th here.

00:03:20.205 --> 00:03:24.145
So, May, May or August.

00:03:24.145 --> 00:03:27.599
If he was told the 16th, let's
see what are the options?

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.651
It could be May,

00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:31.928
there's a May 16th as one of the options.

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:35.585
There's no June 16th,
there is a July 16th.

00:03:35.585 --> 00:03:37.311
So he'd say maybe it's July.

00:03:37.311 --> 00:03:39.831
And there's no August 16th either.

00:03:39.831 --> 00:03:42.695
If he was told, it's a 17th,

00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:44.361
if he was told it's the 17th,

00:03:44.361 --> 00:03:45.620
he could say, well it's
not gonna be in May,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.657
there's no May 17th.

00:03:46.657 --> 00:03:49.216
There is a June 17th.

00:03:49.216 --> 00:03:51.309
There is a June 17th.

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:55.190
There's no July 17th, but
there is an August 17th.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.909
So, there is an August, there is,

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.371
I'll just write Aug for short.

00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:02.727
There is an August 17th.

00:04:02.727 --> 00:04:05.287
And then, if he was told an
18th, he would say, let's see,

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:08.233
there's no May 18th, there is a June 18th,

00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:10.529
and I think that's the only
18th that we have here.

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:13.069
So, if he was told that
the day is the 18th,

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.620
then he would know, he would
know that the month is June.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.796
And, if he was told that
the day is the 19th,

00:04:19.796 --> 00:04:24.722
then up here, the only
19th here is May 19th,

00:04:24.722 --> 00:04:26.945
May, May 19th.

00:04:26.945 --> 00:04:28.735
So, if Bernard, Bernard's interesting.

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:31.181
If he was told the 18th or the 19th,

00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:34.269
then he would know what the month is.

00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:35.529
So, with this out of the way,

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:37.398
and if you're getting
inspired, I encourage you

00:04:37.398 --> 00:04:38.861
to pause the video again and see

00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:40.649
if you could work
through these statements,

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:43.615
but now let's work through the statements.

00:04:43.615 --> 00:04:46.216
So, Albert says, I don't know
when Cheryl's birthday is,

00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:47.333
which makes sense 'cause no matter

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:48.613
what month he's been given here,

00:04:48.613 --> 00:04:51.437
there's multiple options
for each of those months,

00:04:51.437 --> 00:04:52.656
so it makes sense that he doesn't know

00:04:52.656 --> 00:04:54.345
when Cheryl's birthday is.

00:04:54.345 --> 00:04:59.345
But, I know, I know that
Bernard does not know too.

00:04:59.503 --> 00:05:01.352
So how could he be so confident

00:05:01.352 --> 00:05:03.932
that Bernard does not know too?

00:05:03.932 --> 00:05:06.228
Well, Albert has the same information

00:05:06.228 --> 00:05:10.555
that we have right over here
and Albert says well look,

00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:15.555
if the date, if Bernard
was given an 18 or a 19,

00:05:16.145 --> 00:05:20.389
then he would know for sure
that Bernard does know the date.

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.111
So, the only way that
he can feel confident,

00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:25.185
the only way that he can
feel confident that Bernard,

00:05:25.185 --> 00:05:26.301
the only way he could say,

00:05:26.301 --> 00:05:30.904
I know that Bernard does not know too,

00:05:30.904 --> 00:05:33.708
means that Albert knows that Bernard

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:36.267
did not get an 18th or 19th.

00:05:36.267 --> 00:05:39.193
So, another way to
translate this statement is,

00:05:39.193 --> 00:05:43.744
Bernard did not get an 18th or 19th.

00:05:43.744 --> 00:05:47.828
Bernard not get

00:05:47.828 --> 00:05:52.562
18th or 19th.

00:05:52.562 --> 00:05:54.370
Now how can Albert be so confident

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.499
that Bernard did not get an 18th or 19th?

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:00.851
Well, Albert knows,
Albert knows the month,

00:06:00.851 --> 00:06:02.172
Albert knows the month.

00:06:02.172 --> 00:06:04.549
And if he's so confident that Bernard

00:06:04.549 --> 00:06:06.438
did not get an 18th or 19th,

00:06:06.438 --> 00:06:09.059
that's because he knows
it's not May or June.

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:12.130
If the month that Albert got
was May, then he would say,

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.796
oh maybe he did get an 19th here,

00:06:13.796 --> 00:06:15.564
in which I can't, couldn't
make the statement.

00:06:15.564 --> 00:06:17.433
Or, if the month was June, well then 18th

00:06:17.433 --> 00:06:20.074
would've been a possibility
for what Bernard got.

00:06:20.074 --> 00:06:21.620
And so, he wouldn't have been able

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.286
to make this statement here.

00:06:23.286 --> 00:06:24.485
But because he says,

00:06:24.485 --> 00:06:28.020
I know that Bernard does not know too,

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.174
the reason why he can say that is because

00:06:30.174 --> 00:06:32.795
he knows it's not May or June.

00:06:32.795 --> 00:06:34.016
So we can rule out,

00:06:34.016 --> 00:06:37.733
we can rule out May or June.

00:06:37.733 --> 00:06:39.377
So we can rule out,

00:06:39.377 --> 00:06:42.811
we can rule out the 18th, the 19th here,

00:06:42.811 --> 00:06:45.838
and we can also rule out May
or June now from Bernard.

00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:47.466
Now from Bernard's point
of view, we can say look,

00:06:47.466 --> 00:06:49.170
Albert was, the only
reason why he was able

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.568
to make that statement
is because Albert knows

00:06:51.568 --> 00:06:54.148
that the month is not May or June.

00:06:54.148 --> 00:06:56.850
So, let me rule out all
of the Mays and Junes.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.435
So, let me rule out June here.

00:06:58.435 --> 00:07:02.742
Let me rule out, let me
rule out May over here.

00:07:02.742 --> 00:07:05.485
Now I think you see where this is going.

00:07:05.485 --> 00:07:07.252
Now Bernard, and once again, at any point,

00:07:07.252 --> 00:07:11.448
if you get so inspired,
please pause the video

00:07:11.448 --> 00:07:13.520
and continue on with
the deductive reasoning

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.287
that we have started.

00:07:15.287 --> 00:07:17.969
All right, now Bernard says,

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:22.175
At first, I didn't know
when Cheryl's birthday is.

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:24.958
Which is fair because it
wasn't the 18th or 19th

00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.523
which Albert already knew.

00:07:26.523 --> 00:07:29.024
But now I know.

00:07:29.024 --> 00:07:31.033
So, now I know.

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:34.304
So before he didn't
know, but now he knows.

00:07:34.304 --> 00:07:37.717
So, if now he knows, what
are the possibilities?

00:07:37.717 --> 00:07:42.187
What are the possibilities going on here?

00:07:42.187 --> 00:07:46.352
So he knows if the date
he was given is the 17th,

00:07:46.352 --> 00:07:47.835
we've been able to, then
he could deduce that,

00:07:47.835 --> 00:07:49.420
hey, the month is now August.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.136
If the date he was given was the 16th,

00:07:51.136 --> 00:07:53.483
the month that he could
now deduce is July.

00:07:53.483 --> 00:07:55.475
If the date he was given was the 15th,

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.547
he could deduce August.

00:07:57.547 --> 00:07:59.498
But if the date he was given was 14th,

00:07:59.498 --> 00:08:01.652
he still wouldn't know what the month is.

00:08:01.652 --> 00:08:03.540
It could still be July or August.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.511
So we could rule out the 14th,

00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:08.449
'cause if the date he
was given was the 14th

00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:09.707
he still wouldn't know.

00:08:09.707 --> 00:08:11.454
But he says, now I do know.

00:08:11.454 --> 00:08:13.404
So we could rule out the 14th.

00:08:13.404 --> 00:08:15.924
And once again, we're assuming
Albert is hearing everything.

00:08:15.924 --> 00:08:18.504
Albert and Bernard,
they both could kind of

00:08:18.504 --> 00:08:20.961
draw these diagrams out.

00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:23.682
And so Albert could now say, okay, look,

00:08:23.682 --> 00:08:28.051
if he now knows, then the date
couldn't have been the 14th.

00:08:28.051 --> 00:08:30.407
So then he rules out the 14th.

00:08:30.407 --> 00:08:32.398
He rules out the 14th.

00:08:32.398 --> 00:08:34.816
So the stuff in orange that I just did

00:08:34.816 --> 00:08:36.992
I got from this statement there.

00:08:36.992 --> 00:08:38.026
And then Albert says,

00:08:38.026 --> 00:08:41.419
then I also know when
Cheryl's birthday is.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.654
So, from Albert's point of view,

00:08:43.654 --> 00:08:45.949
the only way that he now
knows what the birthday is

00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:48.489
if the month he was given was August

00:08:48.489 --> 00:08:50.602
he still has two options there.

00:08:50.602 --> 00:08:53.304
But he says he now knows
when Cheryl's birthday is.

00:08:53.304 --> 00:08:55.925
So it can't be August because
all the deductive reasoning

00:08:55.925 --> 00:08:57.972
we've just now done,
if he was given August

00:08:57.972 --> 00:08:59.191
then he would still not know

00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:01.345
whether it was the 15th or 16th.

00:09:01.345 --> 00:09:03.295
But now that he knows, it must be July.

00:09:03.295 --> 00:09:05.184
Because if he was given the month July,

00:09:05.184 --> 00:09:08.029
there's only one option now for the date.

00:09:08.029 --> 00:09:13.029
So therefore, the date must be July 16th.

00:09:13.647 --> 00:09:15.924
Albert must have been given July,

00:09:15.924 --> 00:09:17.934
Albert must have been given July.

00:09:17.934 --> 00:09:20.108
And Bernard must have been given,

00:09:20.108 --> 00:09:22.322
must have been given the 16th.

00:09:22.322 --> 00:09:25.474
So Cheryl was born on July 16th.

00:09:25.474 --> 00:09:27.347
Lots of fun.
