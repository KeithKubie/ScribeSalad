a lot of people like to talk about

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420
a lot of people like to talk about
 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.850
a lot of people like to talk about
multivitamins and how they're an

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:07.860
multivitamins and how they're an
 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.010
multivitamins and how they're an
insurance policy and it's almost

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.020
insurance policy and it's almost
 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.660
insurance policy and it's almost
confused me as a doctor I mean you

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670
confused me as a doctor I mean you
 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.190
confused me as a doctor I mean you
really think there's an insurance policy

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200
really think there's an insurance policy
 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.320
really think there's an insurance policy
for not eating well or not exercising

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330
for not eating well or not exercising
 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.359
for not eating well or not exercising
and moving your body or not living in a

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369
and moving your body or not living in a
 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.249
and moving your body or not living in a
compassionate and peaceful way there's

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:19.259
compassionate and peaceful way there's
 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.260
compassionate and peaceful way there's
there's no insurance policy for that and

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
there's no insurance policy for that and
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.060
there's no insurance policy for that and
you don't eat well you get sick and

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070
you don't eat well you get sick and
 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.439
you don't eat well you get sick and
that's one of the reasons that I really

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449
that's one of the reasons that I really
 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.480
that's one of the reasons that I really
promote a food first philosophy that

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490
promote a food first philosophy that
 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.769
promote a food first philosophy that
certainly if people have a deficiency

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779
certainly if people have a deficiency
 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.939
certainly if people have a deficiency
for example if you have an illness like

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949
for example if you have an illness like
 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.650
for example if you have an illness like
pernicious anemia where your body

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660
pernicious anemia where your body
 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.229
pernicious anemia where your body
doesn't allow you to absorb b12 of

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239
doesn't allow you to absorb b12 of
 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.880
doesn't allow you to absorb b12 of
course you have to take a b12 supplement

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
course you have to take a b12 supplement
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.560
course you have to take a b12 supplement
or if you're severely iron deficient

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
or if you're severely iron deficient
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.290
or if you're severely iron deficient
take an iron supplement but over the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300
take an iron supplement but over the
 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.060
take an iron supplement but over the
long term what we really want to see is

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
long term what we really want to see is
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.040
long term what we really want to see is
that that people are getting their

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050
that that people are getting their
 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.840
that that people are getting their
nutrients from food so some of the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850
nutrients from food so some of the
 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.520
nutrients from food so some of the
reasons for this aren't about nutrition

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530
reasons for this aren't about nutrition
 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.410
reasons for this aren't about nutrition
they're about community that when you're

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420
they're about community that when you're
 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.760
they're about community that when you're
engaged with your food and your food

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770
engaged with your food and your food
 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.170

supply when for example you go to a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
supply when for example you go to a
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.000
supply when for example you go to a
farmers market or if you have kids if

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010
farmers market or if you have kids if
 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.560
farmers market or if you have kids if
you take them to a farm and teach them

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
you take them to a farm and teach them
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.450
you take them to a farm and teach them
about where our food comes from that

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
about where our food comes from that
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.580
about where our food comes from that
really creates a different philosophy or

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590
really creates a different philosophy or
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.590
really creates a different philosophy or
different mindset about nutrition and

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600
different mindset about nutrition and
 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.710
different mindset about nutrition and
about how we nourish ourselves certainly

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
about how we nourish ourselves certainly
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.320
about how we nourish ourselves certainly
you can live on a multivitamin and you

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330
you can live on a multivitamin and you
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.969

that to me doesn't create a great meal

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
that to me doesn't create a great meal
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.210
that to me doesn't create a great meal
and that's really where I think I think

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
and that's really where I think I think
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.500
and that's really where I think I think
about my favorite health delivery system

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510
about my favorite health delivery system
 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.200

there are a host of we're called
 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.520
there are a host of we're called
phytonutrients or plant-based nutrients

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530
phytonutrients or plant-based nutrients
 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.259
phytonutrients or plant-based nutrients
and these are really the miracle

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269
and these are really the miracle

molecules of a Y plant-based diets are
 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.979
molecules of a Y plant-based diets are
just so incredibly good for our health

end of our fork into our DNA and change

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010
end of our fork into our DNA and change
 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.710
end of our fork into our DNA and change
how our genes get expressed and they

how our genes get expressed and they
 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.650
how our genes get expressed and they
turn on genes that keep us healthy so so

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660
turn on genes that keep us healthy so so
 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.720
turn on genes that keep us healthy so so
that's another way that the supplements

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730
that's another way that the supplements
 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.869
that's another way that the supplements
and real food differ as you get these

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879
and real food differ as you get these
 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.449
and real food differ as you get these
phytonutrients I like the idea that food

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459
phytonutrients I like the idea that food
 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.820
phytonutrients I like the idea that food
becomes a way of nourishing the self in

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830
becomes a way of nourishing the self in
 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.140
becomes a way of nourishing the self in
a way that a supplement really can't

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150
a way that a supplement really can't
 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.339
a way that a supplement really can't
there are a lot of beliefs and

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349
there are a lot of beliefs and
 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.920
there are a lot of beliefs and
supplements but but really you can get

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930
supplements but but really you can get
 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.300
supplements but but really you can get
