00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.690
- Welcome back, everybody.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.430
This is the final panel of
our conference The Gendered

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.180
Politics of New Nationalisms.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.880
And I'm just going
to briefly introduce

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.630
our moderator for this panel.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.140
And we're very
lucky to have him.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.210
David Gergen is a public service
professor of public leadership

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.970
and also serves as Faculty
Director of the Center

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.750
for Public Leadership at
Harvard's Kennedy School.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.030
These are positions he has
held for over a decade.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.370
He also serves as a senior
political analyst for CNN

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.750
and works actively with a rising
generation of new leaders here

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.400
and around the world.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.280
In the past, he has served
as White House Advisor

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.390
to four US presidents
of both parties.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.190
And he wrote about
those experiences

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.450
in his New York Times best
seller, Eyewitness to Power,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.690
the Essence of Leadership
Nixon to Clinton.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.400
We're honored and thrilled
to have him with us today.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.850
And so let me turn it over
the panel to David Gergen.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.350
- Thank you.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.560
- Good afternoon.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.230
And thank you.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.090
And thank you for the privilege
of coming to participate.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.650
It really to listen to
our four distinguished

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.870
speakers I want
to acknowledge up

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.300
front I've been unable
to come to the earlier

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.380
parts of this conference.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.920
So if I repeat something
that's been said earlier,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.380
please excuse.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.240
You had your first session on
rights and responsibilities,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.910
a very important
question, in part,

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.470
expanding rights in this
country for various people.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.240
Whenever there's
been a major conflict

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.150
in this country about expanding
suffrage, or expanding

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.210
the citizenship, usually, the
expansion forces have won.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.400
We need to keep
remembering that at a time

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.020
when so many are glooming
about what our prospects are.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.419
You then had a session
on walls and borders.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.590
I'm sure that Donald Trump
was trying to listen in

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.920
and to change the conversation.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.920
But it was an opportunity to
talk about who is in and who

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.210
was out, who belongs
and who doesn't.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.600
And this growing pushback
against immigration,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.820
against refugees,
against migrants,

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.120
and the troubles they're
facing, which I think

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.250
is an extraordinarily
important subject

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.120
on the world stage that
deserves much more urgency.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.520
Than it has received.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.760
The average time for a migrant
to go home or a refugee

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.980
to go home is 14 years.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.541
And people are
living in tent cities

00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:47.040
in which not only
are their children

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.190
are being born, but
their grandchildren.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.260
You know, so this issue is
very much front and center

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.500
around the world.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.250
You've just finished
up with a speaker who

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.630
told a very important story.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.290
And then finally, we
come to this issue--

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.700
building on the populism
theme of the last speaker,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.310
the keynote speaker--

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.490
about nationalism.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.100
And what is seen by
many now is a growing

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.730
clash between the
rise of nationalism

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.590
and the effort to empower women
and to ensure greater gender

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.220
equality.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.770
In country after
country, those issues

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.720
are coming smash up
against each other.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.800
So we have four
distinguished panelists.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.790
And I'm very pleased to
introduce upfront Joan

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.910
Williams, who is a
distinguished professor of law

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.070
at the Hastings School.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.020
And she's founding
director of the Center

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.670
for WorkLife Law at the UC
Hastings College of Law.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.220
She's helped create the
field of work family studies

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.890
and modern workplace
flexibility and policies.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.190
Joan wrote a piece in the
Harvard Business Review

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.280
that was entitled, What
So Many People Don't

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.340
Get About the US Working Class.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.800
What So Many People Don't Get
About the US Working Class.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.740
That article has been
highly influential.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.400
It is the most read piece in the
history of the Harvard Business

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.820
Review.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.240
I asked her if she was going
to give us a synopsis as part

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.470
of her presentation,
and she said,

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.420
I'm going to give an
incendiary synopsis.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.360
Joan, over to you.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.860
Thank you.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.335
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.550
- For Trump, everything is a
masculinity contest as when he

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.720
treated that his nuclear
button was much bigger and more

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.730
powerful than Kim Jong Un's.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.840
Are we talking about buttons?

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.930
I don't think so.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.280
Trump's truculence reflects
what social psychologists

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.080
call precarious masculinity,
the sense that manhood is not

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.620
a biological inevitability,
but something that

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.960
has to be earned over, and over,
and over again, and that it's

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.010
a zero sum game.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.030
So one man's is
the biggest around.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.360
In the US, this
anxious masculinity

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.200
proved reassuring, particularly
in the face of the, quote,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.300
witch as the alt-right
referred to Hillary Clinton.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.380
The witch, of course,
is the deadly stereotype

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.670
that justified the murder
of over 10,000 women

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.240
in early modern Europe, many
of them targeted because they

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.540
were widows with property.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.770
And so were seen of subversive
as then of the natural gender

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.310
hierarchy.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.310
But the interesting
issue is not Trump,

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.600
it's the otherwise sensible
people who voted for him.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.390
We voted with our
middle finger, said one

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.400
Trump, South Carolina voter.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.880
Trump's election
represented a collapse

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.870
of the Democratic Party among
the white working class,

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.070
especially men.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.250
And that's why four
crucial Rust Belt

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.310
states swung the 2016 election.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.290
We've all heard a
lot about the divide

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.000
between the 1% and the
99%, but the divide

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.935
that's driving
American politics today

00:06:47.935 --> 00:06:53.080
is a divide between the
professional managerial elite,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:58.520
the top 17%, and
middle class Americans,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.090
often called the
white working class.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.740
They're really the middle 53%.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.050
What are they so angry about?

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.690
Well, really, two things.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.380
This slide shows the first.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.650
It's the demise of
the American dream.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.100
Virtually all Americans
born in the 1940s

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.550
did better than their parents.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.070
But today, it's less than half.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.690
And class has been etched
into American geography, which

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:43.500
explains that ocean of red in
rural and Rust Belt America.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.840
Here's the 2016 election map.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:52.270
And you see the Democrats have
really become a regional party.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.440
The second reason why the
white working class is angry

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.450
is cultural.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.430
They feel disrespected.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.410
And for a very simple reason.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.360
They are.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.950
After 1970s, elites
stopped connecting

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.070
with Americans whom
prior generations gave

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.290
a place of honor.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:22.160
So here is the Coit Tower
murals painted in the 1930s.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.940
And you see how they celebrate
the nobility of blue collar

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.880
work.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:34.270
That was on the wane by 1970s
when Blue collar Archie Bunker,

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.809
of All in the Family,
was depicted as racist,

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:41.919
and sexist, stupid, and fat.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:45.880
Then came Homer
Simpson in the 1990s

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.440
who was amiable, but
also stupid and fat.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.540
And bringing it up
to the present day,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.530
think of Pennsatucky in
Orange is the New Black, who

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.890
was depicted as a white,
working class woman,

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:05.160
and we were invited to
laugh at her bad teeth.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.550
I enjoyed all three of
these shows, actually,

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:13.320
but this kind of thing
has played into the hands

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.810
of the far right.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:21.120
The alt-right also traffics
in precarious masculinity.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.730
They attack traditional
conservatives

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.860
as, quote, cucks, men who
raised the children of men

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.760
who have cuckolded them.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:36.140
Traditional conservatives
respond in kind,

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.530
insulting the
alt-right as, quote,

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:44.828
childless single men
who masturbate to anime.

00:09:44.828 --> 00:09:48.670
The alt-right is
not blue collar.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.850
Richard Spencer describes
the classic member

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:56.410
of his movement as someone
who, quote, is 30 years old,

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.340
who is a tech professional,
who is an atheist,

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.520
and who lives on
one of the coasts.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.820
Greg Johnson, another
alt-right leader

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.450
commented the alt-right
is drawing a higher

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.080
caliber of people than
earlier iterations

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.830
of American white nationalism
because the career

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:22.960
prospects of college educated
whites have declined.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.300
And a growing number
of young whites

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.560
are returning home to live
with their parents, remaining

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.290
unemployed or underemployed
for a long time.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.640
And their resentment grows.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:43.830
Again, the theme, whether
white collar or blue collar,

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.640
there's nothing quite
so dangerous as a man

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.610
without a future.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:55.670
We see this when suicide becomes
a career track for terrorists.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:01.040
We see it in the rise of
neo-nazis and anti-semites

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.500
at home.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.780
The alt-right is openly racist.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:11.980
Their goal is a White ethnostate
without people of color,

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.340
whether they were
born here or not.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.220
The question is how we can
peel of the economic anger

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:20.890
from the racism.

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.780
I suggest three steps.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:40.280
And I realize here that I have
completely screwed this up.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.530
OK.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.440
Going back.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.860
I have all the pages.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.360
They're just in the wrong order.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.290
- Story of our lives.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.430
- There you go.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:01.600
There you go.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.380
There you go.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.390
Let me see if I can--

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.797
well, I'll just improvise.

00:12:07.797 --> 00:12:08.630
You'll bear with me.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.180
One of the things that I
think we have to focus on--

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.230
well, I'm just going to read it.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:19.820
You'll do the math.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.350
I suggest three steps.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:26.540
One is to provide a middle
class standard of living instead

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:31.340
of our economy, in which we
have rich jobs for an ever

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.300
decreasing portion
of the high elite

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:39.620
and muck jobs for everyone else.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:43.810
The second is we need to
stop insulting people.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.300
We need to respect
people in blue collar

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.760
jobs for simple reasons.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.860
They're human beings.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.650
We are committed
to social equality.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.830
And they do important work.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:01.030
When you turn on the tap in the
morning to brush your teeth,

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:06.990
they're the reason water comes
out, not some Harvard grad.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:12.780
The third and most painful, we
need to reassess our attitudes

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.250
towards immigration.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:19.870
Today, progressives typically
use an empathetic human rights

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:26.030
lens for immigrants and
a judgmental neo-liberal,

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.690
the race goes to the
swift, and you're not it,

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:33.680
lens for the white
working class.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.110
And this is part of
a deeper dynamic.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:43.830
Today, elites in both
Europe and the United States

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:48.480
display their cosmopolitanism
as a class act,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.780
a way of enacting
elite class status.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.430
We're cosmopolitan because
we went to college, where

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.440
we formed global networks.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.440
And our job markets are global.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.470
That's just not true
of middle class people.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.800
It's not true of any non-elites.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.500
Their networks are very local.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.240
They're very rooted.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.950
They're much more focused than
we are on community rather than

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.250
just individual achievement.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:24.760
And you know, everyone tends
to stress the high status

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.650
social categories
they belong to.

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.190
That's why we cherish
our classiness

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:36.400
by displaying cosmopolitanism.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.990
Middle class Americans,
on the other hand,

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:42.460
are very proud of
being Americans.

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:47.140
After all, that's one of the
only high status categories

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.982
they belong to.

00:14:48.982 --> 00:14:55.860
To them, talk of open borders
shows a shocking and hurtful

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:59.550
lack of social solidarity.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:03.810
And that's true of the
women as well as of the men.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:08.340
Many people are shocked that
white working class women

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.430
went so heavily for Trump.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.040
White women without
college degrees

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.970
voted for Trump by
a 38 point margin.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:24.080
If they had just split 50/50,
Clinton would have won.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.950
I wasn't surprised they didn't
vote for Clinton, although I

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:33.190
voted for her and worked
endlessly for her.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:38.320
First, she failed to connect
with them because of her focus

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.540
on the glass ceiling.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.300
When you think about
it, the glass ceiling

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.300
is the metaphor that
stands for my right

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:50.320
to have as good a job
as my elite father.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.000
Why do they care?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.930
They don't.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.560
Meanwhile, she was handed
on a silver platter

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.460
sexual harassment through
the Access Hollywood tapes.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:07.250
That is an equal opportunity
gender disadvantage.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.210
She completely ignored it.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:21.230
So the reason that it is is
that, even if Clinton wasn't so

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.550
class clueless, she
was running uphill

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:29.870
because women in
blue collar families

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:35.180
suffer the same dignitary
affronts as same class men.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.510
They have the same pride
in being Americans.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:42.350
They have the same
sense of violation

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:47.660
when that pride is written
off as mere racism.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:52.570
Not to say that it's not
mixed often with racism,

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.670
but that's a different
issue from whether it

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.425
is only mere racism.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:05.810
And blue collar women feel the
same loss of blue collar jobs.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:09.280
And they feel it as
acutely as their men.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.089
Because the level of sex
segregation is sharply

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:15.630
decreased for the likes of us.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:19.520
It's sharply decreased
among professionals.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:26.089
But it's decreased very little
in the working class contexts.

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:29.470
And so they work
pink collar jobs.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:34.630
Have you ever tried to raise
a family on a pink collar job?

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.130
Not easy.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:40.850
And that's what these women
in blue collar families say.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:44.260
Quote, I voted for
my boyfriend's job,

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:48.280
said one Michigan Trump voter.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:52.060
The assumption that women would
vote for Clinton to help her

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:56.500
break the glass ceiling,
a supreme example

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.980
of class cluelessness.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.475
I don't know all the answers,
but I know one thing for sure.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.860
We do need to end
class cluelessness.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.260
It doesn't help immigrants.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.050
It doesn't help the
people of color.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:19.590
It doesn't help women
or the environment.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:23.127
The only thing it
helps is the far right.

00:18:23.127 --> 00:18:24.588
Thank you.

00:18:24.588 --> 00:18:27.023
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:37.610
- Thank you, Joan.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:42.440
And I hope we can find
your book easily here.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.180
Would you keep in
mind a question

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.750
I'd like to ask after
everyone has spoken

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.650
and that is, the place
of our universities

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:53.960
and solving this issue,
higher education is

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.340
under assault in this country.

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.150
The trust levels in higher
education have been plunging.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:04.390
And it is because of a
sense of elitism that

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:05.890
is seen by the working class.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.170
And I'd just like
to ask you when

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.870
we get back to the
questions about what

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.160
we can do about that?

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.380
How do we overcome and rebuild
trust with the working class

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.060
among our universities?

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:23.590
So now our next speaker
is Jan Willem Duyvendak--

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.920
I hope I didn't
butcher that too much--

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:30.940
who is a distinguished
research professor of sociology

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.980
at the University of Amsterdam.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:37.890
And since January 1,
I believe is correct,

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.900
has been the director of
the Netherlands Institute

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.780
for Advanced Study in the
Humanities and Social Science

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.870
at the Royal Netherlands
Academy of Arts and Sciences.

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:53.420
His main fields of research,
currently, are belonging--

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.550
that's what we've
been talking about--

00:19:55.550 --> 00:20:00.410
urban sociology, quote,
feeling at home, and nativism.

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.805
Thank you for joining us.

00:20:01.805 --> 00:20:03.785
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.490
- Good afternoon.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.640
Thanks so much, the
organizers of this conference,

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.540
for inviting me.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:28.970
I really feel honored to be part
of this fantastic conference.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.150
As a scholar, indeed,
of questions regarding

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.950
belonging, feeling at home,
nativism, nationalism,

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:38.780
populism, I love the
conference theme for sure.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.390
And I fully agree that
citizenship is about more

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.240
than just formal citizenship.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.610
But I'm not sure
whether the deep emotion

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.640
of feeling at home, the
deep emotion of belonging

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:54.020
should be part of our
understanding of citizenship.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.200
Don't get me wrong, it's
important for all of us

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.610
to feel at home somewhere.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:05.400
But feeling at home, belonging,
is a very particular emotion.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.480
When you really, truly
feel somewhere at home,

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.810
it often is an
exclusionary emotion.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.300
It's with some people
at some places.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.580
And that makes the emotion
as a political emotion very

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.220
difficult. So the
question I will answer

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:25.090
is, should citizenship be based
on those we feel at home with?

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.160
And that is a difficult
question to answer.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.950
My hesitation or my
skepticism about such

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.910
a more cultural or emotional
definition, sentimental

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.220
definition, of
citizenship is born out

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.340
of my study of my own country,
the Netherlands, which

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:41.920
I normally would
never speak about.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.020
It is an interesting, small,
tiny, not very important

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:45.950
country.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:47.690
But for today, it is important.

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:50.330
And I will explain
why it is important.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.900
Because in this very
particular country,

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.210
politicians-- nor
to public opinion--

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:59.030
doesn't stop speaking the
language of feeling at home.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.610
And particularly-- the white
people tell us all the time--

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:03.590
that they don't
feel at home anymore

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:06.110
in the country they live in.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.330
And this new nationalism
that's developed

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.330
is quite puzzling, because
this new nationalism is so much

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:15.900
based on the idea that we
have to share all our values,

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.600
norms, and feelings.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.540
And to be honest, those
feelings, those norms

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.700
and values, are rather
sympathetic to me

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.160
because they are progressive.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.800
As I will try to show in
the coming 12 minutes,

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.180
there might be progress, but
they are, at the same time,

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.340
highly exclusionary
towards those

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:39.320
we assume do not hear in those
same values and feelings.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.170
So let me try to explain that.

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.870
I'm not going to bother you
with a long history of this very

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:45.432
tiny country.

00:22:45.432 --> 00:22:47.390
Although, there are some
historical connections

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:50.640
between the Netherlands and US.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.910
There are many
misunderstandings out there.

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:55.820
Very briefly, some
scholars think

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.280
that the Dutch have pursued
multicultural policies.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.140
That's not true at all.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.240
What it's important
to realize is

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.660
that we indeed
have some laws that

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.860
stand for more than 100 years.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.860
They're never very
divided religiously.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:18.140
And how to live together
in a harmonious way

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.000
while being so different.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.930
And therefore, we had a societal
system called pillarization.

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:26.020
And everybody was locked
up in his own pillar.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.969
So Protestant pillar,
Roman Catholic pillar--

00:23:27.969 --> 00:23:29.760
and everybody had to
live in those pillars.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.450
And there were no connections,
no right to marry somebody

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.550
from the other pillar.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.520
And for a long time, that
worked, really, very well.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.920
But you have to understand
that this pillarization was

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.010
experienced over time,
more and more suffocating.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.260
You were locked up
in your own pillar.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.734
And you could not even
communicate with others.

00:23:47.734 --> 00:23:49.150
And what's important
to understand

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.830
is that the 1960s
were celebrated

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.650
in this very conservative,
pillarized country--

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.710
the Netherlands-- as an enormous
liberation because people

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.650
could break out of their
pillars and come into contact

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:03.410
with those of other pillars.

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:04.850
And there are very
few countries--

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:06.349
Michele Lamont told
me, perhaps it's

00:24:06.349 --> 00:24:07.610
the same is true for Quebec.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.110
But there are very few
countries, I think,

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:17.695
that saw such an enormous change
as it did during the late 1960s

00:24:17.695 --> 00:24:19.430
to early 1970s.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:23.720
Almost 50% of the
Dutch lost their faith

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.490
in a period of five years.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:27.790
Imagine what that
does to the country.

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:29.210
That's enormous.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.090
So that became a highly
secularized country,

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.360
celebrating sexual freedom,
and it materialized, also,

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.940
in all kinds of folk as if
laws, as you might know,

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.930
regarding euthanasia,
abortion, drug policies, and--

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:45.060
somewhat later-- gay marriage,
but the first in the world.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.020
So May '68 have far
more impact in Amsterdam

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.340
than it had in Paris, to
give a very short summary.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.440
And and that's interesting,
because the Netherlands,

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.510
being one of the most
conservative countries

00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:00.170
in Europe for a very long
time, became one of the most

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.060
progressive countries.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.360
And that is now even more
true than in the 1970s because

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.930
over the past decades,
also, populist parties,

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.150
Christian Democrats,
and right wing liberals

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:15.050
came to share into those liberal
and progressive consensus,

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:17.720
which is obviously, very
different from the situation

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.170
in the United States, and
in many other countries, UK,

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:23.690
France, and so on.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.930
So what happened was that we
were very divided in the 1960s.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.870
And now we have become
very consensual and not

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.060
hyper diverse.

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.430
And for a while, this
developing consensus

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:35.880
still respected differences.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.582
Some differences, some
tolerance was there.

00:25:38.582 --> 00:25:40.040
There was some,
let's say, tolerant

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.610
multiculturalism
towards newcomers, often

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.220
guest workers,
Muslim guest workers,

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:49.250
but also some tolerance towards
the orthodox Protestants

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:52.220
who still live in the
Netherlands who are

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.860
a rather small group now today.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.880
But today, particularly
the Muslim migrants

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.120
are not framed anymore,
are not tolerated anymore,

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.950
they are framed as intolerants.

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:06.580
And we don't have to be tolerant
towards those who are not

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.270
tolerant towards us, right?

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:12.800
So this is the intolerance
towards intolerance.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:19.400
In this self-image of the
Dutch, in this national story,

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:23.406
gender and sexuality
play a pivotal role.

00:26:23.406 --> 00:26:24.780
The parliament in
the Netherlands

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.760
doesn't stop talking
about sex and gender.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.230
It's all the time there.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.240
Whatever kind of debate
we have, it always

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.642
boils down to topics of
sexuality and gender.

00:26:33.642 --> 00:26:34.350
It's interesting.

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.766
I don't have time
to go into that.

00:26:35.766 --> 00:26:38.370
In some of the Western countries
where we see parallels,

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:41.880
it's more in the self-image
about gender equality.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.256
For instance,
Denmark and France.

00:26:43.256 --> 00:26:44.713
In the Netherlands,
it's more about

00:26:44.713 --> 00:26:46.120
sexuality and homosexuality.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.320
We can think why exactly
those differences are there.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.430
But it is important to realize
that nowadays, gender equality

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:58.200
and LGBT rights are considered
as the core of Dutchness,

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.319
also by the far right populist.

00:27:01.319 --> 00:27:03.610
Vilda-- you might have heard
about him-- of the Freedom

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:06.540
Party, he doesn't stop
talking about how proud he

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.900
is that we have gay
marriage, and also

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.660
the Christian
Democratic Parties.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.370
We can discuss more about
why the values of the 1960s

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:18.330
have become so important
in the Netherlands.

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:20.940
But for sure, in
the past 15 years,

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.780
the embrace of those
values by the populists,

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.920
and by the far right, and
by the liberal right wing,

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.630
American Christian Democrats,
has developed an opposition

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:30.850
to Muslims.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:35.370
That has been the core reasoning
and the logic is very simple.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.640
The enemy of my
enemy is my friend.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.370
And then there was
the idea that Muslims

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:42.950
can never care for
gender equality

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:46.300
or can never be LGBTI friendly.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:51.470
Other scholars, [INAUDIBLE],,
John Scott, [INAUDIBLE],,

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.030
have labeled this
development, as you

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:57.080
might know, as homo-nationalism
or female nationalism.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.760
Progressive forms
of nationalism that

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.880
put the women's movement
and the LGBT movement,

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.030
but also queer Muslims and
feminist movements in a very

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:06.860
difficult position,
because the moment

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.987
you mobilize for
those values, it

00:28:08.987 --> 00:28:10.820
looks as if you are
immediately anti-Muslim,

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:14.250
and the other way around.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:16.260
So the problem is--

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.470
it is fantastic, at
least in my perspective--

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.800
that progressive values
are broadly embraced,

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.660
but at whose expense?

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:25.720
I think we should
think about that.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.680
And what does it produce?

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.590
It produces a self image
as if the Dutch have always

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:37.100
been that progressive.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.620
So now, the story is that
since the 17th century,

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:44.440
the Dutch always embraced LGBT
rights and women's rights.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.540
And it is totally essentialized.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.081
It actually doesn't do much
justice to the history,

00:28:49.081 --> 00:28:50.455
as I already
explained to you, we

00:28:50.455 --> 00:28:52.246
were one of the most
conservative countries

00:28:52.246 --> 00:28:53.930
in Europe.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:57.700
And Muslims then are also
fixed in their identities.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.680
They're eternally backwards.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.890
They are unchangeable
and unchanging.

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:04.870
It means the rise of nativism.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:06.670
It means that some
people are considered

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.340
to be more truly Dutch
because they embrace

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.340
LGBT rights and women's rights.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.620
And those are then
the white Dutch.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.590
They consider themselves
as being the true Dutch

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.086
because they are so progressive.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.960
And that brings me
to my last slide.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.510
So I'm quite fine
on time, I guess.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:30.180
And it's somewhat linking
to the second panel

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.240
we had this morning.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.040
Why would it be an
important story?

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.270
I almost apologetically said,
we shouldn't talk too much

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:39.020
about Netherlands.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.620
But it's not just
about the Netherlands.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.310
There is a broader story here.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:46.250
And let me draw
four conclusions,

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:49.740
give four reasons why this
is an important story.

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.620
First of all, it's part
of a broader tendency

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.770
in which the most progressive
countries in Europe

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:58.740
become the most
migrant unfriendly.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:03.550
You might have heard how harsh
the Danish people, Denmark,

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.400
for example, has become.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.620
Another country, like
all the Nordic countries

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.290
that are always
outstandingly progressive,

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:13.950
have become very harsh and
don't want to accept migrants

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:16.880
so easily anymore.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.620
Second, why is it
an important story?

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.560
Because among the
Populist Party,

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:25.650
things are happening that you
might, perhaps, not expect.

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:30.570
Even though Trump also
sometimes mentions LGBTI rights

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:32.100
and women's rights--

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.530
obviously, for highly
opportunistic reasons--

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:37.890
but we have to understand
why populist parties are

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:40.070
embracing that discourse.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.070
And we see it happening.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:42.160
It started in Denmark.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.310
Then the Netherlands,
Germany, France.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.730
So almost all Western European
countries, these very strong

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:51.780
populist parties, are more in
this discourse in which they

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.210
claim modernity,
in which they claim

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:58.470
that the Judeo-Christian
tradition is about equality

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.545
for gender and sexual equality.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.220
It is, obviously,
then in the dynamic

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:10.660
of bashing Muslims in the
logic I already explained.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.860
The third reason why
this is important,

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:17.060
because it marginalizes
and isolates

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:19.430
Muslims or religious
minorities at large

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:21.830
in Western European countries.

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:24.650
They are depicted as totally
alien and as if they can never

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:27.110
become truly Dutch.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:29.930
And fourth, this is
important because this

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:33.875
translates and is part of
a world right polarization.

00:31:33.875 --> 00:31:36.710
A world right
polarization [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:41.600
spiraled from two sites,
briefly sketched, very sketchy.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.470
So the northwestern part
of the world and east south

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:48.890
part of the world, those
are opposing its order.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:50.810
And / most of the
Western countries,

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.740
then, are posing as modern,
and as LGBTI friendly,

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:58.230
and of course, in favor
of women's rights.

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:00.950
But they don't frame it
in terms of human rights,

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:02.270
universal human rights.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.580
No, those are Western
failures, right?

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:09.260
And the other side, Eastern
Europe, Russia, the Vatican,

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.180
Muslim majority countries,
they say, yes, you're right,

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:14.360
those are your values.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.640
We are proudly disagreeing.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.880
We are conservative.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.070
We are traditionals.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.590
We value family values
in the way we do it.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:23.600
And indeed, let's stop
discussing in terms

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.280
of universal human rights.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.520
So both sides are
reinforcing the idea

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:32.390
that we have only
very localized values

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:34.790
and that its roots
should remain like that.

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:37.050
And therefore, the changes
in those countries,

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:44.460
so well-discussed this morning,
are so difficult. To conclude,

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:49.230
what perhaps looks hopeful and
perhaps innocent progressive

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:50.330
dominance--

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:53.220
I can imagine you
are dreaming of it--

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.360
has a dark side.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.290
It has a dark side.

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:57.180
And we have to realize that.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.650
It has a dark side
in combination

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:02.280
with certain forms
of nationalism.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.150
Because gender and
sexuality are not defined--

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:09.390
equal rights for
women, for LGBTI--

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.000
anymore in terms of the
universal human rights.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.070
But only those
parts are supported

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:16.440
because that's part of
being Dutch, or being

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:20.130
German, or being Danish.

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:24.410
When citizenship becomes
dependent on feeling at home

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:28.140
with just those who are
exactly as progressive,

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:30.270
how inclusive are we, then?

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:32.940
I mean, that's the
question we ask ourselves

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:33.990
in the Netherlands.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:36.450
If you only want to live with
the people who are exactly

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:38.730
the same as we are, and
then it is not important

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:41.280
if it's progressive or
conservative, its the idea,

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.440
what is our notion
of citizenship?

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.660
And if you put
belonging central,

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:50.070
that is not necessarily
then very inclusive.

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:53.530
Aren't we losing our ability
to deal with differences

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:56.160
in, for instance, my country?

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.920
And is progress nationalism,
then, perhaps not

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.640
very counter-productive?

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.813
Thanks for your attention.

00:34:01.813 --> 00:34:03.745
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:11.840
- Thank you, Jen Willem.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.857
That was a head
twisting presentation.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.310
I think that it challenges
the conventional wisdom

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:25.190
that most of the authoritarian
strong man and the countries

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:26.989
that have been moving
to authoritarianism

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:29.770
have been led there by
more conservative forces

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:33.620
in the society not by people
who support women's empowerment,

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.449
or gay rights, or the rest.

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:39.590
So maybe we can explore that a
little more and the questions

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:40.880
to help us understand that.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:44.900
It was a fascinating set of
insights and propositions.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:48.889
I'd like, if we could, go deeper
on how it all works together

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:49.639
and how it fits.

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:51.860
And perhaps our next
speaker can also shed light

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:56.820
on that, Fatma Muge Gocek.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.570
She's a professor of
sociology and women's studies

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.180
at the University of Michigan.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.450
Her research focuses on
the comparative analysis

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:11.210
of history, politics, and gender
in the first and third worlds.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:12.980
She critically
analyzes the impact

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:16.280
of processes such as
development, nationalism,

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.590
religious movements,
and collective violence

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:19.850
on minorities.

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.920
She does come to us from
the University of Michigan,

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.450
but it's also notable that
she is from Turkey originally

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:29.400
and is very familiar with
what's going on in that country.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:34.430
And I think it fits very
nicely to compare and contrast

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.690
what we just heard
from Jen Willem.

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:39.260
But Fatma, thank you for coming.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:41.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:52.540
- Thank you very much for
inviting me here and enabling

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.180
me to share my views with you.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:36:02.080
Actually, I think it is
interesting when I heard

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:07.300
the title of the conference--
it said Who Belongs--

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:11.650
the first thought I had
was, where's my passport?

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:14.470
And I said, well, I have
my driver's license.

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.310
That ought to be enough.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:20.810
I'm saying that because I
think what I will have to say

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:23.770
relates to the two speakers
before because I've

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:27.140
spent half my life in Turkey
and the other half in the United

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.840
States.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:33.910
So at this point, I
would say that mine

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:39.880
is more of an in-betweeness,
between the two contexts.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:44.410
And all the sort of
talks up until now

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:47.320
has sort of triggered
in me and made

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:51.430
me realize that, yes, of
course, because of the subject

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:57.990
matter that I specialize
in, I do know social change

00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:59.980
with all of these
social movements

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:02.380
pretty well because
I work on it.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:06.730
But I also have some opinions
about the United States

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:08.560
because I have lived here.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.810
And I am also an
American citizen.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:14.740
So the reason I'm
bringing that up is,

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:18.850
I do not think that we have--

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:26.000
who belongs has this assumption
beneath that youth can only

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.450
belong to one place
and not another.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:32.300
What about people who belong--

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:37.100
or who think they belong--
to more than one place.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.470
That, I think, is the problem.

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:44.600
I mean, I have this notion
I'm working on called

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.850
ontological nationalism.

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:49.820
Ontology meaning social reality.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:54.560
I think what's very significant
about nationalism is that you

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:58.320
either have one social reality
or you have another one,

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.200
but you cannot have
both at the same time.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.720
Why am I saying that?

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.750
When I first came
to this country,

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:11.120
I was very miserable
not because of--

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.000
I mean, I came in
incredible conditions

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.550
to do a PhD at an Ivy
League school and all

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:21.860
that-- but what was important
was I thought about Turkey

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:26.090
and I was so sad about how
many resources there were

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:29.150
and how much of it
was being squandered.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:31.700
It was so sad they
didn't exist in Turkey.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:35.180
So when I went back to Turkey,
I would be miserable there

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.951
and say, oh my god, there are
all these brilliant people

00:38:37.951 --> 00:38:38.450
here.

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:40.400
And you know, there
are no resources.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.720
And then I realized
after a while

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.620
of living in both societies--

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.910
which I've done
now half and half--

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:50.460
I don't belong to
any either one.

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.660
I mean, I no longer
am considered Turkish

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:57.530
even though I'm ethnically
Turkish for generations.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:00.650
Because in this day of
ethnic nationalism in Turkey,

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:02.510
that ought to be something.

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:07.400
But I lost that's when I started
working on the Armenian issue.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.010
And I looked and
wrote a book on why

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.620
the Armenian Genocide and
the collective violence

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:17.180
against the Armenians has
been denied by Turkish state

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:20.300
and society for 220 years.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:23.930
As a consequence of which,
everybody was sure that I was

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:28.580
of Armenian origin because they
cannot imagine that I could be

00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:34.070
an ethnic Turk, which tells
you about this ontological

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:36.920
nationalism that
I'm talking about.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:40.110
And then of course, I came here.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:44.180
And when I was
here, as I said, I

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:47.300
live here, I have had a
lot of experience here,

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.220
I have actually lived
here more than I

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:53.870
have in Turkey at this
point, but I am still seen

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:55.790
as Turkish to a certain degree.

00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:57.770
And this, I think,
is what we ought

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:03.710
to think about when we
think about, what is it?

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:06.920
We have to look at the
assumptions of whiteness,

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:12.440
not only in terms of exclusion,
but in terms of inclusion,

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.510
or resisting that inclusion.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:19.800
Because obviously, I speak
English with an accent.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.830
So I would they would
say to me, oh, you know,

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:24.200
wonderful, I'm
great, and all that.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.880
And they say,
where are you from?

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.550
I'm now in Ann Arbor.

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:31.650
I would say New Jersey because
I came to Princeton, right?

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:35.540
I mean, but it's a test.

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:40.220
So then they would say,
where are you really from?

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:44.070
So I would say yes
because I'm not going to--

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:47.840
I mean, I refuse to have
them pigeon hole me.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:52.310
It's actually very
interesting about the person,

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:56.690
the author who was talking,
she refused to be pigeonholed.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:58.610
But I think that's
something that

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:04.550
comes from those of us who have
lived in more than one context.

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:08.420
That is, I think, the vision
of the future that will get us

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.400
beyond multiculturalism.

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:15.350
But in order to get, basically,
insight into how that would

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:17.840
work, I don't only
look at Turkey,

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.540
I also look at
the United States.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:25.460
Who do you think inspires me in
the United States, you may ask.

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:33.020
I would say WEB Dubois is my
amazing hero at the moment

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:38.230
because only he
captures what I feel

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:41.140
through his notion of
double consciousness.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:45.850
I mean, of course,
I will never presume

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:49.450
to have the violent past
that African-Americans

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:51.020
have had in this country.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.690
That's not what I meant.

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:56.770
But I mean in terms of
belonging and not belonging.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:00.430
And that, of course, makes
me think at the same time

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:05.890
that, how is it that we can
go beyond this ontological

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:08.650
nationalism that
leaves people out,

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:12.160
that doesn't leave
spaces for people?

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.670
I mean, that is the
polarization that's leading us.

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:20.560
At least the other view, they
enabled you to still continue

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.600
living in that society.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:25.660
When you have
ontological nationalism,

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:29.090
they want you to disappear.

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:30.850
They want to send you back.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:34.360
They don't allow that
space for you even here.

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.040
Where does that come from?

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:41.410
I mean, I will talk in more
detail about what is in Turkey.

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:44.740
But because I have
lived in both societies,

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:49.090
I always ask the same
questions of both societies

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:51.280
because I don't think
it is fair for me

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:54.790
to be only critical
in one or the other.

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:57.910
I have to be able to ask
the same questions in both.

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:04.390
And of course, I
am very informed,

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:08.350
let's say, by critical race
theory and feminist theory.

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:13.390
As a consequence, the insights
I have in analyzing and teaching

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:17.230
my students here-- most of
whom, of course, are Americans--

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:22.030
belong to and necessitate that
I know about American history.

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:25.150
But by specialization
on the Middle East,

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:27.490
also, it necessitates
that I know there.

00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:29.710
And of course, my
own experiences

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:31.740
in the first half
of my life enabled

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.940
me to also know that context.

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:37.090
If you look into
the United States,

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:43.780
I think we have to have a
total reinterpretation of what

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.960
it is to belong into
the United States.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.560
And I would do that
on two grounds.

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:53.980
One is, of course, the
grounds of intersectionality,

00:43:53.980 --> 00:44:01.460
that first was developed
by Patricia Hill Collins'

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:02.760
matrix of domination.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.780
And then, developed by King
Berkeley [INAUDIBLE] notion

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:11.460
of, you get public visibility,
in that case, for black women,

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:14.310
because they are excluded
from the civil rights

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:16.850
movement for being
women and from the

00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:22.710
for the feminist
movement for being black.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:28.320
I mean, the argument there
is you have to look at it

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:31.470
not only one category
in a society,

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:33.570
you have to look
at the intersection

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:36.960
of multiple categories
to see the inequality

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.570
in power relations
that are hidden there.

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:41.740
So that is one insight.

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:46.740
And if you do that, I think, as
we saw with the working class,

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:49.710
you see the variation.

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:52.500
I like the fact that you
said white working class,

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.740
because I think that has
very different dynamics

00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:01.020
than the non-white working class
and the issues faced by them.

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:04.980
So that is the intersection.

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:09.030
And the second
thing, I think, is

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:14.910
history and the foundational
violences in our society

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:17.820
that haven't been
adequately addressed.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:25.200
In our context in the United
States, if you think about--

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.070
and I will do this in Turkey,
but I'm starting by doing it

00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:30.750
in the United States--

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:36.510
what are the foundational social
actors of the United States?

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:40.230
Who have made the
United States possible?

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:42.360
Our foundation
within this country

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.420
is settled on white settlers.

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.700
Yes, we say, we the
people, but who are we?

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:51.730
And who is included in
the we and who isn't?

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:54.710
I would argue that there
are three social actors.

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:56.670
That are the white settlers.

00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:59.460
There are the Native
Americans whose lands

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.290
we have built everything on.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:03.000
And there are the
African-Americans

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.250
who provided the labor
for all that to happen.

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:08.550
Look at our
ontological nationalism

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:10.110
in the United States.

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:13.500
We only acknowledge one group.

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.210
We do not acknowledge the other.

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:17.700
Not only do we not
acknowledge it,

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:19.380
they are the ones
who are suffering

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.960
the most in the United States.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:24.140
And I'm not talking about
the other non-whites who

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.400
have come later
in various forms,

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.040
I'm just saying foundational.

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.060
So that is the framework I want
you to think about when I now

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:35.820
turn to Turkey and
explain to you what

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:39.000
happens in that context
because that's obviously

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.890
what I specialize in.

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:43.950
If you look at Turkey and
the nationalism in Turkey,

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:47.430
we do have Tayyip
Erdogan, the president,

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:50.130
and we do have, of
course, Trump here.

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:53.670
In my life, the two
people intersect

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:55.410
in a very interesting way.

00:46:55.410 --> 00:47:01.170
Because of the work I have
done in Turkey with respect

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:04.410
to the Armenian Genocide
followed by the fact that I are

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:08.880
now working on the Kurds
because I focus on minorities,

00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.900
and as a consequence, the
state violence, and others,

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:17.220
and I signed a petition-- along
with [INAUDIBLE] who is was

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:23.340
my friend in crime,
a fellow terrorist--

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.410
saying Kurds should
not be killed,

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:30.660
you should talk to them
instead, the president Erdogan,

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:32.830
said that we were terrorists.

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:37.170
He said there is no difference
between a terrorist machine

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:40.200
gun and a scholar's pen.

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:45.540
So as a consequence, since then,
I cannot go back to Turkey.

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:46.760
So I have--

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.160
I mean, I have
Turkish citizenship,

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.720
but who knows for how long.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.570
I mean, I haven't been able
to go back for three years.

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:58.500
So recently, after Trump's
election, my mother,

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.140
who is back in Turkey,
occasionally keeps

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:04.740
calling whenever I go
on international talks,

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.660
and she says, have
you gotten back?

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:07.490
Is it OK?

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:10.710
And I'm saying, yeah,
I'm an American citizen.

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:12.020
What do you think?

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:14.610
Then the truth came out.

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:17.460
She said, look, you
had two citizenships.

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:20.250
You basically now
cannot go to Turkey.

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:21.660
You're down to one.

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:27.090
So don't make too much
noise because you'll

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:28.920
have no other place to go.

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.020
I said, mom, don't you worry.

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:35.730
I'm very close to
Windsor, Canada.

00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:37.770
I could always go there.

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:39.840
I mean, so that is the other--

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:42.810
with respect to
nationalisms in Turkey,

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:47.040
what we have today, I think,
is a much more violent form

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:50.640
of ontological
destruction in a way

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:55.170
because there were initially
four founding social actors

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:59.720
in the transition from Empire
to nation state in that context.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:04.170
There were the Greeks who
were then basically scared

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:09.050
and about 300,000 were
forced to migrate, also

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:11.690
through population
exchange, to Greece.

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:14.930
There were the Armenians
who also claimed,

00:49:14.930 --> 00:49:17.990
of course-- these are the
four social actors that

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:22.760
claimed Turkey as
their ancestral lands.

00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.310
Greeks were sent to Greece.

00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:28.310
Armenians were, of
course, destroyed

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:30.410
through the Armenian Genocide.

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:34.390
That left the Kurds and the
Turks together initially.

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:37.100
What happened was that,
when you look at history

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:39.950
and what happened
in the transition

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:45.500
in writing our foundation myth
until the republic was founded,

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:50.540
the Kurds were seen as one
of the two essential actors

00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:52.790
of the Turkish Republic.

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:56.450
Once the borders
were put in place,

00:49:56.450 --> 00:50:01.460
all mention of Kurdish
element is totally silenced.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:05.360
And I think that
explains very well why

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:11.390
we have the violence and
the approval of violence

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:16.040
not only by Turkish state,
also by Turkish society

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.900
as we see in Afrin.

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:20.780
Because in Afrin,
not only have Turks,

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:22.790
the Turkish military
had gone in there

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:29.180
and destroyed, and massacred,
and plundered all Kurdish

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:30.890
people and property.

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:36.020
But they say they did it,
of course, with all the arms

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:39.410
and armaments that the United
States and Europe provided

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:40.610
for Turkey.

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:44.690
And we haven't done anything
about it in the United States.

00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:48.920
So for me, therefore, you cannot
separate what goes on in Turkey

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:52.640
and the nationalism there
from what we are doing here

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:58.240
because if you separate it, what
disappears is responsibility.

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.250
And we have to, I
think, bring back

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:02.290
that more moral responsibility.

00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:04.450
And I'll leave there
because I don't have time.

00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:05.764
Thank you so much.

00:51:05.764 --> 00:51:08.224
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:13.362 --> 00:51:14.820
- Fatma, thank you
very, very much.

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:16.790
I'm getting a little
concerned about time.

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:17.900
We have one more speaker.

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.450
We're going to have a
hard time for questions.

00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:22.610
I'm afraid it's going
to be cut short.

00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:24.660
But we'll do the best we can.

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:26.930
But I do want to introduce
and bring to the stage now

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:29.600
Rina Verma Williams,
Associate Professor

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:33.260
of Political Science at the
University of Cincinnati,

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:36.740
where she is also an affiliate
faculty member in Asian studies

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:41.090
and in the Department of Women's
Gender and Sexuality Studies.

00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:43.010
Her research and
teaching interests

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:47.434
include comparative Indian
and South Asian politics--

00:51:47.434 --> 00:51:49.850
I wonder how you were going
to respond to the Northwestern

00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:56.660
versus Southeastern tension
that we heard about earlier--

00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:00.500
comparative Indian and South
Asian politics, religion, law,

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:04.610
nationalism, politics of the
global south, and gender,

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:05.864
and identity, politics.

00:52:05.864 --> 00:52:08.030
Do you wake up each day
wondering which one of those

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:09.770
you'll study?

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:10.580
- All together.

00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:11.150
- OK.

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:13.340
Thank you for coming
to join us, Rina.

00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:14.536
Rina.

00:52:14.536 --> 00:52:15.522
- Thank you.

00:52:15.522 --> 00:52:17.987
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:23.819 --> 00:52:24.610
- Great, thank you.

00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:28.570
So the last speaker of
the last panel of the day.

00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:29.320
No pressure there.

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.760
We've had such a
wonderful slew of panels.

00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.850
But I'm not letting
it get to me.

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:37.360
Thank you to
Radcliffe for putting

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:40.870
this terrific set of
panels, a day and a half,

00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:41.729
really, together.

00:52:41.729 --> 00:52:43.270
Thanks to Dean Cohen
for inviting me.

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:46.000
And Rebecca and your terrific
team for just making us all

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.840
run as smoothly as silk.

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.510
It is great to be
back in Cambridge,

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:52.520
though it's changed a
lot in the last 20 years.

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.120
I am still traumatized
about the idea

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:58.330
that the [INAUDIBLE]
is gone from that slot.

00:52:58.330 --> 00:52:59.650
I'll get over it.

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:02.050
I'll get over it slowly.

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:05.470
So I wanted to start
with this phrase,

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:08.590
this is not the America I know.

00:53:08.590 --> 00:53:12.610
And I wanted to start my
brief remarks with this phrase

00:53:12.610 --> 00:53:15.280
because I feel like I've heard
it so much in the last year,

00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:18.160
or really the last
several years.

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:22.750
And I feel like it captures
a great deal of the--

00:53:22.750 --> 00:53:24.510
I have turmoil in my notes.

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:28.390
And I think that's maybe
not an inaccurate word,

00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:31.540
but the turmoil that we've
been trying to consider

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:32.570
during this conference.

00:53:32.570 --> 00:53:35.560
So this phrase is
fundamentally about questions

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:39.610
of citizenship and belonging,
but also ownership.

00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:40.570
Who owns America?

00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:43.129
Who gets to decide
what America is?

00:53:43.129 --> 00:53:45.670
So notice that for me, there
are two questions embedded here,

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:48.310
not just who belongs
to the nation,

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:51.460
but who does the
nation belong to.

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:54.130
I think both of those are
equally important questions.

00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:56.620
And so I've heard this
phrase, or some version of it,

00:53:56.620 --> 00:54:00.610
from multiple places across the
political spectrum, certainly

00:54:00.610 --> 00:54:03.970
with the election
results last year.

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:06.010
I've heard this phrase
for many progressives,

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:09.730
many of my colleagues,
students, those

00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:14.980
who mean to disavow what
they read, the Trump election

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:17.230
victory and presidency
to represent.

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:18.910
I initially started
with the goal of,

00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:21.580
I'm not going to
say Trump, but I

00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:26.130
think that's both
silly and inaccurate.

00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:27.310
So I put it right in there.

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:29.330
I've heard this phrase
from immigrants,

00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:32.650
people like my
parents who came here

00:54:32.650 --> 00:54:34.990
50 years ago to
complete their education

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:39.790
and build a better life for
themselves and their kids

00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:44.080
and to send their daughter to
Harvard to get a PhD, a better

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.330
life than the one that
they thought they could

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:49.570
have in their native homes.

00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:51.340
But I've also heard
it in different forms

00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:53.710
before Trump's
election from those

00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:55.960
who opposed Obama in
his presidency, who

00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:59.950
opposed Hillary's candidacy,
and the Democrats in general

00:54:59.950 --> 00:55:02.350
in certain ways.

00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:06.250
And then lastly, I have
to add that I have not

00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:10.090
heard this phrase from too many
of my African-American friends,

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:13.360
and colleagues, and family
who have been much more

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.109
likely to say,
often with a smirk,

00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:18.400
I don't know, but it seems
pretty much like the America

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.500
we've always known.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.550
So there's something there that
we also need to think about.

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:24.050
All right.

00:55:24.050 --> 00:55:28.330
So we all know how tribal
American politics has become.

00:55:28.330 --> 00:55:31.030
There's no need to recap
that in any amount of detail.

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:32.630
So I'm not going to do that.

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:35.320
What is striking to me though,
as a scholar of nationalism,

00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:39.570
is that this partisan
tribalism is actually

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:41.700
about the very
nature and definition

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:43.950
of the nation itself.

00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:46.830
It's about what
America actually is.

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:51.210
It's not about what's good or
bad for America, or the best

00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:54.840
paths forward for America, or
even how to correct past policy

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:56.670
mistakes or anything like that.

00:55:56.670 --> 00:56:00.690
Anything that normal political
processes can, at some level,

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:01.830
handle.

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:04.080
Instead, what's up for
debate is the very core

00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:07.200
question of what America is.

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:11.470
Just a quick disclaimer, I
want to throw in at this point.

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:14.080
In this talk, I will use
America to mean the US.

00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:18.310
But I also want to acknowledge,
and I understand that doing so

00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:20.680
can serve to alight
all the other countries

00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:24.860
of the hemisphere, though
that is not my intention.

00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:29.930
It's a simplifying
tool for me right now.

00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:32.630
So I study Indian politics.

00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:35.360
And within that, I focus
on all those things

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:38.160
that David mentioned,
religion, gender nationalism,

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:41.720
I really do try to look at
how they all mush together,

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:45.260
as well as law, and democracy,
and political parties.

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:47.150
You can't really study
one without the other.

00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:51.890
And in some ways,
it's weird not to be

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:53.360
talking about India today.

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.250
I'm actually focusing
on the US, which

00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:58.220
is in certain ways kind of
freeing in some of the ways

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:02.370
that Jhumpa Lahiri talked about.

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:05.540
And what I want to
say is that when

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:07.734
I see what's going
on in US politics--

00:57:07.734 --> 00:57:09.650
I mean, in the sense
that Fatima talked about,

00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:13.181
you can't study Indian
politics, but I've been educated

00:57:13.181 --> 00:57:14.930
and growing my whole
life in this country,

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:16.888
and you can't get a degree
in political science

00:57:16.888 --> 00:57:20.330
without knowing about American
politics in an academic sense

00:57:20.330 --> 00:57:22.310
as well as in a personal sense.

00:57:22.310 --> 00:57:25.280
So I feel entirely comfortable
talking about US politics.

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:28.970
But when I see what's going
on, I sort of naturally

00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:33.170
try to draw on what I know
about nationalism in general

00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:34.299
to try to make sense of it.

00:57:34.299 --> 00:57:35.840
So that's a little
bit of what I want

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.810
to try to share with you today.

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:40.940
And in fact, for someone
who studied nationalism

00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:45.450
in many forms all over
the world for a few years,

00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:48.710
if not decades, it
actually seems crystal

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:50.260
clear to me what's going on.

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:52.880
Or at least I feel
like I can make

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:54.500
some sense of our
current situation

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:57.301
in terms that I know from
studying nationalism.

00:57:57.301 --> 00:57:59.550
And again, that's what I
want to share with you today.

00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:02.390
So for many decades,
scholars of nationalism

00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:06.200
have drawn a distinction
between two different types

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:09.320
or forms of nationalism that
I have listed here for you.

00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:12.260
They've gone by different
names at different times.

00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:14.270
But at root, I
think they can best

00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:17.660
be described and understood as
ethnic and civic nationalism.

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.630
Ethnic nationalism represents
a community of descent,

00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:23.810
D-E-S-C-E-N-T, not
descent into chaos,

00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:25.910
but like bloodline descent--

00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:29.240
maybe descent into
chaos, too, eventually.

00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:34.710
The ethnic nation is rooted
in sociocultural loyalties.

00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:36.650
The nation's
constituted on the basis

00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:39.680
of bloodlines, whether
real, or imagined,

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:42.350
or believed, kin-like relations.

00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:46.790
So an ethnic nation is like one
big family, whether it's happy

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:47.540
or not.

00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:50.040
Civic nationalism,
on the other hand,

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.100
is based in political
institutional ties.

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:56.630
It's more about shared political
beliefs, shared ideology

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:59.510
rather than a shared
ethnic background.

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:01.490
Now, notice that in
ethnic nationalism,

00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:03.140
you're born into a nation.

00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:07.640
You can't choose, or change,
or abandon your nationality.

00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:09.710
Whereas, in civic
nationalism, citizenship

00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:10.760
is a matter of choice.

00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.560
You can choose to
leave one nationality.

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.140
You can pledge
loyalty to another one

00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:17.037
as long as you are
pledging loyalty

00:59:17.037 --> 00:59:18.120
to the beliefs and ideas--

00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:18.980
[AUDIENCE SNEEZE]

00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:20.780
--that constitute that nation.

00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:23.960
Bless you.

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:26.387
And obviously, then,
both the question--

00:59:26.387 --> 00:59:28.970
I hope that doesn't mean you are
allergic to the framework I'm

00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:31.260
putting up.

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:34.550
I will go into that
Q&amp;A. So obviously

00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:37.010
then, both the question of
who belongs to the nation

00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:39.860
and who the nation belongs
to, both those questions

00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:43.640
are answered very differently
in civic and ethnic nationalism.

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:48.739
Ethnic nationalism, you
either belong to the group,

00:59:48.739 --> 00:59:49.280
or you don't.

00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.770
You were born into
it, or you weren't.

00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:54.530
Whereas, civic nationalism,
anyone, in theory,

00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:57.647
could belong to the nation.

00:59:57.647 --> 00:59:59.480
And so hopefully, at
this point, many of you

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.479
can figure out where I'm
trying to go with this.

01:00:01.479 --> 01:00:03.001
I believe that the
US is struggling

01:00:03.001 --> 01:00:05.000
with the question of
whether we're fundamentally

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.980
a civic or an ethnic nation.

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:09.320
And to be explicit,
America has long

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:13.070
gotten by with the veneer
or, more cynically, the myth

01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:15.050
of being a civic nation.

01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:19.520
And I think that we could get
away with that for so long

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:23.240
as the underpinning ethnic
basis of our civic nationalism

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:26.870
remained dominant,
even if dormant.

01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:32.000
And we all know what that ethnic
basis is, it's Judeo-Christian.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.300
Perhaps even more accurately,
Anglo-Saxon Protestant,

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:38.570
primarily of European
descent, and white,

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:41.600
however that's defined at
any given historical moment.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:46.220
But now, we're reaching a
tipping point as the US becomes

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:47.900
a minority-majority nation--

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:50.960
or maybe it's majority-minority,
I am never clear--

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:54.590
that ethnic foundation
is threatened.

01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:58.370
Certain groups of people feel
or sense that that foundation

01:00:58.370 --> 01:00:59.580
is threatened.

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.520
And so that foundation is
trying to reassert itself.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.080
Or those people are trying to
reassert it, the people who

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.680
feel the sense of threat.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:12.260
And these groups, these
elements, I believe,

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:14.090
are the ones that not
only openly support

01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:17.120
Trump, that 30%
of the population

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.170
that will never budge
from supporting him.

01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:21.560
But also, I think very
significant numbers

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:26.120
of people, that
middle 30% to 40%,

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.880
who feel the vague and easiness
of not really liking Trump,

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.110
they don't like Trump,
to some extent, I think,

01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:36.020
maybe what Joan called
the sensible voters,

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.510
but they don't really
like the other side.

01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:41.000
They don't trust where they
think the country is headed

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.680
or where the other
side is either

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:48.200
trying to take the country,
or seems willing to let it go.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:52.610
A couple of things to
note regarding the debate

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:54.200
framed in this way.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.620
First, the US has not
just been considered

01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:00.620
and considers itself to be
a civic nation, but really,

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:02.730
the ultimate example
of a civic nation.

01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:07.760
We're supposed to be the example
to show that civic nationalism

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:09.371
really worked.

01:02:09.371 --> 01:02:11.120
What we all share that
makes us Americans,

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:13.040
a set of beliefs,
an ideology, we

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.880
believe in democracy, individual
freedoms, et cetera, et cetera.

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.120
And then another
thing to make note

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:23.810
of, the ultimate example
of ethnic nationalism

01:02:23.810 --> 01:02:25.700
has long been considered
to be Germany,

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:28.560
especially pre-WWII Germany.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.900
We all know where that went.

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.800
It was not good.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.030
So ethnic nationalism
has a good long history

01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:38.240
of being looked at askance.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.790
I won't really have time
to go global with this.

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:43.910
I think that this civic
versus ethnic nationalism

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:46.500
class can explain a lot of
things around the world,

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.610
including India, which I'm
happy to go into during Q&amp;A

01:02:49.610 --> 01:02:51.110
or follow up if you want.

01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:53.450
My argument is always
that, in India, we

01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:55.370
had our Trump in 2014.

01:02:55.370 --> 01:03:00.140
Right we had him 2 and 1/2 years
before we had ours in the US.

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:03.290
India has definitely
brought to power

01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:06.800
a party that rejects a secular,
civic definition of India.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:11.115
It wants to resurrect an ethnic,
Hindu religious definition

01:03:11.115 --> 01:03:11.615
of India.

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:16.559
So we're at Radcliffe.

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:18.850
And I don't want to miss the
women in nationalism part.

01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:21.270
So I'll close with this.

01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:22.810
Feminist scholars
of nationalism,

01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:26.590
if not always the mainstream
scholars of nationalism,

01:03:26.590 --> 01:03:29.170
have long argued and understood
the critical role of gender

01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:31.360
in constructing
national identities.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.070
They've explained
how women are seen

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:35.410
as those who
propagate the nation,

01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:38.140
both literally by
producing children,

01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:41.980
but also culturally in
passing on language and values

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:44.890
to the next generation.

01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:48.010
Women attend to hearth
and home when men are away

01:03:48.010 --> 01:03:50.170
fighting for the nation.

01:03:50.170 --> 01:03:52.270
They're also the reason
to fight to protect

01:03:52.270 --> 01:03:55.030
the nation, protecting
the women and children.

01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:57.269
And women often symbolized
the nation itself,

01:03:57.269 --> 01:03:58.810
like some of these
images I have here

01:03:58.810 --> 01:04:05.080
with Marianna France and this
famous image of Durga in India.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.620
But to me, in the terms
we've just talked about,

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:12.520
these symbols of the
nation and of nationalism

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.760
are more linked to ethnic
forms of nationalism

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.160
rather than civic.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.500
It's more ethnic
nationalism that women

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:25.240
would play these kinds of roles
in propagating the nation.

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.520
And in fact, even feminist
scholars of nationalism

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.730
haven't done enough
thinking, I would

01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:34.090
say, about the role of women and
gender in civic nationalisms.

01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:37.720
Maybe that's another book to
write in the next few years.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.220
I mean, in theory,
civic nationalism

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:42.550
should be much less
gendered, therefore,

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:43.990
perhaps, more egalitarian--

01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:45.960
I'm not sure, I have
to think about it,

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:49.780
we can think about it together--
than ethnic nationalism.

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:54.100
But the idea of a retrenchment
on an ethnic form or basis

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:58.360
for US nationalism also
goes some way, in my view,

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:01.540
to explain something that
others have found puzzling.

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:05.680
And that is the support of white
women in particular for Trump,

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:09.050
and not often just the working
class white women, right?

01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:14.680
Even the more educated
and wealthier white women.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.500
Despite the many
egregious reasons there

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.780
have been for women--

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:21.134
and for anyone, in fact--

01:05:21.134 --> 01:05:23.050
where they could have
or should have abandoned

01:05:23.050 --> 01:05:26.170
their support of him, if one
takes the primary concern

01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:32.350
to be the refounding, a
reasserting, or reaffirming

01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:35.352
the ethnic basis of US
nationalism, then to me,

01:05:35.352 --> 01:05:37.060
at least, that makes
more sense that they

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:39.700
would continue to
support him if that's

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:43.090
what they believe he's doing.

01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:46.840
So to conclude, just a
moment to think through what

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:48.827
all this might mean.

01:05:48.827 --> 01:05:50.410
The first thing I
would say is I'm not

01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:52.810
sure I'm trying to
make an argument

01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:56.110
about whether ethnic or civic
nationalism will sort of win

01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:57.670
out in this battle.

01:05:57.670 --> 01:06:01.690
I myself am kind of rooting
for civic nationalism

01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:04.770
to win out, not least
because it's an example I

01:06:04.770 --> 01:06:07.090
want to see succeed.

01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:08.860
I think the
possibilities for women

01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:13.120
are probably better
in civic nationalism.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.950
But to me rather,
it's more about what

01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:17.200
combination of civic
and ethnic nationalism

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:20.110
will be left when
this is all behind us.

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:22.660
It's about whether the
underlying fear is justified,

01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:26.200
the fear that our civic
aspects are actually

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:29.830
built on ethnic foundations,
and that they always have been,

01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:32.070
whether it was
acknowledged or not,

01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:35.650
that if the ethnic foundation
shifts as the country becomes

01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:38.170
more diverse, will
the civic structure

01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:41.230
that we've built on it collapse?

01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:43.390
Was civic nationalism
myth all along?

01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:45.850
Can we ever have a
truly civic nationalism

01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:49.684
without that
underlying ethnic base?

01:06:49.684 --> 01:06:51.100
These, to me, are
the questions we

01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:54.910
need to watch, and think about,
and grapple with going forward.

01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:58.810
I'm not going to stand here and
pretend to have any answers.

01:06:58.810 --> 01:07:02.140
But I'm certainly interested
in watching the game

01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:05.890
and hope that the
outcome is the right one.

01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:07.390
And no matter what,
I always believe

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:11.030
in trying to make sure we're
asking the right questions.

01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:11.928
- Thank you.

01:07:11.928 --> 01:07:14.318
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:21.720
Just a word, I might point
out that in the last couple

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:25.410
of weeks, the Parkland kids
came here from Florida.

01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:27.810
There were seven who
came to Kennedy Schools

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:31.680
and on the of day and we had
a chance to talk to them,

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.500
and ask them, and try
to figure out, how could

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.930
it possibly be at
a time when there's

01:07:36.930 --> 01:07:39.774
a lot of negativity about the
millennials, and who they are,

01:07:39.774 --> 01:07:41.940
and what they represent,
and these kids come forward

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:44.510
and they're poised, they're
articulate, they're passionate,

01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:46.260
and they understand
history, and they seem

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:48.870
to understand our civic life.

01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:52.230
And it turns out they have
a very strong civics program

01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:53.550
at that school.

01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:56.730
And it made a difference in
terms of the civic nationalism

01:07:56.730 --> 01:07:59.970
you were just discussing.

01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:01.857
But I want to ask Joan, briefly.

01:08:01.857 --> 01:08:02.940
I have just two questions.

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:06.930
And we're going to go to the
floor for as long as we can.

01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:10.620
Joan, I briefly asked in
beginning, what about elitism

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.600
in American universities?

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:17.460
A Pew poll found that a
stunning 40% of people

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:21.229
think that universities
are bad for the country.

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:22.995
Bad for the country.

01:08:22.995 --> 01:08:26.890
They're our crown jewels.

01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:28.479
So what do we do?

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.900
If Larry [INAUDIBLE]
came to you and said,

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:33.483
I'm taking over Harvard's
[INAUDIBLE],, what should I do?

01:08:33.483 --> 01:08:35.649
- Well, I'm going to give
a short answer because I'm

01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:38.600
eager to hear from the audience.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:41.680
I think there's been
a systematic program

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:46.750
for several decades to undermine
American education, starting

01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:49.660
with the inner cities, but
certainly not ending there.

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:52.779
And I think it's
been very effective.

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:55.870
And it's been
absolutely devastating

01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:58.189
for American civic life.

01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:59.979
And I think the attack
on the universities

01:08:59.979 --> 01:09:03.950
is just the latest
version of that.

01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:07.319
- And where is that
coming from, the effort

01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:10.520
to dismantle and discredit?

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.750
- I think that it is
coming from people

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:20.930
who would prefer a passive
and uneducated electorate.

01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:22.990
As I say, I'm eager to
hear from the audience.

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:24.010
I'm not really sure.

01:09:24.010 --> 01:09:27.670
- Let me ask the
group one question.

01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:29.470
The United States
is soon going to be

01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:33.010
a country where the
whites Caucasians are

01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:34.060
no longer the majority.

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:37.300
We're going to have a
majority of minorities.

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:43.390
And the central issue becomes,
can a multi ethnic society

01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:45.149
succeed?

01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:47.240
And I just would
like to ask you,

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:48.979
is there an example
you can point to

01:09:48.979 --> 01:09:52.880
of a multi-ethnic society
that has been successful?

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:56.990
Or what country would you point
to that's come the closest?

01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:59.840
- Well, it depends on how you
define success, doesn't it?

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:02.540
- Well, it does.

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:04.870
- But just to say
something, I mean,

01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:08.380
if you want to have a
post-colonial take on why is it

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:12.640
that universities are taken
on, one can argue that we are

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:17.080
switching from an entitlement
society to an achievement

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:18.450
society.

01:10:18.450 --> 01:10:20.850
And then universities,
of course,

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:23.665
are where you go when
you achieve something.

01:10:23.665 --> 01:10:26.320
Whereas, the rest,
of course, no longer

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:31.180
have the entitlement,
which they had always

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:35.050
thought was achievement that
came because of what they did

01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:39.330
rather than because of where
they were born and who--

01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:41.410
- Working class
families would argue

01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:43.390
that the sons and
daughters who are

01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:46.035
going to these elite
universities do feel entitled.

01:10:46.035 --> 01:10:48.160
And they're there because
they had a certain amount

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.860
of entitlement in life.

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:52.410
- Their children feel that.

01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:54.780
- Well, then others look
at it and say, well, you've

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:56.365
got it in, you've
got a legacy, you've

01:10:56.365 --> 01:10:59.307
got all these things
that are going on.

01:10:59.307 --> 01:11:00.140
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:01.990
- Just saying, we
did have a legacy,

01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:03.250
that's why I got into Yale.

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.010
- Yeah.

01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:09.330
- But again, let's go
back to this question.

01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:11.560
Can multi-ethnic societies work?

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.680
Which ones are
coming the closest?

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:18.460
- One thing, when
you say multi-ethnic,

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:22.600
you assume that all ethnicities
are equal to each other.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.110
And they are not.

01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:27.640
multi-ethnic means that,
because of history, because

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:30.310
of intersectionality,
with power,

01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:34.900
some ethnicities are always
more privileged than other ones.

01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:37.000
If you bring them
together, then,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.880
you cannot assume that
they are all the same.

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:44.310
- Given that, how do countries
overcome the challenge, please?

01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:50.120
- I wonder if I could ask a
question in return which is,

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.270
which society has not
been multi-ethnic?

01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:57.170
Right the myth one can
have a majority ethnicity,

01:11:57.170 --> 01:12:00.820
but I think anything but
a multi-ethnic society

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:04.330
at some level is not
a fully real thing.

01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:06.590
- Go back to the
fundamental argument

01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:09.190
underlying all of this, that
many people no longer feel

01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:11.140
at home, and a lot
of those people

01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:12.930
are coming from the
majority who now

01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:14.935
feel like they're
turning into the minority

01:12:14.935 --> 01:12:16.810
and are being
overwhelmed by others who

01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:18.480
are coming in from the outside.

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:22.810
- In the US, there is this
kind of new theorizing

01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:26.860
in terms of super diversity,
that all countries,

01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:30.130
many countries, many cities
become minority majorities.

01:12:30.130 --> 01:12:33.920
So indeed, the white mainstream
will then be disappearing.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:36.040
And I agree with you.

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:39.190
This suggestion that it's
new, but also the suggestion

01:12:39.190 --> 01:12:41.110
because we have so
many ethnicities,

01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:42.610
and therefore,
there's no mainstream

01:12:42.610 --> 01:12:44.830
anymore is not
very sociological.

01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:46.480
I mean, there are
many ethnicities.

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.100
But indeed, there
are still rather

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:51.140
dominant groups and groups
that are less dominant.

01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:57.490
And it might be that numerical
changes makes the majority even

01:12:57.490 --> 01:13:00.050
if they are perhaps not the
majority in numbers anymore,

01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:01.520
but they are still
the mainstream.

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.520
Nevertheless, they might
feel threatened, right?

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:06.010
And that's what's happening
with many white Americans

01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:07.270
at this moment.

01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:11.020
But there are then basic
sociological questions to ask.

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:13.660
Does that mean, indeed, that
the mainstream, as such,

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:14.980
is totally disappearing?

01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:16.660
Is that what is happening?

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:18.820
I don't think that
multi-ethnicity necessarily

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:20.650
implies that, to be honest.

01:13:20.650 --> 01:13:23.260
And the second question,
it's a more painful question,

01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:25.840
why do those white people
feel so threatened?

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:28.100
Or to frame it
even more painful,

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:31.240
why do they feel entitled
to have a higher status

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.010
position than others?

01:13:33.010 --> 01:13:35.140
And in that sense, I'm
ambivalent about what

01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:35.680
Joan said.

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.096
On the one hand,
of course, you're

01:13:37.096 --> 01:13:42.100
totally right that the white
working class deserves dignity

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.879
and we treat them with dignity.

01:13:43.879 --> 01:13:46.420
But the question is whether they
will be satisfied with that.

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:50.170
The thing is that they
often think that they

01:13:50.170 --> 01:13:52.390
deserve to be better off.

01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:55.250
I mean, otherwise, how
to confront their racism,

01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:56.830
their homophobia, and so on?

01:13:56.830 --> 01:14:02.210
So I'm sympathetic that you want
to give them back their value,

01:14:02.210 --> 01:14:06.790
but the thing is, is that
what they are asking for?

01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:08.060
- I totally agree with you.

01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:11.200
But to add to that,
whites are not also

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.600
one monolithic category either.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.270
I mean, that is also,
I think, a problem.

01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:19.180
We have to divide the
whites who are critical,

01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:22.800
like most of you in this
room, including you all,

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:27.910
and whites who have
naturalized that privilege,

01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:30.340
and who want to
sustain that privilege,

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.460
and have no interest
whatsoever in saying,

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:35.140
why do we have this privilege?

01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:36.850
Where did it come from?

01:14:36.850 --> 01:14:39.280
Should we have it in
the past, in the future?

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.290
Should we share it
with other people?

01:14:41.290 --> 01:14:45.790
I mean, I want whites
to be normalized

01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:47.590
whites and critical whites.

01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:52.510
Critical whites are, I think,
very important because change,

01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:56.890
positively, can only emerge
when those critical the whites

01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:58.870
are together with
the non-whites.

01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:03.240
Otherwise, we will stay
in totally polarized

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:04.380
from each other.

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:05.770
Why do I say this?

01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:07.530
I am an ethnic Turk.

01:15:07.530 --> 01:15:09.960
When I studied the
Armenian Genocide,

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:13.650
I belonged to the
perpetrator category.

01:15:13.650 --> 01:15:15.960
That was important.

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:18.450
I did not belong to
the victim category.

01:15:18.450 --> 01:15:21.930
I mean, who is victimized
in this situation?

01:15:21.930 --> 01:15:24.780
We have to be aware
that those who

01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:27.390
belong to the dominant
white category

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:30.240
can also own responsibility.

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.860
That's what [INAUDIBLE]
talks about,

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:34.580
is that they can say,
we are responsible,

01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:36.270
this is our society.

01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:39.270
For change, we will be
aligning with the non-whites

01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:41.830
and change the other
normalized whites.

01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:44.180
[APPLAUSE]

01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:48.735
- Joan?

01:15:48.735 --> 01:15:49.600
- Do you mind?

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.300
Do you want to--

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:52.520
- Go ahead.

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:56.960
- I think that racism
and a sense of class,

01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.510
what's been called the
hidden injuries of class,

01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:03.170
I think they've gotten
all mixed up together.

01:16:03.170 --> 01:16:06.020
And I think some people are
not interested in giving up

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:07.230
their racism.

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:10.670
And I think for those people who
are not giving up their racism,

01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:12.450
I'm not interested.

01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:15.030
I'm not going there.

01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:19.400
But I think for a lot of
people, if you say to them,

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:22.010
there are a couple of deals
that are being on offer.

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:27.800
You can continue to have
your McJobs and your racism.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.490
Or we can offer you
the dignity that

01:16:31.490 --> 01:16:35.540
is due to all working
people of all races

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:37.790
because you do important work.

01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:40.070
And you're entitled to
a middle class standard

01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:43.430
of living because we're
one of the richest

01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:45.570
countries in the world.

01:16:45.570 --> 01:16:50.470
And if you're interested in
that deal, we have a wide tent

01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:52.600
and we welcome you here.

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:57.010
I think that we wouldn't get
all of the white working class.

01:16:57.010 --> 01:16:59.920
I think we would
get enough of them.

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:03.220
And I think we would treat our
fellow citizens with dignity.

01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:04.945
Let me just say one
quick other thing.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.570
You know, are these
people racist?

01:17:10.570 --> 01:17:12.410
They are white people.

01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:14.780
White people are racist.

01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:18.000
We're racist, too.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.210
- Are you saying all
white people are racist?

01:17:20.210 --> 01:17:24.380
- I'm talking about
40 years of studies

01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:28.010
that show that the professional
managerial elite prides

01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:30.170
themselves on their merit.

01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:33.530
So 40 years of studies
shows that they fault people

01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:36.050
of color for lack of merit.

01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:39.890
The white working class prides
themselves on their morality.

01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:43.670
So 40 years of studies
show that they fault people

01:17:43.670 --> 01:17:46.190
of color for lack of morality.

01:17:46.190 --> 01:17:49.010
I'm not in favor of
either kind of racism.

01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:51.650
But I find it truly
troubling and off

01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:55.550
putting when elites
use anti-racism

01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:57.580
as an excuse for snobbery.

01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:00.658
And I do not think that
helps people of color.

[APPLAUSE]

- I'm just curious
about your view

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:13.320
and how it's consistent with
treating people with dignity

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:16.640
if they feel you're
calling them racist.

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:19.400
- Well, I'm interested in
whatever Rina wants to say.

01:18:21.694 --> 01:18:22.610
That's a good handoff.

01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:29.452
- Rina is going to
speak about going back

01:18:29.452 --> 01:18:30.660
to our previous conversation.

01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:31.368
Go ahead, please.

01:18:31.368 --> 01:18:36.000
- I'm not sure which
question I'm answering.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.800
The one thing that
came to my mind

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.930
in terms of your
earlier question

01:18:39.930 --> 01:18:44.130
about whether any multi-ethnic
society has ever succeeded,

01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:47.160
it brought to mind
the word fear.

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.045
The fear of what is--

01:18:50.045 --> 01:18:51.420
I'm not saying
you're afraid, I'm

01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:53.930
saying the question
made me think of that.

01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:54.930
Or maybe you are afraid.

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:55.890
I don't know.

01:18:55.890 --> 01:18:57.300
But I don't want to assume.

01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:01.390
The fear of, how is
this going to work?

01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:03.690
How is this American
experiment in civic nationalism

01:19:03.690 --> 01:19:06.570
going to work without
the underlying

01:19:06.570 --> 01:19:09.750
ethnic basis or foundation
that's always been there?

01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:10.959
And that is a scary question.

01:19:10.959 --> 01:19:12.708
Like I said, I stood
up there, and I said,

01:19:12.708 --> 01:19:13.710
I don't know the answer.

01:19:13.710 --> 01:19:14.490
I hope it works.

01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:16.140
I think it can work.

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:19.050
Exactly how it will
work, I'm not sure.

01:19:19.050 --> 01:19:25.470
But that's the sense
I get underneath.

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:26.820
Joan, I love your deal.

01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:29.400
I would grab it in a moment.

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:32.160

takers one would get.

- Oh, it's definitely--

01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:39.010
I think we have to try.

01:19:39.010 --> 01:19:39.843

And then whether people take
it or not, that's on them.

But the studies
I've seen and heard

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.030
that I find very
perturbing, where

01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:54.540
if you go to people
in mining jobs, oh,

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:56.250
what about a program to retrain?

01:19:56.250 --> 01:19:57.840
We don't want to retrain.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.610
We want our old lives.

01:19:59.610 --> 01:20:01.110
We want our old jobs.

01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:02.820
We want things to be
the way they were.

01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:07.680
And that fear of, how is
this all going to work later?

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.090
We don't see how it can work.

place in it is going to be.

how it's going to look.

hear a lot of these questions.

question I answered.

properly suggested

01:20:23.970 --> 01:20:25.530

Chu from Cambridge.

And I have a great concern
about our fragile democracy.

01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:52.480
I saw a movie last night
at the Kennedy School.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.590
It's on Netflix and
available for anyone.

01:20:55.590 --> 01:21:00.570
It's called Get Me Roger Stone.

As a Matter of fact, there's
another film I just saw,

01:21:15.710 --> 01:21:20.010
The Darkest Hour, with Churchill
standing up and saying,

01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:25.060
we're going to fight for island,
and standing up to Hitler.

to think, my question is,

01:21:30.530 --> 01:21:32.780
if the Democratic Party--

01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:35.390
which is not an
ideal party at all,

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:38.990
it has a lot of problems--
if we don't fight like hell

01:21:38.990 --> 01:21:43.420

Congress, and vote out

01:22:02.866 --> 01:22:06.300
- Hi, I'm a graduate
student from Boston College.

01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.750
I have a question for maybe
the sociologists, but maybe

01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:09.330
everyone.

01:22:09.330 --> 01:22:11.925
There are some sociologists
in the field who

01:22:11.925 --> 01:22:13.550
believe that we should
think of America

01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:17.700
or theorize America as an empire
rather than a nation state.

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:18.940
Would you agree with this?

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:22.410
And if so, do you think it
changes the question about who

01:22:22.410 --> 01:22:24.349
belongs or doesn't?

01:22:24.349 --> 01:22:26.390
- You all want to wait to
hear all the questions?

01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:27.515
Is that what you're saying?

01:22:27.515 --> 01:22:29.300
- Well, I know who
the sociologist is,

01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:34.070
Daniel [INAUDIBLE],, who
writes about US imperialism.

01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:36.620
Of course, it's very
important to differentiate

01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:40.100
European imperialism
from American imperialism

01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:43.160
because we do it
through the economy,

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:46.370
we do not politically
go and colonize it.

01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:48.330
We colonize through
the lifestyle,

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:51.170
through the consumption,
through shopping malls,

01:22:51.170 --> 01:22:52.670
and things like that.

01:22:52.670 --> 01:22:56.060
I mean, what does that
do to other societies?

01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:59.870
And what happens when that
intersects with neo-liberalism

01:22:59.870 --> 01:23:04.640
and the priorities of profit
rather than human lives

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:07.250
is something, yes, we
do have to think about.

01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:11.300
But that all requires
critical self-reflexivity.

01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:14.690
We are not, as a
nation, as American, I'm

01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:18.110
talking about,
critically reflexive,

01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:22.310
because I don't think we
study our history enough.

01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:24.620
We are too much
focused on present.

01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:26.320
Of course,
neo-liberalism'squestion

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:30.120
premise is that it is
universal, there is no history,

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.520
that it doesn't matter.

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:33.440
I think history matters.

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:35.420
We have to reexamine
our history.

01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:38.120
- And much less, study the
history of any place else.

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.830
- Exactly.

01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:42.510
- I'm not a sociologist, but
I feel qualified to jump in.

01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:44.510
I'm familiar with the
work you're talking about.

01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:49.220
My only concern about
that is that sets up

01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:52.260
as if empire a nation state
are not closely interrelated.

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:52.760
- Oh, yes.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:53.690
They are the same.

01:23:53.690 --> 01:23:55.130
- There is no
empire that has not

01:23:55.130 --> 01:24:01.040
had a nation state as its
foundation, say, being Indian.

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:04.190
The first question, just really
quick, and maybe a couple

01:24:04.190 --> 01:24:06.590
of questions at a
time, one thing that

01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:09.739
popped to mind very quickly
is two different things.

01:24:09.739 --> 01:24:11.780
I mean, at one point, at
the beginning, you said,

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:13.110
take our country back.

01:24:13.110 --> 01:24:14.457
And that made my ears stand up.

01:24:14.457 --> 01:24:16.040
But then you said,
take Congress back.

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:19.170
So I see those as
two different things.

01:24:19.170 --> 01:24:20.960
They're not really--
take our country back

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.330
made me immediately
want to say, didn't you

01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:25.260
hear what I said about
whose country it is?

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:28.200
We have to figure out
who's country it is.

01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:32.052
But take the Congress back,
that's a different question.

01:24:32.052 --> 01:24:33.010
I can sign up for that.

01:24:33.010 --> 01:24:33.770
- Please.

01:24:33.770 --> 01:24:35.575
Hi, I'm trying to
phrase this question,

01:24:35.575 --> 01:24:39.560
because I want to come back to
the question which I think you

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:43.490
all punted on a little bit,
to offer and challenge you

01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:48.820
to offer a prescriptive norm of
what ideal multi-ethnic society

01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:49.550
could look like.

01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:52.850
Because if, we Rina is saying,
civic nationalism is the best

01:24:52.850 --> 01:24:55.760
we can hope for in a
world of nation states--

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:56.990
that's where we are--

01:24:56.990 --> 01:25:00.770
and if, as Jan was
saying, that even

01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:05.360
espousing certain liberal
ideals of gender equality,

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:08.710
or sexual equality, or
LGBT rights itself becomes

01:25:08.710 --> 01:25:13.610
suspect as an effort to push out
the other, the Muslim, and so

01:25:13.610 --> 01:25:14.460
forth.

01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:19.220
Can a multi-ethnic society
articulate and demand adherence

01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:23.240
to certain liberal values
that are, ultimately, designed

01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:27.200
to be liberal and protective of
the other, the LGBT, the women,

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.880
and so forth.

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:31.440
And the challenge I
see, the conflict I see

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:39.140
is that we also tie ourselves
up in knots the tolerance

01:25:39.140 --> 01:25:40.241
everybody, of everything.

01:25:40.241 --> 01:25:41.990
And that's where the
hate speech comes in.

01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:43.760
That's where the values come in.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:48.250
Does not have to be accepted
within a multi-ethnic society?

01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:52.110
Can a multi-ethnic society
exist by accepting everything?

01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:55.920
What that does is then just
become nothing and chaos.

01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:59.260
So what is the
prescriptive ideal?

01:25:59.260 --> 01:25:59.760
- Thank you.

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.340
Please.

01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:04.780
- Thanks again for the question.

01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:08.970
I think that many of us indeed
gave a rather dark picture

01:26:08.970 --> 01:26:11.100
this afternoon.

01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:13.530
And the terms of civic
and ethnic nationalism

01:26:13.530 --> 01:26:16.350
are very helpful to describe it.

01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:18.690
Because in the many
countries we are discussing

01:26:18.690 --> 01:26:20.520
and we are
researching, there is,

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.250
I think, a shift from
the civic to the ethnic.

01:26:23.250 --> 01:26:24.750
And that's not only
true in the US,

01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:27.240
but it's also true in
France, which you might see,

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:29.310
it very specific,
but it becomes also

01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:32.100
very much defined
and very specific

01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:36.122
values that are, of course,
propagated as universal.

01:26:36.122 --> 01:26:37.830
But at the same time,
as you've described

01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:39.790
very nicely this
morning in the session,

01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:41.400
they are highly
specific, and also

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.680
exclusionary towards others.

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:46.410
So this is broader tendency
from specific to ethnic.

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:48.060
That's all that we want.

01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:51.390
At the same time, my [INAUDIBLE]
to the slightly more ambivalent

01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:54.000
because it is also about
the rise and the embrace

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.494
of progressive values.

01:26:55.494 --> 01:26:56.910
And in the earlier
days, you would

01:26:56.910 --> 01:26:59.760
expect that being progressive
and being tolerant

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:00.856
would go together.

01:27:00.856 --> 01:27:02.730
The problem is that,
also, progressive people

01:27:02.730 --> 01:27:05.165
can be highly intolerant.

01:27:05.165 --> 01:27:06.540
But I do see, in
the Netherlands,

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:07.820
it has a performative effect.

01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:10.110
So all the time
emphasizing women's rights,

01:27:10.110 --> 01:27:14.220
and other, and LGBT rights
creates something like--

01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:16.710
OK, but then we should be
tolerant towards minorities,

01:27:16.710 --> 01:27:20.280
groups in a disqualified, in
a discriminated situation.

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:24.750
So why then not having the
embracement of the notion

01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:26.630
of tolerance itself?

01:27:26.630 --> 01:27:30.750
And not just for those specific
groups, but we should rethink.

01:27:30.750 --> 01:27:32.520
And that gets closer
to, of course,

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:36.120
then the civic notion
that is not relativistic.

01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:39.110
To be totally clear, I
totally agree with you there.

01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:41.970
But that is far from
saying, some people

01:27:41.970 --> 01:27:44.550
are, by color, or by
birth, or whatever,

01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:46.860
more core of the
nation than others.

01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:51.360
Everybody can become
part of that nation.

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:56.580
- Does anybody have a model
nation we can look to?

01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:59.660
- I try to avoid that.

01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:02.100
There is not such
a country, I guess.

01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:04.060
- You say what?

01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:06.050
- I'm curious to hear
from the audience,

01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:10.530
but I mean, they are clearly
hesitant to name countries that

01:28:10.530 --> 01:28:13.970
are closer to this ideal
of civic nationalism.

01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:17.670
What we do see is that many go
from civic to ethnic or a sense

01:28:17.670 --> 01:28:18.340
of nationalism.

01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:19.860
But there are good examples.

01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:21.360
You can think of
countries that have

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.790
become more civic recently.

01:28:23.790 --> 01:28:26.300
I'm afraid that's very
hard to come up with.

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:30.360
- Let me just add that ethnic,
of course, you can touch,

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:33.300
you know, you can see
to a certain degree.

01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:35.880
Civic is an abstract notion.

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:39.300
Modernity's main problem
is that the notions,

01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:43.080
the concepts we have, have a
certain level of abstraction.

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:46.020
You cannot find
them actually there.

01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:49.500
And I'm now very upset
about this imagined part

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:53.310
of the imagined community
that nationalism entails.

01:28:53.310 --> 01:28:56.220
Because when you say
imagined, everybody

01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:57.720
imagines it differently.

01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:01.170
So what happens if those
imaginations don't all go

01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:01.890
along?

01:29:01.890 --> 01:29:06.570
And how do you take that theory
and what happens in practice?

01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:08.310
There is a lot of variation.

01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:13.200
The only insight I have
is [INAUDIBLE] insight.

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:16.830
I think if we have
as individuals

01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:19.740
the unit of analysis, it's
going to be difficult.

01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:22.240
We have to think
of communal again.

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:25.200
Maybe that is the way to
go, of communal rights

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.234
and responsibilities.

01:29:26.234 --> 01:29:27.900
- I'm eager to hear
the other questions.

01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:30.270
But let me just say
one brief thing.

01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:34.290
This is not the first time
we've seen this movie, folks.

01:29:34.290 --> 01:29:37.710
I mean, my mother was Jewish.

01:29:37.710 --> 01:29:40.880
She wasn't considered American.

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:43.470
I'm married to a Catholic boy.

01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:46.500
There was a time when
the Catholics and Irish

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:48.540
were considered black.

01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:53.010
We have done this our
whole national lives.

01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:54.480
We can do it again.

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.400
We just need to want to.

01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.810
And we just need--

01:29:57.810 --> 01:30:00.360
and I would never--

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:03.000
I mean, I've worked in identity
politics my whole life.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.490
I've worked on race and
gender my whole life.

01:30:06.490 --> 01:30:09.150
We just need to add back class.

01:30:09.150 --> 01:30:10.440
Yeah?

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:13.210
- I was going to
ask the question.

01:30:13.210 --> 01:30:18.250
But now I'm just going to
make a very simple statement

01:30:18.250 --> 01:30:21.550
about primary education.

01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:24.280
And that's because,
basically, we're

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:26.680
standing here in
this room because

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:34.370
of what we've learned 30, 40
years ago in kindergarten.

01:30:34.370 --> 01:30:39.290
And I am a child of a white,
American, working class

01:30:39.290 --> 01:30:41.110
woman born abroad.

01:30:41.110 --> 01:30:43.120
And she's still
waiting for the Trump

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:45.640
miracle, which is supposed
to come and fix everything.

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:46.390
- Bless her heart.

01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:47.840
Yeah.

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:51.550
- So when I look at my
teenage children who

01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:53.970
go to an American
school in Nigeria,

01:30:53.970 --> 01:30:58.950
their attitudes towards LGBT
and smoking come from school.

01:30:58.950 --> 01:31:00.630
I didn't teach it at home.

01:31:00.630 --> 01:31:02.830
And so I'm wondering
if maybe this

01:31:02.830 --> 01:31:07.220
is a class here for young
people, just like 20 years ago,

01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:10.270
30 years ago in America
we were studying diversity

01:31:10.270 --> 01:31:11.430
and what that meant.

01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:16.450
I think, though, it has to
include the new minority, which

01:31:16.450 --> 01:31:19.552
is working class America.

01:31:19.552 --> 01:31:21.982
[APPLAUSE]

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:25.540
- Just to say, I
mean, my next project

01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:30.220
is to write a book trying
to reinstill civics

01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:31.149
in the United States.

01:31:31.149 --> 01:31:31.648
- Good!

01:31:34.930 --> 01:31:38.280
I think the hook is here.

01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:39.030
Take it away.

01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:40.113
- What'd you just call me?

01:31:40.113 --> 01:31:41.260
I'm kidding.

01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:43.330
Thank you very much
to our panelists,

01:31:43.330 --> 01:31:46.090
to David Gergen for
moderating this panel.

01:31:46.090 --> 01:31:48.400
We could go on for another hour.

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:52.600
It's a sign of the skill with
which the conversation was

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:55.450
conducted and the brilliance
and thoughtfulness

01:31:55.450 --> 01:31:56.447
of our panelists.

01:31:56.447 --> 01:31:57.280
Thank you very much.

01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:03.580
I'm going to offer
some quick concluding

01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:06.940
remarks and some thanks.

01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:09.370
I realize that I'm
standing between you

01:32:09.370 --> 01:32:13.360
and the weekend
and/or the reception.

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.090
I know that's in there, too.

01:32:15.090 --> 01:32:16.040
Liz, thank you.

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.170
So I will be brief.

01:32:18.170 --> 01:32:19.120
I want to thank--

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:21.350
this has been a
fantastic conference.

01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:23.920
I want to thank, first, the
academic ventures group that

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:27.250
planned it, Becky Wasserman
and her amazing staff,

01:32:27.250 --> 01:32:29.640
Sean O'Donnell,
Jennifer [? Birkat, ?]

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:32.830
Kristen Osborne, Moore Madden.

01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:37.240
I want to thank Jessica Vickland
and our fantastic events staff.

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.700
I want to thank the
planning committee, a number

01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:43.900
of professors who, actually, for
over a year, planned the event.

01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:46.850
That includes Professors
Sarah [? Blige, ?] Melanie

01:32:46.850 --> 01:32:49.510
[? Kammets, ?] Jane
Kamensky, Michelle Lemont,

01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:50.840
and Mark Tushnet.

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:55.960
And I'd be remiss if I didn't
thank our dean, Liz Cohen.

01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:57.820
I've known Liz for a long time.

01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:59.840
[APPLAUSE]

01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:05.410
She is a fellow scholar
of US politics, as am I.

01:33:05.410 --> 01:33:07.840
But she insisted
throughout my time

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:11.590
here as Radcliffe that
we include, indeed,

01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:13.900
prioritize global perspectives.

01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:15.510
And she insisted
on this centrality

01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:18.670
of the arts and humanities
to what we do, science,

01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:19.640
as well, by the way.

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:22.840
And so when you see
Jhumpa Lahiri, Celeste Ng,

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:29.440
Cynthia Lopez, Maria Agui
Carter, and others, thank Liz.

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:32.770
She has really
introduced that and made

01:33:32.770 --> 01:33:34.850
it central to our culture.

01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:39.100
And as you may know, she is
concluding her decanal services

01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:40.510
here within a few months.

01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:41.890
We're not going to lose her.

01:33:41.890 --> 01:33:43.360
I know, but yes.

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.590
But we're going to
miss you as a dean.

01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:46.440
Thank you so much.

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.440
[APPLAUSE]

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:56.400
I do want to offer just a
quick set of concluding remarks

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:59.820
because Liz told me to.

01:33:59.820 --> 01:34:01.630
Who belongs?

01:34:01.630 --> 01:34:04.560
This is a quotidien call.

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:09.690
It is answered every day,
as is the question posed,

01:34:09.690 --> 01:34:12.300
by institutions
and rules that are

01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:15.090
every bit of a part
of our fabric and life

01:34:15.090 --> 01:34:18.150
but are often less visible,
sometimes entirely invisible.

01:34:18.150 --> 01:34:21.510
So I want to focus on two
categories, written rules

01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:23.940
and unwritten
rules, if you will.

01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:26.790
We heard about written
rules in the world

01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:29.010
of birthright citizenship.

01:34:29.010 --> 01:34:31.540
We heard about how
structures of law,

01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:33.560
particularly
birthright citizenship,

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:35.520
converts the state
into something

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:38.280
of an emperor of whim,
of chance, of just, where

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:40.710
did you happen to
be born, and then

01:34:40.710 --> 01:34:42.480
converting that
into your status,

01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:44.940
your identity, your resources.

01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:48.240
We heard Martha Jones talk about
the limited and discretionary

01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:51.180
ways in which birthright
citizenship was applied

01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:53.400
and extended in her
wonderful metaphor,

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:57.630
birthright citizenship as the
haven and the scythe at once.

01:34:57.630 --> 01:34:59.820
We heard Sarah Leah
Whitson describe

01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:04.350
about how, in Jordan, Jordanian
birthright citizenship was

01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:06.520
linked to Jordanian
fatherhood, but not

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:09.120
the Jordanian motherhood
or to the children

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:13.050
of Jordanian mothers
without Jordanian fathers.

01:35:13.050 --> 01:35:15.000
And it's worth remembering
that the birther

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.900
movement, or that meme,
for a while, linked

01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:22.230
to a different kind
of citizenship, one

01:35:22.230 --> 01:35:25.050
actually not connected
to the 14th Amendment,

01:35:25.050 --> 01:35:27.810
but connected to article
two of our constitution,

01:35:27.810 --> 01:35:29.850
the original
Constitution, and the way

01:35:29.850 --> 01:35:34.080
that it defines eligibility
for our presidency.

01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:36.810
We also talked about
immigration structures.

01:35:36.810 --> 01:35:38.580
Immigration judges
of the sort that

01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:42.690
were talked about by Professor
Carey Huang of Boston College

01:35:42.690 --> 01:35:43.777
Law School.

01:35:43.777 --> 01:35:45.360
And it's interesting
that those judges

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:48.990
are answerable to and
employed by not the Supreme

01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:52.890
Court, the judicial branch, but
by the executive branch, which

01:35:52.890 --> 01:35:54.930
is one reason that they
are subject to some

01:35:54.930 --> 01:35:59.100
of the directives of
Attorney General Sessions

01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:01.740
and of President Trump,
which means at some level

01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:04.770
that the access to an
independent judiciary

01:36:04.770 --> 01:36:09.625
in our country is itself
conditioned upon citizenship.

01:36:09.625 --> 01:36:11.750
And as another way of
thinking about written rules,

01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:14.360
we heard about the really
interesting research of Tali

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:18.050
Mendelberg, and the way in
which even a voting rule, which

01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:20.660
is to say, what's the threshold
that determines by which

01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:24.650
something gets passed or failed
in a vote, majority, or simply

01:36:24.650 --> 01:36:26.600
unanimity, but the
way that affects

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:28.340
the way people participate.

01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:32.300
So the written rules are
there with us everywhere.

01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:35.480
But I think rules
are often sometimes

01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:37.910
most powerful when
they're implicit,

01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:40.550
when they're unwritten,
and when they're assumed.

01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:43.370
I have a friend, an
African-American man

01:36:43.370 --> 01:36:45.170
I've known for a long
time, a good friend.

01:36:45.170 --> 01:36:46.585
He's a PhD psychologist.

01:36:46.585 --> 01:36:48.960
He told me something recently
that kind of stuck with me.

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:51.335
He said, well, when you hear
about the canary in the coal

01:36:51.335 --> 01:36:55.324
mine, the important
point when you're

01:36:55.324 --> 01:36:57.740
hearing about that metaphor
of the canary in the coal mine

01:36:57.740 --> 01:37:00.500
isn't about the canary.

01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:01.640
It's about the context.

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:04.940
It's about the gaseous
threats that are

01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:06.337
emerging from the coal mine.

01:37:06.337 --> 01:37:08.420
And so the point isn't
really about the thing that

01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:10.010
keels over and stops chirping.

01:37:10.010 --> 01:37:13.010
It's about the context.

01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:16.460
And that invisible context, I
think, is with us everywhere.

01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:19.430
To get back to, for instance,
Tali Mendelberg's idea

01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:22.337
of just the number of people
in the room who are women.

01:37:22.337 --> 01:37:24.170
You know, a lot of the
experimental subjects

01:37:24.170 --> 01:37:26.336
probably didn't know that,
oh, look, it's all women,

01:37:26.336 --> 01:37:28.970
or it's 80% women as
opposed to 20% women.

01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:31.130
Yet, that invisible
fact structured

01:37:31.130 --> 01:37:32.960
the way they treated
others and the way

01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:34.845
they rated them is influential.

01:37:34.845 --> 01:37:39.650
You can think about Fatma Muge
Gogek's point about, well,

01:37:39.650 --> 01:37:43.550
does everybody just have one
identity, just one nationality?

01:37:43.550 --> 01:37:47.000
That's a common assumption
that we all make.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.880
Or Joan Williams', I think, very
thoughtful, poignant criticism,

01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:56.610
have working class people of
whatever race in this country,

01:37:56.610 --> 01:37:59.510
in the United States, been
stripped of a certain degree

01:37:59.510 --> 01:38:02.900
of cultural citizenship or
of educational citizenship?

01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:04.790
Have they been
assumed irredeemable

01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:06.980
based on where they live?

01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:11.210
I note as somebody who grew up
in a small town in the Midwest,

01:38:11.210 --> 01:38:15.800
that that is not merely a
simple, white racial fact

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:16.880
that she's pointing to.

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:19.460
There were many Native
American reservations

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:24.530
that went from 60/40 Obama
Romney to 60/40 Trump

01:38:24.530 --> 01:38:26.720
Clinton for some of
the same reasons,

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.897
namely, that their economies had
been wrecked in recent years.

01:38:29.897 --> 01:38:31.730
Does that mean that
dynamics are not racial?

01:38:31.730 --> 01:38:32.690
Of course not.

01:38:32.690 --> 01:38:34.850
Does that mean they're
deeply involved with class

01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:36.530
and economic trajectories?

01:38:36.530 --> 01:38:38.770
Yes, it does.

01:38:38.770 --> 01:38:41.890
We heard Nulifer
Gole's discussion

01:38:41.890 --> 01:38:44.740
of Muslim women in
Europe, especially France,

01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:49.510
and the idea of the burkini,
and her asking this question of,

01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:53.770
does belonging entail the
subjugation of our identities

01:38:53.770 --> 01:38:55.120
for some people?

01:38:55.120 --> 01:39:01.030
For instance, of the idea of the
corporeal person or personhood,

01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:04.480
and how people, especially
Muslim women, treat,

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:07.450
cover, and display
their own bodies?

01:39:07.450 --> 01:39:11.690
Or think of the father in
Jhumpa Lahiri's beautiful story,

01:39:11.690 --> 01:39:15.610
Il Confine, The
Boundary, that father

01:39:15.610 --> 01:39:18.260
who had retreated to the
countryside, who, in a sense,

01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:22.630
had exiled himself from his
own nation, his new nation,

01:39:22.630 --> 01:39:24.760
living away from the
city so he didn't

01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:27.670
have to expose his
shattered teeth,

01:39:27.670 --> 01:39:30.790
so he didn't have to
expose his infacility

01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:34.660
with the official tongue.

01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:38.440
So who belongs strikes me as the
fundamental political question

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:39.910
of our time.

01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:43.750
And our answers often
come in the form

01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:46.480
of borders, not merely
concrete borders,

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.860
but categorical borders.

01:39:47.860 --> 01:39:49.870
And those borders can be fluid.

01:39:49.870 --> 01:39:51.520
They can be paraffine.

01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:54.910
They can be cemented
in a Trumpian fantasy

01:39:54.910 --> 01:39:56.740
and built very high.

01:39:56.740 --> 01:39:58.990
But those borders are
always constructed,

01:39:58.990 --> 01:40:02.140
even if the president
wishes to construct them.

01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:05.830
But that means not just that the
cement borders are constructed,

01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:07.480
but so are the categorical ones.

01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:10.450
And so, to get back to one of
the calls from one of our very

01:40:10.450 --> 01:40:14.200
first speakers today, professor
Kerry Kari Hong, maybe we,

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:18.280
in part, start changing those
borders by changing our talk,

01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:20.740
by changing the
talk, including--

01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:22.930
to get back to Joan Williams--

01:40:22.930 --> 01:40:26.260
the talk that we regularly
and assumably carry

01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:27.760
on in our universities.

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:29.560
And I'll conclude there.

01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:32.310
[APPLAUSE]
