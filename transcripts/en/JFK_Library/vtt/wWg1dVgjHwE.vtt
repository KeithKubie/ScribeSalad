00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:02.565
- It is young leaders like
President John F. Kennedy

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:04.507
and Reverend Martin
Luther King that remind me

00:00:04.507 --> 00:00:07.321
every single day that
age does not determine

00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:09.974
my ability to make an impact.

00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:13.836
Like my fellow honoree,
Max Kenner, we must all be

00:00:13.836 --> 00:00:17.460
ever more committed to
helping the least of those,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.178
those people that have been outcasted

00:00:19.178 --> 00:00:22.268
and those communities that
have been counted out.

00:00:22.268 --> 00:00:24.195
President Kennedy said it best,

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:28.597
"If a free society cannot
help the many who are poor,

00:00:28.597 --> 00:00:30.670
"it cannot save the few that are rich."
