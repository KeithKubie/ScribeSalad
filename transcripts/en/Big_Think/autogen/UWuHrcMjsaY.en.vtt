about it I think is that we really
really think about it tape first like

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379
really think about it tape first like
 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.470
really think about it tape first like

gonna be huge story like you're gonna
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.080
gonna be huge story like you're gonna
take those pieces of tape you're gonna

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
take those pieces of tape you're gonna
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.560
take those pieces of tape you're gonna
lay them out and all the writing is

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570
lay them out and all the writing is
 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.700
lay them out and all the writing is
really secondary to that where it's like

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
really secondary to that where it's like
 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.160
really secondary to that where it's like
what are the what kind of writing can

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170
what are the what kind of writing can
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.109
what are the what kind of writing can
get me through these pieces of tape that

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119
get me through these pieces of tape that
 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.539
get me through these pieces of tape that
I want to play for the listener and it's

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549
I want to play for the listener and it's
 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.429
