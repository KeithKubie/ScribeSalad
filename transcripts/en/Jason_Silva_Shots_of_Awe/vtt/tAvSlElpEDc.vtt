[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:15.990
SPEAKER: So we have a
constant conversation

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.150
in society about the role of
technology in the world, right.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.290
Mankind has this capacity
to extend his agency

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.280
into these scaffoldings,
into these tools that

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.510
are beyond his
biological skin tissue.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.000
We extend our mind,
we're out into the world.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.580
The Mars Rover right now
crawls the surface of Mars,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.920
extending our optic
nerve into space.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.380
That is what we
do with our tools.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.630
And, increasingly, these
tools are giving us

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.680
transformation,
disruption, they're

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.230
giving us new construction
kits for our reality.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.300
You know, Mark Pesce
has a great line.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.650
He says that advances in
emerging biotechnology,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.110
which gives us the power to
harness the software of life.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.510
And in emerging
technologies of nanotech,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.730
which allow us to pattern
the physical atoms

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.790
of the physical
world increasingly

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.650
are making the world
linguistically pliable, right.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.800
DNA is code.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.560
The material science
of nanotech allows

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.030
us to turn this into
something that can be rendered

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.050
at the speed of thought.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.140
This notion of reality, of the
world becoming linguistically

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.560
pliable tells us that
mind, okay, that agency,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.400
that sentience has overpowered
the biosphere, the mind sphere,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.440
the noosphere is now a
force of geological impact.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.590
Consider that the
next time you're

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.090
sitting a dinner
talking to somebody

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.670
about the role of technology.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.860
I mean, it's really like

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.070
[LAUGH]

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.940
it's the bursting
forth of a new agency,

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.750
a new agent of evolution.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.000
We are evolution evolving
its own evolvability, right.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.350
Man, who knows where we're
going to go with that, who

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.700
knows what we're going to do.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.750
