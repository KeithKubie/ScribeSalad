00:00:01.043 --> 00:00:02.920
"The Goalie’s Anxiety
at the Penalty Kick"

00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:04.963
was really my first film.

00:00:05.215 --> 00:00:07.716
And to fly with it to New York
and present it at the MoMA

00:00:07.883 --> 00:00:10.470
do my very first interviews
in English

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.598
and stay in New York
for the very first time,

00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:16.141
that was...
unbelievable.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:17.726
I think I was here
for four days.

00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:20.188
I don’t think I slept
for one second.

00:00:25.443 --> 00:00:27.945
It had a short life
that film, because...

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:31.950
I had put
all the music I loved into it.

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:35.078
And you see
I was quite naïve and made it

00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:39.581
for German theatrical use,
and television in Germany.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.003
So all the music rights
I had only acquired for Germany

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:46.213
and theatre
for a number of years.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.978
I didn’t think the film was...

00:00:48.145 --> 00:00:51.108
Nobody thought
films had a longer life.

00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:55.715
So I acquired Elvis
and Roy Orbison,

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:59.018
Van Morrison
and Creedence Clearwater

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:03.523
for just a couple of years.

00:01:04.148 --> 00:01:06.400
And after that the film
was practically dead.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.611
It had a glorious time
in New York

00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:10.405
and was shown for a while.

00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:12.948
It even got distribution later on.

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:15.826
But then we had
to stop it, because...

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:19.413
to reacquire all those rights
for international territories

00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:21.916
would have cost
more than the entire film.

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:25.545
So it is only now, 40 years later,

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.963
that we freed the film again.

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:30.591
I had always produced
my films myself

00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:32.760
so I always owned them,

00:01:33.678 --> 00:01:36.596
which is of course great,
you can control them.

00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:38.768
But the drawback is that...

00:01:39.308 --> 00:01:41.310
anything you own
you can also lose.

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:45.190
And in 2000 I actually lost
possession of my entire work.

00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:47.358
Long, sad story.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.610
Then for ten years,

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:50.945
I watched the movies
that were still distributed

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.615
but they were owned
by big commercial companies.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.621
These commercial entities are not
so much interested in restoration.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.126
Because that means to invest
and they rather exploit it.

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.421
And then after ten years, finally...

00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:12.841
my wife and I,
we had the cool idea

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.803
not to buy it back
because I wasn’t so interested

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.890
in personally owning
my work again.

00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:21.251
That had gone wrong
already twice.

00:02:21.418 --> 00:02:23.501
I don’t think it’s an ideal form

00:02:23.758 --> 00:02:26.056
for movies to survive
to be owned by somebody.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.365
I think it’s better
if they own themselves.

00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:31.693
And the only form
that allows work

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.030
to own itself is a foundation.

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:37.158
So it took us two years to...

00:02:38.038 --> 00:02:39.536
collect all that money,

00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:42.746
with the foundation to acquire
each and every movie back.

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.831
Now they’re all
owned by the foundation,

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.751
and the foundation
so far has already restored eight.

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.546
When you get into restoration
and you really...

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.090
realize it’s a whole craft

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.885
and you realize
the mistakes you can do

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:58.805
you can over-restore it,
so all of a sudden

00:02:58.971 --> 00:03:01.418
it looks as if it was shot today
and it was digital

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:03.810
and that of course
is not what we wanted.

00:03:04.435 --> 00:03:06.896
So the basic idea
was to make it look

00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:10.190
as good as it could
have looked in the first print.

00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:13.360
So any hairs in the gate
that were in the first print

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.155
I left them in
because I figured...

00:03:16.948 --> 00:03:19.158
well, we could take them out

00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:21.535
but in that first print
they were there.

00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:23.328
So we kept all the grain,

00:03:24.406 --> 00:03:28.488
we stabilized the image a little bit
because the 16mm image...

00:03:29.843 --> 00:03:32.383
always jumps a little bit,
especially every cut.

00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:34.453
So we stabilized it.
I thought that was...

00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:37.260
an improvement
that was pleasant for the eye.

00:03:38.858 --> 00:03:40.628
And every scratch and stuff...

00:03:41.485 --> 00:03:44.938
of course we did
our best to take it out.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.230
But on the other hand,
we still liked to give it that...

00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:52.775
film look, not work against it,

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:55.653
what really bring it out
as good as possible.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.948
Scanned it in 4K but as it’s 16,

00:03:59.115 --> 00:04:00.408
we finished it in 2K

00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:03.076
because there’s not
more information on it.

00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:07.581
And I think it now looks
as good as it can possibly look.

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:12.171
It was a great pleasure
to see it reanimated.

00:04:12.795 --> 00:04:15.411
Our inspiration
was Walker Evans, strictly,

00:04:15.578 --> 00:04:17.455
and we looked at
a lot of his stuff.

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.428
Our inspiration wasn’t
any other black and white films

00:04:20.595 --> 00:04:22.138
but strictly photography.

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:25.056
Framing-wise, but also aesthetics.

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:28.310
Whenever I found anything
in corrugated iron,

00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:29.311
we stopped and shot.

00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:32.398
Because I thought that was
the coolest thing in black and white.

00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:36.563
And of course for Alice,

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.613
that was the first time I was
actually able to shoot in America.

00:04:40.573 --> 00:04:43.993
It was quite an improvised shoot,
we were a tiny little crew.

00:04:45.043 --> 00:04:50.028
And I wanted to start it
somewhere in the South

00:04:50.195 --> 00:04:53.043
and we didn’t really have the money
to go all the way to Florida.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:54.920
So we traveled down and I said,

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:58.006
“When we see the first palm trees,
we’ll start shooting.”

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.175
And that became North Carolina.

00:05:00.468 --> 00:05:04.805
So for some reason it starts
in Surf City, North Carolina.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.308
It was also
the first road movie that I shot.

00:05:09.386 --> 00:05:11.455
That little film
"Alice in the Cities" was...

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.690
a way for me to discover
that there was a genre

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.026
where I could feel
like a fish in the water.

00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:20.913
It was very liberating
to shoot with such a little crew,

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:23.490
and direct sound...

00:05:24.565 --> 00:05:26.163
And on the road traveling,

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:29.668
and stopping wherever
I saw something that I liked

00:05:29.835 --> 00:05:31.290
and we invent the scene there.

00:05:31.528 --> 00:05:33.796
Did you take a lot
of still photographs on that trip?

00:05:33.963 --> 00:05:37.546
I was still
a Polaroid photographer.

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:40.090
And "Alice in the Cities"
of course is the film

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:44.886
where people saw for the first time
the I-670 land camera.

00:05:45.763 --> 00:05:48.473
We got a prototype from them.

00:05:49.808 --> 00:05:52.353
And even when the film came out

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.105
most people had never seen
this camera where...

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.525
the picture came out,
and then you saw nothing

00:05:57.645 --> 00:05:59.850
and slowly it would develop
in front of your eyes.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.363
So that was
the big fetish of the film.

00:06:04.448 --> 00:06:07.630
But you were interested
in Polaroids before that.

00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:10.366
What drew you
to Polaroids as opposed to Leicas

00:06:10.533 --> 00:06:13.110
or printing in a darkroom?

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:18.295
I loved the idea
that they only existed one.

00:06:19.195 --> 00:06:20.608
I liked the idea that...

00:06:21.215 --> 00:06:23.466
you took a picture
and it only existed once.

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:25.301
Of course you could make copies

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:28.890
but I never did, and I liked
the idea that it was...

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:32.685
You took it once
and it existed once,

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:35.605
and it was just
one piece that was...

00:06:35.938 --> 00:06:39.191
entirely related
to that second that you took it.

00:06:41.318 --> 00:06:43.736
There was
so much truth about the act,

00:06:44.456 --> 00:06:47.838
and there is nothing
phony about a Polaroid.

00:06:48.005 --> 00:06:49.701
Because you can’t fake anything.

00:06:50.035 --> 00:06:52.078
You can’t interfere
with the process.

00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:55.248
And once it’s there, that’s
what it is, that’s all you get.

00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:58.585
I really liked that;
for years, I didn’t do anything else.

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:01.630
Later on, I went
to a larger form and negatives,

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:04.591
and took photography
more seriously.

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.885
But at the time,

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:11.223
that was the first camera
you could actually do selfies with.

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:16.228
The first camera you can
really be very spontaneous.

00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:18.396
Also give those pictures away,

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:21.150
sometimes people
just didn’t know...

00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:24.361
you could do something
and then hand it over to them

00:07:24.528 --> 00:07:26.071
and say, “Keep it.”
