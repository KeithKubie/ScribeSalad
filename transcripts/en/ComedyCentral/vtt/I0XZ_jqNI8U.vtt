00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:03.536
-Mike, you're a nice guy.

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:05.171
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:07.173
But not everyone is
as nice as you.

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:09.409
-That's true.
-I think it's important

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:12.078
to let the audience know
who's being nice

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:13.880
and who's being not nice

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:18.584
in our very first desk piece,
called "Nice! Not Nice!"

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:21.054
-♪ ♪
-(applause, whooping, cheering)

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.060
Nice!

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:30.063
Marine Le Pen.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:32.598
She's French, she's blonde,

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:34.801
and she hates Muslims.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:38.037
She's a triple threat.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.039
Not nice!

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:43.242
-Marine World.
-Mm.

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:46.312
The whales are sixes,
the dolphins are fours,

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:48.681
and the only tens
are the penguins--

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:52.252
-and they're all married!
-Mm-hmm. Tough.

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:57.890
Nice.

00:00:57.923 --> 00:01:01.360
My lovely daughter, Ivanka.

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:04.697
Her skin is like Italian marble,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.600
and her hair is like...

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:09.602
really great hair.

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:11.404
I don't know.

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:12.839
Not nice!

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:15.975
The German people who booed her
when she defended me

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:17.977
at a conference in Berlin.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.278
Disgusting!

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:23.182
This is the worst thing
the Germans have ever done.

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:24.851
Ever.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:26.419
Ever, Mike. Ever.

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:27.487
Well...

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.755
Nice.

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:31.891
Nice.

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:34.827
Clam chowder.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.096
Thick, creamy, hot.

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:39.932
I could drink it with a straw.

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:41.567
Not nice!

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.603
Corn chowder.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:45.171
It's fake chowder.

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:47.073
Fake chowder.

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:50.476
You're taking jobs away
from hardworking clams.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.280
This American "cornage"
ends now.

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:55.648
(applause, whooping)

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.251
I'm gonna mix it up.
I'm gonna mix it up, Mike.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:01:59.819
-Oh, okay.
-I'm gonna mix it up.

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:01.120
Are you ready? Are you ready?

00:02:01.153 --> 00:02:02.722
-I'm-I'm Ready Freddy.
-We're mixing it up.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.924
-Ready Freddy.
-Not nice!

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:07.493
Press Secretary Sean Spicer.

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:10.229
-(ooh'ing and oh'ing)
-He's a muttering slobbermouth

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:12.231
with a taste for his own foot.

00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:15.801
Why... why don't I fire
this guy?

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:17.170
Nice.

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:20.140
Sean Spicer's TV ratings--
I can't fire this guy.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:23.709
His ratings are tremendous.

00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:26.146
We love ratings,
and Spicer brings 'em in.
