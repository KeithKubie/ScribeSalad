1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,630
And have so much money. I'm sure.
Look, it's a good move and rightly so,

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,770
that Bayzos dude's burning money. You
can do whatever the fuck you want. Yes.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,500
So much money.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,430
Although his girl has half now she's
third on the list of richest Chakachak

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,300
Chuck. Yeah, he has that dimey
piece with them now though.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,430
Hulu has gotten that game too for
live stuff, so there's not that.

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,800
It's like everyone is playing the game
pretty soon. It's going to be over.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,470
Imagine if you're trying to
do a shoot a sitcom right now.

9
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:29,460
Could you imagine if a guy got divorced
from a woman who was like a duchess or

10
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:33,030
some shit and made out in the
deal as good as Jeff Bezos,

11
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:35,220
his wife was gonna make it out to be sick.

12
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:37,650
Does she initiated like $1
billion or something like that?

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,830
She had way more inability.
Get Billy Young son.

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,440
They said as soon as they divorced she
going to be like top 10 richest in the

15
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:44,274
world.
Yeah.

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,310
He gave her like 25% of its stock
or some crazy shit he get. Yeah.

17
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:53,400
Like, but they did start together
like his room. Yes. Listen man. Yeah.

18
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:58,020
She deserves it. But it's
hilarious. It's so much money.

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,060
Like damn.
She banked on it correctly.

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,780
She's hanging out with that dude when he
was like 24. Go on this fucking psycho.

21
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,710
Have you seen that around the world? Have
you seen that? Yes. That picture. Yes.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,940
Yeah. That is amazing. That's, I
want that. Send me that picture.

23
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,420
I know you're a picture.
Do me a favor and send that to my phone.

24
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:17,310
I need to see that. Isn't that
great phone? I'm going to,

25
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,630
I'm going to put that as my,
uh,

26
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,840
I'm going to replace the American
flag with that in that great.

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,430
I'm serious end. He's like,
and he's like shaved his head.

28
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:29,790
Trt on malice,
bawling.

29
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,160
Just look at that banner on the wall.
Look at the,

30
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,100
just the little [inaudible]
banner. Look at him there, dude.

31
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:40,260
And have you seen his new
girl? What's up? Holla? Sure.

32
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:43,770
That caught you about $40 billion,
but you gotta be happy. Yeah.

33
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,770
He looks like he's enjoying us.
When you have 80 billion, what's 40?

34
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:49,830
Who gives a fuck, how much can you
spend? And by the way, I spend it.

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,260
Do you think he's going to, he's,
here's the problem with that dude.

36
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,910
He might be making so much money that
you think about it like when did Amazon

37
00:01:56,911 --> 00:02:01,450
even start? Was it 15 years ago? I mean
what second ago? It wasn't that long.

38
00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:05,790
I don't know what's going to be like 15
years from now when he's on fucking gene

39
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,250
doping and they got them

40
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,410
back dated to a 24 year old Bayzos
Tj's Chin looks thicker is he's got a

41
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:19,110
shoulder caps Ron and she's going
to be 85 years old running shit,

42
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:23,460
looking 30 how much money do you need?
He'll have that guy billion,

43
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,480
billion dollars. Like how much
money? This is my point. Like if,

44
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,510
if he stays healthy and is enthusiastic
and still has like this drive to

45
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:31,921
succeed,

46
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:35,970
how much is going to be worth how when
you start getting that kind of momentum.

47
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:40,350
That's why companies like that's why you
get people like Elizabeth Warren but I

48
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:41,940
don't know too much about her politics.

49
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:43,790
But one of the things that
I do know about her is um,

50
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,120
she wants to shut down or break
up some of these big companies.

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,980
You know there's a,
yeah,

52
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,220
I forget what big companies
she was talking about but
that would be an example.

53
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,270
Like yeah, just too much
power. So much about,

54
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,410
she'd probably want to break them up.

55
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,000
It's interesting cause it's
like you see like what is,

56
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,620
when you see capitalism play out right,
you see someone, they start a business,

57
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:06,371
they want to kick ass,

58
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:09,310
they want to make a lot of money and then
they do and then they keep calling and

59
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:12,910
then they get to this point where
they can make more money more easily,

60
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,310
more often. And they just
keep going, keep going.

61
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,410
And then they get to this point where if
you hit the right river at the perfect

62
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:23,080
time, but the most ambitious
person ever at the helm,

63
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,650
and you've got this fucking boat running,
running down this river,

64
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,730
just pass and everybody, that's
where you got Amazon with Jeff Bezos.

65
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,940
It was the perfect guy at the perfect
time with the perfect adjusting to the

66
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,910
role of scrooge McDuck he's,
he's making, he's like,

67
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,880
Elon wants to make a rocket shop.
Give me a rocket ship. Correct.

68
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,300
It's an ego thing. Why is he going
to need that work spaces too though?

69
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,640
You have nothing to do.
Like what challenges does he have?

70
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,510
That one click is the shit. If you
need something, it's the Shit Amazon.
