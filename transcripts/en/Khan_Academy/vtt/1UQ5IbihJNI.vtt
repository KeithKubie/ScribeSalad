00:00:00.243 --> 00:00:01.580
- [Voiceover] So we have an interesting

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.530
shape right over here.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.931
The base is a rectangular prism.

00:00:05.931 --> 00:00:07.751
And the dimensions of
that rectangular prism,

00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:10.485
it's three units I
guess we could say tall,

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:14.471
four units wide, and then four units long.

00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:16.909
And then on top of that, on top of that,

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:19.781
we have what you could
call a right pyramid,

00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:22.277
where the height of this right pyramid,

00:00:22.277 --> 00:00:25.814
so if you start at the center
of its base right over here,

00:00:25.814 --> 00:00:26.876
and you go to the top,

00:00:26.876 --> 00:00:29.996
this height right over here is one unit.

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:31.784
And this hasn't been
drawn completely to scale,

00:00:31.784 --> 00:00:33.809
and kind of the perspective
skews a little bit.

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.951
But our goal here, our goal here,

00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:40.780
is to figure out what is the length?

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.662
What is the length of one of
these edges right over here?

00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:49.624
So either that one, or
this one right over here.

00:00:49.624 --> 00:00:51.273
What is that length?

00:00:51.273 --> 00:00:55.118
And we will call that,
we will call that x.

00:00:55.118 --> 00:00:57.752
And so I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:57.752 --> 00:00:59.289
and try to think about it on your own.

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.585
Remember, this is a right,
this is a right pyramid.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.674
So what that tells us
is that this red line,

00:01:06.674 --> 00:01:11.039
that's one unit long, it is perpendicular,

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:15.702
it is perpendicular to this entire plane.

00:01:15.702 --> 00:01:17.498
It's perpendicular to the top

00:01:17.498 --> 00:01:20.959
of the rectangular prism.

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:23.860
So with that in mind, I encourage you to

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.263
pause the video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:01:27.263 --> 00:01:29.369
And I will give you a hint.

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.615
You will have to use
the Pythagorean theorum,

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:35.174
maybe more than once.

00:01:35.174 --> 00:01:39.385
Alright, so I am assuming
you've at least given it a shot.

00:01:39.385 --> 00:01:41.666
So let's work through it together.

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:46.015
So the key here is to
realize, well okay this point,

00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:48.298
this base right over here,
this point right over here

00:01:48.298 --> 00:01:50.249
it's half way in this direction

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:51.584
and half way in this direction.

00:01:51.584 --> 00:01:56.321
So we can figure out,
well this entire length

00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:59.318
right over here is length four.

00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:01.324
So half way, this is going to be,

00:02:01.324 --> 00:02:02.286
I'll write it with perspective.

00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:06.082
That's going to be two,
and that's going to be two.

00:02:06.082 --> 00:02:07.610
Just like that.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.975
And then the other
thing we can figure out,

00:02:09.975 --> 00:02:13.993
we can figure out what
this length is going to be.

00:02:13.993 --> 00:02:16.455
'Cause once again it's
half way in that direction.

00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:20.213
So if this whole thing is two,

00:02:20.213 --> 00:02:21.350
and we see it right over here.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.146
This is a rectangular
prism, so this length

00:02:23.146 --> 00:02:25.043
is going to be the same
thing as this length.

00:02:25.043 --> 00:02:27.172
So if this whole thing is
two, then each of these,

00:02:27.172 --> 00:02:29.064
this is going to be one,

00:02:29.064 --> 00:02:31.870
and this is going to be
one right over there.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.165
Well how does that help us?

00:02:34.165 --> 00:02:36.817
Well using that information,
we should be able

00:02:36.817 --> 00:02:40.529
to figure out this length.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.385
Actually, I'll keep it in this color

00:02:42.385 --> 00:02:44.017
'cause this color's easy to see.

00:02:44.017 --> 00:02:46.766
We should be able to
figure out this length.

00:02:46.878 --> 00:02:48.736
Well why is this length interesting?

00:02:48.736 --> 00:02:50.268
Well if we know that length,

00:02:50.268 --> 00:02:52.799
that length forms a right triangle.

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.618
That length and the one are the two

00:02:54.618 --> 00:02:57.111
non-hypotenuse sides of a right triangle.

00:02:57.111 --> 00:02:59.101
And then the x would be the hypotenuse.

00:02:59.101 --> 00:03:02.240
So we could just apply
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.702
So if we can figure out
this, we can figure out x.

00:03:05.702 --> 00:03:07.142
So let's do one step at a time.

00:03:07.142 --> 00:03:09.326
How do we figure out, how do we figure out

00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:11.735
I dunno, let me call this length.

00:03:11.735 --> 00:03:14.247
How do we figure out length a?

00:03:14.247 --> 00:03:15.593
Well let's just take it out

00:03:15.593 --> 00:03:17.773
and look at it in two dimensions.

00:03:17.773 --> 00:03:19.262
So if we look at it in two dimensions,

00:03:19.262 --> 00:03:22.184
If we look at it in two dimensions,

00:03:22.184 --> 00:03:24.164
it would look something like this.

00:03:24.164 --> 00:03:25.905
So that's our length a.

00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:27.856
We know that this length

00:03:27.856 --> 00:03:30.078
is half of this side right over here,

00:03:30.078 --> 00:03:31.733
so that's going to be one.

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:33.498
And actually let me do
it in the same colors.

00:03:33.498 --> 00:03:35.423
So this right over here

00:03:35.423 --> 00:03:38.757
is the same thing as this right over here.

00:03:38.757 --> 00:03:40.835
And it is going to be of length one.

00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:44.175
And then this right over here

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.786
is going to be the same
as this right over here,

00:03:48.786 --> 00:03:51.131
which is going to be of length two.

00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:53.891
And so we can just use the
Pythagorean theorem here.

00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:56.076
We know that the hypotenuse squared

00:03:56.076 --> 00:03:59.392
is going to be equal to one squared,

00:03:59.392 --> 00:04:02.367
one squared plus two squared.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.118
One squared plus two squared,

00:04:05.118 --> 00:04:08.962
which of course, is
equal to one plus four,

00:04:08.962 --> 00:04:10.904
which is equal to five.

00:04:10.904 --> 00:04:12.669
So we could write a...

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.796
Let me do this in the magenta color.

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:18.690
We can write a squared is equal to five,

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.245
or we could say that a is equal to

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:22.266
the principal root of five.

00:04:22.266 --> 00:04:24.538
So this length right over here

00:04:24.538 --> 00:04:29.138
is the square root of five,
the principal root of five.

00:04:29.138 --> 00:04:31.770
And now we can use that
information to solve for x.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.964
So let's take this right triangle.

00:04:32.964 --> 00:04:34.460
And it takes a little bit
of visualization practice

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.419
to visualize this right.

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:36.620
But notice, this is a right triangle.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.053
This height right here of
length one is perpendicular

00:04:40.053 --> 00:04:42.405
to this entire plane.

00:04:42.405 --> 00:04:44.202
So let's see if I can draw it.

00:04:44.202 --> 00:04:46.552
So we have this side

00:04:46.605 --> 00:04:49.926
is the square root of five.

00:04:49.926 --> 00:04:51.876
And then we have a height,

00:04:51.876 --> 00:04:53.617
Let me do it, looks like it's in a...

00:04:53.617 --> 00:04:56.430
Well, I'd say we're talkin' about

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.676
this height right over here is length one.

00:05:01.152 --> 00:05:04.879
So I'll draw that, that is of length one.

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.447
And we are trying to figure out x.

00:05:07.447 --> 00:05:11.297
We are trying to figure out x in orange.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.894
So we're trying to figure out this x.

00:05:15.894 --> 00:05:18.402
And once again, we know
this is a right triangle.

00:05:18.402 --> 00:05:20.915
This is a right triangle, so we can apply

00:05:20.915 --> 00:05:22.835
the Pythagorean theorem again.

00:05:22.835 --> 00:05:27.508
So we will have x squared
is equal to one squared.

00:05:27.508 --> 00:05:28.843
Which is just, I'll just write it

00:05:28.843 --> 00:05:31.769
one squared plus square
root of five squared,

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:35.250
plus square root of five squared.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.750
Well, that gets us x squared is equal to

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.644
one plus five, right?

00:05:41.644 --> 00:05:43.076
Square root of five squared is just five.

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:45.394
So one plus five is equal to six.

00:05:45.394 --> 00:05:49.737
So we get x is equal to
the square root of six.

00:05:49.737 --> 00:05:50.892
And we're done!

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:54.375
We figured out the length of
this side right over here.
