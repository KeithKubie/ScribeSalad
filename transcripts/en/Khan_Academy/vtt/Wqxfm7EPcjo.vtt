00:00:00.546 --> 00:00:01.379
- [Instructor] So, what we're gonna do

00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:04.327
is get a little bit of practicing
multiple numbers together

00:00:04.327 --> 00:00:06.310
and we're gonna discover some things.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.155
So, first I want you to figure out

00:00:08.155 --> 00:00:10.988
what four times five times two is.

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:17.516
Pause the video and try to
figure it out on your own.

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:19.141
Alright, so whatever your answer is,

00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:20.828
some of you might have done it this way,

00:00:20.828 --> 00:00:22.220
some of you might have said hey,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.805
what is four times five

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:25.945
and then you multiplied it by two,

00:00:25.945 --> 00:00:27.161
so what you would really have done

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:30.556
is you would have done
four times five first,

00:00:30.556 --> 00:00:32.411
so that's why I put
parentheses around that

00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:34.927
and then you would have multiplied by two

00:00:34.927 --> 00:00:36.325
and what would you have gotten?

00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:39.384
Weil, the four times five part,

00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:41.412
that is of course 20

00:00:41.412 --> 00:00:44.520
and then you multiply that times two

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.958
and you would get 40

00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:48.493
which of course would be correct,

00:00:48.493 --> 00:00:50.118
four times five times two

00:00:50.118 --> 00:00:52.404
is indeed equal to 40.

00:00:52.404 --> 00:00:54.262
Now, what I want you to do now

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:55.937
is as quickly as possible

00:00:55.937 --> 00:00:59.755
try to figure out what five times two

00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:01.382
times four is.

00:01:01.382 --> 00:01:04.467
Really quick, pause the
video, try to figure that out.

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:06.646
Well, some of you might have tried

00:01:06.646 --> 00:01:08.627
and you might have done
it in a similar way

00:01:08.627 --> 00:01:12.039
where you tried to figure
out five times two is first

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.128
and you said okay, five times two

00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:15.794
is equal to 10

00:01:15.794 --> 00:01:18.730
and then I'd multiply that times four

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.744
and then you would say well, gee,

00:01:19.744 --> 00:01:21.998
this is same thing as I got last time.

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:24.685
Is there something interesting going on?

00:01:24.685 --> 00:01:25.610
And the interesting thing

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.518
that you might realize is in both cases

00:01:27.518 --> 00:01:29.660
we're multiplying the same three numbers.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.637
We are just doing it in a different order.

00:01:31.637 --> 00:01:32.587
Here we multiplied four times,

00:01:32.587 --> 00:01:34.450
we wrote it out in a different order,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.847
four times five times two.

00:01:35.847 --> 00:01:38.101
Here we wrote five times two times four.

00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:40.333
Here we did the four times five first,

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.487
here we did the five times two first

00:01:42.487 --> 00:01:45.053
but notice we got the same result.

00:01:45.053 --> 00:01:46.699
Now, I'd encourage you, pause this video.

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:48.920
Try to multiply these numbers

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.216
in any order,

00:01:50.216 --> 00:01:53.290
maybe you do two times four first.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.636
In fact, let's just do that.

00:01:54.636 --> 00:01:56.636
Let's do two times four,

00:01:58.302 --> 00:01:59.613
two times four

00:01:59.613 --> 00:02:01.579
and then multiply that by five.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.010
What is this going to be equal to?

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.321
Well, you might notice again

00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:08.130
this is two times four is eight,

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.460
you multiply that times five.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.432
Well, once again, we got 40,

00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:15.397
so you might see a pattern here.

00:02:15.397 --> 00:02:19.793
It doesn't matter which order
we multiply these things in.

00:02:19.793 --> 00:02:23.960
In fact, you could write
four times five times two.

00:02:25.615 --> 00:02:28.554
You could do the four times five first,

00:02:28.554 --> 00:02:31.063
four times fives times two

00:02:31.063 --> 00:02:34.563
or you could do four times five times two,

00:02:35.706 --> 00:02:38.439
so you could do four times five times two.

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.190
So, it doesn't matter which order

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.866
you multiply these things in.

00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:44.287
In every case you are going to get 40.

00:02:44.287 --> 00:02:45.872
Now, there's a very fancy term for this,

00:02:45.872 --> 00:02:48.418
the associative property of multiplication

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:51.805
but the main realization
is and it's not just true

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:52.788
with the three numbers,

00:02:52.788 --> 00:02:54.445
in fact, you've seen something similar

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:56.199
with two numbers where it doesn't matter

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.987
what order you multiply them in

00:02:57.987 --> 00:02:59.549
but what you see with three numbers

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.110
and even if you tried it with four or five

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.228
or really 1,000 numbers

00:03:03.228 --> 00:03:04.563
being multiplied together,

00:03:04.563 --> 00:03:06.594
as long as you're just
multiplying them all,

00:03:06.594 --> 00:03:09.315
it doesn't matter what
order you're doing it with.

00:03:09.315 --> 00:03:10.725
It doesn't matter in what order

00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:12.251
you associate them with.

00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:13.900
Here we did four times five first,

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.535
four times five first,

00:03:15.535 --> 00:03:16.971
here we did five times two first

00:03:16.971 --> 00:03:18.107
but in either case

00:03:18.107 --> 00:03:19.335
we got the same result

00:03:19.335 --> 00:03:21.130
and I'd encourage you, after this video,

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.182
try to draw it out.

00:03:22.182 --> 00:03:24.871
Try to think about why that
actually makes intuitive sense,

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.252
why this is true in the world

00:03:27.252 --> 00:03:29.422
and it's nice because
it simplifies our life

00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:31.195
when we're doing mathematics

00:03:31.195 --> 00:03:34.363
and not only now but in our
future mathematical career.
