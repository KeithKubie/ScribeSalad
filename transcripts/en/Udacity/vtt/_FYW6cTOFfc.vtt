one answer. And we, we saw some instances of that. Be open during the process of

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.040
analyses to the possibility of new requirements arising or

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.120
that there's ambiguities. Or infact, that there, mistakes have been made.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.560
And this may mean for the consultation with the customer. The fact that a simple

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.500
set of requirements can have so many issues, should illustrate the value of

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.890
performing this kind of careful thinking that is but the kind of

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.439
careful thinking that is required in order to construct an OCL specification.
