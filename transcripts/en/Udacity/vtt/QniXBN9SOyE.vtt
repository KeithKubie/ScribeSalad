I don't have to change very much. If I run the tester initially, it won't

00:00:04.018 --> 00:00:09.627
compile. Because right now, andahlSpeedup isn't a static method. And I can't

00:00:09.627 --> 00:00:15.170
call non-static methods from the static main method. But if I go here and

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.240
declare this as public static double andahlSpeedup and public static double

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.664
crossRatio, and public static double average. Now, I can compile and run the

00:00:26.664 --> 00:00:29.980
tester method. Looks good.
