GUNTHER ROLAND: There's
a couple of new elements

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.960
that we've introduced
in the last few years.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.970
One is that the students write
a proposal for an experiment

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.120
that they want to do
and develop themselves.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.340
And for that experiment,
they can use any material

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.860
that you have in the lab
or anything that they

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.450
can find at MIT and other in
labs of former UROP advisors

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.310
or people that they know.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.570
And sometimes even buy
some equipment for them

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.170
if it's a particularly
interesting proposal

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.630
and we think that it can be
used in future experiments.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.570
So that proposal, develop
your own experiment

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.630
and really see through
the whole process

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.680
not starting from a
prefabricated experiment

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.510
but coming up with
your own, that's

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.637
a really unique
experience in 8.14

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:55.470
and I think something
that is very difficult

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.110
to find outside of the lab.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.080
And then we also have
included in the last two years

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.980
a post-session at the end
that the students present

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.442
the results of
their own experiment

00:01:09.442 --> 00:01:11.400
to the other students in
the lab, to the staff,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.860
and then to any member of
the physics department that

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.330
happens to walk past.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.240
We try to time that with
the physics faculty lounge

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.550
so that the big professors
walk past the post-session

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.550
and then the students
can explain to them

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.710
their own experiment,
what they found

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.150
in that part of the course.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.420
So I think that's really
a different than what

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.510
you do in 8.13 when you
start with experiments that

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.511
have been done by generations
and generations of students

00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:40.010
before.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.400
And I think the students
really like that.
