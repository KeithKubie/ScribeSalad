the idea of what we should be testing is

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540
the idea of what we should be testing is
 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.560
the idea of what we should be testing is
a very hotly debated because there's a

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
a very hotly debated because there's a
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.209
a very hotly debated because there's a
certain objectivity that we think we

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219
certain objectivity that we think we
 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.790
certain objectivity that we think we
have once we standardize things and we

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800
have once we standardize things and we
 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.050
have once we standardize things and we
give it the same tests to everyone and

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060
give it the same tests to everyone and
 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.939
give it the same tests to everyone and
there is some truth to that that the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949
there is some truth to that that the
 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.660
there is some truth to that that the
more you standardize a test the more you

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670
more you standardize a test the more you
 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.340
more you standardize a test the more you
kind of give everyone the opportunity to

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350
kind of give everyone the opportunity to
 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.440
kind of give everyone the opportunity to
to perform on that test there so there

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450
to perform on that test there so there
 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.209
to perform on that test there so there
is some argument to be made towards

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219
is some argument to be made towards
 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.220
is some argument to be made towards
standardization but we don't have

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230
standardization but we don't have
 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.600
standardization but we don't have
standardized minds I mean no one has a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610
standardized minds I mean no one has a
 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.979
standardized minds I mean no one has a
standardized mind there's no such thing

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989
standardized mind there's no such thing
 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.700
standardized mind there's no such thing
as as an average mind so every one of us

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
as as an average mind so every one of us
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.760
as as an average mind so every one of us
every unique individual has a dynamic

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
every unique individual has a dynamic
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.580

desires I formulated a theory called it
 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.330
desires I formulated a theory called it
the theory of personal intelligence

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340
the theory of personal intelligence
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.670

one aspect that we are saying this is

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450
one aspect that we are saying this is
 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.639
one aspect that we are saying this is
the measure of intelligence whether it's

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
the measure of intelligence whether it's
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.959
the measure of intelligence whether it's
a standardized test or whether it's an

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
a standardized test or whether it's an
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.389
a standardized test or whether it's an
IQ test we say well this is we've

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399
IQ test we say well this is we've
 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.039
IQ test we say well this is we've
decided as a society that's our measure

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049
decided as a society that's our measure
 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.629
decided as a society that's our measure
of intelligence and then we compare

00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:08.639
of intelligence and then we compare
 

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:10.010
of intelligence and then we compare
everyone to each other on that one

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
everyone to each other on that one
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.779
everyone to each other on that one
metric I wanted to remove it to a

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789
metric I wanted to remove it to a
 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:13.879
metric I wanted to remove it to a
personal level and recognize that well

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:13.889
personal level and recognize that well
 

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:16.160
personal level and recognize that well
within a person every single one of us

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
within a person every single one of us
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.499
within a person every single one of us
has a combination of traits and we can

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509
has a combination of traits and we can
 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.840
has a combination of traits and we can
compensate for lower levels of one trait

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850
compensate for lower levels of one trait
 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.160
compensate for lower levels of one trait
with higher levels of another trait for

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170
with higher levels of another trait for
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.660
with higher levels of another trait for
instance we can compensate with lower

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670
instance we can compensate with lower
 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.209
instance we can compensate with lower
levels of IQ with grit you know or with

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219
levels of IQ with grit you know or with
 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.660
levels of IQ with grit you know or with
perseverance so there's we're capable of

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
perseverance so there's we're capable of
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.980
perseverance so there's we're capable of
mixing and matching our own unique

you are not being fed you know it's very
 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.780
you are not being fed you know it's very
hard to show your intellectual

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790

intellectual brilliance it is a fact
 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.890
intellectual brilliance it is a fact
that there's a huge under-representation

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900
that there's a huge under-representation

of ethnic and racial minority students
 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.390
of ethnic and racial minority students
in gifted and talented education and I

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400
in gifted and talented education and I
 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.580
in gifted and talented education and I
do not believe that ethnic and racial

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590
do not believe that ethnic and racial
 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.410
do not believe that ethnic and racial
matter students are less gifted that I

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420
matter students are less gifted that I

mean who was who wants to make that

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890
mean who was who wants to make that
 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.490
mean who was who wants to make that
argument yeah it's not it is not the the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500
argument yeah it's not it is not the the
 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.920
argument yeah it's not it is not the the
reality of the matter and what you find

how do gifted students think you know
 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.110
how do gifted students think you know
and can we teach this and they taught to

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120
and can we teach this and they taught to
 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.780
and can we teach this and they taught to
every student in in the school and they

are students all of a sudden qualified
 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.970
are students all of a sudden qualified
