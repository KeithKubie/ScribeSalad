00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.390
Female mosquitoes can put a damper on any
outdoor event when they start to snack on

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.960
those present.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.390
(Note: only the females drink your blood;
they don’t need it for their own nourishment,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.730
but for certain nutrients necessary to develop
their eggs).

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.860
Certain people seem to be swatting the insects
away or ending the night with more red bites

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.860
than others.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.050
So is it true that some people really are
more “attractive” to mosquitoes, and,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.070
if so, why is this the case?

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.690
To answer the first question- yes, some people
do attract mosquitoes more than others at

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.010
certain times.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.730
As for the answer to why this is the case,
there are numerous factors involved.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.720
Beyond the several hundred chemical odors
that have been identified to date that the

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.030
human body gives off (some of which singularly,
or in combination with others, attract or

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.390
repel mosquitoes), there are also over 3500
types of mosquitoes, not all of which are

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.720
attracted to or are repelled by the same things.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.320
Needless to say, why mosquitoes seem to be
more attracted to one person over another

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.810
at a given time is very difficult to discern.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.860
That said, in general, we know definitively
that seemingly all female mosquitoes identify

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.220
you as a potential target for a blood meal
via the carbon dioxide your body puts off,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.160
which they detect via their maxillary palp
organ.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.920
In fact, mosquitoes can detect you this way
from up to about 100-150 ft (~40 meters) away.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.060
This is one of the many reasons mosquitoes
tend to target people who are in the middle

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.010
of exercising more- when you’re working
out and breathing hard, you’re giving off

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.830
more carbon dioxide than you otherwise would
in your resting state.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.049
This also contributes to overweight or otherwise
larger individuals being more targeted by

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.820
mosquitoes than their slimmer or shorter brethren-
the more body mass, the more oxygen the body

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.500
needs to maintain it and the more carbon dioxide
the individual will give off.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.600
Essentially, the higher your metabolic rate,
the more carbon dioxide you give off and the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.280
more you’ll be (at least initially) attractive
to female mosquitoes looking for some blood

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.750
so they can make baby mosquitoes.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.140
This is also one of the reasons why children
are usually less likely to be bitten by mosquitoes

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.970
than adults, and men more likely to be bitten
than women.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.780
Another contributing factor to people exercising
being more likely to be bitten is body heat-

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.150
the higher your body heat, the more likely
a mosquito is to notice you.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.681
This is also generally hypothesized to be
a potential reason that people who are drinking

00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:36.780
alcohol are more likely to be bitten.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.310
However, it should be noted that it’s a
myth that drinking alcohol raises your body

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.310
temperature.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.110
In fact, the opposite happens; the age old
remedy for staving off extreme cold via drinking

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.430
alcohol actually makes it more likely you’ll
get hypothermia, as alcohol cools your body

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.430
off.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.570
Drinking alcohol does make you feel warmer
because it dilates your blood vessels, particularly

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.230
the capillaries under the surface of your
skin.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.490
Thus, the volume of blood brought to the skin’s
surface increases, making your skin a lot

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.640
warmer, and sometimes more sweaty.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.780
These two factors may result in you being
more attractive to mosquitoes, at least as

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.260
far as this commonly touted hypothesis goes.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.910
That said, in one study looking at the effects
of alcohol consumption on mosquito attractiveness,

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.030
Alcohol Ingestion Stimulates Mosquito Attraction,
while, as the title of the paper suggests,

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.070
they did find alcohol consumption significantly
increased one’s chances of getting bitten

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.750
by mosquitoes, contrary to prevailing wisdom,
they found “ethanol content in sweat and

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.000
skin temperature did not show any correlation
between alcohol ingestion and mosquito landings.”

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.660
It should be noted though that this particular
study was performed using an exceptionally

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.150
small sample size of only 13 individuals.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.299
But the bottom line with this one is that
several studies indicate that alcohol consumption

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:54.040
very much does appear to increase the likelihood
of being bitten by mosquitoes, but, as with

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.160
so many of the known attractants, exactly
why this is the case is still a matter of

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.160
debate.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.970
Pregnant women are also more attractive to
mosquitoes (statistically almost twice as

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.419
likely to be bitten than the rest of the general
populace).

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:11.669
The culprits in this case are generally thought
to mirror those of exercisers: carbon dioxide

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:12.669
and heat.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.430
Pregnant women exhale on average about 21%
more carbon dioxide than when they are not

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.430
pregnant.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.940
Their body temperature is also typically slightly
higher than non-pregnant individuals, particularly

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.150
around the belly.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.290
Another factor that potentially attracts mosquitoes
from afar is clothing color and movement.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.970
While it’s not completely understood why
mosquitoes are more attracted to people wearing

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.000
darker colored clothing, the general hypotheses
put forth are that it may have something to

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.919
do with making you stand out more on the horizon
(mosquitoes tend to fly low to the ground

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.730
to stay out of the wind as much as possible)
and it may also have something to do with

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.710
heat, with dark clothing absorbing more sunlight.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.069
Moving around is presumed to make you more
attractive to mosquitoes via motion allowing

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:57.250
the mosquito to better distinguish your body
from the surrounding environment.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.210
So that’s the initial attraction.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.759
Just because a mosquito is attracted to you
from afar, once they get close up (and even

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:08.270
after they land), they may actually decide
not to bite.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.840
After all, an idling car gives off plenty
of carbon dioxide and heat, which will initially

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.020
attract a mosquito, but once up close, the
lack of other markers will let it know it’s

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.910
not a potential blood source.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.840
The factors involved in whether a mosquito
will decide to land and then whether they

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.850
decide to bite essentially comes down to your
general scent and then taste, both in terms

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.280
of certain chemicals attracting the mosquito
even more and others potentially repelling

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.280
them.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.910
How sweaty you are at a given moment, and
what exactly is in your sweat, will greatly

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.530
influence these attractive and repellent factors,
with such markers as lactic acid, uric acid,

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.270
and ammonia being among the compounds in your
sweat and other skin excretions that attract

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.270
mosquitoes.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.470
On the other hand, those who naturally excrete
the compound 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one have

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.150
been found to be significantly less likely
to be bitten owing to this compound acting

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.260
as something of a mosquito repellent.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.379
One’s blood type also seems to be one of
the markers used by mosquitoes to determine

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:07.110
whether you’re a good candidate for a blood
meal.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.199
How?

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:13.099
Approximately 85% of people emit certain blood
type markers, something at least certain types

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:16.069
of mosquitoes seem to be able to detect.

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:20.350
While significantly more research needs done
to determine whether blood type really makes

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.139
that much of a difference in likelihood of
being bitten by a mosquito, in one study looking

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.229
at Asian Tiger Mosquitoes, it was found that
people with Type O blood were nearly twice

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:31.181
as likely to be bitten as people with type
A blood.

00:06:31.181 --> 00:06:32.181
(If you’re curious, see What is the Difference
Between Blood Types? and Why Can’t You Use

00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:33.181
the Blood from People Who Have a Different
Blood Type Than You?)

00:06:33.181 --> 00:06:36.490
It also appears that the blend of microbes
living on your body also effects how attractive

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.770
you are to at least certain types of mosquitoes,
although research into this is also pretty

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.340
scant at this stage.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.020
That said, in one 2011 study, Composition
of Human Skin Microbiota Affects Attractiveness

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.199
to Malaria Mosquitoes, they found that more
diverse colonies of microbes on your skin

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:56.610
actually seems to repel mosquitoes, whereas
a high density of just a small number of certain

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.030
microbes, such as Staphylococcus spp, seems
to attract them.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.439
Beyond certain people actually being more
attractive to female mosquitoes than others,

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:08.340
there’s also the fact that some people are
more reactive to mosquito bites.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.120
After the mosquito has drunk her fill of your
blood, she leaves behind the cocktail that

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.129
is her saliva.

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:18.229
Your body’s response to this foreign substance
is to produce a variety of antibodies to bind

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:23.300
to the antigens in the saliva, which in turn
releases the nitrogen compound histamine.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.129
Why this is a good thing most of the time
is that histamine helps your white blood cells

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:31.400
and other proteins engage whatever is invading
your body by making the capillaries of these

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.910
cells more permeable.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:37.449
The downside in the case of mosquito bites
is that this triggers an inflammatory response

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:40.580
causing the bite region to swell into a nice
pink bump.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.120
If you scratch this bump, this irritates and
inflames the area even more, resulting in

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.880
your immune system kicking into overdrive
to try to get rid of the foreign substance.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:54.620
So this means more inflammation for you, resulting
in an ever swelling, itchy bump that just

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.310
won’t go away.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:01.000
For some, their body’s histamine response
is minimal, meaning they may not even be aware

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.970
they were just a blood meal for a mosquito.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.090
For others, every bite becomes swollen and
itchy.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.789
So if one person’s body doesn’t really
react much, or at all, to a mosquito’s bite,

00:08:10.789 --> 00:08:15.129
that person may think they’re one who isn’t
very attractive to mosquitoes even though

00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:30.309
they may be, and vice versa.
