00:00:04.856 --> 00:00:07.706
&gt;&gt;Teacher: But then it's
also saves more naps.

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:08.046
[ laughter ]

00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:09.566
&gt;&gt;Mark: If we're learning at our
highest potential as teachers,

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.716
it's only going to serve our students.

00:00:11.056 --> 00:00:12.466
When we learn, they learn.

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.756
We're a community of learners.

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:18.106
&gt;&gt;Pauline: Because we do teacher lab, we
are constantly being driven by a desire

00:00:18.106 --> 00:00:23.816
to grow together, to collaborate, to
communicate, and to be self-reflective.

00:00:23.816 --> 00:00:25.836
&gt;&gt;Amy: They're actually
teaching me things sometimes.

00:00:25.836 --> 00:00:26.976
Let's me know you're really engaged.

00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:34.716
&gt;&gt;Valerie: I want you to call me over.

00:00:34.716 --> 00:00:36.296
I'll take a look at your work.

00:00:36.296 --> 00:00:39.736
&gt;&gt;Mark: When teachers enhance their
craft and improve their skills,

00:00:39.816 --> 00:00:45.056
then students will improve their level
of learning and academic achievement.

00:00:45.456 --> 00:00:49.616
So teacher labs are a way we formally
get teachers together to collaborate.

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.406
&gt;&gt;Thank you all for being here.

00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:55.436
&gt;&gt;Teachers come together,
cross discipline.

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:59.546
It's about a three hour
session around one focus area.

00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:01.036
&gt;&gt;This morning, we're focusing

00:01:01.036 --> 00:01:04.046
on student engagement,
specifically student talk.

00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:06.386
&gt;&gt;Pauline: These kids
have got to be engaged

00:01:06.386 --> 00:01:07.996
in meaningful discourse with each other.

00:01:07.996 --> 00:01:10.096
&gt;&gt;Mark: It's facilitated by
our instructional specialist.

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:13.976
She walks them through a
protocol that's very defined,

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.466
with the ultimate purpose
of teacher growth.

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:19.076
&gt;&gt;Pauline: Somebody volunteers
to be a host teacher.

00:01:19.356 --> 00:01:20.846
&gt;&gt;Valerie: Let's think
about how we get there.

00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:22.466
&gt;&gt;Pauline: Valerie's an
eighth grade math teacher,

00:01:22.806 --> 00:01:25.126
and she wants to get some feedback

00:01:25.316 --> 00:01:29.086
to improve how students
communicate when problem solving.

00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:31.506
&gt;&gt;Valerie: My biggest goal
for the year is trying to get

00:01:31.506 --> 00:01:34.096
that collaborative work, that
collaborative problem solving--

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:38.556
&gt;&gt;We start off by identifying what
student engagement looks like,

00:01:38.846 --> 00:01:41.196
both from the student side
and from the teacher side.

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:44.646
&gt;&gt;Mark: Hopefully, we hear kids
asking each other questions.

00:01:44.786 --> 00:01:46.076
&gt;&gt;Teacher: That asking for help,

00:01:46.076 --> 00:01:49.066
without having negative
feelings towards themselves

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:50.616
or that they think their
peers are looking

00:01:50.616 --> 00:01:52.206
at them differently,
because they didn't know.

00:01:52.396 --> 00:01:56.266
&gt;&gt;Pauline: After the discussion,
the host teacher speaks to the group

00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.316
about what the lesson
is going to be about.

00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:01.096
&gt;&gt;Valerie: So I've given you
handouts that the kids will get.

00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:02.946
&gt;&gt;I talked about the
goals of the lesson,

00:02:03.116 --> 00:02:05.566
what I wanted teachers
to look for and observe.

00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:09.286
&gt;&gt;Focus in on how they interact
with the task, how engaged they are.

00:02:09.286 --> 00:02:13.506
Hopefully they'll be able to justify
why the correct ways are correct.

00:02:13.506 --> 00:02:15.596
&gt;&gt;Amy: By setting the stage,
it kind of gets us thinking.

00:02:15.956 --> 00:02:17.926
Teacher lab is not just for the host.

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:20.916
It is really for every
teacher that attends.

00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:22.606
&gt;&gt;Valerie: Estimates for
the population of Brazil.

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:24.676
&gt;&gt;Pauline: We go to the
host teacher's room.

00:02:24.946 --> 00:02:29.076
They teach the lesson, and as
observers, we will be making notes.

00:02:29.076 --> 00:02:31.406
&gt;&gt;Valerie: Today, we're going
to look at population change.

00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:34.646
I want to start off with a video.

00:02:34.646 --> 00:02:36.396
&gt;&gt;We talked about population growth.

00:02:36.946 --> 00:02:39.136
It's intriguing to students
and something

00:02:39.136 --> 00:02:40.596
that has some real implications.

00:02:41.226 --> 00:02:44.046
&gt;&gt;How could governments estimate
year to year population changes,

00:02:44.356 --> 00:02:46.336
without making a complete census?

00:02:46.396 --> 00:02:49.166
&gt;&gt;It led into the math very nicely.

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:53.046
&gt;&gt;Student: One nine eight
point seven eight.

00:02:53.146 --> 00:02:55.766
&gt;&gt;Amy: I was looking for key words like,

00:02:56.146 --> 00:02:57.926
"Let me show you," or
"How can I help you?"

00:02:57.926 --> 00:02:59.296
or "Can you explain this better?"

00:02:59.296 --> 00:03:00.386
&gt;&gt;Student: What do you add?

00:03:00.386 --> 00:03:00.996
What do you add?

00:03:00.996 --> 00:03:02.976
Oh, you rounded out to
two point oh seven.

00:03:04.086 --> 00:03:04.556
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:03:06.046 --> 00:03:08.316
&gt;&gt;Valerie: After the teachers
observe the lesson, we come back

00:03:08.316 --> 00:03:11.106
and Pauline facilitates
in the post discussion,

00:03:11.106 --> 00:03:14.576
asking the host teacher
to just quietly listen.

00:03:15.286 --> 00:03:18.416
&gt;&gt;Pauline: The process is,
we all go around and share

00:03:18.416 --> 00:03:20.206
with Valerie what we noticed.

00:03:20.326 --> 00:03:22.226
&gt;&gt;It's very celebratory.

00:03:22.356 --> 00:03:25.556
The first thing that teachers
report back on are the wonderful,

00:03:25.556 --> 00:03:27.216
amazing things that they saw.

00:03:27.396 --> 00:03:30.296
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I noticed a lot of math
vocabulary when I heard them speaking.

00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:33.246
&gt;&gt;Amy: There were mistakes,
but they talked about them,

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:34.816
and I don't think they ever
said, "You were wrong."

00:03:35.286 --> 00:03:37.606
&gt;&gt;Pauline: So let's move
on to questions.

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:39.356
&gt;&gt;Then they ask wonderings.

00:03:39.546 --> 00:03:44.276
&gt;&gt;Mark: I wondered, how do we get
kids to that level to say, "Oh, Eli,

00:03:44.276 --> 00:03:45.846
we haven't heard from
you in a little bit.

00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:47.486
What are you thinking?"

00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:50.436
&gt;&gt;Amy: The red light strategy, I
was just curious what that was.

00:03:50.436 --> 00:03:53.496
&gt;&gt;Pauline: The host teacher
makes notes on all the questions

00:03:53.496 --> 00:03:56.026
that everybody had, and
then they can respond.

00:03:56.256 --> 00:03:57.686
&gt;&gt;Valerie: We have a
lot of great questions.

00:03:58.086 --> 00:04:01.736
The red light strategy is a strategy
I got from a training over the summer.

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:04.426
&gt;&gt;Pauline: Everybody walks
away with some new knowledge,

00:04:04.516 --> 00:04:06.416
some new gained perspective.

00:04:06.416 --> 00:04:09.596
&gt;&gt;He made a student engagement
teacher lab page.

00:04:09.986 --> 00:04:13.066
Just identify a strategy or an
action that you want to take back

00:04:13.096 --> 00:04:14.746
to your classroom and employ.

00:04:15.026 --> 00:04:18.146
&gt;&gt;Valerie: My big takeaway was that
students need support learning how

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:21.626
to justify their answers,
explain their solutions.

00:04:21.626 --> 00:04:23.476
&gt;&gt;Student: It doesn't
show you how it works.

00:04:23.526 --> 00:04:25.216
&gt;&gt;Valerie: And they need
some examples for that.

00:04:25.216 --> 00:04:26.686
&gt;&gt;Read the solution.

00:04:26.686 --> 00:04:29.446
Think about if you have any
questions before you get started.

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:32.796
&gt;&gt;Pauline: We're really asking teachers
to step outside of their comfort zone.

00:04:33.156 --> 00:04:35.756
We are creatures that
live behind closed doors.

00:04:35.756 --> 00:04:37.106
&gt;&gt;Valerie: Record those estimates.

00:04:37.106 --> 00:04:39.526
&gt;&gt;Pauline: Normally, nobody
ever comes in and sees it.

00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:40.916
&gt;&gt;Student: What did you get
for the change of birth?

00:04:40.916 --> 00:04:41.836
&gt;&gt;Pauline: To experience being

00:04:41.836 --> 00:04:44.516
in somebody else's classroom,
it's really powerful.

00:04:44.516 --> 00:04:47.976
&gt;&gt;What I love about teacher labs
is, we've all got something from it.

00:04:47.976 --> 00:04:50.596
&gt;&gt;I think that speaks volumes
to the work that you do

00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:51.936
in your classrooms, so
thank you so much.
