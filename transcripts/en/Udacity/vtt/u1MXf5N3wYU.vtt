00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.650
So, Michael, I want to try to convince

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.530
you other than the fact that it's an algorithm

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.040
with symbols that, it sort of works, at, at

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.870
least informally. And then, I'm going to do what I

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.590
always do and refer you to actually read

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.350
the, the, the text to get the, the details.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.440
But before I do that, I wanted to go

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.190
through an example if you think that would help.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.190
&gt;&gt; I would like an example.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.320
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, let's go through an example. So, here's a very simple

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.470
example. So, I got three little boxes on the screen. Can you see them?

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.960
&gt;&gt; Now,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.890
they're the same boxes. I've drawn them up here beforehand

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.990
because I'm going to solve this problem in only three steps.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.280
&gt;&gt; Hey those boxes are really nice, did

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.250
you get help from our trusty course developer?

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.600
&gt;&gt; I did in fact did get help from our trusty

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.360
course developer. And when I say help, I mean he did this.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.350
&gt;&gt; Oh thanks Push Car.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.650
&gt;&gt; Yes Push Car is wonderful. Now what's

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.770
really cool about this is that Push Car is

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.970
already let you know that we're going to be

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.310
able to do this in 3 simple steps. And

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.570
I'm going to be able to animate it. Or at least hopefully

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.660
it'll look animated by the time, [LAUGH] we're done with all

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.970
the editing. So just pay attention to the first box for

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.480
now, you have a bunch of data points; red pluses and

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.144
green minuses, which is the opposite of what we usually do

00:01:07.144 --> 00:01:09.935
Push Car. But either way it's red pluses and green minuses.

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:13.620
[LAUGH] With the appropriate labels and they all live in this,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.400
this part of the plane. By the way, what do you call

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.050
a part of the plane? I know you have

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.720
line segments, what's like, a sub part of a plane?

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.320
&gt;&gt; Looks like a square to me.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.460
&gt;&gt; Yes it is, but I mean, what do you call them? You,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.150
you don't call it a plane segment, do you? What do you call it?

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.850
&gt;&gt; A region.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.540
&gt;&gt; A square region, fine. So it's a square region on a plane. And we

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.130
want to figure out how to be able to correctly classify these examples. Okay, so

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.930
that is nothing new there. We just want to be able to come up with

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.460
something. So now we have to do what we did like in the quiz is that

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.940
we have to specify what our hypothesis space is. So

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.120
here's our hypothesis space. So the hypothesis space is the set

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.540
Of axis aligned semi-planes. You know what that means?

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.570
&gt;&gt; Mm, no.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.990
&gt;&gt; Well for the purpose of this example it means,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.470
I'm going to draw a line, either horizontal or vertical and say

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.200
that everything on one side of that line is positive

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.360
and everything on the other side of that line is negative.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.400
&gt;&gt; I see. Okay, good.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.630
&gt;&gt; Right. And their axes align because it's only

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.670
horizontal and vertical, and they're semi-planes because the positive part

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.760
of it is only in part of the plane. Okay, so I'm

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.170
going to just walk through what boosting would end up doing with this particular

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.310
example or what a boosting might do with this particular example given that

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.050
you have a learner. That always chooses between axis aligned semi planes. Okay?

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.440
&gt;&gt; So let's imagine we ran our boosting algorithm

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.870
now in the beginning it's step 1 all of the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.290
examples look the same because we have no particular reason

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.350
to say any are more important than the other, any

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.910
are easier or harder than the other. And that's just

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.700
the algorithm we had before We run through and we ask

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.150
our learner to return some hypotheses that does well in

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.070
classifying the examples. It turns out that though there are many,

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.810
and in fact there are an infinite number of possible

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.170
hypotheses you could return. One that works really well is one

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.680
that looks like a vertical line that separates

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.960
the first two data points from the rest.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.870
&gt;&gt; That is what I was guessing.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.310
&gt;&gt; Of course it was. And what I'm saying here is that everythign to

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.470
the left of this line is going to be positive and everything to the right

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.910
is going to be negative. So if you look at this what does this hypothesis do? So

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.980
it gets correct, correctly labeled positive. The two pluses to the left. Right?

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:32.870
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.140
&gt;&gt; And it gets correct all of the minuses as well.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.920
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.580
&gt;&gt; Right? But it gets wrong the three pluses on the

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.160
right side. So it gets, this wrong, this wrong, and this wrong.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.770
&gt;&gt; Right, the Three Plusketeers.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.040
&gt;&gt; Exactly. [LAUGH] The Three Plusketeers. That's

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.320
actually pretty good. So I'm just you know

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.960
I'm just going to ask you to trust me here but it turns out that the specific

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:07.370
error here is 0.3 and if you stick that into our little alpha you end up,

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.730
our little, our little formula for alpha, you end up with alpha equal to 4.2.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.930
&gt;&gt; That's not obvious to me but.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.760
&gt;&gt; Is is See, see, see it's not always obvious.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.875
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:17.920
&gt;&gt; Okay. Good. So there you go and that's

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.220
just what happens when you stick this particular set in

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.390
there. So now we're going to construct the next distribution.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.630
Right? And what's going to happen in the next distribution?

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.950
&gt;&gt; So the one's that it got right should get less weight and the one's that

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.670
it got wrong should get more weight so

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.790
those three plusketeers should become more prominent somehow.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.640
&gt;&gt; That's exactly what happens. They become, I'm just going to draw them

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.580
as much thicker and bigger to kind of emphasise that they're getting

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.190
bigger, and it's going to turn out that everything else is going

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.750
to get smaller which is a lot harder to draw here. So i'm

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.440
just going to kind of leave them their

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.460
size, so they sort of get normalized away. Okay?

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.160
&gt;&gt; I would guess as to what the next plane should be. I think that we should

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.620
cut it. Underneath those pluses but above the green

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.030
minuses. And that should get us three errors. The

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.140
two pluses on the left and the minus on

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.130
the top will be wrong. But they have less

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.920
weight than the three pluses we got right, so

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.350
this going to be better than the previous one.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.980
&gt;&gt; So,

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.110
that's possibly true. But it's not what the learner output.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.510
&gt;&gt; Oh!

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.390
&gt;&gt; Let me tell you what the learner did output though. This learner

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.090
output by putting a line to the right of the three pluses, because

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.660
he's gotta get those right in saying that everything to the left is

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.760
in fact, positive. So, does that seem like a reasonable one to you?

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.850
&gt;&gt; Well, it does better than half. I guess that's really all what we're

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.570
trying to do, but it does seem to do worse than what I suggested.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.700
&gt;&gt; Well, let's see, it gets the three

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.650
that mattered that you were really, really doing poorly

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.470
right but then so did yours. And it only,

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.290
and it picks up still the other two which

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.570
it was getting right. And it gets wrong these

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.550
three minus' which aren't worth so much. So is

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.700
that worse than what you suggested? No, it gets

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.816
wrong, oh, the three minuses. Oh, it gets correct

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:10.010
those two red pluses on the left. So it gets three things

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.650
wrong. So that's just as good as what I suggested. Okay, I agree.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.110
&gt;&gt; Okay good. So the error of this step by the way, turns out

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.530
to be 0.21 and the alpha at this time step turns out to be 0.65.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.350
So that's pretty interesting, so we got a bunch of these right and a bunch of

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:32.270
these wrong. So what's going to happen to the distribution over these examples.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.650
&gt;&gt; Alright, the ones that it, again, the

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.280
ones that it got wrong should get pushed up

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.100
in weight and which ones are those, those are

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.300
the, the three green minuses in the middle patch

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.710
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.060
&gt;&gt; They should become more prominent. The pluses, the three, the three

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.700
plusketeers should become less prominent than they were but it still might be

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.290
more prominent than they were in the beginning. And maybe because in fact

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:57.270
the alpha, let's see the alpha is bigger so, it will have actually

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.900
a bigger effect on bringing it down.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah I guess so, but it, there'll still be

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.370
more prominent than the other ones that haven't been bumped.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah the ones that you, the, the two, the two

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.510
red pluses on the left have, you've never gotten them wrong.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.800
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.000
&gt;&gt; So they're really going to disappear. So, if we do, If I

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.270
do my best to, If I do my best to kind of draw

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.540
that you're still, you're going to have. These pluses are going to be a

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.290
little bit bigger than the other pluses, but they're going to be smaller than

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.070
they were before. The two, the three greens in the middle are

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.960
going to be bigger than they were before. But those two pluses

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.980
are going to be even smaller, and these two minuses are going to

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.130
be smaller. So, what do you think the third hypothesis should be.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:37.690
&gt;&gt; Quiz.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.700
&gt;&gt; Oh, I like that.
