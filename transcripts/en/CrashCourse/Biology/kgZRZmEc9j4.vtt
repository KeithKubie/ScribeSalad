00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.000
Next time someone asks
you who you think you are,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.200
just give them the facts.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.620
You're a mammalian amniotic
tetrapodal sarcopterygiian

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.749
osteichthyan gnathostomal
vertebrate cranial chordate.

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:10.789
Yeah, it's a mouthful.

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.699
And in order to understand
what it means, you're going to

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.879
have to understand the most
complex group of animals on earth,

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:22.879
and what it takes to
get from this to this.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.390
The phylum Chordata accounts for
all 52,000 species of vertebrates

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.160
on earth and several thousand
species of invertebrates.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.309
Together they range from
tiny, brainless filter feeders

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.670
all the way up
to Scarlett Johansson.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.239
Now, you know by now that when
we talk about classifying animals,

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:45.719
we're really talking about
their shared ancestry,

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.710
each new branch on this
tree marking an important

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.609
new evolutionary milestone.

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:52.379
And just like with tissue
layers and segmentation

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.609
in simpler animals, there
are traits we can look for

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.250
to track the
evolution of chordates.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.190
By the time all of those
traits appear in one organism,

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.019
we'll have arrived at
the most complex class

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.560
within the most complex
phlyum: the mammals.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.620
But first let's start
with the fundamentals.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.300
We've talked before about
synapomorphic traits:

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.890
traits that set a group of
animals apart from its ancestors

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.510
and from other groups that
came from the same ancestors.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.110
Chordates share four
synapomorphies that

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.480
make us who we are.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.160
Each of them is
present at some point

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.840
in every chordate's life cycle.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.990
How about a volunteer
to demonstrate these traits?

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.540
Ah, I see that the lancelets
are raising their...mouthparts.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.750
The lancelets, also
known as cephalochordata,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.030
literally "head-cords," are one of
the three sub-phyla of chordates.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.220
And unlike almost all other
chordates, these tiny, brainless,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.030
invertebrate filter
feeders retain all four

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.310
of these characteristics
for their entire lives.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.010
You probably already know
where most of these traits

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.660
are going to appear, since
the phylum is named after it:

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.100
the spinal cord, or at least
something that resembles

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.310
a spinal chord.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.010
First there's the notochord,
a structure made of cartilage

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.250
that runs between an animal's
digestive tube and its nerve cord.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.270
In most vertebrates, a skeleton
develops around the notochord

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.800
and allows the muscles to attach.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.300
In humans, the notochord
is reduced to the disks

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.850
of cartilage that we have
between our vertebrae.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.539
Second, we have the
nerve cord itself,

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.040
called the dorsal hollow nerve cord
a tube made of nerve fibers that

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.260
develops into the
central nervous system.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.519
This is what makes chordates
different from other

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.819
animal phyla, which have
solid, ventral nerve cords,

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.280
meaning they run along
the front or stomach side.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.319
Third, all chordates
have pharyngeal slits.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.579
In invertebrates like our
lancelet here, they function

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:28.890
as filters for feeding.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.129
In fish and other aquatic
animals, they're gill slits,

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.790
and in land-dwelling vertebrates
like us they disappear

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.749
before we're born, but that
tissue develops into areas

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.849
around our jaws, ears, and other
structures in the head and neck.

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.549
And finally, we can't forget
our fourth synapomorphy,

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.560
the post-anal tail, which is
exactly what it sounds like.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.689
It helps propel aquatic
animals through the water,

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.249
it makes our dog look happy
when she wags it, and in humans

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:55.359
it shrinks during embryonic
development into what is known

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.920
as the coccyx, or tailbone.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.889
It's right here.

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.829
And trust me, when it
comes to tail placement,

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.249
post-anal is the way to go.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.989
These four traits
all began to appear

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.810
during the Cambrian explosion
more than 500 million years ago,

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.329
and today they're shared by members
of all three chordate subphyla

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.829
even if the animals
in those subphyla look

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.450
pretty much nothing like each other

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.920
For instance, our new friends
here in cephalochordata

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.609
are the oldest living subphylum,
but you can't forget

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.819
the other invertebrate group
of chordates, urochordata,

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:26.749
literally "tail-cords."

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:30.379
There are over 2,000 species here,
including sea squirts.

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.519
If you're confused about why
this ended up in a phylum with us,

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.040
it's because they
have tadpole-like larvae

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.779
with all four
chordate characteristics.

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:41.060
The adults, which actually
have a highly developed

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.629
internal structure, with
a heart and other organs,

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.840
retain the pharyngeal slits
but all other chordate features

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.620
disappear or reform
into other structures.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.480
The third and last and most complex
subphylum, is the Vertebrata,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.980
and has the most species
in it because its members

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.609
have a hard backbone,
which has allowed

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.260
for an explosion in diversity,
from tiny minnows

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.419
to the great blue whale.

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.859
You can see how fantastic
this diversity really is

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.099
when you break down Vertebrata
into its many, many classes

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.099
from slimy, sea-snakey things
to us warm and fuzzy mammals.

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.389
And as these classes become
more complex, you can identify

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.730
the traits they each
developed that gave them

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.400
an evolutionary edge over
the ones that came before.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.340
For example, how's this for
an awesome trait: a brain!

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.920
Vertebrates with a head that
contains sensory organs and

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.840
a brain are called craniates.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.210
They also always have a heart
with at least two chambers.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.760
Since this is science,
you're going to have to know

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.970
that there's going to be an
exception for every rule

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.150
that you're going
to have to remember.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.010
and the exception in this
case is the Myxini, or hagfish

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.840
the only vertebrate class
that has no vertebrae

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.320
but is classified with us
because it has a skull.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.350
This snake-like creature swims
by using segmented muscles

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.660
to exert force against
its notochord.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.950
Whatever, hagfish.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.470
Closely-related to it
is the class petromyzontida,

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.820
otherwise known as lampreys,
the oldest living

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.140
lineage of vertebrates.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.770
Now these have a backbone,
made of cartilage,

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.750
and maybe even more important,
a more complex nervous system.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.170
With the advent of the backbone
we see vertebrates getting larger,

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.220
developing more complex
skeletons, and becoming

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.020
more effective at catching
food and avoiding predators.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.560
But do you notice
anything missing?

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.500
Lampreys and other early
vertebrates are agnathans,

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.030
literally "no-jaws."

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.030
And if you want to be able to
chew food, it really helps

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.780
to have a jaw and teeth.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.950
Most scientists think that
the jaw evolved from structures

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.670
that supported the first two
pharyngeal slits near the mouth.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.160
And teeth? Well, the current
theory is that they evolved

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.050
from sharp scales on the face!

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.110
Gnathostomes, or "jaw-mouths",
arrived on the scene

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.660
470 million years ago,
and one of the oldest

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.920
and most successful groups of
gnathostomes that have survived

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.590
to the present day are
the class chondrichthyes,

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.190
the "cartilage fish".

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.980
You know them as sharks, skates
and rays, and as their name says,

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.370
their skeleton is made
up mostly of cartilage,

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.780
but they show the beginnings
of a calcified skeleton.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.290
Chondrichthyans haven't
changed much over the past

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.280
300 million years or so,
and their success

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.660
stems from the paired fins that
allow for efficient swimming,

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.500
and those jaws for biting
off delicious hunks of flesh.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.780
If we're going to
eventually get to mammals,

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.500
we need bones, and we find those
with the evolution of fish.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.580
Meet Osteichthyes, which
technically means "the bony fish"

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.360
unlike cartilaginous fish,
members of this group

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.360
have a mineralized endoskeleton.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.310
Now, Osteichthyes is sometimes
considered a superclass,

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.770
because it includes a whole
slew of diverse classes

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.090
that descended from it.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.620
There's actually some
controversy among taxonomists

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.280
about what to call it,
but the main thing to know

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.310
is that the majority
of all vertebrates

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.390
fall under Osteichthyes,
and that includes you.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.030
It's broken up into
two main groups,

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.120
which themselves include
a bunch of classes.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.690
The first is Actinopterygii,
or ray-finned fishes,

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.140
and with 27,000 species,
pretty much every fish

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.930
you've ever heard of
is in this group.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.650
Ray-finned fishes
evolved in fresh water,

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.310
spread out into the oceans,

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.010
and some eventually came
back to fresh water.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.370
In the second group, things
start to get really strange

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.470
and interesting.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.440
These are the lobe-finned
fishes, or sarcopterygii,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.300
a name derived from bones
surrounded by muscle found in their

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.270
pectoral and pelvic fins.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.180
And that sounds like something
that could be used for walking!

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.790
Lobe-fins include the coelacanths,

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.370
which consist of one living species

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.290
lungfish, which gulp
air into their lungs;

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.300
and tetrapods, which have
adapted to land with four limbs.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.730
So this is weird, right?

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.840
Even though land animals
clearly are not fish,

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.000
since tetrapods evolved
from bony fish,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.270
they are filed under this group.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.200
These taxonomists, man.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.170
I want to party
with them sometime.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.120
But first:

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.820
Imagine that you're a fisherman
off the coast of South Africa

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.660
in the western Indian
Ocean about 75 years ago.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.420
Just put that in your
brain and hold on to it.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.070
And you've just pulled up a
fish that no one has ever seen.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.260
Not only that, you've caught
a fish that was thought

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.170
to have become extinct
75 million years ago.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.350
This is exactly what
happened in 1938,

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.730
when Captain Hendrick
Goosen hauled up a coelacanth,

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.230
and it has mystified
scientists ever since.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.130
A second population has since
been identified near Indonesia

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:09.120
in 1999, but the deep-sea
creatures remain extremely rare.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.970
The coelacanth fascinates
scientists because of its

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.830
paired lobe fins.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.820
They extend from the
body like legs and move

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.120
in an alternating pattern.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.730
In other words, they move more
like a horse than like a fish.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.170
And in fact those
paired fins are supported

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:26.140
by the very same bones that
we have in our arms and legs.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.660
The coelacanth also has a
hinged joint in the skull

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.080
so it can widen its
mouth to eat large prey,

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.370
as well as thick scales that don't
exist on any living fish.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.490
It's not good eating, but why
would you want to eat what's

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.249
essentially a living fossil?

00:08:40.249 --> 00:08:42.699
Alright, now we're talking about
tetrapods, which of course

00:08:42.699 --> 00:08:45.829
means "four feet," and getting
those four feet onto land

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:48.889
was really awesome for those
early creatures because that meant

00:08:48.889 --> 00:08:50.779
that they could escape
the increasingly brutal

00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:52.410
and predatory world of the ocean.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.879
Tetrapods gradually replaced
their fins with limbs,

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:56.759
and developed entirely
new body parts

00:08:56.759 --> 00:08:59.139
that were never seen
before, like necks,

00:08:59.139 --> 00:09:00.660
with the help of
additional vertebra,

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.350
that separated the
body from the head.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.430
The first tetrapods are today
found in the class Amphibia,

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.819
which were the first creatures to
develop a three-chambered heart.

00:09:07.819 --> 00:09:10.449
There are more than 6,000
known species of amphibians

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:12.720
like frogs and salamanders,
most of which begin life

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.110
as tadpoles in water, and
then later develop legs,

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.410
lungs and a digestive
system, and often migrate

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:18.670
to land for adulthood.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:21.240
But amphibians lay eggs
that don't have shells,

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.079
so they dehydrate quickly, so
they have to be laid in water.

00:09:24.079 --> 00:09:26.519
So this leads us to our
next evolutionary milestone

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:29.430
for chordates: the amniotic egg.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:33.079
Amniotes are tetrapods that have
eggs adapted for life on land

00:09:33.079 --> 00:09:36.019
a group that includes
reptiles, birds and mammals.

00:09:36.019 --> 00:09:39.269
The amniotic egg was crucial
for the success of land-dwellers,

00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:42.389
allowing embryos to develop
in their own "private pond"

00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:45.459
of the amniotic sac, often
surrounded by a hard shell

00:09:45.459 --> 00:09:47.160
in the case of reptiles and birds.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.930
The class Reptilia represents
the earliest amniotes.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.110
Like amphibians, they
have a 3-chambered heart,

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.670
but they're totally terrestrial.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.459
And here's where we find
our dinosaurs, snakes,

00:09:55.459 --> 00:09:56.170
turtles and lizards.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.339
You often hear reptiles
described as "cold-blooded."

00:09:58.339 --> 00:10:00.089
This does not mean that
their blood is cold.

00:10:00.089 --> 00:10:03.209
They're actually ectothermic,
which means that they absorb

00:10:03.209 --> 00:10:06.300
external heat as their
main source of body heat.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.550
Hence the lizard that likes
to lay in the sun all day.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.670
The oldest group of reptiles,
the archosaurs, mostly disappeared

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.790
when most of the dinosaurs
died out 65 million years ago.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.800
But two lineages
of archosaurs survived.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.660
One includes the modern
reptiles crocodiles and alligators,

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.740
and the other is a type of
dinosaur that we now call birds,

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:24.459
the class Aves.

00:10:24.459 --> 00:10:26.019
There are big, obvious differences

00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:28.689
between these two
surviving archosaurs:

00:10:28.689 --> 00:10:32.199
one is designed for eating
and fighting big animals,

00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:34.420
while the other is
designed for flying around

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.329
and being graceful and stuff.

00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:37.269
The not-so-obvious but
equally important difference

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:39.540
is that birds are endotherms,
which means that they can

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.430
crank up their metabolism to
regulate their body temperature.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.709
Making all that heat requires
a big furnace, which is provided

00:10:45.709 --> 00:10:48.209
thanks to the evolution
of a four-chambered heart.

00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:51.009
There's only one other group of
animals that developed this trait,

00:10:51.009 --> 00:10:53.550
independently of birds, by
the way, and it allowed them

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.079
to spread through the planet.

00:10:55.079 --> 00:10:57.790
I'm talking, of course,
about the class Mammalia,

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.410
otherwise known as
amniotes that have hair,

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.029
three special ear
bones and mammary glands.

00:11:03.029 --> 00:11:04.720
And most mammals have
evolved to dispense

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.449
with the hard egg shell altogether

00:11:06.449 --> 00:11:08.459
the embryo avoiding
predation and other

00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:11.540
environmental dangers by developing
inside the mother's body.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.059
In this class of chordates
you'll find me, dame Judi Dench,

00:11:15.059 --> 00:11:18.579
your dog, your cat, Shamu the
orca, African elephants,

00:11:18.579 --> 00:11:23.199
the South American pudu, and 5,300
other known species of mammals.

00:11:23.199 --> 00:11:25.529
It all began with a
simple ancestor more than

00:11:25.529 --> 00:11:28.819
500 million years in this
crazy chordate phylum,

00:11:28.819 --> 00:11:30.309
but we've finally made it!

00:11:30.309 --> 00:11:34.470
And now you know
exactly who you are.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.300
