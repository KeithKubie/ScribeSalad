when you think about nothing you have to

when you think about nothing you have to
 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.510
when you think about nothing you have to
be a little more careful than you

a physical concept because it's the

a physical concept because it's the
 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.309

absence of something and something is a
