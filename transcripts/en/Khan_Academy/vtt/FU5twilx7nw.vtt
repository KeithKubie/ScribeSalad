00:00:00.686 --> 00:00:03.201
Voiceover: This video is to
answer some questions part

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:05.104
for the Royal Geographic Society.

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:08.493
This is part of their 21st
Century Challenges Series.

00:00:08.493 --> 00:00:14.976
First the general questions, so
the first question right up here is

00:00:14.976 --> 00:00:18.108
will changes in education
in the coming decades

00:00:18.108 --> 00:00:21.442
be evolutionary or revolutionary?

00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:27.151
Evolutionary would kind of imply small
changes, maybe not so noticeable changes

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:30.472
but then maybe over a long period
of time they add up to a lot

00:00:30.472 --> 00:00:32.554
or revolutionary, everything all at once.

00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:36.350
I hope you don't think that
I'm not answering the question

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.656
but I think it's going to be both.

00:00:37.656 --> 00:00:40.925
It's already been stated independent
of education that we are in

00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:44.741
and information revolution right now
and I think that's pretty obvious.

00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:47.663
First you have the computers and
then obviously you have the internet.

00:00:47.663 --> 00:00:51.519
Everything now becomes accessible and
it's becoming all of that more accessible

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.664
every almost moment that passes by.

00:00:53.664 --> 00:00:56.996
The funny thing is the
information revolution

00:00:56.996 --> 00:01:01.662
and there's no industry that revolves
around information more than education.

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:04.522
I guess there's other industries that
are close like finance and whatever else.

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:09.222
But education really is about, I
would say information or knowledge

00:01:09.222 --> 00:01:11.122
or conveying information

00:01:11.122 --> 00:01:14.458
or transferring understanding
from one person to another.

00:01:14.458 --> 00:01:17.411
It is really about a
transferring information

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:19.988
or a communication
between different people.

00:01:19.988 --> 00:01:23.239
The information revolution
should I guess naturally,

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:26.331
the education revolution
should be part of it,

00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:29.524
and it really just maybe
hasn't for a bunch of reasons.

00:01:29.524 --> 00:01:35.122
There are different [nurses] in
place to keep it from changing.

00:01:36.537 --> 00:01:39.788
My sense is and this
is true of many things,

00:01:39.788 --> 00:01:43.078
is that when people are most
pessimistic about something

00:01:43.078 --> 00:01:47.825
that's when it's about to change in
a really, really, really big way.

00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:50.405
That's when it's about to give

00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:53.655
and I think we are at that
moment in education where,

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:56.589
sure people have been talking about
technology education for a long time.

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:59.786
People have been trying to
improve education for a long time

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:04.185
but the unfortunate narrative is every
year we just hear things of get ...

00:02:04.185 --> 00:02:06.989
They see more at least based on the
narrative we're hearing in the media.

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:09.986
It seems like it's getting worse,
getting more expensive too.

00:02:09.986 --> 00:02:12.076
So depending on how you do it,

00:02:12.076 --> 00:02:15.744
either worse performance at
kind of the grade school levels

00:02:15.744 --> 00:02:19.258
or at the higher education levels just
getting more and more and more expensive

00:02:19.258 --> 00:02:20.578
and less affordable.

00:02:20.578 --> 00:02:24.022
Even if you can afford and you take
on the loans it's becoming less clear

00:02:24.022 --> 00:02:27.326
that you're able to even get the
return when you go into the job market,

00:02:27.326 --> 00:02:29.723
whether you've been
[necessarily] not employable.

00:02:29.723 --> 00:02:32.528
So yes, I think the revolution is coming.

00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:35.007
I think it's going to come
in a bunch of different ways.

00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:38.842
I think you're going to start
seeing a decoupling of learning

00:02:38.842 --> 00:02:41.195
from credentialing.

00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:44.335
Right now, the word education
is even kind of modeled

00:02:44.335 --> 00:02:46.493
because it's actually a
whole bunch of things.

00:02:46.493 --> 00:02:49.902
Inside of education you
have the idea of learning

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:52.325
and this is what most people
associate with education.

00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:55.237
You also have the idea of
credentialing which is,

00:02:55.237 --> 00:02:57.467
"I got a degree from here or there."

00:02:57.467 --> 00:02:59.532
Then you also have an
element of socialization

00:02:59.532 --> 00:03:02.386
which is a very important
element, socialization.

00:03:03.093 --> 00:03:06.366
When people talk about education it's
not clear what they're talking about,

00:03:06.366 --> 00:03:09.014
most people are talking about ...
Think they're talking about this

00:03:09.014 --> 00:03:12.258
but when you ask them why they're
willing to go $200,000 in debt,

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:15.592
they'll be talking about this right here.

00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:18.592
What I hope to see is that
this actually becomes decoupled

00:03:18.592 --> 00:03:21.299
and when it becomes decoupled, it
becomes actually more interesting.

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.404
Because if someone can earn a
credential by proving what they know

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:27.466
and they don't have to sit
some place for four years

00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:29.995
and they don't have to pay $200,000,

00:03:29.995 --> 00:03:33.725
then all of a sudden the learning
will happen in whatever way

00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:35.478
is easiest for that person.

00:03:35.478 --> 00:03:37.753
It could be through something
like the Khan academy,

00:03:37.753 --> 00:03:42.121
it could be attending a
traditional university, it
could be learning on the job.

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:46.519
What's powerful that is if the credential
is done independently from that,

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.991
then the credential can also
become much more powerful.

00:03:48.991 --> 00:03:52.588
Right now you have a reality where
you have thousands of universities,

00:03:52.588 --> 00:03:54.191
and I'll talk about universities,

00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:57.086
the high school diploma has
become almost meaningless now.

00:03:57.086 --> 00:04:00.164
No one even says, "I'll give you a job
because you have a high school diploma."

00:04:00.164 --> 00:04:01.664
They don't know what that even means.

00:04:01.664 --> 00:04:04.126
On the other side of it you have
people getting into universities

00:04:04.126 --> 00:04:06.053
that don't have a high school diploma.

00:04:06.053 --> 00:04:08.074
That just have really good
standardized test scores

00:04:08.074 --> 00:04:10.670
and they've done amazing things
when they were before college,

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.253
and they were home schooled or whatever.

00:04:12.253 --> 00:04:16.505
What you have right now is the
credentialing is kind of been done

00:04:16.505 --> 00:04:19.106
by the same people who
are doing the learning.

00:04:19.106 --> 00:04:20.292
It makes everyone say,

00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:23.497
"Well look, how do we know what the
standards are in that university?"

00:04:23.497 --> 00:04:25.098
"How do we know what the standards
are at that high school?"

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:29.452
That's what's making standardized
tests and all of that so valuable,

00:04:29.452 --> 00:04:32.375
regardless of whether you
actually view them as valuable

00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:34.851
but that's why people are
putting so much emphasis on them.

00:04:34.851 --> 00:04:40.114
What would be valuable is if the
credentials is more recognized.

00:04:40.114 --> 00:04:43.048
If there's a nationally or
internationally recognized credentials

00:04:43.048 --> 00:04:45.516
because right know you could
go to a regional university.

00:04:45.516 --> 00:04:49.181
Maybe your regional university
or your local community college,

00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:52.248
maybe it's amazing at this, maybe
it's better than Harvard at this,

00:04:52.248 --> 00:04:55.099
maybe it's better than any
university at the teaching part,

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:01.052
and maybe it's graduates actually
do know the material really, deeply,

00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:03.302
and amazing, and they know it
better than the kids graduating

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:04.226
from the Ivy League.

00:05:04.226 --> 00:05:06.741
But the sad reality right
now is even if they do,

00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:11.185
their credential will not carry as much
weight in the eyes of most employers

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:15.328
as that Harvard degree will or that
Stanford degree, or that MIT degree.

00:05:15.328 --> 00:05:18.720
So they have a credentialing problem,
but if you decouple this things

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.144
the students will learn from
the regional university,

00:05:21.144 --> 00:05:25.257
could go and prove that they know
it just as good as anyone else.

00:05:25.257 --> 00:05:29.311
I think you're going to see
some very interesting things

00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:32.324
or I think once you open this up
and people can get the credential

00:05:32.324 --> 00:05:37.398
and obviously the cost of getting tested,
even if it's a very rigorous test,

00:05:37.398 --> 00:05:40.393
even if it's a more rigorous test
than what's going on right now

00:05:40.393 --> 00:05:43.991
in the best universities, that's
not going to cost 50,000 a year.

00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:46.809
You ask a university right now why
they're charging 50,000 a year,

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:51.324
they'll say, "Look at our
facilities. Look at our campus."

00:05:51.324 --> 00:05:53.591
"Look at our professor's salaries."

00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:57.257
They don't say, "We're
charging you $50,000 a year"

00:05:57.257 --> 00:05:59.483
"because we're giving you
really rigorous exams."

00:05:59.483 --> 00:06:01.594
"We're giving you oral
exams and all the rest."

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:06.124
If you ask students why they're
paying $50,000 they'll tell you,

00:06:06.124 --> 00:06:07.927
that for the most part they're
paying for the credentials,

00:06:07.927 --> 00:06:10.814
and then some students
hopefully for the learning,

00:06:10.814 --> 00:06:15.641
and then some for the socialization and
that socialization can take many forms.

00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:18.732
I suspect the credentialing
itself can be done in a better way

00:06:18.732 --> 00:06:19.991
than it's being done now.

00:06:19.991 --> 00:06:23.827
That can be much cheaper, I'm
talking in orders hundreds of dollars

00:06:23.827 --> 00:06:25.476
as opposed to thousands of dollars.

00:06:25.476 --> 00:06:29.657
Then it opens up the learning
part to whatever works best,

00:06:29.657 --> 00:06:31.329
and I suspect once you do that

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:34.404
then now higher education
institutions won't have

00:06:34.404 --> 00:06:39.565
this kind of control over the market

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:44.479
and it will be very hard
for them to justify raising
their tuition 6% every year

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:45.998
and it would be very hard for them to ...

00:06:45.998 --> 00:06:50.244
They would have to prove the case
that it really is worth $50,000

00:06:50.244 --> 00:06:54.079
that their graduates really are
performing better on these credentials

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:58.263
than say people who use the Khan Academy
or go to their local community college

00:06:58.263 --> 00:06:59.820
or learn on the job.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.903
I think you're definitely
going to see that coming.

00:07:01.903 --> 00:07:05.005
I think in 10 years or so
you're going to see that shift

00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:10.662
and you're actually going to see that
tuition cost you're going to give.

00:07:10.662 --> 00:07:14.565
Because they're already becoming
so unaffordable for so many people

00:07:14.565 --> 00:07:16.933
that I think everyone's going
to wake up at some point

00:07:16.933 --> 00:07:19.604
and realize that there
has to be another way.

00:07:19.604 --> 00:07:23.405
How important is knowledge
in a modern education?

00:07:23.405 --> 00:07:26.936
Knowledge is one of these words that
depends how you think about knowledge.

00:07:26.936 --> 00:07:28.895
Is knowledge fact information?

00:07:28.895 --> 00:07:32.073
Is it a specific skill set?

00:07:32.073 --> 00:07:35.130
Is it a medal level skill of
kind of knowing how to learn

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.333
and some would say it's all of the above.

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:41.456
What I would say is what I think
are the most important things

00:07:41.456 --> 00:07:45.628
in a modern education, I think
it's the ability to be creative.

00:07:45.628 --> 00:07:50.652
I think it's the ability to
kind of go into an open space

00:07:50.652 --> 00:07:55.198
where nothing is defined and
be able to look at the tools

00:07:55.198 --> 00:07:58.864
that are available to you and put
something together that meets a problem.

00:07:58.864 --> 00:08:03.097
Actually this could be in a technical
sense or it could be in a business sense

00:08:03.097 --> 00:08:04.972
or a market, whatever sense.

00:08:04.972 --> 00:08:09.799
I think the most important thing is that
people should get from their education

00:08:09.799 --> 00:08:12.466
is the ability to make things,
the ability to create things.

00:08:12.466 --> 00:08:16.066
Unfortunately that's the thing
that I think is completely absent

00:08:16.066 --> 00:08:18.170
from our current education.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.239
One example is Math and
there's a huge debate

00:08:20.239 --> 00:08:22.201
about what's the best way to
teach Math is and all the rest.

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:25.319
What's shocking is that no one ever says,

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:29.458
"Well maybe there should be engineering
in education to some degree,"

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:31.328
that's limited by people's perception

00:08:31.328 --> 00:08:34.401
of whether we can get proper
engineering even taught.

00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:37.646
Whether we can find a talented
teacher in the engineering in schools.

00:08:37.646 --> 00:08:40.066
But no one ever says, because
frankly the ability to engineer,

00:08:40.066 --> 00:08:42.403
and I'm saying engineering in
the broadest sense of the word,

00:08:42.403 --> 00:08:44.336
not what people normally
associate with engineering.

00:08:44.336 --> 00:08:46.558
I'm saying engineering which is really,

00:08:46.558 --> 00:08:50.066
most people don't normally associate
it as a deeply creative field,

00:08:50.066 --> 00:08:51.475
but it is a deeply creative.

00:08:51.475 --> 00:08:54.895
In fact engineering is, by
it's very nature, it's creating
things that never existed before.

00:08:54.895 --> 00:08:59.277
Engineering is not something
that's emphasized right now.

00:08:59.277 --> 00:09:04.933
There might be music class and music
class is focused on playing things

00:09:04.933 --> 00:09:09.835
but you see very little composition at
especially at the K through 12 level.

00:09:09.835 --> 00:09:13.175
Everything is focused on playing
things that someone else has written.

00:09:13.175 --> 00:09:16.798
So the creativity is
de-emphasized in school right now.

00:09:16.798 --> 00:09:20.745
I think that's the very thing
that has to be emphasized a lot,

00:09:20.745 --> 00:09:23.079
a lot more heavily, not just ability.

00:09:23.079 --> 00:09:25.757
Because frankly and this is
the reality of the modern world

00:09:25.757 --> 00:09:28.496
is that the tools are going to
change, the jobs are going to change,

00:09:28.496 --> 00:09:31.080
the information you need to know
for that job are going to change

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.175
but what you really need
to do is that ability to

00:09:33.175 --> 00:09:35.702
one, create something out of
nothing, so that's the creativity.

00:09:35.702 --> 00:09:40.452
I would say the second thing is this
ability to kind of self-teach yourself.

00:09:40.452 --> 00:09:42.874
Look at the resources
that are in the world

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:47.451
to give yourself the tools you need
to be able to create that thing.

00:09:47.451 --> 00:09:51.388
The next question, if the
era of a job for life is over

00:09:51.388 --> 00:09:53.034
and we need to be more adaptable,

00:09:53.034 --> 00:09:56.261
do you foresee a future of people
self-educating through their life?

00:09:58.214 --> 00:10:01.365
My peripheral vision was
reading this question.

00:10:01.365 --> 00:10:05.124
So yes, I think self-educating
throughout life,

00:10:05.124 --> 00:10:10.725
beyond just the economic aspects of
it, maybe being a requirement now

00:10:10.725 --> 00:10:13.585
because the world is changing so
fast and jobs are changing so fast,

00:10:13.585 --> 00:10:17.992
but I also just think it's helpful,
healthy from a happiness point of view.

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:22.949
Just as people go to the
gym, they do exercise

00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:24.985
and not because they're going
to compete in some sport.

00:10:24.985 --> 00:10:27.054
Not because they're paid
to compete in exercises,

00:10:27.054 --> 00:10:28.992
they do it because it's
good for their health

00:10:28.992 --> 00:10:31.988
and they do it because they
know it makes them happy.

00:10:31.988 --> 00:10:33.654
There's even these studies,

00:10:33.654 --> 00:10:35.945
endorphins get released in
your brain and all of that.

00:10:35.945 --> 00:10:37.859
I think the exact same
thing is to of learning,

00:10:37.859 --> 00:10:40.793
I mean you're just exercising a different
part of what it means to the human.

00:10:40.793 --> 00:10:42.360
You're exercising your brain.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.195
One, I think is going to
be an economic imperative.

00:10:46.195 --> 00:10:48.077
You will need to self-educate
through your life.

00:10:48.077 --> 00:10:50.945
I mean going back to this answer, the
context is going to keep changing,

00:10:50.945 --> 00:10:57.518
the only skill that will
really be valuable is the
ability to learn very quickly

00:10:57.518 --> 00:10:59.720
and then apply it in a creative way

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.132
to create something that
has never existed before.

00:11:02.793 --> 00:11:04.853
I also think hopefully people
will start to recognize

00:11:04.853 --> 00:11:08.523
that self-education is
an economic imperative

00:11:08.523 --> 00:11:12.523
but it's also a really satisfying thing
that will give people more happiness

00:11:12.523 --> 00:11:15.942
than many of the things that people
perceive will give them happiness.

00:11:15.942 --> 00:11:18.440
Like more square footage or a fancier car.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.831
Now Khan Academy related,

00:11:20.831 --> 00:11:23.593
what are your aspirations for
the growth of the khan Academy?

00:11:25.039 --> 00:11:27.400
Our attitude towards growth is,

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.640
I mean we'd obviously love as many
students as possible to use it,

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.799
but our attitude is let's
focus on what we are producing.

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:38.801
Let's make sure it's this
compelling of an experience

00:11:38.801 --> 00:11:40.335
for the people who are using
it as right now as possible.

00:11:40.335 --> 00:11:44.975
If we do that, other people
will find it compelling as well.

00:11:44.975 --> 00:11:47.669
Those people who are using it and
finding it valuable right now,

00:11:47.669 --> 00:11:49.198
will tell other people.

00:11:49.198 --> 00:11:53.195
In terms of user growth, I mean I
can hope that it continues to grow

00:11:53.195 --> 00:11:55.672
at the rate it's doing, it
grew tenfold this past year

00:11:55.672 --> 00:11:57.593
and we're about two million
unique students a month.

00:11:57.593 --> 00:12:03.344
We don't want to get to 20 million or
200 million and have a bad experience.

00:12:03.344 --> 00:12:06.679
Our main focus is keep
tight on the experience.

00:12:06.679 --> 00:12:09.260
If you talk about growth
from a future point of view,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.802
we hope to expand the faculty

00:12:12.802 --> 00:12:15.855
and this is something I've
started hinting at a little bit.

00:12:15.855 --> 00:12:18.140
I don't want to be the
only person teaching.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.664
I do want to teach on Khan
Academy the rest of my life

00:12:20.664 --> 00:12:21.971
but I think there's other people

00:12:21.971 --> 00:12:24.139
who will bring super
valuable voices to the table.

00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:26.145
We're going to expand the faculty

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:29.005
and you'll hear more about
this in the coming months.

00:12:29.005 --> 00:12:33.976
We're also going to expand kind
of what the platform that we have.

00:12:33.976 --> 00:12:36.664
We hope to enable students to
communicate with each other,

00:12:36.664 --> 00:12:38.735
and to turn really into
a community experience

00:12:38.735 --> 00:12:40.932
and we just have to think
of a good way to do that.

00:12:40.932 --> 00:12:42.982
Obviously expanding the faculty

00:12:42.982 --> 00:12:44.957
but this also goes with
the software part of it.

00:12:44.957 --> 00:12:48.342
We want to expand the content
base of both the video side

00:12:48.342 --> 00:12:49.813
but also the exercises.

00:12:49.813 --> 00:12:55.547
Eventually you can also use Khan
Academy as a way to learn art history,

00:12:55.547 --> 00:12:59.865
or to learn chemistry, whatever,
to actually practice those things.

00:12:59.865 --> 00:13:04.401
Your thoughts on flipping the
classroom, I thought this was fantastic.

00:13:04.401 --> 00:13:05.752
Well thank you for
thinking it was fantastic

00:13:05.752 --> 00:13:07.211
but one thing I want to emphasize

00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:09.340
because I talk about flipping
the classroom in that Ted talk

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.213
and got a lot of press,
and the notion is that

00:13:12.213 --> 00:13:14.339
these high school teachers were saying,

00:13:14.339 --> 00:13:15.550
"Hey, Sal gave a lecture so let's ..."

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.547
My students watch Sal's video

00:13:17.547 --> 00:13:20.214
and then the teacher can use
class time for interaction,

00:13:20.214 --> 00:13:23.379
I 110% agree with that idea.

00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:27.470
What we're advocating now
is taking that even further.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:29.137
It's not even a pure flip,

00:13:29.137 --> 00:13:32.883
it's now every student whether
they're at home or at the classroom,

00:13:32.883 --> 00:13:34.949
working at their own
pace at their own time

00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:36.795
and then the teacher intervenes

00:13:36.795 --> 00:13:41.664
either when there's a need to do the
interactive project or a conversation,

00:13:41.664 --> 00:13:44.947
or the teacher intervenes when
they see a student being stuck.

00:13:44.947 --> 00:13:48.526
You can go to a pure
flip then when you go,

00:13:48.526 --> 00:13:50.864
what we're talking about it becomes
a little less pure of a flip.

00:13:50.864 --> 00:13:53.792
We're saying, "Look if a
kid needs to watch a video"

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:55.559
"in the classroom, that's okay."

00:13:55.559 --> 00:13:58.336
We don't think that the classroom
should be about watching videos

00:13:58.336 --> 00:13:59.989
but if that's what they
need at that moment,

00:13:59.989 --> 00:14:02.913
or that kid, not all the kids,
that kid they can watch the video.

00:14:02.913 --> 00:14:05.497
If they want to do exercise
at home that's great.

00:14:05.497 --> 00:14:08.255
But the important thing is
that they can fully leverage

00:14:08.255 --> 00:14:11.044
the humans in the classroom,
their peers and the teacher.

00:14:11.044 --> 00:14:13.494
Then the teacher spending
every moment of his or her time

00:14:13.494 --> 00:14:15.163
in meaningful interaction with students

00:14:15.163 --> 00:14:17.001
and really taking them to the next level.

00:14:17.001 --> 00:14:19.189
Then the last question is,

00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:23.054
your thoughts on the potential
of game mechanics and ICT,

00:14:23.054 --> 00:14:25.854
in general to encourage
the learning process.

00:14:25.854 --> 00:14:27.793
Any clear evidence in the Khan Academy?

00:14:27.793 --> 00:14:31.459
There is this layer of points
and badges, and streaks

00:14:31.459 --> 00:14:33.461
and things like that in the Khan Academy.

00:14:33.461 --> 00:14:37.055
Anecdotaly it seems like a lot
of kids find it compelling,

00:14:37.055 --> 00:14:42.119
even the data in the school
it looks like a lot of kids

00:14:42.119 --> 00:14:44.523
became more engaged when
we threw this layer on.

00:14:44.523 --> 00:14:46.503
But we're constantly
experimenting with it,

00:14:46.503 --> 00:14:49.253
we're constantly making sure that
it's driving the right behaviors,

00:14:49.253 --> 00:14:54.170
that the kids aren't just looking
at the badges or the points

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.707
but they really are getting good gains

00:14:55.707 --> 00:14:58.095
and they're trying to enjoy
the learning process itself.

00:14:59.326 --> 00:15:02.195
The evidence, we saw really
good results from Los Altos.

00:15:02.195 --> 00:15:05.504
I actually put some of those results
in a previous video that I made today,

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:06.916
so you can look at that.

00:15:06.916 --> 00:15:08.751
That's why Los Altos
is going district wide.

00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:11.081
Not clear if that's due to the
game mechanics or due the content

00:15:11.081 --> 00:15:13.196
or some combination of both of them.

00:15:13.196 --> 00:15:15.084
We hope to continue to explore this

00:15:15.084 --> 00:15:18.591
and we're talking to teachers and students
constantly about how to tweak this,

00:15:18.591 --> 00:15:20.194
so we can make it a better experience.

00:15:20.194 --> 00:15:23.591
We also hope to put a lot of
our game mechanics right now

00:15:23.591 --> 00:15:26.595
for the most part extrinsic, so they're
independent of the subject at hand.

00:15:26.595 --> 00:15:28.928
We also want to put a lot
of intrinsic motivator,

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:32.158
so some of the exercises
themselves are like games

00:15:32.158 --> 00:15:36.238
but their games that are where deep
subject matter help you solve the game.

00:15:36.238 --> 00:15:38.927
This is something that we're
just going to constantly try

00:15:38.927 --> 00:15:40.995
to iterate on it and address.

00:15:40.995 --> 00:15:43.592
This brings to an important issue
as we've gotten a lot of press

00:15:43.592 --> 00:15:49.682
and we think hopefully that we
are having an impact right now.

00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:51.436
But we think we're very
early on in the process,

00:15:51.436 --> 00:15:53.174
so we don't think that we
have all the solutions.

00:15:53.174 --> 00:15:57.628
I think what is kind of the opportunity
that we have in the Khan Academy,

00:15:57.628 --> 00:15:59.524
what excites me is that
we do have the traction

00:15:59.524 --> 00:16:03.786
that we can now become the best lab
for really figuring out what works

00:16:03.786 --> 00:16:05.918
and then getting traction on that.

00:16:05.918 --> 00:16:08.798
We view ourselves where
we're early in the game

00:16:08.798 --> 00:16:12.676
and the baseball now is your top
of the first inning right now.

00:16:12.676 --> 00:16:15.731
Maybe I should make a cricket analogy
but I don't understand cricket.

00:16:15.731 --> 00:16:20.192
We think we're really early on and so
we think it's a very open ended question

00:16:20.192 --> 00:16:21.553
on where we're going to take this.

00:16:21.553 --> 00:16:25.337
We really just want to be open minded
about building stuff, looking at the data,

00:16:25.337 --> 00:16:28.004
looking at the feedback and
then taking that seriously

00:16:28.004 --> 00:16:30.607
and then continuing to refine it.
