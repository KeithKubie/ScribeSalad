00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.960
So one thing that we should explain is
the difference between the terminal

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.290
and the shell.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.074
&gt;&gt; The terminal is a program
that draws text in a window, and

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:10.020
let's you type things in on a keyboard.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.340
Technically it's called
a terminal emulator,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.690
since it acts like one of those
old school hardware terminals.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.360
It displays output on the screen and
it accepts input from the keyboard.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.470
&gt;&gt; But the terminal itself doesn't
know what to do with that input.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.410
It needs another program to do that.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.820
In this case, that program is the shell.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.930
When you type things in the terminal
just sends what you type to that

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.170
separate program.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.750
When you press Enter, the shell
interprets what you wrote as a command,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.670
figures out what program you
want to run, runs it and

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.460
sends the output back to the terminal so
you can see it.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.520
&gt;&gt; You could actually use
the terminal without the shell,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.850
with a lot of terminal programs you
can tell it what program to run.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.320
The default is a shell, but

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.650
you can have it run say,
the Python interpreter instead.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.176
&gt;&gt; Also, there are actually a lot of
different shell programs that you can

00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:53.320
choose from.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.750
The default one on most Linux systems,
and on the Mac, is called GNU Bash.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.770
But there are others called TCSH,
KSH and Seashell.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.260
They all work slightly differently and
have various different features.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.600
For this course,
we're just going to stick with Bash.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.460
&gt;&gt; And you can also use a shell
without the terminal, sort of.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.610
You can write shell commands
into a file and arrange for

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.240
your computer to run the shell
program on that file.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.710
This is called shell scripting.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.510
It's a bit of an advanced topic and
we don't go into it in this course.
