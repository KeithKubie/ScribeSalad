00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.750
What's up guys? We are back in the lab today and this time with a couple of new toys

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.460
These are a couple of real-life pokeballs you may have seen floating around on the internet

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.200
I got this one from Dan Markham from the What's Inside channel where they cut open a metal Pokeball

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.520
So if you want to see what they look like on the inside go check them out this one's from the devin supertramp

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.330
channel where they produced a video on

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.029
Pokemon in real life. A couple of good quality videos if you want to see them go check them out the links are in the

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.309
Description these things don't actually belong to me. I do have to give them back, but while they're in my possession

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.379
I thought it'd be fun to cast them in silicone

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.840
So we can make exact replicas and have our own silicone pokeball mold for casting whatever we want

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.799
I have explicit instructions to give this pokeball back in the same condition

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.860
I received it the funny thing about this is when Devin lent this to me

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.349
He asked me not to scratch it up, but to return it in the same condition

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.010
I got it

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.239
If you set your pokeball down they fall forward so there's definitely some

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.300
Electronics or something waited inside that makes them go Facedown

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:00.809
I would rather that these things sit upward-facing at a 45 degree angle or flat, so when we design our molds

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.309
We're going to have two designs they come out a little bit better like that. I notice on the bottom half here

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.559
[I] can wiggle it. There's a little bit of play

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.409
So that makes me believe that there might be a way to separate these two halves. We gently work around the edges

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.219
You can actually see that there's a clasp under there

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.529
There we go, okay cool so our pokeball does separate into two halves

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.820
You can see it's actually got three latches to hold together and this is why it's top-heavy

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.239
it's got this really heavy metal button near the front and

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.758
Apparently there aren't any batteries in this so that makes a lot of sense as to why it's not working [now] [these] button cell batteries

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.759
Are [2016] and they should be?

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.109
2032 for this unit but to compensate for that all we need to do really is [just] bend these wires up a little bit

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.320
So they make contact

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.009
Let's tuck the wires in out of the way and put [the] two halves back together, and it should click back into place

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.339
There we go, and now we get a little light-up pokeball you're welcome Devin don't say I didn't do anything for you

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.100
Now these balls are mostly filled with error which means if we put them in the container and fill it up with silicone

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.479
They're going to float to the top and that's not going to be good for getting a mold we need to weight them down

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.980
There we go. I heard a snap

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.459
Awesome, just like that our pokeballs gained some weight, so we're back inside

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.329
and I packed these things full of as many rocks as I could get into them which has given them a

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.119
Significant amount of weight that's gonna be important because we want these things to stay down at the bottom of the silicon so at this

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.799
Point let's go ahead and fire up our hot glue gun Gather up some acrylic and start mixing some silicones

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.660
So check this out

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.799
I've got two black dots on my acrylic and what we're going to do is glue the base of the pokéballs on there

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.760
So they angle up at A 45-degree angle [then] we're going to take these five inch acrylic tubes

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.949
Place them over top of the pokéballs and use a bead [of] hot glue to secure them in place and make them air tight

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.320
The only thing left to do after that is to pour [in] the silicone let them set and see if we got ourselves a polka

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.719
Mold now in my last silicone pouring video. I didn't explain how to mix up the silicone, but there are basically two steps

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.969
There's the white runny silicone

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.860
Which is really icky and Gooey stuff?

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.270
And then you have something called a catalyst which can come in different colors in my last video

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.890
We used a red catalyst, so in this video

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.320
I thought it'd be fun to use purple and we mix this in on a ratio of [1] to [10], and that's by weight

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.460
Silicone is really sticky stuff to work with so if you do get any on you

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.880
It's a real pain in the butt, so this is why I'm wearing gloves

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.790
So let's slap a bowl on our scale measure out some silicone, and then add 10 percent of the catalyst and mix it in thoroughly

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.760
5 pounds 4 Ounces 2 Grams

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:47.779
Oh 1 [pounds] equals 2381 point three six grams answers my question, so we want 239 grams of our hardener

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.159
At this point you can see the consistency kind of looks like Blueberry yogurt

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.739
[actually] looks really good really nice, and I forgot a cloth. So we're just going to set this on my workbench

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.219
I'll let that harden up later. All right cool. It's time to pour

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.449
You can already see on this one trapped Air bubbles are starting to rise out

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.779
I'm just going to help those along by getting a little jiggle

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.570
Hopefully those little doodles will help release any trapped Air bubbles

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.010
Because if there's anything trapped on the inside that's not going to work out very well for us

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.750
Now you can see I made a ridiculous mess pulling this stuff

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.389
We've got leaks coming through the sides we've got it spilling over the top

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.709
You can see this puddle where the beaters have been leaking silicone, and right now. It's extremely sticky

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.799
We come back tomorrow when it's firmed up and rather than having a sticky mess that whole thing will peel [right] off and clean up

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.200
Without any trouble at all so our real-life pokeballs are completely encapsulated in silicone right now

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.999
We really have no way of knowing whether or not they turned out so did we secure them well enough to the base

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.660
Or are they going to float to the top?

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.419
you're going to join me in the next video because tomorrow we cut them open rip them apart and take a look at what we've

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.619
Got thanks so much for joining me [for] this experiment. I'll be looking for you the next one Doc you then?

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.050
you
