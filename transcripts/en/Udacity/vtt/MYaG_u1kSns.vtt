00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.102
IP lookups find longest prefixes. Let's suppose that we

00:00:04.102 --> 00:00:07.222
want to represent a particular IP address as one

00:00:07.222 --> 00:00:11.902
point in the space from zero to 2 to the 32 minus 1, or the range of all

00:00:11.902 --> 00:00:16.880
32-byte IP addresses. Each prefix represents a smaller range

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.460
inside this larger range of 32-bit numbers. Obviously, this

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.850
is not to scale. Now these ranges, of course,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.520
might be overlapping, as is shown here. And the idea

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.730
is that longest prefix match will match the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.880
smallest prefix for which the IP address range

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.170
overlaps that of the specified IP address. So

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.630
longest prefix match is harder to perform than exact

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.660
match. For one, the destination IP address does

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.220
not indicate the length of the longest matching

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.530
prefix, so some algorithm needs to determine the

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.540
length of the longest matching prefix, which in this

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.050
case is 21. So we somehow need a way to search the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.520
space of all prefix lengths, as well as prefixes of a given length.
