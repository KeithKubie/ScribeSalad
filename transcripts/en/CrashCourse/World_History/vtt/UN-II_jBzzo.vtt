Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World
History and today we’re going to talk about

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.040
a relationship. No, not you, college girlfriend.
No, not that kind of relationship either.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.339
No. STAN, THIS IS A HISTORY CLASS. We’re
gonna talk about the relationship between

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.050
a city, Venice, and an empire, the Ottomans,
and in doing so, we're going to return to

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.780
an old theme here on Crash Course World History:
How studying history can make you a better

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.800
boyfriend and/or girlfriend. Probably or,
but I’m not here to judge.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.200
Mr. Green! Mr. Green! No offense, but you don’t really
seem like an expert in how to get girls to like you.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.380
Here’s something amazing, Me From the Past.
You know that girl, Sarah, in 10th grade,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.360
who’s super super smart?

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.240
Yeah, she’s really hot. She’s like three
or four leagues hotter than I am.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.430
Yeah, I married her. So shut up and listen.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:48.340
[theme music]

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.180
Ten minutes from now, I’m hoping you’ll understand
how one mutually beneficial relationship, between

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.640
the Venetians and the Ottomans, led to two really
big deals: the European Renaissance and Christopher

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.380
Columbus. Not like his birth, I mean he wasn't
like a half-Ottoman, half-Venetian baby, his travels!

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.820
So Venice is a city made up of hundreds of
islands at the northern tip of the Adriatic

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.590
Sea, but walking around it, you can’t help
but feel that the city is essentially a collection

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.539
of floating buildings tied together by some
canals. If ever there was a place where geography

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.770
was destiny, it was Venice. Venice was literally
built for ocean-going trade. As you can imagine,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.539
Venice didn’t have a lot of natural resources
— except for fish and mustaches — so if

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.780
they wanted to grow, they had to rely on trade.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.359
First, Venetians became experts in shipbuilding.
Remember that when the crusaders needed ships

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.170
for their crazy Fourth Crusade, they headed
to Venice, because the Venetians were famous

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.899
for their ships, including merchant ships
like the galley and the cog. Not only could

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.749
they build ships; they could also sail them
to pleasant locales like Constantinople and

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:45.499
the Levant, so the Venetians formed trade
treaties, sometimes called concessions, with

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:49.799
the Byzantines, and then when Constantinople
fell to the Ottomans and became Istanbul,

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.549
the Venetians were quick to make trade treaties
with their new neighbors, famously saying

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.200
that while Istanbul had been Constantinople,
the matter of Constantinople getting the works

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.020
was nobody’s business but the Turks.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.679
But even before the Ottomans, Venice had experience
trading with the Islamic world: It initially

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.999
established itself as the biggest European
power in the Mediterranean thanks to its trade

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.799
with Egypt’s sultan in the outlandishly
lucrative pepper business. Can’t blame the

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.170
Europeans, really, that stuff is delicious.
Oh, you mean like actual pepper? Ah, that’s

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.860
good too, especially since it masks the taste
of spoiled meat, which most meat was in the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.170
days before refrigeration. Due to some awkward…
Crusades… the Egyptian merchants weren't

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.870
terribly welcome in…ya know...Europe. But
they had all the pepper, because the Egyptians

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.420
imported it from India and controlled both
overland and oversea access to the Mediterranean.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.650
And when others cited moral or religious opposition
to trade, the Venetians usually found a way.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.209
Which is why the whole freaking town is made
of marble. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.269
To avoid the sticky situation of having to
consort with the heathen Egyptians, the Venetians

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.500
employed a handy story. This is the Piazza
San Marco, the #1 Destination in the Entire

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.650
World for People Who Like to Be Pooped on
by Pigeons. It’s also home to this church,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.829
which includes some bronze horses you may
remember that were looted from Constantinople.

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.549
And it contains the body of St. Mark, author
of the Gospel According to St. Mark, who had

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.989
once been the bishop of Alexandria, in Egypt.

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.239
So naturally he died and was buried in Alexandria,
but the Venetians claimed him as their own,

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.780
because apparently one time he visited Venice,
and these two merchants hatched a very clever

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.700
plan. They went to Alexandria on business,
stole St. Mark’s body and then hid it in

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.240
a shipment of pork, which the Muslims didn’t check very
carefully because, you know, they were disgusted by it.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.400
You can even see a version of this on the
mosaics in the Basilica of St. Mark, complete

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.480
with the Muslims shouting an Arabic version
of “ewww gross.” And then, forever after,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.230
the Venetians were like, “Listen, we HAVE
to trade with these guys. We use it as a secret

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.590
way to ferry saint bodies out of Egypt. We
don’t WANT to become fantastically wealthy.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.450
It’s just a necessary byproduct of our saint-saving.”

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.780
So what did Venice import? Lots, but notable
for us, they imported a lot of grain, because

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.670
if you've ever been to Venice, then you might
have noticed that it is basically made out

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.849
of marble and therefore kind of difficult
to farm. The Ottomans, on the other hand,

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.439
had abundant grain, even before they conquered
Egypt and its oh-so-fertile Nile River in

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.530
1517. Also, while trade was certainly the
linchpin of Venice’s economic success, they

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.420
had a diverse economy. They also produced
things like textiles and glass. And in fact,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.980
Venice is still known for its glass, but they
couldn’t produce it without a special ash

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.989
that they used to make the colors. And you’ll
never guess where the ash came from. The Ottomans.

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.850
Am I making you a better boyfriend yet? You
have to add to your partner’s life. You

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.260
have to color their glass. That sounds like
a euphemism. but it’s not-- BACK TO HISTORY.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.250
One last thing about Venice that makes it
special, at least for its time. Venice was

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.920
a republic, not a monarchy or, god forbid,
an empire. So its leaders were elected, and

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.720
had to answer to the populace- I mean, at
least the property-owning male populace. The

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.200
ruler was the doge and he got to live in a
very nice house and wear a funny hat.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.970
The Sultan of the Ottoman empire also got
to live in a nice house and wear a funny hat,

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.390
but there the similarities end. To begin,
the Ottomans were an empire that lasted from

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.560
around 1300 CE until 1919, making it one of
the longest-lasting and richest empires in

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.080
world history. The Ottomans managed to blend
their pastoral nomadic roots with some very

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.420
un-nomadic empire building, and some really
impressive architecture, like this and this

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.970
and this, making them very different from,
wait for it, the Mongols.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.750
The empire, or at least the dynasty, was founded
by Osman Bey, and Ottoman is a Latinization

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.340
of Osmanli, which basically means like the
House of Osman. No, Stan, the house, y-, yes.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.250
Oh my Gosh. The Ottomans were greatest in
the 15th and 16th centuries under two famous

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.450
sultans: First, Mehmed the Conqueror ruled
from 1451 to 1481 and expanded Ottoman control

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.150
to the Balkans, which is why there are Bosnian
Muslims today. But Ottoman expansion reached

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:40.500
its greatest extent under Suleiman the Magnificent,
who ruled from 1520 to 1566. He took valuable

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.370
territory in Mesopotamia and Egypt, thus securing
control over the western parts of the Asian

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.590
trade – both overland and oversea. He also
defeated the king of Hungary and laid siege

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.790
to Vienna in 1526. And he turned the Ottomans
into a huge naval power. Also, judging from

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.340
his hat, he had the largest brain in human
history.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.270
The Ottomans basically controlled about half
of what the Romans controlled, but it was

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.660
much more valuable because of all the Indian
Ocean trade you’ll remember from last week.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.730
So all this land brought a lot of wealth,
but it needed to be ruled. The Ottomans could

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.640
have followed the Roman model, where you send
out generals and nobles to rule over conquered

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.410
territories, or they could’ve demanded the
allegiance of client kings like the Persians,

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.670
or developed a civil service system like the
Chinese, but instead, they created an entirely

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.250
new ruling class, a system that some historians
call the slave aristocracy.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.510
So if you are a King, one of your main problems
is hereditary nobles, because they always

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.960
want to replace you, and they don’t want
to give you your money, &amp; they want their

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.050
ugly sons to marry your gorgeous daughters,
etc. One way to deal with this problem is

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.010
to make them part of the government so they
feel included and shut up. Another way is

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.790
to kill them. That’s what they usually do in Russia.
I’m whispering so Putin doesn’t hear me. Ahh! Putin!

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.600
The Ottomans just bypassed the problem of
hereditary nobles altogether by creating both

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:54.100
an army and a bureaucracy from scratch so
they would be loyal only to the Sultan. How?

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.260
The devshirme, a program in which they kidnapped
Christian boys, converted them to Islam, and

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.170
raised them either to be members of an elite
military fighting force called the Janissaries,

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.810
or to be government bureaucrats. Incidentally,
which of those gigs would you prefer? Because

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.950
I think that says a lot about you as a person.
Either way, you weren’t allowed to have

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.420
kids, which prevented the whole hereditary
nobles problem, and also ensured that the

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:19.570
Ottoman government would contain quite a lot
of Eunuchs. Oh, it’s time for the Open Letter?

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.280
An Open Letter to Ottoman Eunuchs. But first,
let’s see what’s in the secret compartment

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:29.590
today. Oh, its a blow up globe. See what quitting
smoking will get you, Me From the Past?

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.930
Hey there Ottoman Eunuchs, How’s it hanging?
I’m just kidding, that was mean. Listen,

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.310
there’ve been eunuchs all around this great
planet of ours. But you’re special. I’m

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.250
not going to give you the details why, because
they’re horrifying. I’m just going to

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.220
link to an article in the video info.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.170
You started out just being harem guards, Ottoman
Eunuchs, which is kind of an obvious gig for

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.830
you, but then, you expanded. As had happened
in China, you made yourselves indispensable,

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.780
and you were often the center of palace intrigue.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.890
In fact, few people in the Ottoman Empire
were as wealthy and important as many of you

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.390
were. Way to turn lemons into lemonade. I’m
sorry, I shouldn’t have brought up lemons.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.880
Best wishes, John Green

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.980
This system eventually broke down as Janissaries
(who had guns) lobbied to be allowed to have

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.030
families. But until that happened, the Ottomans
system of using a mix of slave administrators

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:13.220
and Eunuchs to run everything worked incredibly
well. But to return to the relationship between

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.630
the Ottomans and the Venetians: After the
Ottomans captured Egypt, they pretty much

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:21.600
controlled the flow of trade through the Mediterranean,
but the Venetians had centuries of experience

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.300
as mariners, and also lots of boats. Speaking
of ships, I ship these guys. So the Ottomans

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.260
were content to let the Venetians do all the like,
trading and carrying of goods, and they just made

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.760
their money from taxes. And that worked because both
Venice and the Ottomans added value to each other.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.200
Healthy relationships — listen up, Me From
the Past — aren’t about extracting value;

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:46.130
they have to be mutually beneficial to work.
And boy, was that a mutually beneficial relationship.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.820
For instance, Venice became super rich, and
being super rich was a prerequisite for the

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:55.170
European Renaissance because all that art
and learning required money, which is why

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.030
Venice was a leading city at the beginning
of the European Renaissance before being eclipsed

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.640
by Florence, Rome, and I don’t know, say
Rotterdam.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.520
Also, this relationship established firm connections
between Europe and Islamic world, which allowed

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:11.440
ideas to flow again especially old Greek  that ideas
had preserved and built upon by Muslims. I mean,

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.000
I guess those connections had existed for a long time,
but crusades aren’t a great way to exchange ideas.

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.940
But perhaps the most crucial result of the
Venetian and Ottoman control of trade was

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.760
that it forced other Europeans to look for
different paths to the riches of the East.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.080
And that fueled huge investments in exploration.
The Portuguese sailed south and east around

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.900
the southern tip of Africa, and the Spanish
went west, believing that the Indies and China

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.890
were much closer than they turned out to be.
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.
