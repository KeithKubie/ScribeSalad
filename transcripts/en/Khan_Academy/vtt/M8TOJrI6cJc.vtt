00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.600
So we're at problem 76.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.119
Which of the following ratios
is most nearly equal to the

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:13.920
ratio of 1 plus the square
root of 5 to 2.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.079
And then they give us a bunch of
integer choices, so this is

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.290
really just a problem of
approximating what the square

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.970
root of 5 is.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.370
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.100
So 2 is equal to the square
root of 4, or 2 squared is

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.510
equal to 4.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.750
3 is equal to the square
root of 9.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.500
So the square root of 5 is going
to be a lot closer to 2.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.410
What's 2.1 squared?

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.280
2.1 times 2.1 you get 21.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.570
0, 2 times 21 is 42.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.100
So then you get, 4.41
So 2.1 is equal to

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.180
square root of 4.41.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:09.950
2.2 times 2.2, 2 is 44, 0, 44,
this gets pretty close to 5.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.550
8, 4.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.430
So 2.2 is I think about as close
as we're going to get.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.920
If we approximate the square
root of 5 is 2.2, and this is

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.640
just an approximation, we just
have to figure out which

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:30.990
choice is closest, 1 plus 2.2
over 2, that's equal to 3.2

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.210
over 2, and that's not one of
the choices, because this

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.200
really isn't an integer
choice.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.160
But let's see if I can
just express this,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.405
this is equal to 1.6.

00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:45.850
It'd give you 1.6:1.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.200
So we just have to find which
of the choices are roughly

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.450
equal to 1.6:1.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.640
So choice A, 8:5.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.760
Well what is that?

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.230
That's 1 and 3/5.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.920
Well that's exactly 1.6.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.630
So that's the choice I'm
going to go with.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.300
Let me look at the other ones.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.490
6:5 is going to be a lot closer
to 1, 6:5 is 1.2, 5:4

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.900
is 1.25, 2:1 is 2.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.530
So choice A is the
best choice.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.990
Next question.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.340
Problem 77.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.900
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:39.470
7 over 1/5 plus 5 over 1/7 is
equal to-- 7 divided by 1/5 is

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.240
equal to 7 times 5, plus
5 divided by 1/7 is

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.840
equal to 5 times 7.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.950
When you divide by a fraction,
it's the same thing as

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.560
multiplying by its reciprocal.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.370
So 5 times 7.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.370
So this is equal to 35 plus 35,
which is equal to 70, and

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.730
that's choice D.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.280
78.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.930
From January 1, 1991, to January
1, 1993, the number of

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.030
people enrolled in health
maintenance organizations

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.220
increased by 15%.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.980
The enrollment on January
1, 1993 was 45 million.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.070
How many million people, to
the nearest million, were

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.310
rolled in health maintenance
organizations

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.630
on January 1, 1991?

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.730
OK, so let's just call this x.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.140
That's what they want to know,
they want to know how many

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.680
million people were
enrolled in 1991.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.070
So when x increased by 15%,
you got to 45 million.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.410
So remember, not 15% of
x is 45 million, x

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.380
increases by 15%.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.630
So let me write an extra step
that I normally don't do.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.080
So you could view it as
x plus 15% x, right?

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.520
This is x, and then you're
increasing it by 15% of x, is

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.300
going to be equal
to 45 million.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.490
And then this is 1x plus 0.15x,
so that's 1.15x is

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.240
equal to 45 million.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.970
And you could also just go
straight to this step.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.480
In fact, you usually can once
you get used to it.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.130
You can say, 15% increase,
that's the same thing as

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.770
multiplying by 1.15.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:31.820
So x is equal to 45 divided by
1.15, and we're going to have

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.230
to do a little bit of division
to figure this out.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:44.510
115 divided by 45, add a couple
of 0's So it's 1.15

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.270
divide by 45, so that's the same
thing as 115, take the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.220
decimal place, go 2 to the
right, going to 4,500.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.800
115 goes into 450
how many times?

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.030
Does it go into it 4 times?

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.250
No, that'd be 460, so it
goes into it 3 times.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.820
3 times 115 is 345.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:17.460
This difference is 105,
bring down a 0.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.440
115 goes into 1,050
how many times?

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:30.060
If I did 8, 800, I think it's 8
times, because 9 would be--

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.040
actually 900 plus 90 plus 45,
actually it would be 9 times.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.750
9 times 5 is 45.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.640
9 times 1 is 9 plus 4 is 13.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.280
9 times 9 is 1-- I'm sorry,
is 9, plus 1 is 10.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.600
You have a remainder 15, bring
down the 0, that goes 1 time.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.610
So we already have the
decimal point.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.710
And all their choices
are in integers.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.310
So this is closest to B, 39.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.630
And I wanted to get that last
decimal point, because maybe

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.850
that was 39.9, in which
case 40 would

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.770
be the closest choice.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.480
Sometimes they get
tricky like that.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.080
Next question.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.700
79.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:35.120
R is the set of positive odd
integers less than 50.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:43.730
And S is equal to squares
of R, squares of the

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.210
numbers in that set.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.430
How many elements does the

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.190
intersection of R and S contain?

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.930
OK, so we have to say,
positive odd

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.160
editors less than 50.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.480
So we have to think, how many
positive odd integers less

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.540
than 50 are squares of
other positive odd

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.750
integers less than 50.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.330
It doesn't take a long time to
figure out all of the squares

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.870
between 1 and 50.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:19.950
It's 1, 2, 4, 9, 16, 25,
they start increasing

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:26.320
pretty fast, 36, 49.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.650
Now we know that they
have to be positive,

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:30.700
these are all positive.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.830
We know they have to be odd,
because we're looking for

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.690
things that are both squares
and they're in set R.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.380
They're squares, and they're
squares of other

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.680
things in set R.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.620
So let's take out all
the even numbers.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:51.170
Can't be 36, can't be 2, can't
be 4, can't be 16.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.370
1 is 1 squared.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:08:00.160
So 1 is in set R, it's a
positive odd integer less than

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.810
50, and it is a square of
another positive odd integer

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:06.570
less than 50, a square
of itself.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.090
So 1 counts.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:10.460
9 is 3 squared.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:15.600
9 itself is a positive odd
integer less than 50, and it's

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.350
also the square of 3, which is
another positive odd integer

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.940
less than 50.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.900
So 9 counts.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.190
25, same logic.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.380
It's a positive odd integer less
than 50, it's the square

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.360
of 5, which is the same.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.850
And 49, same thing.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.090
Square of 7, both 49 and
7 are positive odd

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.610
integers less than 50.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.360
So I found four.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.610
So that's C.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:46.440
Question 80.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.640
A retail appliance store priced
a video recorder at 20%

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.260
above the wholesale
cost of $200.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.090
We could just go, 20% above
200, that's going to

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.520
be 1.2 times 200.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.820
If a store employee applied the
10% employee discount to

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.500
the retail price to buy the
recorder, how much did the

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.980
employee pay for the recorder?

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.020
So this is the retail price.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.890
This was the wholesale price,
that's what the store bought

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.010
it for, this is what a
non-employee would have to

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.600
pay, 1.2 times 200.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.610
And then the employee
got a 10% discount.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.450
So essentially the
employee paid the

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.330
retail price times 0.9.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.290
So what's 1.2 times 200?

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:39.320
200 times 1.2.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.140
Let's just do it out.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.060
2 times 200 is 400.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.760
Add a zero.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.440
1 times 200 is 200.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.640
And we have one point behind the
decimal-- well let's add

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.560
them up, you get 2400.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.720
We have one digit behind the
decimal, so it's 240.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.730
So the retail price is 240, and
we have to multiply that

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.750
times 0.9 to figure out what
the employee paid.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.240
They got a 10% discount, which
is another way of saying they

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.100
played 90% of the
retail price.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:11.320
So 240 times 0.9.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:15.750
9 times 0 is zero, 9 times
4 is 36, 9 times 2

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.020
is 18 plus 3, 21.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.860
We have one number behind the
decimal point, so the employee

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:25.090
paid $216, which is choice B.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.890
Now I'm out of time,
I'll continue

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.690
this in the next video.
