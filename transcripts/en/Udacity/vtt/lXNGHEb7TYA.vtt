00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.690
IBS scores are powerful tools that can give

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.220
you a sense of genetic identity, with other humans

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.800
around you. But it's not just the presence

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.790
of similar SNVs that gives away clues to relatedness

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.640
but, it's also the order of the SNVs.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.180
Remember when personal genetic information is obtained, not only

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.820
is the individual SNV determined, but we know where

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.880
exactly it's placement is on the Chromosome. This order

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.510
on the chromosome is significant, when we consider that

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.520
your genome is one set of chromosomes from one parent

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.510
and one set of chromosomes from another. What if instead

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.500
of doing a point by point comparison of SNV's, we

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.140
actually look at the order in which you share

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.304
them along the length of a chromosome. For example lets

00:00:44.304 --> 00:00:47.500
say you find that your 50% related to one individual.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.992
Now this is not 50% IBS. Okay, this is not

00:00:50.992 --> 00:00:54.225
what we're talking about. We're talking about relatedness you're

00:00:54.225 --> 00:00:58.190
50% or half related to someone. In the genetics

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.350
world there are only two options that allow you

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.160
to be half. Exactly half related to someone. You're half

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.660
related to a Parent. Right? You have two parents.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.400
You receive half your chromosomes from one and half

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.180
from another. And you're also half related to one

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.020
of your Full Siblings. So based on what you know

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.400
about chromosome transmission and recombination which we

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.960
learned about in lesson five. Which of the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.520
following chromosome comparison diagrams indicates a parental

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.180
relationship and which one indicates a full sibling

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.330
relationship? Now in this particular scenario the

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.270
shaded areas are whole links of shared SNVs.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.610
So there is were we had an IBS match. These SNVs match with the other person.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.500
Remember you have two copies of every chromosome so

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.670
imagine that these are your chromosomes. And in this

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.850
scenario, you match them with an individual, and you

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.370
see the shaded regions are shared. You match with another

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.980
individual, and you see that the shaded region is

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.760
shared here along the length of the whole chromosome,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.320
but not the other. Indicate which one is the

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.930
parental relationship and which one is the full sibling relationship.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.699
By entering the number one or the number two in the text boxes you see here.
