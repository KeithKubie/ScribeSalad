LUKE MAHE: Ready to go.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.940
So welcome to this Hangout.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.940
This is the Places
API Hangout.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.970
I am Luke Mahe and
this is Justin.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.330
Justin is one of our PMs
down here in Sydney

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.460
on the Places team.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.645
Justin, why don't you tell us
a little bit about yourself?

00:00:31.645 --> 00:00:32.470
JUSTIN CHU: Sure.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.490
Thank you, Luke.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.775
I was born and raised in
the States, New Jersey.

00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:37.990
Moved out to California
to go to university.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.650
I started off my Google career
last October at YouTube,

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.620
working on a bunch
of partner stuff.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.670
But thankfully, I've been lucky
enough to come down to

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.590
this gorgeous city of Sydney,
Australia, and work with the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.130
geo developer team and
the Maps API team

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.540
with Luke as well.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.380
LUKE MAHE: Yes.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.210
So we've got a special
day today with us

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.730
with the Base's API.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.810
We're going to talk about a
couple of things which we're

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.519
launching very soon and then
maybe some stuff that's coming

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.250
down in the future.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.820
JUSTIN CHU: Absolutely.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.200
LUKE MAHE: So what've we got
to show people today?

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.620
JUSTIN CHU: Sure.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.070
So today I'd like to talk about
a couple new things that

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.390
you just said, one of which
we call the JavaScript

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.700
Autocomplete Data Services.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.260
And though that name is quite
a mouthful, it's actually

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.330
quite a straightforward, awesome
feature that we have.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.930
So today in the JavaScript
library, you have to bind a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.090
input field to some widget for
you to actually get the

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.510
autocomplete functionality.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.980
That's pretty cool and fun.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.920
That's pretty simple, so that a
lot of developers, they want

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.470
a quick easy fix, snap that
thing around to the

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.890
application, you get some
autocomplete functionality.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.060
But obviously, Google
developers, externally and

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.330
internally, they want some more
flexibility and freedom.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.210
And so with this JSON collection
from the data

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.420
service, you can style your
predictions in more

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.730
feature-rich ways.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.900
And you can also add in your
own predictions as well.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.730
So one use case, actually, that
Google uses themselves in

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.080
the Maps application is to put
in your home address with your

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.150
directions.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.650
So as you can imagine during
location-based applications,

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.240
start locations, or important
locations, or things that you

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.840
need to know that you have in
your prediction list, you can

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.100
stick them right in there
alongside our

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.250
predictions as well.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.620
LUKE MAHE: Cool.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.770
We actually have
a demo of this.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.140
JUSTIN CHU: Awesome.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.490
LUKE MAHE: So here we go.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.750
So here we go.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.030
Do you want to have a
play with your demo?

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.790
JUSTIN CHU: Sure, exactly.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.535
So this demo is actually just to
showcase the styling things

00:02:27.535 --> 00:02:28.630
that we can do today.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.330
So with this new data service,
you can do things like

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.380
actually add different types of
color for flair that match

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.390
your applications themes.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.730
This one, for example, is based
on the Google colors.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.050
The fun thing here is that you
can actually-- it actually

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.310
rotates through different
colors through our log.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.620
But you can do much stronger
things here, too, involving

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.030
premiere CSS and styling that
I know nothing about and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.470
you're very, very good at.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.930
So hopefully we'll get some cool
demos up in the future.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:57.290
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.760
Here we're just doing some cool
things by changing the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.400
bold color to different--

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.650
JUSTIN CHU: Exactly.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.820
LUKE MAHE: --interesting
colors to

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.990
highlight what was typed.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.240
JUSTIN CHU: For sure, yeah.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.300
LUKE MAHE: Cool.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.600
So what else have we got
coming out soon?

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.980
JUSTIN CHU: Yeah.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.840
So this one's super exciting.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.560
We call it the Query
Autocomplete.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.150
And so when the Places API
launched last year, the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.660
autocomplete functionality
was one of the most

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.930
differentiating, powerful
traits we had

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:27.500
as part of the service.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.550
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.875
I remember you do cool stuff
like just start typing where

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:31.555
you live, and it completed
your home address.

00:03:31.555 --> 00:03:31.840
JUSTIN CHU: Exactly.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.520
Pretty neat.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.490
LUKE MAHE: It was so useful.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.240
I remember the previous PM, Tor,
was obsessed with making

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.670
this the standard
for everybody.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.960
He never wanted to every
type his address again.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.950
He wanted to type the first
letter and then have all the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.770
forms in the web complete
everything for him.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.480
JUSTIN CHU: Yeah, that's a
perfect world, definitely.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.990
And we're slowly
getting there.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.710
I mean, there's more and more
people that are using the

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:51.930
service, for sure.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.090
We also know that it's
not complete.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.100
We were missing one big thing.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.740
And that one big thing, we're
happy to say, we're including

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.080
today as our next [? update ?]
very soon.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.590
Oh man.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.820
It is going to be
popular queries.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.360
So you can actually imagine
taking some of the magic of

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.860
that really cool, awesome search
box, map.google.com,

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.640
and putting that within
your own application.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.730
So now, today, instead of saying
things like points of

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.155
interest, like Starbucks, or
addresses, like 48 Pirrama

00:04:19.155 --> 00:04:23.100
Road, you can actually include
popular queries-- like Italian

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.620
restaurants, like
coffee shops--

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.230
inside the actual search
boxes themselves.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.390
And things will get
autocompleted there.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.920
LUKE MAHE: That's cool.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.620
But I don't believe you.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.500
So let's see a demo.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.450
JUSTIN CHU: Cool.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.570
So this is the gorgeous city
of Sydney, Australia.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.400
I'm going to type in one of the
queries I have planned.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.017
It's Italian restaurants, as
you can see, that rows two

00:04:49.017 --> 00:04:51.630
through five, actually
have places

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.240
in geographic locations.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.490
But the first one that was
autocompleted was actually a

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.375
query, Italian restaurants.

00:04:57.375 --> 00:04:59.950
In case you don't believe me,
Luke, come up with a random--

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.440
what's a random query
we can think about?

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.740
LUKE MAHE: Oh, French
restaurants.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.460
JUSTIN CHU: French?

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.400
No way.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.510
Let's see if we can do it.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.520
I see France coming
up, then food.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.350
French, let's see.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.950
Oh, restaurant, right there.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:10.080
LUKE MAHE: Oh!

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.080
And you only had to type
in half of it.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.570
JUSTIN CHU: Exactly.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.180
Now that is what I called
good [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.540
LUKE MAHE: I know.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.900
You've made my day.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.730
JUSTIN CHU: And mine, too.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:17.360
Oh my god.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.690
Together, two days were made.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.300
But yeah, so as you see in this
demo, which was awesome,

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.120
made by Luke and Co., you can
get cool queries and use them

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.050
alongside our other services
like text search and things

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.730
like that to get points of
interest on your map.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.030
LUKE MAHE: And the very famous
one is pizza in New York.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.270
You actually want to search for
pizza places in New York,

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.530
not just places that have "New
York pizza" in their name.

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.420
JUSTIN CHU: Oh, really?

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.180
How is the pizza
here in Sydney?

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.360
LUKE MAHE: Not as good
as New York.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.480
JUSTIN CHU: Not as good,
you would say?

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.080
LUKE MAHE: I would say so from
personal experience.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.960
JUSTIN CHU: So what's their
pride and joy, then?

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.135
What would be pizza in New York
to "blank" in Sydney?

00:05:53.135 --> 00:05:54.690
LUKE MAHE: Oh, who knows?

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.900
You'd probably say the
traditional Aussie pie.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.140
JUSTIN CHU: Aussie pie?

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.680
Good.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.010
OK.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.530
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.830
JUSTIN CHU: I actually only
had that a couple times.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.170
Is there such a thing
as tiger pie?

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.190
I heard of that.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.500
LUKE MAHE: I think you're
making things up.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.820
JUSTIN CHU: Oh.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.100
And probably I've been
having bad sources.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.720
But yeah, cool.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.410
LUKE MAHE: Cool.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.940
So what are some other things
that are coming down the

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.480
pipeline for the Places API?

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.460
JUSTIN CHU: Well, so two
things I can call out

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.560
specifically, which I'm excited
about, one of which is

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.520
very much-- and thanks to the
people who have used our Issue

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.280
Tracker and Stack Overflow
and those forums--

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.270
that is, of course, Business
Listing Photos.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.930
That is something we're very
actively working on and we're

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.350
excited to get out by
the end of the year.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.480
Any questions for Photos?

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.760
LUKE MAHE: No.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.040
JUSTIN CHU: Yeah.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.005
It's exciting, though.

00:06:37.005 --> 00:06:37.790
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, it
is pretty cool.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:38.730
JUSTIN CHU: Finally you can
get some pictures of what

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:39.950
you're looking at.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.120
Next up by the end of the year
as well, is the thing that

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.880
we're going to call radar search
Essentially, you're

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.320
going to be able to get up to
200 lat/longs and references

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.430
of places around a
circular area.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.950
So you can imagine that sort
of wave [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:53.370
coming out from you.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.430
LUKE MAHE: That's cool.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.260
JUSTIN CHU: And so this thing
here is basically a great--

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.930
one use case for it would be
building a heat map for the

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.940
neighborhood, trying to find
different types of avenues and

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.510
venues around where you live.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:12.100
But besides that, it's a good
way to showcase the amount and

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.980
variety of places just
anywhere you want.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.010
So it's not something about
specific details for a place,

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.140
but just what is the place
ecosystem around you like.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.620
And I think it's really
interesting and definitely

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.150
visually very, very pretty.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:25.880
LUKE MAHE: That's pretty cool.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.590
There's a lot of useful use
cases for doing the what's

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.590
around me sort of queries.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:30.820
JUSTIN CHU: Yes, completely.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.490
And so in a little bit longer
term, there are two main

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.950
strengths that Places API have
that are guiding its road map.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.430
The first one I can call out
is-- it's awesome data.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:48.210
We have over 95 million points
of interest, amazing amounts

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.500
of telephone numbers, opening
hours, things like that that

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.860
we can share with people.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.860
So how do we take that huge
amount of data and let

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.100
developers play with it more?

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.350
The specifics there are
still up in the air.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:01.350
We're still definitely
[? designing some ?] things

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.330
out, but that's definitely a
theme you want to focus on,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.800
taking that huge pile of data
we've got Google-scale and

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.690
making it available
to everybody.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.370
Another piece is obviously the
suite of Google products we

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:12.390
have around us.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.310
In the same building as us right
now, we have the Maps

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.300
API teams as well.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.310
All the way across the Pacific
and California, obviously, we

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.570
have the Google+ team.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.580
But these are services.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:24.120
And they have APIs themselves
that we definitely want to

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.260
integrate well with.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.990
And they'll go on and make these
summed-up the products

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.260
bigger and better than
individual pieces.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.299
LUKE MAHE: So if Tor wanted to
see everybody using this

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.210
autocomplete to type in an
address, what do you want to

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.700
our developers do with
the Places APIs?

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.549
What are some cool things
you want people to do?

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:41.110
JUSTIN CHU: Absolutely.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.570
I think that right now
there has been--

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.050
I'd be really interested
in seeing where the

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.560
location-based application
trends are going.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.860
So for example, I thought it
was really interesting that

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.190
for the gaming companies that
were used to doing just

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.530
check-in-based games,
commerce-like games, now it's

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:01.190
very much actually purely a
zombie game, where you're

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.290
actually in the world,
more of a virtual

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:04.810
reality type of thing.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.960
I think that not just in
location-based games, but just

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.880
in location-based apps
everywhere-- travel, social

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.890
networking, food and wine--

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.190
there's a lot of room to do
something above just the

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.820
baseline location data.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.820
But you need the best data to
get the best services, right?

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.330
So that's why we're here.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.265
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, true.

00:09:22.265 --> 00:09:24.540
it would be cool to see people
actually get the data that we

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.455
provide and make some sense out
of it and offer something

00:09:27.455 --> 00:09:29.980
more to the user than just, hey,
look at all those coffee

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.820
shops around you.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.170
JUSTIN CHU: For sure.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.250
Yeah, that's the goal.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.760
So I don't have a specific
end point, I

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.090
guess, like Tor mentioned.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.670
But as we get more and more
stuff out and see more and

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.920
more ideas, I bet I'll get
some better opinions too.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.780
LUKE MAHE: Cool.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.060
Well, that was short
and sweet.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.440
Do you have any parting
words for everybody?

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.270
JUSTIN CHU: Yeah.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.950
Well, first, thank you
so much for hosting.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:50.450
It was a great experience.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:51.530
LUKE MAHE: No problem We hope
we'll see you soon.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.800
JUSTIN CHU: Oh, definitely And
