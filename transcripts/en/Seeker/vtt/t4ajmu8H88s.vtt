00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.879
We’re constantly trying to find evidence
of life on other planets, but have we been

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:06.720
going about the search all wrong?

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.629
Hey guys, Amy here with DNews.

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.599
The desire to find life on other worlds is
a very strong one that has basically dictated

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.400
how we’ve gone about unmanned space exploration
since we started shooting robots off the Earth.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.790
We know that life here requires water, so
NASA’s maxim when it comes to space exploration

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.859
is “follow the water.”

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.740
We’ve looked for evidence of a wet past
on Mars, we focus on subsurface oceans of

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.730
distant moons like Jupiter’s Europa, and
we search for exoplanets in the goldilocks

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.329
zone, that is, planets that orbit their stars
where liquid water can exist on their surface.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.600
But what if we should be approaching this
differently?

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.710
Some scientists have already suggested that
we broaden the “goldilocks zone” to take

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.969
into account a host star’s evolution and
how its cooling could have changed the timeframe

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.969
in which liquid water existed on a planet’s
surface.

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.210
This is something we’ve talked about on
DNews before: the idea that water could have

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.070
existed on a planet in its early life when
its star was hotter even if that planet is

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.989
now too far from its star and too cold for
water.

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.540
We might do well to take some extraterrestrial
life hunting tips from isotopes.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.780
Recently, scientists at the University of
Surrey, Japan's RIKEN Nishina Centre, and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.780
the University of Beihang recreated in a lab
the isotopes that occur when a star explodes.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.909
It wasn’t just for fun; it was an attempt
to help physicists understand where life-supporting

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.860
elements might be found in space, something
that by extension could give us some clues

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.500
on where to look for signs of life.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.420
The team was able to observe isotopes of certain
elemental chemicals that form when a star

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.420
explodes.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.390
To get these isotopes, the team accelerated
uranium to 70 percent of the speed of light

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.020
and smashed it into a metal target.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.450
Then, they analyzed the fragments left behind
by the impact using a gamma-ray microscope,

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.240
specifically isotopes of samarium and gadolinium,
both of which are sensitive tracers of an

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.560
exploding star that could help explain where
the heavy elements that support life in our

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.590
universe originate.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.790
What’s really neat is that these exotic
isotopes aren’t ones scientists have had

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.980
a chance to study before, so their existence
in the wake of a violent event opens an interesting

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.530
path for the potential creation of the elements
essential for life as we know it.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.229
It really is true that star dust -- the remnants
of exploded stars -- plays a vital but mysterious

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.729
role in the formation of life-supporting planets.

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.740
There’s still a lot we need to learn, but
this is a really neat development.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.780
What do you guy think about our ongoing quest
to find life on other planets and moons?
