Objects in the book class know how to read the text of a book into a string.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.915
We've included the text in a text file, you can see it in the directory with

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:14.413
all of the code for the project. Soon objects of the book class will be able to

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:19.245
return all types of information about the text they include. But first, you'll

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:22.435
need to add the methods, starting with this one. Right now, getNum characters

00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:25.699
just returns zero, but it should be returning the number of characters in the

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.170
entire book text string. And I mean characters like letters and punctuation,

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.735
not people in the book. There's also a book tester with a main method you can

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:36.770
use to check your answers. Happy coding.
