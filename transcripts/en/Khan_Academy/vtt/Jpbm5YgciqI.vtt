00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.960
The graphs below
show the test grades

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.730
of the students
in Dexter's class.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.020
The first graph shows the
relationship between test

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.240
grades and the amount of time
the students spent studying.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.510
So this is study
time on this axis

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.949
and this is the test
grade on this axis.

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.740
And the second graph
shows the relationship

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.740
between test grades
and shoes size.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.390
So shoe size on this
axis and then test grade.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.560
Choose the best description
of the relationship

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.630
between the graphs.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.420
So first, before looking
at the explanations,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.820
let's look at the actual graphs.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.570
So this one on the
left right over here,

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.374
it looks like there is a
positive linear relationship

00:00:45.374 --> 00:00:46.040
right over here.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.332
I could almost fit a line
that would go just like that.

00:00:48.332 --> 00:00:49.790
And it makes sense
that there would

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.550
be, that the more time
that you spend studying,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.390
the better score
that you would get.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.500
Now for a certain
amount of time studying,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.250
some people might do
better than others,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.000
but it does seem like
there's this relationship.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.570
Here it doesn't
seem like there's

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.190
really much of a relationship.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.060
You see the shoe sizes,
for a given shoe size,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.480
some people do not so well
and some people do very well.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.267
Someone with a size 10
and 1/2, it looks like,

00:01:16.267 --> 00:01:18.100
someone it looks like
they flunked the exam.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.000
Someone else, looks like
they got A minus or a B plus

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.950
on the exam.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.780
And it really would be hard
to somehow fit a line here.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.030
No matter how you draw
a line, these dots

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.900
don't seem to form a trend.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.370
So let's see which of
these choices apply.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.000
There's a negative
linear relationship

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.350
between study time and score.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.183
No, that's not true.

00:01:38.183 --> 00:01:41.250
It looks like there's a
positive linear relationship.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.550
The more you study, the
better your score would be.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.970
A negative linear relationship
would trend downwards

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.190
like that.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.140
There is a non-linear
relationship between study time

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.590
and score and a negative
linear relationship

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.790
between shoe size and score.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.340
Well that doesn't
seem right either.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.090
A non-linear
relationship, it would not

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.800
be easy to fit a line to it.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.440
And this one seems like a
line would be very reasonable.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.290
And it doesn't seem like
there's any type of relationship

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.605
between shoe size and score.

00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:09.520
So I wouldn't pick
this one either.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.152
There's a positive
linear relationship

00:02:11.152 --> 00:02:12.360
between study time and score.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.150
That's right.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.530
And no relationship between
shoe size and score.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.030
Well, I'm going to
go with that one.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.060
Both graphs show
positive linear trends

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.430
of approximately equal strength.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.140
No, not at all.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.440
This one doesn't show
a linear relationship

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.550
of really any strength.
