00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In the next class, I will tell you about

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
robot motion--how to make the robot move.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So we're going to move beyond the idea of

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
just state estimation--finding out where we are

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
or where the other cars are.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And we're going to move to the fascinating topic:

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
how to use all this to decide where to move.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So in the next class, I'll talk about a basic

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
AI method called "search"--.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
in particular, "A* search"--which is an algorithm

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
invented by my colleague, Nils Nilsson, at Stanford

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and I will apply it to the problem of planning

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
robot trajectories and making it move

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
in real time.

00:00:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So I'll see you in the next class.
