&gt;&gt; So, this example is pretty similar to the case we had in

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.712
the previous example. So, the most specific case is that I'm simply allergic to

00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:12.085
any breakfast that comes on Friday that's cheap and isn't vegan, so

00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:15.720
this very specific example. And the most general model is I'm just

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.720
allergic to everything, no matter what meal it is, what day it is,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.230
how much it costs, whether it's vegan, or what restaurant I got it at.
