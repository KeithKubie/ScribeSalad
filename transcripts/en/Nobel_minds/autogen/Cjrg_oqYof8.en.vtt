actually also contain a single monolayer

so<00:01:15.740><c> graphite</c><00:01:16.740><c> exists</c><00:01:17.190><c> as</c><00:01:17.509><c> stats</c><00:01:18.509><c> layers</c><00:01:18.810><c> is</c>

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 align:start position:0%
so graphite exists as stats layers is
 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.620 align:start position:0%
so graphite exists as stats layers is
that<00:01:19.319><c> what</c><00:01:19.470><c> you're</c><00:01:19.560><c> saying</c><00:01:19.640><c> they</c><00:01:20.640><c> yes</c><00:01:21.179><c> it</c><00:01:21.479><c> does</c>

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying they yes it does
 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.870 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying they yes it does
yeah<00:01:21.899><c> it's</c><00:01:22.259><c> like</c><00:01:22.440><c> and</c><00:01:22.830><c> graphene</c><00:01:23.250><c> is</c><00:01:23.520><c> one</c><00:01:23.759><c> of</c>

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
yeah it's like and graphene is one of
 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.139 align:start position:0%
yeah it's like and graphene is one of

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 align:start position:0%
those layers you're correctly yeah and
 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.279 align:start position:0%
those layers you're correctly yeah and
you<00:01:27.149><c> have</c><00:01:27.240><c> another</c><00:01:27.420><c> nice</c><00:01:27.660><c> property</c><00:01:28.020><c> show</c><00:01:28.170><c> us</c>

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 align:start position:0%
you have another nice property show us

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
to show how graphene is that the if you
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.600 align:start position:0%
to show how graphene is that the if you
like<00:01:31.020><c> to</c><00:01:31.259><c> get</c><00:01:31.410><c> a</c><00:01:31.440><c> feeling</c><00:01:31.740><c> for</c><00:01:31.890><c> what</c><00:01:32.069><c> graphene</c>

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 align:start position:0%
like to get a feeling for what graphene
 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.130 align:start position:0%
like to get a feeling for what graphene
is<00:01:32.910><c> you</c><00:01:33.599><c> can</c><00:01:33.840><c> actually</c><00:01:34.099><c> increase</c><00:01:35.099><c> its</c><00:01:35.729><c> lateral</c>

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 align:start position:0%
is you can actually increase its lateral
 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.499 align:start position:0%
is you can actually increase its lateral
dimensions<00:01:37.140><c> with</c><00:01:37.700><c> 100</c><00:01:38.700><c> million</c><00:01:38.970><c> times</c><00:01:39.240><c> and</c>

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 align:start position:0%
dimensions with 100 million times and
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.380 align:start position:0%
dimensions with 100 million times and
then<00:01:40.050><c> you</c><00:01:40.200><c> will</c><00:01:40.349><c> get</c><00:01:40.530><c> the</c><00:01:40.770><c> honey</c><00:01:41.280><c> come</c><00:01:41.610><c> or</c><00:01:41.970><c> a</c>
