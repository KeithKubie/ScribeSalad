[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.082 --> 00:00:07.290
KYLE MCDONALD: Hey, I'm Kyle.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.370
MANNY TAN: I'm Manny.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.780
JESSIE BARRY: Hi, I'm
Jessie from the Cornell

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.758
Lab of Ornithology.

00:00:13.422 --> 00:00:14.880
MANNY TAN: This is
an experiment we

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.130
made that uses machine
learning to organize thousands

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.396
of bird sounds into an
interactive visualization.

00:00:20.396 --> 00:00:22.020
JESSIE BARRY: Bird
sounds can be really

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.170
difficult to learn because there
are so many species out there.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.460
And some of them
sound really similar.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.950
And at times, you
might just need

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.440
to be distinguishing between
a note that slurs up--

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.940
[BIRD CALL]

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.840
--or a note that drops in pitch.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.440
And these can be really,
really subtle differences.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.940
MANNY TAN: This
project started when

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.530
we were talking to
people at Cornell

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.900
about how it might be
interesting to apply machine

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.790
learning to bird sounds.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.350
So we decided to
try a little test

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.140
with some of the sounds
in their collection.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.620
We didn't give the computer
any outside data or tags

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.540
or even tell it
the birds' names.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.940
We wanted to see if it could
just listen to the sounds

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.473
and automatically learn its
own way to organize them.

00:00:59.473 --> 00:01:00.690
[BIRD CALL]

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.200
KYLE MCDONALD:
Birdsongs vary a lot.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.450
So before we can look at
them in the same space,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.290
we have to break down everything
in short bursts of sound,

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.520
less than a second long.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.270
[BIRD CALL]

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.120
Then we group sounds with
a technique called t-SNE.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.040
First, the computer
creates a fingerprint

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.110
from each sound,
which is like an image

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.670
or set of numbers
that represents

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.126
that particular sample.

00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:21.600
Then t-SNE compares all
of these fingerprints

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.480
and places similar
sounds closer together.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.400
One way to think about
t-SNE is that it's

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.890
taking these fingerprints
from a high dimensional space,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.960
that space with more
than three dimensions,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.530
and reducing them
to two dimensions

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.617
so that we can visualize it.

00:01:34.617 --> 00:01:36.450
MANNY TAN: And our tests
worked pretty well.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.780
This is a map of the sounds
that the computer created.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.690
You can see that it figured
out how to group similar sounds

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.520
from similar birds
closer together.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.655
We also made it so that you
can search for specific birds.

00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:49.320
[OWLS HOOTING]

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.814
We put it on the
web [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:52.814 --> 00:01:55.230
JESSIE BARRY: We certainly
have a dream that someday you'd

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.650
be able to put out a microphone
in the Amazon with a recorder

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.400
and have all the species,
maybe not even just

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.510
birds, identified.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.500
And we will be able to monitor
species diversity at a site

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.020
through the automated
recognition techniques.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.289
I think it's incredibly
exciting to figure out

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:13.830
what are those
collaborations that we

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.830
can make between computer
science and ornithology

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.470
or biology in general and
start to tackle some really

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.940
exciting and challenging science
and conservation questions.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.580

on wildlife sounds.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.370
And you can play with the
