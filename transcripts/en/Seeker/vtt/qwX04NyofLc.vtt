00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.740
Most of you probably know the name Scott Kelly.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.700
He’s a retired astronaut who holds the current
U.S. record for the longest ever single spaceflight,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.850
clocking in at 342 consecutive days in space.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.520
Some of you may also know that he has an identical
twin...who is ALSO an astronaut.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.369
What are the chances of that?!

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.560
Mark and Scott Kelly were the central figures
in a brand new, totally unique twin study.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.140
NASA just published the results that let us
know, in unprecedented detail, what happens

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.640
to our bodies during long-term spaceflight—and
we’re here to give you the rundown.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.260
In the decades since first sending humans
into space, we’ve been monitoring spaceflight-induced

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.449
physiological changes in hundreds of astronauts.

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.450
We can compare an individual to themselves
before, during, and after a mission—allowing

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.100
NASA to develop countermeasures against issues
like decreased bone density and decreased

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.100
muscle mass.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.601
But so far, we’re most familiar with the
results of 1-4 months of spaceflight, and

00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:03.640
comparing an individual to themselves doesn’t
clearly let us know what could be caused by

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.660
spaceflight vs. something that may have happened
to that individual anyway.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.531
If we’re expecting humans to survive years
for something like transport to Mars, how

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:15.100
do we prep for that?

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.750
How do we know what’s going to happen to
our bodies?

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.890
Well, Scott and Mark Kelly presented an incredibly
exciting opportunity for NASA.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.390
While Scott spent a year in space, Mark served
as his ‘genetically matched ground control’.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.780
Both twins were monitored closely before,
throughout, and after the mission—physiologically,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.320
genetically, and cognitively—creating a
massive amount of data in the first twin study

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.600
of its kind.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.140
Some things changed during spaceflight that,
while SUPER interesting and important to keep

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.620
measuring in future studies, don’t seem
to pose a significant health risk.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.560
For example, body mass decreased, gut microbiome
composition changed, and inflammation increased—all

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.560
temporarily.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.270
Plus the flu vaccine works just as well on
someone in space as it does for someone on

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.530
earth, which is a relief.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.909
Then we’ve got the medium-risk stuff, stuff
we may need to be careful about.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.599
Urine sample metabolites indicated that spaceflight
could interrupt collagen regulation in the

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.599
body.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.969
While we may most often hear about collagen
in the context of our skin, it’s also part

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:21.499
of all our veins and arteries and valves,
and disturbance in its production and incorporation

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:26.189
could result in issues like blood pooling
at the bottom of our legs or issues with blood

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.439
pressure regulation.

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:32.450
And don’t even get me started on the telomeres—these
are the caps on the end of your chromosomes

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.359
that protect your DNA from damage and that
deteriorate as we age.

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:43.349
Scott Kelly’s telomeres actually lengthened
during his year on the ISS—but then shortened

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.400
rapidly and significantly when he returned
to Earth.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.290
They’ve since recovered to around pre-spaceflight
length, but given the essential nature of

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.010
telomeres in protecting genomic integrity
and the role we think they play in aging,

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.060
further research into this aspect of space-induced
genetic changes could be really fruitful,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.950
not only for spaceflight, but for other areas
of science and medicine.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.629
And now for the high-risk stuff, the stuff
we really need to work on solutions for.

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.269
A comprehensive suite of computerized tests
indicated that while some measures of cognitive

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.269
function increased, especially early in the
mission, other cognitive functions—like

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.599
emotion recognition and abstract matching
accuracy—actually declined during spaceflight,

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.459
along with cognitive speed.

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.819
And these declines persisted for about 6 months
after return to Earth.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.359
In a weightless environment, our veins and
arteries can also get a little...confused.

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.639
Usually, they have to work with or against
Earth’s gravity to move blood around our

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.980
body, but in microgravity, we see thickening
of vascular walls, an increase in vascular

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.150
stiffness, and a ballooning effect in the
vasculature of the upper body.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.709
We’re actually still not sure if all of
this is reversible after an astronaut comes

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.260
back to earth—that remains to be seen.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.529
We also confirmed observations made in many
other astronauts: spaceflight is associated

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.159
with altered optical function.

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:12.540
.We see swelling of the optical disc, a flattening
of the actual globe of the eye, along with

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.200
other structural changes, which can lead to
onset of blurry vision, blind spots, and more.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.760
We haven’t been able to pinpoint what causes
these changes but they’re obviously not

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.840
good for your eyesight, and may be permanent.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.550
And lastly, blood samples pre-, during, and
post- flight determined that spaceflight can

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.090
significantly increase genotoxic stress.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.760
Space is highly radioactive, and while galactic
cosmic rays may sound awesome, they can really

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.530
do a number on your DNA.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.990
Cytogenetic analysis, which means looking
at changes in your chromosomes, revealed higher

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.840
levels of genomic instability for the spaceflight
twin.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.610
This comes in the form of increased chromosomal
translocations and inversions, which can be

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.150
linked to disorders like infertility and cancer.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.100
Genetic analysis also revealed dysregulation
of genes, especially those associated with

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.990
immune function and DNA repair, and these
changes did not return to normal when they

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.110
got back to Earth.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.820
All this talk of DNA changing may make it
easy to ask the question, “Are they still

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.820
twins?”.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.560
The answer is YES.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.560
Media outlets a while back went a little overboard
with the ‘news’ that 7% of Scott Kelly’s

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.790
DNA was different.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.900
If 7% of Scott’s genes were completely different,
not only would he not be Mark’s twin anymore,

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.720
he would be an entirely different species.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.350
The real way to think about it is that yes,
some genetic mutation occurred, but most of

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.050
the change was epigenetic change.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.620
This means that something like DNA methylation,
or a little add-on unit to a gene, changed

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:50.600
the expression of the gene, not the actual
makeup of the DNA itself.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.600
This can result in upregulation or downregulation
of the genes in charge of things like immune

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.220
function and bone growth..So yeah.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.830
They’re still related.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.580
All of this data represents, as the researchers
put it, “a uniquely controlled and integrated

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.390
framework for comprehensively quantifying
astronaut biology in space”.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.860
And opens up so many exciting questions that
are going to be fascinating to build on.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.430
Even though NASA doesn’t currently have
any more twins in the pipeline, this kind

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.600
of research can continue with those who take
on longer and longer spaceflights.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.600
Building a better understanding of the effects
of long-term spaceflight on the body and the

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:33.340
mind will prepare us to test even more spaceflight
boundaries that no human has ever broken before—while

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.770
hopefully keeping us all in one piece.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.770
We're working on a new series that we're stoked
to share with you that's all about what goes

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.740
on in your body when you get sick.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.560
And it’s called...well...Sick.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.240
And here's our sneak peak of our first

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.900
episode

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.440
Beyond treatments and symptoms, we're curious
about how exactly viruses, parasites, and

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.100
other invaders wreak havoc on our health.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.060
Is there a disease or illness you want us
to cover?

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.460
Let us know down in the comments and make
sure you subscribe to catch the first episode.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.450
