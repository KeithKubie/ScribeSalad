00:00:00.644 --> 00:00:02.310
So as we talked about
in the last video,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.070
we've seen many
examples of starting

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.340
with a geometric
series expanded out,

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.540
and then assuming
that its common ratio,

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.220
that the absolute value of the
common ratio is less than 1,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.140
finding what the sum
of that might be.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.667
We've proven with this
formula in previous videos.

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:19.250
But now let's go the
other way around.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.170
Let's try to take
some function-- let's

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.560
say h of x being equal to
1 over 3 plus x squared--

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.409
and let's try to
put it in this form.

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:29.950
And then once we
put it in that form,

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.970
we can think about what a
and our common ratio is.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.473
And then try to represent it
as an actual geometric series.

00:00:38.473 --> 00:00:40.080
So I encourage you
to pause the video

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.405
and try to do that right now.

00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:44.530
So let's see, the first
thing that you might notice

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.620
is we have a 1 here
instead of a 3.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.500
So let's try to factor out a 3.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:56.320
So this is equal to 1 over 3
times 1 plus x squared over 3.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.160
And now, since we don't want
that 3 in the denominator,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.450
we can think about
this as 1 over 3.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.630
So we could say this
is 1/3 over-- let

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.880
me do it in that purple color.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.200
1/3 over 1.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.866
And we don't want to
just add something,

00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.620
we want to subtract
our common ratio.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.401
So 1 minus-- and let me
write our common ratio here

00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:19.900
in yellow.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.000
1 minus negative
x squared over 3.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.720
So now we've written
this in that form.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.720
And so now we could say that
the sum-- let me write it here

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.740
in-- let me do it
in a new color.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.020
So let me do it in blue.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.040
So now we could say
that the sum from n

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.015
equals 0 to infinity of-- let's
see, our first term is 1/3.

00:01:48.015 --> 00:01:55.320
1/3 times our common
ratio to the n-th power.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.360
Common ratio is negative
x squared over 3.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.440
And if we wanted
to expand this out,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.730
this would be equal to-- so
the first term is 1/3 times

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.630
all of this to the 0-th power.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.820
So it's just going to be 1/3.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.700
And so each successive
term is just

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.170
going to be the previous
term times our common ratio.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.710
So 1/3 times negative
x squared over 3

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:28.036
is going to be
negative 1/9 x squared.

00:02:28.036 --> 00:02:29.410
To go from that
to that, you have

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.140
to multiply by-- let's
see, 1/3 to negative 1/3,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.810
you have to multiply
it by negative 1/3.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.300
And we multiplied by
x squared as well.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.060
Now in our next
term, we're going

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.420
to multiply by negative
x squared over 3 again.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.440
So it's going to be plus-- a
negative times a negative is

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.675
a positive-- plus
1/27 x to the fourth.

00:02:50.675 --> 00:02:55.940
x squared times x squared,
x to the fourth power.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.060
And we just keep going
on and on and on.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:09.070
And when this converges, so over
the interval of convergence,

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.290
this is going to
converge to h of x.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.290
Now, what is the interval
of convergence here?

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.826
And I encourage you to pause
the video and think about it.

00:03:16.826 --> 00:03:18.200
Well, the interval
of convergence

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.360
is the interval over
which your common ratio,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.980
the absolute value of your
common ratio, is less than 1.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.070
So let me write this
right over here.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:37.540
So our absolute value of
negative x squared over 3

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.030
has to be less than 1.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.850
Well, the absolute
value, this is

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.120
going to be a negative number.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.536
This is the same
thing as saying--

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:46.510
let me scroll down a little bit.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.270
This is the same thing as saying
that the absolute value of x

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:58.670
squared over 3 has
to be less than 1.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.070
And this is another
way of saying--

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.040
well, one thing that might jump
out at you is that x squared,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.947
this is going to be
positive no matter what.

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:08.530
Or I guess I should
say, this is going

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.410
to be non-negative
no matter what.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:18.000
So this is another way of
saying that x squared over 3

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.780
has to be less than 1.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.280
Right?

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.280
I don't want to confuse you
in this step right over here.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.050
But the absolute value
of x squared over 3

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.508
is just going to be x squared
over 3, because this is never

00:04:28.508 --> 00:04:29.960
going to take on
a negative value.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.150
And so we can multiply
both sides by 3.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.490
I'll go up here now to do it.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.340
Multiply both sides by
3 to say that x squared

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.510
needs to be less than 3.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.490
And so that means that
the absolute value of x

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.170
needs to be less than
the square root of 3.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.610
Or we could say
that x is greater

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.710
than the negative
square root of 3,

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.960
and it is less than
the square root of 3.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.720
So this is the interval
of convergence.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:07.690
This is the interval of
convergence for this series,

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.736
for this power series.

00:05:08.736 --> 00:05:10.110
It's a geometric
series, which is

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.110
a special case of
a power series.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.880
And over the interval
of convergence,

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:23.650
that is going to be equal
to 1 over 3 plus x squared.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.420
So as long as x is
in this interval,

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.360
it's going to take
on the same values

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.662
as our original function,
which is a pretty neat idea.
