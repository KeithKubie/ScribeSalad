most part the aliens are probably not
 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.440

going to be interested in us because

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450
going to be interested in us because
 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.750
going to be interested in us because
we're so arrogant to believe that we

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760
we're so arrogant to believe that we
 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.630
we're so arrogant to believe that we
have something to offer them realize

have something to offer them realize
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.460
have something to offer them realize
that they could be thousands maybe

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
that they could be thousands maybe
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.050
that they could be thousands maybe

millions of years ahead of us in
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.990
millions of years ahead of us in
technology and they may have well no

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000
technology and they may have well no
 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.600
technology and they may have well no
interest in interacting with us in the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610
interest in interacting with us in the
 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.970
interest in interacting with us in the
same way that we don't necessarily want

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980
same way that we don't necessarily want
 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.920

to deal with the squirrels and the deer

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
to deal with the squirrels and the deer
 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.410

in the forest now some people say that

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
in the forest now some people say that
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.690
in the forest now some people say that
we should not try to make contact with

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
we should not try to make contact with
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.550
we should not try to make contact with
them because they could be potentially

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560
them because they could be potentially
 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.130
them because they could be potentially
dangerous for the most part I think

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
dangerous for the most part I think
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.810
dangerous for the most part I think
they're going to be peaceful because

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820
they're going to be peaceful because
 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.430
they're going to be peaceful because
there'll be thousands of years ahead of

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440
there'll be thousands of years ahead of
 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.760
there'll be thousands of years ahead of
us but we cannot take the chance so I

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
us but we cannot take the chance so I
 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.469
us but we cannot take the chance so I
personally believe that we should not

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479
personally believe that we should not
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.250
personally believe that we should not
try to advertise our existence to alien

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260
try to advertise our existence to alien
 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.100
try to advertise our existence to alien
life in outer space because of the fact

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
life in outer space because of the fact
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.860
life in outer space because of the fact
that we don't know their intentions then

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870
that we don't know their intentions then
 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.450
that we don't know their intentions then
the other question is what happens if

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460
the other question is what happens if
 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.780
the other question is what happens if
they're evil well I think the question

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
they're evil well I think the question
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.200
they're evil well I think the question
of evil is actually a relative question

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210
of evil is actually a relative question
 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.330
of evil is actually a relative question

we were just in the way and so I think

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730
we were just in the way and so I think
 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.789
we were just in the way and so I think
that is a potential problem we could be

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799
that is a potential problem we could be
 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.009
that is a potential problem we could be
in the way of a very advanced

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019
in the way of a very advanced
 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.309
in the way of a very advanced
civilization that simply is not evil but

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319
civilization that simply is not evil but
 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.860
civilization that simply is not evil but
simply views us as we would view

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870
simply views us as we would view
 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.280
simply views us as we would view
squirrels and deer in the forest so

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290
squirrels and deer in the forest so
 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.780
squirrels and deer in the forest so
personally I think that we should not

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790
personally I think that we should not
 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.509
personally I think that we should not
advertise our existence when we go into

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519
advertise our existence when we go into
 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.759
advertise our existence when we go into
outer space for the most part however I

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769
outer space for the most part however I
 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.319
outer space for the most part however I
do think they are going to be peaceful

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329
do think they are going to be peaceful
 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.449
do think they are going to be peaceful
they're not going to want to plunder the

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459
they're not going to want to plunder the
 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.880
they're not going to want to plunder the
earth because they're plenty of planets

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890
earth because they're plenty of planets
 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.309
earth because they're plenty of planets
out there that have nobody on them that

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319
out there that have nobody on them that
 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.860
out there that have nobody on them that
they can plunder at will without having

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870
they can plunder at will without having
 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.750
they can plunder at will without having
to worry about restive natives called

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760
to worry about restive natives called
 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.819
to worry about restive natives called
humanity and so I think they're not

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829
humanity and so I think they're not
 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.379
humanity and so I think they're not
going to come to visit the earth to

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389
going to come to visit the earth to
 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.090
going to come to visit the earth to
plunder us to do all sorts of mischief

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100
plunder us to do all sorts of mischief
 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.250
plunder us to do all sorts of mischief
for the most part I think they'll just

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260
for the most part I think they'll just
 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.440
for the most part I think they'll just
leave us alone

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450
leave us alone
 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.690
