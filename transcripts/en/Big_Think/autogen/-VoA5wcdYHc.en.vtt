00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.809
You know we have to tear down this really
animosity that the jihadist movement has against

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.809
America.

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:18.240
There's people who hate america.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.430
And I have found the best way to treat this
severe hatred is build up a counter force.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.200
And that's through women and children and
using medical diplomacy.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.070
I've traveled all over the world and I'm blessed
by it.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.320
An I've had the opportunity as Secretary of
Health to see there is one common denominator,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:46.850
whether you're a Shiite, Suuni, Kurd, Hamas,
Hezbola, Jewish member, everything revolves

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.690
around how you're going to provide good health,
good security, but good health for the family.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.170
And this is with women and children.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.260
And if you're really able to tap into that,
you're going to be able to start a movement

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.899
across the world.

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.210
It's going to be basing themselves on good
health conditions, good health for their family.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.110
And that's what I want to do through global
medical diplomacy.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.710
I've got a plan laid out, really to develop
that.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.909
And I think that's the kind of ideas and positive
things we have to do in this country to show

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:27.490
the world that we're not this terrible country
that's trying to invade and be able to in

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.110
any way change their way of life.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.049
We got to show them that this is America.

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.360
That we're good.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.689
We're positive.

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:47.099
We're strong, and we want to protect you,
and we want to do what is right.
