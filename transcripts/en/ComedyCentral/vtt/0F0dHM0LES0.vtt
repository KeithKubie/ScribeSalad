00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:01.968
It is now 24 hours

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.337
since the already-legendary
Trump-Kim summit.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.005
Frankly, I'm still buzzing,

00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:07.907
and not just because
my phone's on silent,

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.809
and I have a debt collector
hounding me

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:11.611
about my impounded
flame thrower, no.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:13.679
No, I'm also buzzing

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:16.115
because there were so many
exciting moments yesterday

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:18.351
that got overshadowed
by Trump's big win.

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:20.219
And here to help me go over
them, citizen journalists,

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:22.588
-Kobi Libii and Aaron Jackson.
-(applause and cheering)

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:25.291
Guys, welcome.

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:26.926
Now that the dust has settled,

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:30.897
we can relax a little
and let our hair down, so...

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.033
(sighing)

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.102
Ah. That is better. Okay.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:41.374
Now in a word, how would you
describe the summit yesterday?

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:44.444
I'd say "historic," like
the launch of the<i> Titanic,</i>

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.112
but without the shipwreck.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.047
And I'd say
"profoundly emotional,"

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.749
like the movie<i> Titanic,</i>

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:51.517
-but without the Billy Zane.
-KLEPPER: Yes.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.554
Now, Kobi, what moment
really stood out to you?

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:57.590
Three words: Dennis Rod Man.

00:00:57.623 --> 00:01:00.827
-WOMAN:<i> A very strange twist
 in this story.</i> -WOMAN 2:<i> Yes.</i>

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.530
WOMAN:<i> So Dennis Rodman arrived,
 uh, in Singapore.</i>

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:06.499
I talked to Kim Jong-un,
and, uh,

00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:08.468
and administration
over there five years ago.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.903
And he sat down and asked me,
"Hey, Dennis, um,

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:13.239
"I would like
to ask you three things.

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:15.274
"If you could go back to the
president of the United States

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:18.177
these three things, and I would
be willing to talk to him."

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.913
And Obama didn't even give me
the time of day!

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:24.684
(scoffs) He didn't give
Dennis Rodman the time of day!

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:27.453
Obama wasted months
talking to experts

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:29.789
on the history
of the Korean Peninsula.

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:33.159
Dennis Rodman could have given
him 45 breathtaking minutes

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:37.029
about the time he and Kim went
go-karting over peasants.

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:40.366
Now, in spite of Dennis Rodman's
obvious expertise,

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.135
I know what you're thinking:

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:45.705
Why would Trump bring an NBA
player with him to Singapore?

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.340
Answer: He didn't.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.542
Dennis Rodman's trip
was actually sponsored

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:53.146
by a cryptocurrency company
called PotCoin.

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.714
(laughter)

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:58.050
Here's Dennis Rodman walking
with either a senior executive

00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:01.020
from the company
or Turtle from<i> Entourage.</i>

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:03.189
-(laughter) -I'm glad you
brought this up, Kobi.

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:04.924
So, what is PotCoin?

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:08.227
PotCoin is a cryptocurrency
specifically designed

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.663
to buy and sell marijuana.

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:14.634
Not to be confused with CoinPot,
the jar where I keep my change,

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:17.336
which so far
only has one investor.

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.405
(laughter)

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:21.007
-Is it...
-It's me.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.808
-It's you, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-I'm the investor.

00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:24.610
And to be clear,
we are still talking

00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:26.045
about the North Korea summit.

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:27.680
Believe it or not, we are.

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:30.917
You see,
even though PotCoin paid

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.252
for Dennis Rodman's trip
to Singapore,

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:36.589
Trump valued his contribution
so much that Dennis Rodman

00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:38.558
got a White House
thank-you call.

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:39.992
(chuckles):
Which makes sense,

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:41.961
because Republicans have
a long tradition

00:02:41.994 --> 00:02:44.330
of including NBA players
in diplomacy.

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:46.566
When Reagan
visited Berlin in '87,

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.834
you know who was
right there beside him?

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:51.304
-Boston Celtic Kevin McHale.
-Yes.

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:54.740
Oh. I believe
the famous quote is,

00:02:54.773 --> 00:02:56.876
"Mr. Gorbachev,
tear down this wall.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.178
"And, Mr. McHale,
I can see your scrotum

00:02:59.211 --> 00:03:01.514
dipping out from those shorts."

00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:03.516
-Can I just add something?
-Yeah.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.951
First of all, great summary.

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.786
I didn't understand
a word of it.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.188
But personally,
I'm more interested

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:11.457
in the human aspect
of this thing.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.994
-Okay, the human rights aspect?
-No, the human interest aspect.

00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:16.963
The heart, the drama,

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:19.999
and Dennis Rodman's
emotional thank-yous.

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:22.001 line:0%
-Can I thank some people?
-Yeah, go ahead.

00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:23.369 line:0%
But let me ask you something,

00:03:23.402 --> 00:03:25.171 line:0%
don't go on a whole tour
about it.

00:03:32.811 --> 00:03:34.480
Oh, my God.

00:03:34.513 --> 00:03:35.915
So moving.

00:03:35.948 --> 00:03:39.352
I'm not exactly sure
what he's talking about, or why,

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.887
but it feels like
he just won a championship

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.289
or an Oscar.

00:03:43.322 --> 00:03:45.658
And Pearl Jam
is somehow involved?

00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:47.059
I mean, (bleep).

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:49.562
I love North Korea now!

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:51.130
(laughter, applause, whooping)

00:03:51.163 --> 00:03:53.666
I...

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:57.069
I heard Jeremy spoke
at the summit today.

00:03:57.102 --> 00:04:01.440
Okay, no one actually knows
Pearl Jam references, Jordan.

00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:05.878
But... you know who really
lit up hearts this weekend?

00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:07.346
Ivanka.

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.683
In response to her daddy's
critics, Ivanka tweeted...

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:18.424
Incredible.

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:21.560
Ivanka's tweets pack
all the inspirational punch

00:04:21.593 --> 00:04:24.730
of a wrist tattoo that says,
"Just breathe."

00:04:24.763 --> 00:04:25.931
(laughter)

00:04:25.964 --> 00:04:27.767
And to be honest,
I'm pretty impressed

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.502
that she knows
a Chinese proverb.

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:31.804
Well, admittedly, I guess...

00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:36.943
And, in fact...

00:04:39.144 --> 00:04:40.913
-(laughter)
-But...

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:43.349
who knows more
about Chinese culture,

00:04:43.382 --> 00:04:45.551
actual Chinese people
or Ivanka,

00:04:45.584 --> 00:04:48.054
whose clothing line
was once manufactured

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:50.122
in factories
where real Chinese people

00:04:50.155 --> 00:04:52.158
claimed they
were actually abused?

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:53.592
Oh. Amen.

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:56.462
Gents, but we need
to wrap this up, so real quick,

00:04:56.495 --> 00:04:59.765
what do you hope to see
in future Trump-Kim summits?

00:04:59.798 --> 00:05:02.668
Less research, more CoinPot...
Sorry, PotCoin.

00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:05.771
-Yes.
-And I'll just say nine words:

00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:07.807
Eric Trump haiku, baby.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.909
Amazing work as always, guys.

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:11.477
The fight continues.
