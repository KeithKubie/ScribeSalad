KOTOE KARASAWA:
Doobdoo is a website

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.080
that connects pet
sitters and pet

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.560
lovers to people who own pets.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.310
And sometimes we need to
travel, and you need someone

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.620
to take care of your pets.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.570
That's what we do.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.370
RICARDO FIGUEIREDO: Designing
a little box that you

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.880
could take a bag, so you
can wrap up your dog's poop.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.860
And it's a way of
giving people something.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.010
They're going to say, oh,
OK, Doobdoo, what's that?

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.060
I'm going to check that out.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.601
I don't know.

00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:44.270
It's just like we have
these little ideas.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.670
We can make events, like dog
meetings and stuff like that.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.280
KOTOE KARASAWA: The
biggest challenge, I think,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:02.880
would be validating the
model and actually validating

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.310
the website or the
buttons or the way

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.480
the website is
working right now.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.430
If it's working,
if the users are

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.780
doing what we want them to do,
and if we are really solving

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.709
their problems, that's
the biggest challenge.

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:19.250
RICARDO FIGUEIREDO:
For me, launching

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.600
means that I'm going
to test my website.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.580
It's not, OK, work is
done, and it's all good.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.030
Let's just sit and wait.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.190
So launching, for me,
it's a very special stage,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.460
because we're going to get the
early adopters, the people who

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.590
really want to know about it.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.170
And these are the
potential people

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.400
who are going to share it.
