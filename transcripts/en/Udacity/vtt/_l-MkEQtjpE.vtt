00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's start with the first one--let's try some experiments and I want to encourage you

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to do all the experiments you can think of to try to answer a question about set.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And the quizzes that we're going to have, some of them in this unit are different

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
from the kind of quizzes that you had in CS101.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
All those quizzes were meant to be ones that you could answer based on what had been covered,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but realize it's not like that.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
These problems you face don't follow directly from previously covered content.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Many of the course in this unit will be different, that you'll need to do some experiments

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
on your own, may be do some web searches, may be read some documents

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to try to figure out how to answer them.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Then I'll talk about how I would find the answer to that question when I discussed the answer

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
not so much what the answer is but more importantly how do you find it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The question is, is the result of set x or x as a list a mutable object or an immutable object,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and you should remember that mutable objects are objects whose value can change

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
like list in dictionaries.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Immutable objects are objects whose value doesn't change like integers and strings.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What's the result of set x.
