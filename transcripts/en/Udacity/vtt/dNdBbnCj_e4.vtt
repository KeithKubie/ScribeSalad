00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.910
How does HTTP work?

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.676
In its original
form, Berners-Lee

00:00:04.676 --> 00:00:06.509
came up with a template
that you can fill in

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.609
to make a request for
a document on a server.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.609
The original protocol,
later called HTTP 0.9,

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:16.378
was incredibly limited.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.390
You fill in if you want
to retrieve or store

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.368
a document, where to
store the document,

00:00:20.368 --> 00:00:22.410
including the name and
any additional information

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.410
you think is necessary.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.990
This request is then
handed to the server.

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.149
Since the server
speaks HTTP, it

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.850
knows that this is an HTTP
request and can, therefore,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.980
understand what
the client wants.

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:37.979
The protocol also has
templates for the responses.

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:40.229
These are a bit more versatile,
since a single request

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:43.049
can have a variety of outcomes,
including errors, unreadable

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:45.479
request forms, or redirecting
the client to a completely

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:46.799
different server.

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:50.489
Luckily, Rich did a good job,
and I know what he wants.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.770
The only thing left for me
to do is fill out this form

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.260
so Richard knows which
request I'm responding to.

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:08.275
Bandwidth problems.
