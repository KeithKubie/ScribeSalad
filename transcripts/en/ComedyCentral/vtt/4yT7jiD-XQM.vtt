00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:05.038
(Forrest)
Gay people have existed
since people have existed.

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:08.542
And, yet, in all that time
I have never closely considered

00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:12.012
who they are
or why they might need curing.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:15.215
I chose to begin my review
with a fact-finding mission

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.818
to the gay sex shop
nearest my dad's house.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.820
Who is that man?

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:23.056
(Forrest)
While there I was confronted
by a big realization.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.225
- Mystified.
(Forrest) It was so enormous

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.728
I suddenly wondered if
this review was even possible

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.564
and I knew I had to consult
my producer Grant.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:32.766
Completely mystifying.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.302
Have you ever
looked closely

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.438
at a man's
flaccid penis?

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:40.107
It looks like something
that belongs

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.576
on the lightless
ocean floor

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.913
and what if, when a gay man
looks at a woman's

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:47.714
beautiful breasts,
he feels the same way.

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:51.084
That they're like
sea blobs with nipples on them.

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:53.320
I mean, if that's what
a gay man sees

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:54.922
when he looks at
a pair of breasts,

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.590
how am I supposed
to change that?

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.258
- It's impossible.
- Exactly.

00:00:58.292 --> 00:01:00.093
What am I supposed to do?

00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:04.264
Well, life is a parade of people
doing impossible things.

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:07.100
- Wha--
- Hey, when you quit this show

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:09.236
to go after your ex-wife
and she said it was too late

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.238
- and she rejected you...
- Yeah.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:13.073
You vanished from
the face of the earth

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:16.276
until a dog found you
sleeping in a crawl space

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.512
- under a church.
- Yeah, it was a Rottweiler.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.848
But what if I had told you
back then

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:23.750
that in less than a year
you would turn it all around.

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:25.419
You'd have your old job back,

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:26.854
you'd be dating a great
coma nurse.

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:28.722
Oh, well, eh, no,
she and I broke up.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.224
Yeah, well,
that is exactly my point.

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:31.525
Because you don't
need her anymore

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:32.993
because
you're back out there,

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:34.995
you're living
a brand-new life.

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:37.164
So, if you can jump-start
a brand-new life,

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.266
why do you think
a gay person can't?

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.737
- Hmm.
- Are you so homophobic

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.773
that you don't think
a gay man can do what you do

00:01:46.807 --> 00:01:49.276
just because he's gay?

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:54.615
No. Definitely gay men
can do everything I can do

00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:56.517
and probably a lot better.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.218
- Thank you for that.
- You get out there.

00:01:58.252 --> 00:01:58.318
- Yeah.
- All right.
