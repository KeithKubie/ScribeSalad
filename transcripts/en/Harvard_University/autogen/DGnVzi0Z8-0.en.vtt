projects we've gotten involved in it's
 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.300
projects we've gotten involved in it's
been again this idea that there are

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310
been again this idea that there are
 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.100
been again this idea that there are
known ways that you can be more

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110
known ways that you can be more
 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.950
known ways that you can be more
effective and can we make it easy for

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960
effective and can we make it easy for
 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.109
effective and can we make it easy for
people to adopt those known ways

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119
people to adopt those known ways
 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.010
people to adopt those known ways
effectively and if we show that it works

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020
effectively and if we show that it works
 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.350
effectively and if we show that it works
then you kind of got to do it and that's

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360
then you kind of got to do it and that's
 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.310
then you kind of got to do it and that's
and that's a hard place to come to
