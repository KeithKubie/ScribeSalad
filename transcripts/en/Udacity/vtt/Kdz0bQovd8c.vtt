00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.870
So here's an example that we're going to
use to kind of motivate this idea.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.510
So here's a representation of a POMDP.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.600
It's got how many states?

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.500
&gt;&gt; Four.
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.420
It's got how many observations?

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.920
Three!

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.360
Right, blue, green, and red.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.490
And so these two states
are indistinguishable by their

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.630
immediate observations.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.130
And let's say there's four actions,
north, south, east, west.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.314
So north from this red
takes you to this green,

00:00:20.314 --> 00:00:22.710
north from this red
takes you to this blue.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.900
East and west from this blue
leave you where you were, etc.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.750
Does that make some sense?

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.490
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.190
&gt;&gt; So we've got left, right, up, down as
our actions and these four states and

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.800
these three possible observations.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.620
And so we can represent this as a POMDP.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.290
If we know these dynamics,
we know this system, we know this model,

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.930
we can represent what's the probability
we're in each of these states, one, two,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.830
three, four, the states.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.080
And so for example, if I say okay, I'm
going to start off uniformly at random.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.010
And by the way,
the state you're in is currently red.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.640
So then our belief state would be
what zero, zero, a half, a half.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.460
If we then go left, then our
belief state would be zero, zero,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.355
a half, a half still.

00:01:00.355 --> 00:01:01.110
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.300
&gt;&gt; If we went up and observed green,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.010
then our probability distribution
would be zero, one, zero, zero.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.440
We'd definitely be in this state.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.220
And actually, given that there's
no stochasticity in this case,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.840
we would know where we were
forever after, right, and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.870
we would continue to act and
we'll know where we are.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.130
We're going to to try to re-represent
the same idea, the same system, the same

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.950
model, but not using a POMDP but
instead by using a set of predictions.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.770
So I'm going to claim that the tests
that we're going to use for

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.160
this representation, well,
there's lots of possibilities, but

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.160
we're going to do is say, hey,
what would happen if you were to go up?

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.260
Would you see blue?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.510
So what's the probability that
you'd see blue after going up?

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.090
And if you were to go left,
would you see red?

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.910
What's the probability of
seeing red if we were to go

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.750
left from the current state?

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.666
And so again,
the state is going to be predictions.

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:51.243
It's going to be probabilities
on these two quantities, and

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:52.958
we're going to try to keep that updated.

00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.910
We're going to keep these
predictions updated as we move

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.200
around in the environment.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.470
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we're replacing
a distribution over states with

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.630
a kind of distribution over the outcomes
of tests that we might take.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's
a good way to think about it.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.890
Probabilities that we get here
don't necessarily have to add up to

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:13.500
one, right?

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.840
That's sort of independent,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.160
the question of how likely is
it to see blue when we go up?

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.810
How likely is it to see
red after we go left?

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.960
But other than that,
it is a sort of probabilistic quantity.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.188
But we kind of like this notion that
these tests are actions and observations

00:02:28.188 --> 00:02:32.281
because in any given time, we could say,
hey, this seems like the kind of

00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:36.205
situation where it's two-thirds
probable that I go up and see blue.

00:02:36.205 --> 00:02:38.210
Let's just try that just to make sure.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.790
So we can go up, see whether or
not we see blue, and

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.280
see how often that
actually seems to happen.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.200
It's still not trivial
to learn in this case,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.810
but at least it's grounded out in
observables, actions, and observations.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.390
&gt;&gt; Right, and I guess sort of
philosophically, if I might

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.930
wax philosophical for a moment, there's
really no difference between this and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.840
states, right, because states
are kind of made up things,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.100
which represent states of the world,
dare I say it.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.170
Then these tests also kind of represent,
at least implicitly,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.136
other states of the world and are just
as fine a reasonable representation

00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:12.150
as these made up nominal circles.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
they're not certainly no worse, but

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.600
I'm going to argue that in principle,
they might even be better.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.410
Because again,
you can actually execute these tests and

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.720
see what the outcomes were.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.440
&gt;&gt; And then that will tell you where
you were and possibly where you are.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, or at least would let you
validate your current predictions.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.010
Whereas with states, if I think,
okay, I'm in the belief state zero,

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.280
a half, a half to zero,
there's nothing that you can validate.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.470
There's no test that you can run.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.310
There's no experiment you can do
in the world that would tell you

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.420
what the states actually were
because states are not observable.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.730
&gt;&gt; But these tests can tell
you sort of whether you are,

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.295
I'm going to try to ground
this out an example.

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:51.550
So, am I sick,
do I have a particular disease?

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.880
Well, there are tests that I
could run that would tell me, and

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.230
then I might be able to do
other more interesting things.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.020
And that's kind of a practical thing to
know, rather than asking the question, I

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.040
mean, it's one way of sort of answering
an underlying question of am I in

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.245
the state of being sick or in the state
of, I don't know, having blue hay fever.

00:04:09.245 --> 00:04:12.195
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I guess that's
this upper left state.

00:04:12.195 --> 00:04:15.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm intrigued,
so what's next?

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.170
What do we do with these tests?

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.850
&gt;&gt; Well, so in principle, we should
be able to learn PSR representations.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.790
And because again, if we have a test,
we should be able to validate it and

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.880
make our predictions better over time.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.438
And in principle, we could plan
in this kind of space as well.

00:04:30.438 --> 00:04:32.460
We're not going to talk about
either of those in the class, but

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.460
I do want to do a slightly more concrete
example of these test probabilities with

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.170
this little grid that we've got going
here, just to make it more concrete.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.670
&gt;&gt; Okay.
