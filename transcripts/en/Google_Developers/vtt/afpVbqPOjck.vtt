TIMOTHY JORDAN:
And now it's time

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.900
to talk about Android Auto.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.950
Doesn't it feel like old times?

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.491
SPEAKER 1: I know
it feels like we're

00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:12.612
in an introduction to
Android Auto reunion.

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:15.070
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Dylan, tell us
about what we're sitting in?

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.736
Actually, before we
get to that, tell me

00:00:16.736 --> 00:00:19.120
about what the latest
is with Android Auto.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.661
SPEAKER 2: Well, I think, the
latest we're showing here today

00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:23.590
is that Android is now
embeddable in the car.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.624
So unlike, I think,
we've seen in the past,

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:27.040
you guys were
showing on the phone

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.574
or even connected over USB to
the car that's Android Auto,

00:00:29.574 --> 00:00:31.990
now we're showing Android as
the actual embedded operating

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.400
system in the car.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.400
So our goal is always to have
safe, seamless, integrated,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.780
connected services.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.540
And now, I think, we're seeing
the seamless part of that.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.330
There's no phone involved here.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.205
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:44.220
And It's beautiful.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.886
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:00:44.886 --> 00:00:47.290
So this is an Audi
Q8 concept car.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.320
It's absolutely gorgeous,
it's got a really nice set

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.630
of screens we can look at here.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.720
And Audi actually just announced
plans to ship, in the future,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.040
with Android in the car.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.777
So that's what we're
showing here today.

00:00:58.777 --> 00:00:59.860
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Very cool.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.884
Well, let's get to, I don't
know, play with some features.

00:01:02.884 --> 00:01:05.050
And then we'll get back to
Android Auto, in general.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.720
SPEAKER 2: Cool, all right.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.803
Well, let me show you a
few different things here.

00:01:07.803 --> 00:01:10.614
So first of all, we've
obviously got a home screen,

00:01:10.614 --> 00:01:13.030
doesn't really look like a
phone, doesn't look a wearable,

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.610
or TV.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.395
So this is nice automotive,
integrated experience.

00:01:16.395 --> 00:01:17.770
We've got the kind
of information

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.870
a driver is used to seeing here.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.990
But the key aspect to this is
that Audi did the integration

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.850
and it's Audi's UI concept.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.280
It's not just another phone
or even just another car.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.010
So, for example, they like to
have music front and center.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.070
They've got a
great sound system,

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.830
so there's interactive
tiles here.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.060
We can turn these on and off.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.399
They have the ability to
look at vehicle information.

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.190
Unfortunately, we're
not driving right now,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.190
so it's a little static.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.430
But they have this and
it's an Android app.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.850
That's the important part,
it's just an Android app.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.730
We can also go to the home
screen and see on the launcher,

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.440
they've got their
important stuff

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.450
that they feel is
front and center here.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.970
So for example, we can
switch between apps,

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.110
there's an Audi navigation app.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.850
And we can start
running it, does

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.580
what you might expect in a car.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.300
We're driving somewhere
, so that's good.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.410
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE] good.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.076
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:02:09.076 --> 00:02:09.699
Oh, let's not.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.810
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We should,
right through those doors there.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.476
SPEAKER 2: Actually,
yeah, we should do.

00:02:13.476 --> 00:02:14.380
Not.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.051
They won't be happy.

00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:16.550
Yes.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.216
So this is happening, but what I
want to draw your attention to,

00:02:19.216 --> 00:02:21.070
actually, is the
integrated aspect of--

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.130
what's important here is
over in the cluster display

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.050
now which actually
isn't running Android,

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.670
this is a real-time
operating system

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.350
for the driver information.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.510
But we do have
information coming

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.290
from the app, from the APK,
through the vehicle network,

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.070
and it's being integrated
into their cluster over here.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.320
The same with, actually, the
Android notifications as well.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.720
And if I switch
to what they call

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.910
their Big Stage,
their different view,

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.090
we can also now push
through a cluster API.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.800
We can push real graphics
from an app as well.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.467
So this is a pretty
automotive specific,

00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:55.258
this is not something
you would necessarily

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.250
want to do on a watch
or what have you.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.990
But this is the
kind of integration

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.730
we're looking to do
with the partners.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.460
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome
how it's all well integrated.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.920
And you still get the real-time
OS for the instrumentation.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.170
That I imagine is critical
in the automotive industry.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.740
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.480
So we're really focusing on
what they call infotainment.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.810
The music, the maps, the
media, the car information.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.489
But what we're not going into is
the critical information that--

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.280
we're not touching the
brakes, for example.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.970
We're not controlling
the brakes, yet.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.000
I shouldn't say yet, we're
not controlling the brakes.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.500
Or things like the
speed limit which

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.716
really has to be accurate
and present all the time.

00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:33.340
But, I think, the
key, as we're saying,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.449
is we still want to show
integration as appropriate.

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:37.990
So the driver has
all the information

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.210
they need to see right
in front of their eyes.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.300
And the passenger, for example,
can still work with the system

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.360
as well.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.590
So let's switch to
Google Maps, for example.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.270
Like this.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.510
And the passenger can work
with the app, like so,

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.450
or they can even use the Google
services like the assistant.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.740
Navigate to San Francisco.

00:04:02.754 --> 00:04:04.910
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: San
Francisco, all right.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.030
SPEAKER 2: That's more
like it, we're on the way.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.110
We can also show how here we've
got third party apps as well.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.950
So we were just
talking about how

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.450
on the phone side of
things, the app developers

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.510
have enabled their apps to
work seamlessly in a car.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.891
And the same applies here.

00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:22.765
So it just extends right
across the ecosystem

00:04:22.765 --> 00:04:25.780
as just another screen
to an app developer

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.850
implementing a couple of APIs.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.804
But of course we can
switch to different apps.

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:32.470
And, I think, the
really cool thing here

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.150
is that it still looks
and feels like an Audi.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.050
It feels like a
premium experience,

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.920
but it also feels
like Pocket Casts.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.329
And it also feels like Spotify.

00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:46.870
So, I think, those
are the key things

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.030
we're trying to call out
with this concept demo

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.630
with Audi is number one, Android
is a good operating system

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.320
for the car.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.710
Number two, the developer
ecosystem can come with it

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.450
and tie really nicely
with a good vehicle

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.450
integration as well.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.660
So there's--

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.118
SPEAKER 1: It sounds like it
uses the standard Android Auto

00:05:02.118 --> 00:05:03.900
media and messaging
API so that just--

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.290
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.620
SPEAKER 1: --integrates
right in here.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.340
So yeah, that's cool.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.464
SPEAKER 2: Yep, absolutely.

00:05:06.464 --> 00:05:08.910
Like Media Browse,
Media Session--

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.490
as long as the apps
work there then

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.200
Audi can assure that it's going
to work in there car, as can

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.400
any other OEMs as well.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.420
So that's the key,
the standard APIs.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.300
SPEAKER 1: Nice.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.300
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.970
Well, before we
get going, I'd like

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.000
to ask what else is going on
in the world of Android Auto?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.764
One of the things that
I noticed recently,

00:05:25.764 --> 00:05:27.180
and people are
still asking about,

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.096
is that you can get
Android Auto on your phone

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:31.500
even if your car doesn't have
the integration built in.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.510
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.040
So one of the
things we talk about

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.550
is safe and seamless connected
experience in any car.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.079
So obviously in this
car we have it here,

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:42.120
it's seamless, connected.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.040
But actually just if
I have a phone when

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.272
I'm driving my crummy, old--

00:05:45.272 --> 00:05:46.230
I shouldn't say crummy.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.220
My Mazda 5.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.740
I love it.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.800
I love it, it moves
my kids around.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.240
I can stick this
on the dashboard,

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.865
I have Bluetooth connection, and
I have everything that I want.

00:05:53.865 --> 00:05:57.150
So if I'm driving
with my old car that

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.070
doesn't have Android
Auto into it,

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.310
I can still use my phone, as
is, and look at the media apps

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.110
that I already use today--

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.499
my contacts and my map
in a safe seamless way.

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:10.290
So, yeah, I think,
that's the exciting part

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.930
is on the phone connected
from the phone to the car.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.897
Or just the car.

00:06:14.897 --> 00:06:15.980
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Very cool.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:16.980
SPEAKER 2: There you go.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.521
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Well, I think, that's

00:06:18.521 --> 00:06:19.630
all the time that we have.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.025
So, I guess, we'll get going.

00:06:22.025 --> 00:06:23.275
Anything else you want to say?

00:06:23.275 --> 00:06:25.020
SPEAKER 2: If we're going to
get going we should just drive.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.520
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Yeah, let's do that.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.810
SPEAKER 1: Let's do it.
