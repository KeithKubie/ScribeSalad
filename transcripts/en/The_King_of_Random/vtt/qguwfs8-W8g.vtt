00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.390
For this project I’m going to show you how
to raise a squadron of 3D fighter jet puzzles,

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.610
and assemble an elite fleet, of foam fighter
jets, that’ll fly straight as an arrow,

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.550
and cruise over 40 ft away.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.240
To start this project, you’ll just need
a piece of foam-board from the dollar store.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.390
It doesn’t matter whether it’s a black
or white board, because we’re just after

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.939
the foam on the inside.

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.050
Pick one of the corners, and use a fingernail
to carefully peel the top layer off the board.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.909
Then flip it over, and peel the paper off
the other side as well.

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.919
This should leave you with a nice large sheet,
of medium density styrofoam.

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.329
Now the next thing you’ll need are these
styrofoam cutting templates I made, for building

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.890
a SU-27 fighter jet. And I’ve put a link
in the description, to where you can get those.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.219
Print off the templates, and use a sharp pair
of scissors, to carefully cut around the outlines

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.949
of the puzzle pieces, as neatly as you can,
and take time to do a good job, because the

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.129
finished product, will only be as straight,
as your cuts.

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.600
Now if you printed your templates on full
page label paper, you can simply peel off

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.070
the backing, and stick the pieces directly
to the foam.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.960
Otherwise, just use some glue to slap them
on, instead.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.760
I cut and pasted all my pieces to the foam
board, so let’s get ready to slice and dice, with electricity.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.370
The quickest, cleanest, and easiest way to
cut these styrofoam shapes, is with the “Styro-Slicer”,

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.150
I showed you how to make in a previous project.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.090
This homemade “wire foam cutter”, uses
electricity, to heat up a very thin wire,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.630
and melt through styrofoam, like butter.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.900
Flip the red switch to the “normal” power
setting, then press the control knob, to get

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.580
the electricity buzzing, and turn up the dial.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.980
It should only take about 2 seconds, for the
system to heat up. And you can see the instant

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.310
the wire touches the foam, it glides right
through it, without any trouble at all.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.140
Now I find the best approach, to precision
styrofoam slicing, is simply to rough out

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.440
the individual pieces first, then focus on
tracing the templates themselves, once they’re

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.380
smaller and easier to handle.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.220
You can see the wire slices through the foam
with ease, but notice how it doesn’t actually cut through the paper.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.540
That means, that anything you can make out
of paper, you can now, make into foam.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.720
When you finish tracing the edges, you should
be able to pop the templates right out of

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.830
the foam, leaving you with clean, and professional
looking, puzzle pieces.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.780
Alright our 3D puzzle’s, nearly ready for
assembly. There’s just one thing we need to do first.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.130
The little white slots on the paper still
need to be cut out, so find a sharp knife

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.700
with a pointy tip, and carefully begin carving,
along the edges.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.410
I put a piece of scrap foam on the bottom,
to help protect my work surface, and you can

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.860
see it gives the blade a little better penetration,
through the foam, as well.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.130
Now when all 4 sides are cut, simply press
it with the tip of the knife, and the piece

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.720
should fall right out, leaving a clean, blank
hole in its place.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.240
Go ahead and cut the other slots the exact
same way, and your 3D puzzle, is ready for assembly.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.360
Now do a quick check, to make sure you have
29 puzzle pieces, that look like these. And

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.300
it’s ok to leave the paper glued to the
foam, because I designed it, so that you could.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.340
Now rather than spoiling the fun and showing
you how the puzzle goes together, I’m going

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.620
to let you try and figure it out by yourself.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.770
But the pieces are made to inter-lock, and
hold themselves together without glue.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.740
These finished 3D fighter jets make an awesome
addition to your desktop or dresser, and can

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.680
make really fun gifts as well.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.280
The aircraft is modeled after an SU-27 fighter
jet, and if you give it a gentle tug upward,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.740
it’ll separate, right off the base.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.880
You can see how the missiles, and each of
the other components, interlock with each

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.650
other, making the jet surprisingly robust,
and durable, considering it’s made of foam.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.930
Now when you’re done admiring your handy-work,
just look on the underside, directly in the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.310
center, and you’ll find a hook for connecting
it back to the base.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.920
Simply push the stand into place, and your
foam fighter stands proudly on its own, until

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.280
you need it, for the next mission.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.540
Now just for fun I tried peeling the paper
off the templates, and made a couple versions,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.260
in plain white foam. Which actually look pretty
cool, in-and-of themselves.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.580
In fact, I made a whole squadron of different
shapes, sizes, and models, which are all really

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.110
awesome. But would be even cooler, if they
could fly.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.830
Now with a few modifications, I just created
a “Fling Fighter Jet” version, that’s

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.580
powered by rubber bands, and will easily cruise
over 40 ft away.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.380
The design’s similar to the 3D puzzle, but
it’s different enough, that I gave it it’s own template.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.150
The “Fling Fighter Jet” only has 4 pieces
to cut out, which can be done quickly and

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.950
easily, the same way you made the others.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.220
And similar to the puzzle, the pieces are
designed to interlock, and hold themselves tightly together, as well.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.739
Now you will need a way to balance your “Foam
Fighter” so it flies straight, and I recommend

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.630
using a small wire nail, like the kind you
use for hanging pictures.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.819
Carefully push one down into the nose, and
it’ll shift the center of gravity, forward.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.960
Now the weight of the nail you need, will
be different depending on the type of foam

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.400
you use, the elevation you’re at, and the
temperature, so you’ll need to experiment

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.969
with which nails work best for you, in your
area.

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:24.409
But in my experimenting, #16 wire nails between
1-1/4” - 1-1/2”, worked best for me.

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:28.439
When you’ve got your jet perfectly balanced,
it’ll shoot as straight as an arrow.

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:32.360
Load your “Fling Fighter", by looping an
elastic band around the hook under the cockpit,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.529
then grab the tab, at the end of the jet.

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:38.090
Pull back, to power it up, then simply aim,
and release.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.099
These “Fling Fighters” can be launched
over and over, and they fly impressive distances.  Especially indoors.

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.370
Well now you know how to convert pieces of
dollar store foam-board, into interactive

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.620
“Fling Fighters”. Or raise a micro Air-Force,
of 3D fighter jet puzzles, you made yourself.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.860
By the way. With the “Styro-Slicer”, you’re
not just limited to making airplanes either.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.680
In fact, you can make anything you can think
of.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.440
Well that’s it for now. If you liked this
project, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
