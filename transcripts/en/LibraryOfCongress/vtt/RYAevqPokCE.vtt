00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.920
at the Kluge Center.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.320

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.210
The John W. Kluge Center
is a vibrant scholar center

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.170
on Capitol Hill that brings
together scholars and researchers

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.620
from around the world to

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.330 position:56%
to distill wisdom from the Library's
rich resources, and to interact

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.560
with policymakers and the public.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.990
The Center offers opportunities
for senior scholars,

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.680
post-doctoral fellows, and PhD

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.600
about future programs as
well as opportunities for you

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.810
to conduct your own research
here at the Library of Congress.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.940
Today's program is titled
"Profiles in Statesmanship,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.610
20th Century Breakthroughs,
21st Century Challenges."

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.030 position:56%
It features scholar Bruce Jentleson,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.590
who holds the Henry A.
Kissinger Chair in Foreign Policy

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.040
and International Relations here
at The John W. Kluge Center.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.690
While at the Library, Bruce has
been working on a book project

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.110
that examines transformational
leaders of the 20th century

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.030
who made major breakthroughs
for peace and security.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.250
In an interview on our blog I
asked Bruce why this project now?

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.680
And his response was the
following, "It's a lot easier

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.370
to name a global problem that's
been growing worse than one

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.560
which progress is being made.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.800
There are many aspects
to meeting these

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.820
and other 21st century challenges,
but much must come top-down

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.300
from global leaders able and
willing to be transformational,

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.440
to break out of the tunnel
vision of thinking narrowly

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.920
about one's interests and
the myopia of focusing

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.250
on today but not tomorrow."

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.030 position:56%
We hope that Bruce's work will
reveal what lessons may exist for us

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.780
to solve our 21st century problems.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.020
A word about the Chair
position which Bruce holds,

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.490
the Kissinger Chair is made
possible by the generous donations

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.310
of the friends and admirers
of Dr. Henry Kissinger.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.560
It establishes a nonpartisan
focus in the nation's capital

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.470
for discussions of key issues
in foreign affairs and acts

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.940 position:56%
as a catalyst for the fresh analysis

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.760
of foreign affairs
in this global era.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.190
One distinguished senior scholar
is appointed annually to be

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.440
in residence at the Kluge
Center, and the research may be

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.310
on any aspect of foreign policy

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.860
or international relations
involving the United States

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.810
and using the Library
of Congress collections.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.910
Our past chair holders
have included an ambassador

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.080
who researched the evolution of
the relationship between India

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.670
and the United States, a member
of the British Diplomatic Service

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.020
who researched Pakistan's
strategic culture,

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.120
and an adjunct senior fellow at
the Council on Foreign Relations

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.790
who researched the growing
divisions between the EU, NATO,

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.080
and the Former Soviet Union.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.540 position:56%
Our 16th Kissinger Chair will arrive
later this year, and we are eager

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.490
to hear from you with nominations
for our 17th Kissinger Chair.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.530
So please visit our website to
learn more about the program,

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.960
and note that applications
and nominations

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.410
for this position may be
submitted through November 1st.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.000
And now to introduce Dr. Jentleson.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.810
As mentioned, Dr. Jentleson
is the 15th holder

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.340
of the Henry A. Kissinger
Chair in Foreign Policy

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.580
and International Relations here
at the Library's Kluge Center.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.420

00:06:53.510 --> 00:07:00.040
[ Applause ]

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.340
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jentleson:
Thanks very much, Jason.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.440
And thanks to the Kluge Center.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.770
I've been here for the
full academic year.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.170
It's been a fabulous
place to be and to work.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.320
I particularly want to thank Jane
McAuliffe who was the Director

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.270
of the Center during my
period of application,

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.600
Bob Gallucci who was the Director
during my period of residence,

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.640
and really all my colleagues here
at the Kluge Center, both present

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.490
and those earlier in
the academic year.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.380
I also want to acknowledge the
Wilson Center where I also worked

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.720
on this book a couple of years ago
when I was a Distinguished Scholar,

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.430
and still am affiliated as a
Non-resident Global Fellow.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.070
And my various RAs who worked
on this [inaudible] one

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.510
of whom is here today --
so thank you very much --

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.380
in the years of doing the research.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.090
The Kissinger Chair is
really a great honor.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.650
And as part of this
project I actually got

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.090
to interview Dr. Kissinger
in January.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.670
It's the first time I had
actually had a one-on-one with him,

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:58.140
and I had interacted with him in
groups in various times before.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.950
In fact, there was one time
where I was invited to go

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.370
with a congressional delegation
to a conference in Germany,

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.140
and Henry Kissinger was part of
the delegation, along with a number

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.810 position:56%
of congressmen and senators who were
flying out of Andrews Airforce Base.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.770 position:56%
And so it was one of these overnight
flights, and I said to my wife,

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.180 position:56%
I said, "You know, normally I'd just
sort of wear like a running suit."

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.660
She said, "You can't do that.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.340
You know, you're going with
Kissinger and these senators.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.850
You've got to like wear, you
know, at least a sport jacket

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.150
and a tie if not a suit."

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.330 position:56%
So I show up at Andrews dressed
like this, and who's greeting people

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.170
when you get on the plane but
Kissinger in a running suit, right?

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:33.860
You know, of course, he had
a compartment on the plane

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.920
to change into, and so when we came
back, you know, I said to Barbara,

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.420
I said, "You see, you know,

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.090
Kissinger was wearing
a running suit."

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.040
And she said, "Yeah,
he's Henry Kissinger.

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.250
You're Bruce Jentleson," right, so
you each get to dress accordingly.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.970 position:56%
And so the book, as Jason mentioned,

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.010
will be published next summer
or fall by W.W. Norton.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.260
The working title -- everybody
knows published books it's really

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.520 position:56%
up to your editor what the title is,

00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.940
but this is the title
we've been using,

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.540
"Transformational Statesmanship,
Difficult, Possible, Necessary."

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.670
And it's really a book
that, as Jason said --

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.970
and I'll talk some more about it --

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.800
about breakthroughs in the
20th century for global peace

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.180
and security, broadly defined.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.680
Not a book about perfect
achievements of peace and security.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.920
Indeed, that would be a very short
book to write, unfortunately.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.920
One wouldn't need a full nine
months of residence to do it.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.600
But I realized the other day

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.200
that this book serves a
number of purposes for me.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.710
In fact, this morning I was on a
panel at the Holocaust Museum --

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:35.340
I do a lot of work both as a
scholar and in my policy roles

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.900
on mass atrocities and
genocide prevention.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.700
We had a panel with Senator Ben
Cardin and a number of other people

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.120
over at the Holocaust Museum.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.350
And I also have been
doing a lot of work lately

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.750
in a very immediate
sense on issues in Syria.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.420
And those can be rather
depressing subjects.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:55.200
This book is a little bit
about hopeful achievements,

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.790
so I realize that I
may not ever finish it,

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.830 position:56%
because it's really my mental health
therapy that keeps me thinking

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:04.440
about what actually may
be possible in the world.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.010
It's interesting, so this
book actually started

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.610
with some ideas from my students.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.030
In the early 1980s, toward the end

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.570
of a U.S. foreign policy
course I taught when I was then

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.170
on the faculty at the
University of California Davis,

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.000
I had asked the students
their thoughts on the future.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.500
"Well, Professor Jentleson,"
one earnest young student said,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.580
"I think the Cold War will end" --

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.540
this is the early 1980s
-- "and end peacefully."

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.440
And from another bright-eyed
one I got, "Apartheid will end

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.660
in South Africa, and South
Africa will transition

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.190
to a black-majority democracy."

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:35.050
My responses at the time
were along the lines of,

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.910
"It's nice to be young, naive,

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:41.000
and California dreaming,
but let's be realistic."

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.190
The Cold War did end, and
without a nuclear or other U.S.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.490
/Soviet war.

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:49.110 position:56%
Apartheid did end, and the political
transition was impressively civil.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.650
While many factors came into play,

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:54.170
the extraordinary statesmanship
provided by Mikhail Gorbachev

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.620
and Nelson Mandela
were the crucial ones.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.930
So in one of those gratifying
examples of the two-way street

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:04.460 position:56%
of professors teaching and also
learning from students, and teaching

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.180
and research cross-fertilizing,
I got thinking

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.600
about two other questions.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:13.110
Who else in the 20th century
was a profile in statesmanship,

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.460
shaping major breakthroughs
for peace?

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.960
The leaders I include in the
book were not totally successful.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.280
Gorbachev and Mandela
were not, either.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.820
But they were transformational,
making breakthroughs on issues

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.840
that have been marked by deep
tensions and intense conflict,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.520
which made possible, although did
not guarantee further progress.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.160
And secondly, what can we learn

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.000
from 20th century transformational
statesmanship for the 21st century?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.530
A while back, in the late 1980s,
early 1990s, it sure seemed

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.980
like the world was going
in a good direction.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.190
The Cold War ended peacefully,
dictatorships were falling

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.540
to democracies, globalization
was spreading the wealth,

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.040
history was said to be over,
world affairs becoming so harmonic

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.320
as to be downright boring.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.620
As Jason said in our interview,

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.170
things have not exactly
worked out that way.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.740
The end of the Cold War has
not meant the end of war.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.810
That democratic wave has
broken up on some rocky shores.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.610
Globalization has had
losers as well as winners,

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.580
downsides as well as upsides.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.370
History has come roaring back

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.950
with ancient hatreds
fueled by modern venoms.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.250
Climate change is speeding up.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.520
Global health pandemics
are spreading.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.920 position:56%
Cyberwar and other technology-driven
emerging areas in need of rules

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.940
of the game aren't getting them.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.710 position:56%
Indeed, it is a lot easier to name
a global problem that's been growing

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.030
worse than one in which
progress has been made.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:34.120
So as I thought about these
two questions and started

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.630
to develop my thinking on it,
they really bring you back to one

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.080
of those questions that's been
debated forever, you know,

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.340
does history make statesmen
or do statesmen make history?

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:47.140
You know, at one end of the
debate is Thomas Carlyle's heroic

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.500
conception of history that, quote,

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.280
"The history of what man has
accomplished in this world is

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.510
at bottom the history of the
great men who have worked here.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:57.420
All thing that we see
standing accomplished

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.920
in the world are properly
the outer material result --

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.350
the practical realization
embodiment of thoughts that dwelt

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.180
in the great men sent
into the world."

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.980
The other end of the
debate is Herbert Spencer

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.120
who derided the universal
love of personalities,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.580 position:56%
going back well before "People"
magazine and TMZ.com to when, quote,

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.010
"Round the campfire assembled
savages telling the events

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:25.050 position:56%
of the day's chase, and he among
them who has done some feat of skill

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.500
or agility is duly lauded."

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.330
The truth lies in between.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.900 position:56%
Carlyle is too much the romanticist,
overstating the roles of individuals

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.320
and undervaluing conducive
conditions creating opportunities

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.720
for leadership.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.970 position:56%
Spencer is too much the sociologist,
overstating societal processes

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.790
and contexts, and undervaluing
what, as many people find,

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:50.910
and Isaiah Berlin said, "At
crucial moments at turning points,

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.480
individuals and their decisions

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.950
and acts can determine
the course of history."

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.930
My perspective, based on experience
in the foreign policy world as well

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:02.260
as an international relations
professor, puts me in this history

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.700
of great leaders' middle ground.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.410
The academic literature digs deeper
than just the latest who's up

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.840
and who's down, but too often
stays at a level of abstraction

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.970
that glosses over the
impact that leaders do have.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.870 position:56%
The talk here inside the Beltway and
among journalists can get too caught

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.560
up in personalities,
but often does focus

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.090
in on critical decision
making and strategizing.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.330
The analytic balance is in
recognizing that history

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.180
and broad social forces
create constraints as well

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:32.580
as conducive conditions, shaping
the range of available choices.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.730
But they don't determine
what choices get made.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.510
No individual is so
extraordinary that he

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.820
or she would have transformational
impact, irrespective of the context

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.890
in which he or she
ends up operating.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:46.720
But it's also not a given that just
anyone could have pulled off the

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.920
statesmanship that the
particular leader did.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.720
It's man, woman, and
moment, fit, and timing.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.240
And so as I've thought
about this in the book,

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.670 position:56%
I think of it as a framework of what
I call the three Cs, the constraints

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:05.070
that limit the choices that leaders
have, the conducive conditions

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:07.810
that help make it possible
to make certain choices,

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.890
but ultimately really
about choices being made.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:17.130
The -- Fred Greenstein, who
was a noted political scientist

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.960
at Princeton, in his worked talked
in more formal social science terms

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:25.340
about actor indispensability,
that the leader

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.670
in question responds significantly
differently than another leader

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.010
in the same situation would have.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:33.690
And Greenstein says this is
especially true in situations

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:37.220
like transformational statesmanship
when, as he puts it, quote,

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.580
"The more demanding the political
act, the greater the likelihood

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.880
that it will be influenced

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.100
by personal characteristics
of the actor."

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.980
So yes, there are systemic
forces at work at many levels,

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.230
but choices that are made.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:54.790
Another way of thinking about this
is in baseball moneyball terms,

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.360
right, the statistic of
wins-against-replacement,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.810 position:56%
which calculates how much one
player contributes to team victories

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:03.700
over alternative ones
at the same position.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:08.170
And one gets into very
complicated sabermetrics on this.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:12.010
So while there is no neat
diplo-ball statesmanship

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:16.010
against replacement leader
sabermetric, or SARL,

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.480
evidence can be marshalled to make
the same point, who the player

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.460
or statesman is makes a big
difference, and frankly,

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.610
it allows me to connect my
passion for baseball and my work

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.460
in foreign policy, which
at least two people

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.260
in the audience will
know is something I try

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.210
to do as often as possible.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:34.010
So we can think about this in
the broader sense of leadership

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.570
as genus leadership,
species statesmanship.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:41.200
And there is a huge
literature on this.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.850
James MacGregor Burns, very
distinguished scholar on this,

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.110
called leadership, "One
of the most observed

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.760
and least understood
phenomena on earth."

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:51.890 position:56%
Noted author and public intellectual
Walter Isaacson calls it an

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:53.190
"elusive quality."

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.580
That's not for a lack of trying.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:57.880
Books abound.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.390 position:56%
Some are about political leadership,
some about business leadership,

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.060
some philosophical, some how-to.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:07.350
And an Amazon search
brought up 173,164 books

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:12.930
for keyword leadership, 79,455
for political leadership.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.230
Nor are there a shortage

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.780
of university-based
leadership programs.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.260
Harvard has its Advanced
Leadership Institute.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.190
At Duke we have our
Hard Leadership program.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.930
The University of Virginia has
the Batten School of Leadership

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:24.480
and Public Policy, and many others.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.460 position:56%
In the corporate world an
estimated $14 billion has been spent

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.760
over the past two decades

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.110
on leadership development,
twice as much as before.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:37.740
Yet 75% of respondents deem
their programs ineffective.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.920
Indeed, as we know in many context,

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.050
people talk about leadership all
the time, but with the same mantra

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:46.470
of we need leadership,
and how do you get it?

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.300
And there's a sense of both
fascination and frustration.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.660
Fascination in how time and again
explanations of success and failure

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.680
in such a range of
professions and pursuits hone

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.790
in on leadership as a key factor.

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:02.830
Frustration in how difficult it is
to find the elements of leadership

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:07.040
with any degree of consistency,
let alone teach and cultivate them.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.250
My intent in this book is to tap
the fascination and at least try

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.750
to reduce the frustration.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.980
So in working with this literature
on leadership broadly defined,

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:22.760
I've derived and I use in the book
a four-part analytic framework

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.870
which has the who, why,
how, what questions.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:29.690
Who were these leaders
as individuals?

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.340
Why did the make the
crucial choices they did?

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.420
How did they pursue their goals?

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.090
And what was and wasn't achieved?

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.290
Let me talk a little bit about
that framework before getting

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:43.120
into the profiles of who
I focus on in the book.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.730
Who were these leaders
as individuals?

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:47.470
Here we kind of want to get to
know them a little bit as people

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.360
without putting them on
the couch and doing sort

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.750
of a deterministic,
psychoanalytic analysis.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.730
"A man's rootage [sic]," as
Woodrow Wilson once said,

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.050
"means more than his leafage."

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.980
But it's not about
being a born leader.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.080
Rarely is there a statesmanship
equivalent

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.870
of Mozart the five-year-old
prodigy or LeBron James

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:10.530 position:56%
with NBA superstar skills coming out
of high school, or a perfect person,

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:15.480
Nelson Mandela in his
own personal life was --

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.830
issues with his own family,
with is wives and his children.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.750
There are, though, some
certain personal qualities

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:25.540
that do bear heavily
on leadership capacity.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:31.610
One is what is called by some
in the literature moral capital,

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:33.710
which is a little different
than political capital.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:37.570
It's a justness of what you stand
for, and of you as the leader

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:40.120
of that cause and for that purpose.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.300
And so legitimacy is
perceived by those

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.900
to whom you would provide
the leadership.

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.010
One of the factors that goes
into this is personal courage,

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:50.910
the sacrifices endured,
the hardships suffered,

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:56.240
in many cases prison
sentences, the willingness

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:58.370
to take courageous stands.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:02.280
As two scholars on leadership
at Harvard put it, they said,

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.480
"Transformational leadership
is not a safe path.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.940
It is indeed a dangerous activity.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.490
You appear dangerous to people
when you question their values,

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.740
beliefs, or habits of a lifetime.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.060
You place yourself on the line
when you tell people what they need

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.800
to hear rather than
what they want to hear."

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.360
Gorbachev got killed
politically, some of the others

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.340
in the book got assassinated.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.730
Charisma is an interesting quality,

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.150
which is sort of what
people always point to,

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.710
sort of the John Kennedy charisma.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:31.910
But -- and again, I'll talk some
about this now, and I'm happy to go

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.400
into more detail when
we have discussion --

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.060
in some ways it's backward.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:38.860 position:56%
I mean, Nelson Mandela is the iconic
case of a charismatic personality.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.700
But to jump ahead a little
bit, one of the people

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.810
in the book is Yitzhak Rabin who
hardly fit the Kennedy image,

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.540
this gruff old grandfatherly
guy who wasn't very good

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.850
at being -- giving speeches.

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:53.280
I was in Israel about three
weeks after his assassination,

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.500
and I wasn't surprised
by friends and colleagues

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.200
who were all broken up about this.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:01.020
But when I went down to the
square where he had been killed

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.090
and I saw 16-year-olds lighting
candles and playing guitars

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:08.670
for this gruff old guy who didn't
have Kennedy-esque charisma,

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.480
it really affected me
even more profoundly

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.030
than my own friends and colleagues.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:17.380
And so some ways charisma is a
product, and ultimately you see it,

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.450
but it's not the kind
of thing that, you know,

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.450
sort of consultants
and others look for.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:25.100
We also get into some
negative qualities,

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.730
because the point here is
admiration, but not hero worship.

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:31.500
And the point being many
imperfect people can be very

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.960
effective statesmen.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.300
Political skills of a variety
of kind also were important

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.540
in terms of these two profiles.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.780
Why really gets into the
vision, why did these

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.000
and others develop their guiding
visions beyond the way the world is

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.780
to how it could be?

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.240
Being able and willing to
push beyond standard analysis

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.990
and see the need for
profound change was a key.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.060 position:56%
What was the basis for that insight?

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.070
I looked for turning
points, decisive moments

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.780
when key choices were
made, and ideas

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.140
and strategies started to develop.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.890
A vision is really a
story, a political one.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.600
It's akin in form and functions
to what we think of more broadly

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.880
as narratives that provide the
why for the transformation.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.010
And while it varies
in different cases,

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:15.430
you'll find that it
always has three elements.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:16.730
There's a normative element,

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.610
the values which the
present is violating

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:22.320
and the alternative future
will affirm; the symbolic,

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.530
tapping deeply-rooted
cultural beliefs and mores,

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:28.500
and avoiding taboos that infuse
judgments of the legitimacy

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.490 position:56%
of the vision; and a cognitive
element, the key substantive points,

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.340
and the critique, and
the alternative.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.700
How is really a question
of politics and strategy,

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.820
what Joe Nye in his
work on this quotes,

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.730
"The means to achieve the
ends in one's vision."

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.420
Robert Rotberg, who's
written a lot on leaders

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.660
in the developing world
says leaders --

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.380
transformational leaders
can't just be visionaries.

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.420
They have to be navigators.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.580
Nan Keohane, President of Duke for
many years and a political theorist

00:22:54.580 --> 00:23:00.770
in her own right, talks about not
just making decisions, but devising

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:04.360 position:56%
and implementing strategies with
the right combination of incentives.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.300
Heifetz and Lipsky at Harvard talk
about controlling the temperature,

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.600
keeping the opposition close.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.820
And in deed, in the
stories that I tell,

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.630
when these have been violated it
also points to ways in which some

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:17.470
of these leaders have not
achieved the full transformations

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:18.770
that they've wanted.

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:23.620
The what did and what didn't they
achieve, to quote Machiavelli,

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.320
"There is nothing more difficult
to carry out, nor more doubtful

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.870
of success, nor more
dangerous to handle

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.370
than to initiate a
new order of things.

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:33.800
And here I take the
transformational balance sheet,

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.850
and sort of net assessing in
each case what was lessons

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:39.030
and what was and wasn't achieved.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:43.340
Recall that Isaiah Berlin quote in
which he talked about individuals

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:48.780
that can determine the course of
history, not necessarily they do,

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.980
which comes back to the
three Cs, constraints,

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:53.030
conducive conditions, and choices.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.070
Breakthroughs also have backlashes.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.690
And here it's important to
draw the lessons, as I said,

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:00.000
between what was achieved
and what wasn't.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.260 position:56%
So that's the [inaudible] framework.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:06.920
Quickly sort of the criteria
for choosing the cases in terms

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.920
of the research design, I
focus on 20th century cases,

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.380
which is really more
my own expertise

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.820
than prior historical periods in
a sense of what's most pertinent

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.210
for 21st century lesson drawing.

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.740
Transformational statesmanship
and the work of people

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.110
like Janet Berger Burns
[assumed spelling]

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:26.440
and Joe Nye is distinguished
from transactional diplomacy.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.620
Transformational being efforts
to make major breakthroughs

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.420
in global peace and security as
distinct from diplomacy geared

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.650
to managing and resolving issues
in the normal course of events,

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.890
which is not to belittle importance
of transactional diplomacy.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:46.240
It's very important on a day-to-day
basis, but it's just not my focus

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.390
in this particular book, trying
to look at those breakpoints.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:54.010
Third is the impact had, not
so much the position held.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:56.560
Typically when we think of
statesmanship we turn to presidents

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.260 position:56%
and prime ministers, secretaries of
state, ministers of foreign affairs,

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.580
and other leaders of nation-states.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.030
While I emphasize national
leaders, I'm also inclusive

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.850
of transformational leaders
for international institutions,

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:11.260
from social movements and
NGOs who did for peace

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.910
and justice what governments
were unable or unwilling to do.

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.710 position:56%
This is the sense of
statesmanship less strictly in terms

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:24.370 position:56%
of the position held than the impact
had on global peace and security.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.580
Twentieth century breakthroughs,
21st century lessons based

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:30.290
on these profiles, not
so much to point at this

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.050
or that leader floating
around the 21st century world.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:35.420
Indeed, if someone tried
to do that with many

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.940
of the 20th century profiles,
we would miss quite a few.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.450
But drawing lessons
for different areas,

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:44.910
for overcoming the difficulties,
maximizing the possibilities,

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.010
and achieving what is necessary.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.840
And when I think about
global peace and security,

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.670
it's a rather large subject.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:56.640 position:56%
To get a handle on it, I break it
down into five different dimensions,

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.600
and then I choose representative
cases for each of these areas,

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.790
by no means the claim
of being comprehensive.

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:06.940
Five dimensions are
major power geopolitics,

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:11.800
managing major power relations for
cooperation more than conflict;

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.720 position:56%
building international
institutions for conflict prevention

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.340
and collective action; fostering
reconciliation of peoples

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.890
who have been looked in conflicts
rooted in historical hatreds;

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:24.490
advancing freedom and
protecting human rights;

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:26.820
and promoting sustainability,
including poverty

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.940
and equality reduction,
environmental protection,

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.220
and global public health.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.170
As I said, I look at
representative examples.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:35.500
In fact, you know, maybe

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.900
when we publish we will
develop a social media game

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:44.200
of who people would nominate in
their own sort of set of leaders.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.650
But I choose at least leaders

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.940
that I think really represent
important breakthroughs.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.940
Okay, so who are they?

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.410
I'm going to run through
them really quickly,

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:55.160
and then I'll say a
little bit about each ones.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.880
Terms of major power
geopolitics, the two cases I focus

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.380
on are Henry Kissinger
and Zhou Enlai --

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:04.740
and I had this focus before I got
the Chair -- and the opening of --

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.110
between the United States and China

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:09.070
in the early 1970s,
and Mikhail Gorbachev.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:12.310
For building international
institutions,

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:14.940
little bit on Wilson actually
in a way that I didn't expect

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.630
to be talking about Wilson,
FDR, and particularly focus

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.840
on Dag Hammarskjold, the most
effective Secretary General

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.850
in the history of the
United Nations.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.420
And again, that was before knowing

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.540
that our Swedish colleagues
were coming.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.610
Reconciliation of peoples, the
cases here are Nelson Mandela,

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:37.450
Anwar Sadat, Yitzhak Rabin, and the
Northern Ireland Women for Peace,

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.830 position:56%
Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:43.160
Freedom and human rights --
and I'll go through each one,

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.700
explain the basis for
choosing them --

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.450
Gandhi, the founder of
Amnesty International,

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:50.280
a British lawyer named
Peter Benenson, Lech Walesa,

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.390
Vaclav Havel, Aung San Suu Kyi.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:56.550
And for sustainability
Gro Harlem Brundtland,

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.120
the former Prime Minister
of Norway, Al Gore

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.090
and the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change,

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:03.420
and the Gates Foundation.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:06.810
Let me give you a little bit of an
explanation of the choice for them

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.680
and a little bit of what
I see coming out of them.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.410
But I'm going to be very brief
in some of these remarks in order

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:17.860
to leave some time for
questions and discussion.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:23.480
The opening to China was
really Kissinger's best.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.530
It entailed realpolitik
strategizing,

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.400
or great power politics.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.150
It required the face-to-face
diplomacy

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.340
that his persona so well suited.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.380
It worked through back channels and
secret meetings as was his want.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.930
It maneuvered the superpower
triangle in ways

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.660
that reinforced Soviet
incentives for detente.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.470
Zhou Enlai was very
much the equal partner.

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.630
He was that extraordinary mix
of committed revolutionary,

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:47.400
pragmatic diplomat, and what
some would call the last mandarin

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.180
bureaucrat in the Confucian
tradition.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.160
Had Las Vegas bookies known

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.340
about the secret Kissinger-Zhou
meetings representing two countries

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.740
that have been enemies
for 20-plus years,

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.460
that regularly demonized one
another politically and culturally,

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:04.440
that had burning issues like U.S.
support for Taiwan and Chinese aid

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.250
to North Vietnam, no doubt the
betting odds would have been

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:08.870
on breakdown.

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:12.240
One of the keys was making
the transactional serve

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.770
the transformational.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.090
Compromising on issues
like Taiwan and Vietnam,

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.920
conscious of the larger strategic
stakes, recognizing that,

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.500 position:56%
as Zhou put it, "Only the settlement

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.610
of fundamental questions
first can lead

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:26.590
to the settlement of
other questions."

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:29.020
And I think that's a very
significant statement that relates

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.820
to any number of issues one
can think about today, U.S.

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:33.120
/Russia, U.S.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.420
/China, perhaps U.S.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.750
/Iran, only the settlement of
fundamental questions that can lead

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:39.580
to the settlement of
other questions.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:43.370
It's true there are other
players in this, President Nixon

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:45.740
and Chairman Mao were of
course also major players,

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.430
and they did get the opera.

00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:51.100
But Kissinger and Zhou were
the statecraft strategists.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:55.910
Gorbachev made the key decision
to bring the Cold War to an end.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:57.920
And while he gets the
bulk of the credit,

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.460
some also goes to Ronald Reagan.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.170
It wasn't as essentially equal
a role as Kissinger and Zhou,

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.890
so I do bring Reagan
into the analysis more

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:07.770
than some, less than others.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:10.650
I focus the profile
principally on Gorbachev.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:14.110
As bad as things were for the
Soviet Union, the Afghanistan War,

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:19.110
the economy, restiveness all over
Eastern Europe, it wasn't a given

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:21.560
that another Soviet leader
would have made the decisions

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:25.120
that Gorbachev did, thus
the statesmanship moneyball.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.780
While Gorbachev acknowledges
his own leadership failures,

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.390
as he says in his memoirs, quote,
"Looking back, on can see blemishes

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:35.570
and mistakes that could have
been avoided," and while he ended

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:39.270 position:56%
up eliminated from the Russian
political scene, his impact endured.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.570
The Cold War ended.

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:41.870
It ended peacefully.

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:44.320
And Vladimir Putin notwithstanding,
today's tensions are nothing

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.180
like the competition between
nuclear arms superpowers

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.870
with global ambitions
and competing ideologies

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:51.410
that largely define the world scene

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:52.920
for the second half
of the 20th century.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.560
So when you hear people
talking about the New Cold War,

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.440
I think what we're
seeing is a major power --

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.710
a classical major power competition

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.500
between the United
States and Russia.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:06.350
But we shouldn't forget what
the Cold War was really about.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.920
And so my argument is that
endured despite the current state

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.920
of relations.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.460
For a while, of course, it
seemed like the great game

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:18.210
of major politics might
be a thing of the past.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:20.530
Russian and American
leaders were embracing,

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:22.420
Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin.

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.330
Peering into each other's eyes
and getting a sense of his soul,

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:28.140
George W. Bush after his
first meeting with Putin.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.680
Declaring a reset to get
relations back on track,

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.860
Barrack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.390
The interweaving of China into
the global economy was supposed

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:37.690
to temper its rise.

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:40.520
The United States claimed to be
playing its leadership role in ways

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.550
that were in the interest of the
overall international community.

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:45.040
But again, it hasn't
worked out that way.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.220 position:56%
Russia has been more aggressive
than at any time since the Cold War;

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.950
China has been flexing
its muscles in Asia;

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:53.280
and the Bush Administration went
to war in Iraq over the opposition

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.440
of much of the world;
the expectation

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.470
that greeted Barrack Obama
that all will be fine

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:00.510
with a more multilateralist
American President was not met

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:04.250
in any enduring way over the
course of his presidency.

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.670
And what comes next
in the United States?

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:09.420
Separate conversation [chuckle].

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.250
But as we try to get U.S.

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:13.890 position:56%
/Russia/China relations on a better
track, there are a number of lessons

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:16.810
that I try to draw out from
the Kissinger/Zhou relationship

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.800
and the Gorbachev breakthrough.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.830 position:56%
Building international institutions,
when I was first thinking

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:27.150 position:56%
about the book I really had Wilson
very much in mind for the main focus

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:29.370
of international institutions,
you know, making the world safe

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.300
for democracy, international
cooperation through new League

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:35.190
of Nations, Wilsonianism as
an enduring school of thought.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:38.700 position:56%
But the more I dug into the reading,
much of which I actually did

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:42.860
at the Wilson Center on this
part, in research about Wilson,

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:46.350 position:56%
the more the limits of his
transformationalism became apparent.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:48.910
The standard view that Americans
were just bent on retreating

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:52.550
into isolationism after the Great
War is actually much too knee-jerk.

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:54.510
When you look at actually
the politics of the moment,

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.840
Wilson could have gotten
the Versailles Treaty

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.620 position:56%
and U.S. League membership ratified,

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:02.050
but he hugely mismanaged
the domestic politics.

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:03.350
And for all his high-mindedness,

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:06.290
the design of the League
was fundamentally flawed.

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:09.040
So it's the limits of Wilson's
transformational statesmanship

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:13.380
that's instructive and that I use
as sort of an initial mini-profile.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.310
FDR as the principle architect

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:17.840
of the U.N. succeeded
where Wilson didn't.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.180
While designing an international
institution is its own active

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.770
statesmanship, his untimely
death meant that he never got

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.070
to play a direct role in
bringing it to fruition.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:30.440
Had he lived, his imprint on the
U.N. may have been even greater.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.760
Another we'll-never-know
is whether FDR's musings

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.460
about resigning the presidency
and taking up the leadership

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.020 position:56%
of the U.N. would have come to pass.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:42.920
As things turned out, the first
U.N. Secretary General, Trygve Lie,

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.370
had such a difficult time in the
position that he left, calling it,

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:47.410
quote, "The most impossible
job in the world."

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:51.520
Lie's successor Dag Hammarskjold
would prove differently.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:56.610
And he more than any other
leader showed how impactful an

00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:00.210
international institution
the United Nations could be.

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:04.280
He made the position a genuine
leadership one, a secular pope,

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.910
as he and others called it,

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.510
and showed what the
U.N. could contribute

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:10.000
to building global
peace and security.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.470
This comes through
in his overall effort

00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:13.170
to strengthen the U.N.
institutionally,

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:16.350
guided by a conception of the
international public servant,

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:18.770
and especially in his handling
of three crises that I focus

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:23.090
on in the book, American/Korean War
POWs held by the People's Republic

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:28.640
of China in 1954, the
1956 Suez Crisis spurred

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.650
by the British/French/Israel
invasion of Egypt,

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:33.690
and the 1960-61 Congo Crisis.

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:37.650
At a time in which the world
needs a more effective U.N. --

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:39.490
other international
institutions as well,

00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:42.310 position:56%
but the U.N. having the most bearing
on global peace and security --

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:46.230
there is much to be learned
from someone who was eulogized

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:49.080
by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.
Adlai Stevenson as, quote,

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.800
"A brilliant mind, a brave
and compassionate spirit.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.290
I doubt if any living man has
done more to further the search

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:59.100 position:56%
for a world in which men solve their
problems by peaceful means and not

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.370
by force than this
gallant friend of us all."

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:04.830
The final part of this chapter lays
out what I call the job description

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:08.690
for a 21st century
Hammarskjoldian Secretary General.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:11.430
While this is not the only element
of making the U.N. more effective,

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:14.500
and while a more effective U.N.
is not the only international

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.850
institutional reform needed, a
more effective U.N. won't happen

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:21.410
without a Secretary General
with the statesmanship qualities

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:22.710
Hammarskjold had.

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:24.730
And without an effective U.N.,

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:27.800 position:56%
other international
institutional reforms won't suffice.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:31.220
So the way I'm doing this is I'm
writing a variety of offshoots.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.740
I'm writing an article this summer
for more of a policy journal

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:37.800
as we go into this search for
a new U.N. Secretary General

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.120
in which there is much emphasis
on gender and geography,

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:44.040
and appropriately, but making the
argument about why it's really

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.420
about the job description.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:49.940
And I'm going to do that with
a lot of pieces of this to sort

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.310
of get pieces out along
the way to the book.

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:54.460
But I think as we move
toward September

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:58.320
when I think this decision gets
made, there's enormous lessons

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:02.270
in the role that Hammarskjold
played.

00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:04.060
Mandela, of course,
is the iconic case

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:08.000
of reconciliation among peoples,
leading the fight to end apartheid

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.720
through peaceful means, and the
global icon that he embodied.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.410
The dignity with which he
endured his nearly three decades

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:17.190
as a political prisoner inspired
so many people around the world,

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.950
as well as in his own country.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.700
His commitment to reconciliation
fathered the rebirth

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.940
of his own nation and presented the
world with a very different model

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.660
from those seeking
retribution and revenge.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:32.390
His moral capacity to differentiate
between hatred of the system

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:35.290
and hatred of whites was
a statesmanship contrast

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:37.190
to the demagogic leaders
in so many other parts

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:41.040
of the world fomenting
identity-based killings.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.050
For Sadat, who had built is
career quite conventionally

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:47.220
through the Egyptian military and
was generally seen as a placeholder

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.330
until a stronger successor
to Gamal Abdel Nasser rose,

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:52.880
it was a long and surprising
journey.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.360
It ended with an assassin's
bullet, but before then along

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.330
with U.S. President Jimmy Carter

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:59.820
and Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin --

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.130
who again are prat of the story,
but not the crucial focus --

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:06.270
he forged the first piece
of Arab/Israeli peace.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.660
And so, too, with Rabin who had
been the top military commander

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.830
in the 1967 war that had
conquered the West Bank

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:15.780
and other Arab territories.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.680
And as Defense Minister during the
1987 Palestinian Intifada allegedly

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.580
[inaudible] of breaking bones,
became the Prime Minister

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:26.430
who in 1993 shook hands with
PLO leader Yasser Arafat

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.300
and signed a series of peace
agreements until he, too,

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:31.590
was struck down by an assassin.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:33.880
True, the pieces of peace
they laid were partial,

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.950
but without them there would be
even less chance of ever getting

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:40.950
to a full Israeli peace --
full Arab/Israeli peace.

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:43.950
And in the spirit of the
impact held, not just the --

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:47.750
impact had, not just position
held, I'm trying to bring in others

00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:51.900 position:56%
to demonstrate how in this
particular case of Northern Ireland,

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.540
Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:58.440 position:56%
who in 1976 founded the Northern
Ireland Women of Peace at the height

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.540
of the violence of the
troubles as everyday people

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:05.320
who in their own ways demonstrated
transformational statesmanship.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.740
The troubles had taken
the death toll

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:13.350
from about 16 in 1969
to 500 by 1972.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.850
And while there was never only
one factor, these two women

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:19.720
and the organization they formed
got a great deal of credit

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:25.770
for the steep decline to
111 in 1977, 82 in 1978,

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:27.720
and never reaching
those levels again.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.130
They inspired people
to speak up, stand up,

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:32.150
and turn out against the violence.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:33.710
They catalyzed outrage
from the people

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:35.610
in whose names the violence
was being perpetrated,

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:38.790
yet who were paying the price,
Protestants and Catholics together

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:41.110
to a greater extent
than ever before.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.260
Not a full resolution
of the conflict,

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.830
but a seminal breakthrough.

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:47.090
Indeed, George Mitchell,
the principle negotiator

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:50.420
of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement,
would later write the foreword

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.250
for a book about Corrigan
and Williams,

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:55.900 position:56%
recognizing their contribution to
what ultimately became the agreement

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.580
that he helped negotiate.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.050
These politics of identity,
which we were talking

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:03.190
about at the Holocaust
Museum this morning,

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:06.690
who I am versus who you are,
are even more prevalent today

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:07.990
than in the 20th century.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:10.110
They have been much
more the continuation

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.900
than the end of history.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.620
But history shapes,
it does not determine.

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:17.850 position:56%
When demagogic leaders --
political leaders intentionally fuel

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:21.290
identity-based conflicts, hatreds
become all the more visceral,

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:23.410
the killing wanted and massive.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:26.620
When statesmen like Sadat, Rabin,
and Mandela and everyday people

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:30.200
like Corrigan and Williams
provide more positive leadership,

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:32.160
reconciliation is possible.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:34.910
And I draw lessons here for our
era's identity-based conflicts

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:37.080
in the Middle East,
Africa, and elsewhere.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.610
In terms of freedom
and human rights --

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:42.180
and I'm going to run through this
quickly so we can have some time

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.520
to discuss -- if you think about
the 20th century freedom agenda,

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.680
there are three main elements.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:51.390
One was decolonization and
independence, and here I use Gandhi

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:54.240
as the principle profile for
his nationalism and passivism

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.180
that not only shaped India,
but resonated globally

00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:01.710
as the world transitioned from the
Imperial Age to Post-Colonialism.

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:04.840
It had democratization
both from communist rule

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.260
and Soviet imperial control.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.730
And here there is similarities
and contrasts between Walesa

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:11.770
and Vaclav Havel that
are very interesting.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:15.200
And also, by the way, in
the spirit of imperfections,

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:19.770
there are more positives about the
role of leaders of the Liberation,

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:22.210
and less so in terms of the
roles they played once they

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:23.510
became President.

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:27.880
And also democratization
in terms of freeing

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.530
from military [inaudible]
dictatorship.

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:33.550
And here I include Aung San Suu
Kyi for her courageous defiance

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:36.380
of the Burma military dictatorship.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.110
And again, this is an
absolutely fascinating case,

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:39.820
because those of you who have
been following Burma now know

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:43.180
that while she's played
this extraordinary role

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.400
in bringing back democracy to
Burma, there is this huge issue

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:51.340
of the Rohingya Muslim minority in
Burma which is -- there are 135 --

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:55.750
136 minorities in Burma,
135 are recognized.

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:57.590
They don't have other rights,
but the Rohingya are not even

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:01.110
yet granted status
as state citizens,

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:05.050
and they've been persecuted
by the previous governments.

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:10.100
And so the question of what her
policy would be remains uncertain.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.090
She is now Counselor,
quasi-President.

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:18.440 position:56%
And so far -- I mean, just this one
example that happened the other day,

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:21.910
the American Ambassador to Burma
made a statement of condolence

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:24.310
for these Rohingya families
that had drowned at sea

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:28.780
on these makeshift boats, simply a
condolence, and she called him in

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:32.420
and told him that he really
couldn't use that word,

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.270
because they were not a
recognized state minority.

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:37.350
So as I write the book I'm
trying to bring out the tensions

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:39.890
in these breakthroughs, and again,
away from the perfect people.

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:41.670
And you know, I've
got four or five --

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:44.020
I've got a few more months to
publication to see where this goes.

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:46.650
And the great debate is
whether or not she is sort

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:48.990
of doing a walk-before-you-run,
you know,

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:51.410
trying to keep the military
contained and will ultimately move

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:54.390
to this core set of values, or
whether her advocacy of freedom

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:57.350
and human rights really pertain
more to political prisoners.

00:41:57.350 --> 00:42:02.030
And the other profile is the
founder of Amnesty International,

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:04.050
a British lawyer named
Peter Benenson.

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:09.930
And I include them because Amnesty
International really launched the

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:11.510
contemporary human rights movement.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.770
Benenson himself was
a bit of an odd duck.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:16.520
He was actually kicked out of
Amnesty International about five

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.480
or six years after he founded it.

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.260
But I think it's very
important, and what I try to get

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:23.890
out here is this lead role
for social movements, NGOs,

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:27.490
and other unofficial groups,
which is increasingly a part

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:32.770
of our 21st century world that
we see even in the 20th century.

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:34.810
And here starting with
the Amnesty International,

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:37.310
which opened up the door to Human
Rights Watch, Humanity United,

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:41.200 position:56%
all these other groups that are very
much a part, I think, of the efforts

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:45.350
to make transformations on human
rights in the 21st century.

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:49.790
Last category is sustainable
development.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:52.740 position:56%
It was only in the late 20th century
that sustainability finally started

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.100
to be recognized as a priority.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.520 position:56%
Gro Harlem Brundtland, who is
three-time Prime Minister of Norway,

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.340
is really included
principally for her work

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:02.330
in the international arena first
as Chairwoman in the early --

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:05.370
in the 1980s for the World
Commission on Environment

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:08.330
and Development, which coined
the term sustainable development.

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:12.540
And then as Director General of the
WHO, the World Health Organization,

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:17.340
1998 to 2003, in which she sort
of rescued it from a period

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.010
of corruption and inefficacy
and brought it back --

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:23.540
something that hasn't that -- as
much continued by her successors.

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:27.990 position:56%
But one of the things she did was
he made health an integral component

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:30.920 position:56%
of four of the eight United
Nations millennium development goals

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.180
that had guided policy
from 2000 to 2015

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:37.940
for the overall global
antipoverty agenda.

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.980
And so I talk here,
too, about the role

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:44.090 position:56%
of another international
institution, and her particular role

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:47.870 position:56%
and the leadership that she provided
that I think was quite unique.

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:55.110
On the environment -- and as Jason
said, you know, transparency here,

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:58.850
I for many years worked in a
variety of capacities for Senator

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:00.850
and Vice President Al Gore as one
of his former policy advisors.

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:03.450
I did not work on climate change
other than when he first started

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:05.730
out being, asked to hold
up these giant posters

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:09.060
until he got his Apple
slideshow going.

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:12.840
But I think that Gore represents
an interesting case both

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.050
in his political successes
and failures,

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:18.540
with lessons from both
to be carried forward.

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:21.810
And I think I try to draw
those out, where he succeeded

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:25.170
in making it an issue, and where he
didn't during his political career,

00:44:25.170 --> 00:44:27.260
and then the career
that has come after.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.200
The IPCC is also included
both for its particular work

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.320
on global environmental issues
and as an example of the role

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:36.800
of multilateral independent
expert commissions.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.540
The Gates Foundation I
include for similar reasons

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.510
as the Amnesty International,
both for what it's done,

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:46.980 position:56%
but for this broader notion of
social entrepreneurship in this area

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:52.580
of sustainability as
playing a crucial role.

00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:54.510
It's also the case
that is with said back

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:58.220
in 2005 before our World Health
Organization meeting in Geneva,

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.270
a Swiss newspaper ran the headline,

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:02.970 position:56%
"The health of the world depends
more on Bill Gates than on the WHO."

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:06.230
Though in exaggeration, it
made a point about the role

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:09.000
of the Gates Foundation and
more broadly about NGO's

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.320
and social entrepreneurs
and issues of global health

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.810 position:56%
and other aspects of sustainability.

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:17.050
In his very powerful
book, <i>Collapse </i>,

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:19.050
how societies choose
to fail or succeed.

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.350
Jared Diamond poses
the star question

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:24.300
about how could a society
fail to have seen the dangers

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:25.910
that seem so clear in retrospect?

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:28.450
Then he talks about
Easter Island and others.

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:32.120
He also says, "Globalization makes
it impossible for modern societies

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.500
to collapse in isolation."

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:37.330
You know, so we think about
security, we put much emphasis duly

00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:41.420 position:56%
on things like weapons of mass
destruction and a variety of things.

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:44.240
But I think we also live in a
world in which climate change

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.060
and these other issues,
sustainability, are not something

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:48.880
out in the future, but
they're very much here today.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.790
There was an article in
the paper the other day;

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:53.430
it was called the "First climate
refugees in the United States."

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:56.270
And so I'm trying to
get at this issue

00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:57.660
as an increasingly important issue.

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:02.030
So I'm going to stop there,
hopefully giving you an overview

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:04.070
of the book and how I'm both
using the cases and trying

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:05.370
to draw out the profiles.

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:07.390
Let me just close by going back

00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:11.480
to John Kennedy's <i>Profiles
in Courage </i>.

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:14.530
It was about American politics,
not world affairs, U.S. Senators,

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:17.430
not world leaders, but in
rereading <i>Profiles in Courage </i>,

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:22.700
I was struck by the concern
that today, that is 1956 quote,

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.460
"The challenge of political
courage ludes --

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:26.600
looms larger than ever before.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:30.800
For our everyday life is becoming
so saturated," this is 1956,

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.530
"With a tremendous power
of mass communications.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:36.240
Our political life has become
so expensive, so mechanized

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.850
and so dominated by
professional politicians

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.760
and public relations men,
that the idealists who dream

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:45.940
of independent statesmanship is
rudely awakened by the necessities

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:49.120
of election and accomplishment."

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.050
Many say that if he thought it was
hard then, he should see what it's

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:54.500
like in our 21st Century media
environment with the logs

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:57.400
and the iPhone cameras and
social media, cable TV,

00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.280
multibillion dollar
political campaigns, etcetera.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:02.840
Indeed there's been spade
of books telling us, quote,

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.140
"Historical greatness

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.090
in the American presidency
has gone the way of the dodo."

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:09.360
It is quote, "The end of power
from boardrooms to battlefields

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:12.260
and churches to states, that
it's the end of leadership,

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:13.700
that we're just sending
in the global anarchy."

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:17.840
There's a little bit too much woe
is us-ism for my taste in this.

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:21.670
The problem of bold leadership has
always been there in every era,

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:25.430
in every area of societal life,
in every country internationally.

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:28.740
Transformational statesmanship
is difficult, we've seen that,

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.250
but it's possible we've
also seen that.

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:33.470
If we're to meet the challenges
of the global peace, security

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:37.790
and justice here in the 21st
Century, it is necessary.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:39.920
Standard statesmanship
just won't fill the bill;

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.080
it can't just be all transactional.

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.830
And my goal in this book is
to show what has been possible

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:48.330
when thought impossible in the
20th Century and to propose ideas

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:50.800
and strategies for our
current global agenda,

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.460
to help get from how the world
is to how it can and needs to be.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.260
Thanks very much.

[ Applause ]

So, Jason has a microphone
and welcome questions

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:09.890
and comments from anyone.

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:20.430
&gt;&gt; Let me first say that I find
it to be a very incredible,

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:25.290
interesting summing up
of very complex issues.

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:29.300 position:56%
I'm not from this spot of the world,
I'm from the Caribbean, so you know,

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:32.390
I studied in Netherlands, America,
but I'm from the Caribbean,

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:35.740
so I'm just saying that
so that you understand

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:38.180
where I'm coming from
too [inaudible].

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:44.090
You know, some of the people
you are summing up here, I mean,

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:46.080
they are big and important people.

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.590
You talk about Al Gore
and the IPCC, I mean,

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:51.040
I'm wondering about Jimmy
Carter and his -- his role.

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.340
I mean, he's played
a tremendous role.

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:54.780
I mean, to a certain extent,
I think an even more important

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.740 position:56%
than Al Gore, but be that as it may.

00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:02.330
And what I see is that
really much more kind

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:03.930
of radically leaders
from the third world.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:08.220
I'm talking -- I mean, this is a
huge problem, but what is happening

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:11.660 position:56%
in Cuba now, obviously, [inaudible]
or, I mean, whatever one might think

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:15.320
of as undertaking of trying to
come up with a different way

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.990 position:56%
to integrate the Caribbean in a much
more independent way [inaudible]

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:22.430
United States of America, right,
which I mean, what's happening

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:24.120
in Venezuela, what
happening Bolivia,

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.620
a lot of these different
places, it is run to ground.

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:28.590
In the Caribbean are
much more positive one,

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:31.380 position:56%
or maybe somewhat less controversial
[inaudible] to a certain extent,

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.660
still controversial would
be the leader of Jamaica.

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:40.010
Now, I forgot his name, in
1980's -- what's his name?

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:41.310
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:43.040
-- right, right, you know?

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.090
I was in Netherlands
there, I was a law student

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:47.870 position:56%
at university [inaudible] those
days and I remember going to England

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:50.260
and everybody would
come and hug me and say,

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:52.850
"You guys have the spokesman
for the Third World, right."

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:56.170
So, I was wondering, I mean, a lot
of this takes place in kind of,

00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:58.620
you know, liberal internationalism,
etcetera, etcetera.

00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:03.210
But what do you see of the other
attempts by other leaders, right,

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:04.800 position:56%
to as the world change and as the --

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:08.030
as the power in the world
clearly shifts away --

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:09.850
start to shift away from the
United States of America.

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:11.150
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jentleson: Right.

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:13.510
&gt;&gt; How do you see and potentially,

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:15.290
how do you see these
other leaders trying

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:17.150
to be transformation leaders
in this new [inaudible].

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:18.870
Thank you.

00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:21.400
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jentleson: So, I
think your comments point

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:22.700
to my -- two things I said.

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:26.170
One is I -- I, you know, I've tried
to choose representative examples

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:28.670
of each type, not necessarily
comprehensive.

00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:31.170 position:56%
And secondly, the great social media
game that can come out of this.

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:33.400
I've given a couple talks in
these other places and, you know,

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.470
people always have their
own lists and stuff.

00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:38.030
And, I mean, I can make
arguments about some

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:39.810
of the people you mentioned,
pros and cons,

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:41.350
you know, that sort of way.

00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:45.260
But I think -- but the last point
is what I really want to focus on,

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.860
which in the last chapter, you
know, I talk about the shifts.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:52.830
When you look at the 20th Century
and you look at breakthroughs

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:56.730
for global peace and security,
it tended to be very western

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:59.150
because of the nature
of the system in power.

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:01.680
I think what's interesting about
the 21st Century and I've written

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.560
on this in other places,
what I call the pluralization

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.570
of diplomacy, right.

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:11.720
Indeed even in my undergraduate
days at Cornell,

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:15.290
there was a great course called
astronomy for nonmajors taught

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:18.740
by a not -- a guy who wasn't
yet famous called Carl Sagan.

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:22.060
And so I always loved these
astronomy metaphors and if talked

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:26.050
about how to a certain
extent, the Cold War was a era

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:27.860
like [inaudible] era, you
know, [inaudible] had the earth

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:30.110
at the center and everything
revolved around it.

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:32.470
[Inaudible] the U.S. saw itself
at the center of that world,

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:34.770
ideologically, economically,
military.

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:37.940 position:56%
Copernican comes along many
centuries later and says, "Actually,

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:39.500
every planet has its own orbit

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.620
and there's something called
the sun in the middle."

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:43.670
I think the 21st Century
is a Copernican world,

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:45.210
you have many countries
that have a sense

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:48.110
of what their interest
priorities and choices are.

00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:52.890
And I think what we'll see, you
know, over the next decades is --

00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:55.820 position:56%
is more of these kind of initiatives
that broadly effect global peace

00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.200
and security coming
from nonwestern leaders.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.570
In fact, it's my hope.

00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:02.150
But, you know, empirically
looking at the 20th Century,

00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:03.540
it tends to tilt in that direction.

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:05.830
So, yeah I mean, there could be
plenty of discussions and debates

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:08.030
about choices and there's
some people, you know,

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:10.450
that I haven't included
because, you know, I'm under --

00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:11.790
you know, it's got to
be a certain length

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:13.640
for my publisher and everything.

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.510
But -- but that's really where
an interesting question is.

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:19.020
And part of my goal in writing
the book whether it's for people

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:22.290
in scholarly circles or people
in book clubs, you know,

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:23.640
to have these kind of discussions.

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.970
Who would you put in
those categories?

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:33.890
&gt;&gt; Hi, thank you so
much for your talk.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:35.920
So, I'm a history major,
so I probably have

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:39.890
like 20 different questions for
you, but I'll limit myself to one.

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:42.630
I really appreciated
that you ended talking

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:44.190
about climate change refugees.

00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:48.480
And one thing I was actually,
like a couple days ago,

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:52.920
just reading the UNHCR sort of
stipulations for how we should

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.360
like treat climate change refugees.

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:58.600
But then, it makes you
wonder, so all of those NGO's,

00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:05.100 position:56%
all of these things, like the UN and
human rights council, everything --

00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:09.140
to what extent do NGO's that
were created in the 20th Century,

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:14.560
now in the 21st Century, just
serve to sort of like benevolently

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:19.780
like sort of perpetuate the
status quo where the west is sort

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:23.100
of controlling things,
creating stipulations,

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.930
creating sort of our
definition for what rights are,

00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:29.930
for what is a refugee,
what isn't a refugee,

00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:33.010
how should they be
treated, etcetera.

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:37.120
And so, like I guess
with that considered,

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:41.730
like how is that then a
model for a more just world?

00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:43.030
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jentleson: Yeah, I
think -- I think, you know,

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:47.430
NGO's is a large category and when
I teach my course at the university

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:50.650
on globalization and governance,
I try to give the students

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:55.890
of a couple cases of NGO's as "bad
guys" and companies as good guys

00:53:55.890 --> 00:53:58.480 position:56%
because everybody, you know, usually
assumes the opposite of them.

00:53:58.480 --> 00:53:59.780
Just to sort of mix it up.

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:02.800
So, there's no question that
there's differences in NGO's.

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.660
The climate change
issue to me, you know,

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:07.740 position:56%
when I talked about the three C's
-- conducive conditions, constraints

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:11.620
and choices, it is
so ripe for some --

00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:14.550
various kinds of leadership
statesmanship.

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:16.880
I mean, here you have the
private sector, you know,

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:21.540
if you're an insurance company
and you own hotels on Miami Beach,

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:23.300
you know, you're actually
really beginning to think

00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:25.230
that climate change might
be a problem, right.

00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:28.550 position:56%
So there -- there's a shift from the
classical, and that's where I try

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:30.780
to talk about with
[inaudible] and Gore and the IPC

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:34.930
from the binary zero sum, you're
either for the economic or for not.

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:38.760
But it hasn't gone far enough --
I mean, even the Paris Agreement,

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:41.590
you know, is not really keeping up
with the pace of climate change.

00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:43.200
So -- so what I'm going
to, you know, try to say,

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.610
that you have a lot of
conditions there, you know --

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:49.460
you know, Pope Francis has spoken
to it now, that it's really ripe

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:51.390
because you have more
conducive conditions I think

00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:52.730
in fewer constraints.

00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:55.500
I know there are some people that
still deny that it's happening,

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.980
but that's another subject.

00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:58.720
But I'm just talking
about things happening

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.110 position:56%
and there are different issues here,
you know, if you're in Micronesia,

00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:04.170
you know, it -- I mean,
talk about climate refugee.

00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:06.820
So -- so, I guess I would say,
I'm not trying to glorify NGO,

00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:09.200
I'm trying to say how they're
part of the statesmanship mix

00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:13.070
in the 21st Century and then people
will make judgments and analysis

00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:15.450
about where they think
their playing, you know,

00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:18.360
[inaudible] a positive
role and we're not.

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:21.740
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:25.270
Firstly, just to say thank you so
much for your amazing insights.

00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:27.610
I very much look forward
to reading the book.

00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:32.290
I represent the European
Union, which is a set

00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:35.240
of [inaudible] institutions which
was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:38.540
in 2012 in recognition of six
decades of peace on a continent

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:40.300
that had had two fairly nasty wars

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:42.110
at the first half of
the 20th Century.

00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:43.920
That's the breakthrough.

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:46.270
The challenges we're
facing in the 21st Century,

00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:47.670
I think are fairly self-evident,

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:49.540
we don't need to talk
about them too much.

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:52.880
But just be really interested
in your assessment of the role

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:55.930
of the likes of Jean Monnet,
Robert Schuman, Konrad Adenauer.

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:59.360
And you can -- the list goes on
and on and on, but some of those.

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.950
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jentleson: Yeah,
I actually -- I've --

00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:05.970
I at one point had Monnet
and the whole group,

00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:07.520
Adenauer, Schuman in the book.

00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:10.550
And I've been wrestling with
that, actually I've done a lot

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:12.910
of the research on it and
I've been wrestling with it.

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:16.270
And I don't like to be too
newspapery, headliney, you know,

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:19.680
about [inaudible] refugees,
euro, etcetera.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.870
So I'm still wrestling with
that because I do believe it,

00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:24.110
because I tried to -- you know,
my own sense is that in --

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:26.760 position:56%
in the 21st Century world,
regional organizations are extremely

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:29.750
important, African Union has
been very important [inaudible]

00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:35.000 position:56%
in Africa, [inaudible] and Asia, and
that the EU is really the -- the --

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.040
yeah, I mean, you know,
blaze the trail.

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:40.920
And as you said, and we Americans
don't give enough attention to,

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.810
stopping major power wars after --

00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:45.450
over a century of them in Europe
was really a big deal, right.

00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:47.650
Whatever else is happening
-- so you're exactly right,

00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:51.210
I've been wrestling with that and
trying to decide whether or not

00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:54.600
to put it back in and say
the same kind of thing.

00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:57.570
Whatever else has happened since
then or happens in the future,

00:56:57.570 --> 00:56:58.870
this was really a big deal.

00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:01.150
So you -- you -- you
nailed me on that one

00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:03.100
and I'm still mulling it
over, hearing you raise

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:07.280 position:56%
that maybe be a reason to, you know,
try to put it back in, so yeah.

00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:09.650
&gt;&gt; Thank you, sir.

00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:13.030
Do you think that Detante,
if it would have continued,

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:16.420
could have had the same results
that Reagan got in the 80's,

00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:22.780
in terms of Soviet -- the
fall of the Soviet Union?

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:24.080
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jentleson: Do
I think what, I'm sorry?

00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:28.080
&gt;&gt; Do you think Detente, if it
would have continued in the 70's,

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:33.730
could've achieved the same results
that Reagan got in the 1980's?

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:38.460
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jentleson: I think
Detente collapsed before --

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:42.860
before Reagan's election, I
mean, I think Detente collapsed

00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:46.650
because of policies on both sides
and a whole variety of things.

00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:51.240
And I think that the, you know, on
the Soviet side and the U.S. side

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:55.920
and I think some ways
Detente was put together

00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:58.190 position:56%
that created expectations on both --

00:57:58.190 --> 00:58:00.960
on both sides that more had
been worked out than before.

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:05.610
I think that in the Gorbachev era,
there are many who argue that,

00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:08.300
you know, Gorbachev had no choice,

00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:09.840
it was all about Star
Wars, etcetera.

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:13.140
And I go into some detail
in the book, you know,

00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:16.110
making the case why there were
plenty of choices that he had.

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:17.480
They might not have
been good choices,

00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:18.780
but he had plenty of choices.

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.260
He could've, you know, sent
the military into Poland just

00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:26.000
like they did in Prague in
1968 and Hungary in 1956.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.620
And there were unusual aspects,
you know, of him as a leader.

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:34.490
And Reagan, second term Reagan,
much to the chagrin of some

00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:38.490
of his own hawks, you know,
developed this partnership,

00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:40.290
you know, with Gorbachev.

00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:43.350
And so there is some credit to be
given there even though, you know,

00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:46.480
on the liberal side people
don't always acknowledge that.

00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:49.340
Now there's a -- there's a,
sort of a hero worship of Reagan

00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:51.710
on the other side says it was all
about Reagan and if we hadn't,

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:54.630
you know, pushed them [inaudible]
have it, so I really do focus a lot

00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:56.780
on Gorbachev, but bring -- and
I bring de Klerk a little bit

00:58:56.780 --> 00:59:00.700
into the story of Mandela, but he
doesn't really in my, you know,

00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:03.330
my diplo-ball -- I make an argument

00:59:03.330 --> 00:59:05.820
that I think other South African
leaders would have made the same

00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:07.860
choices that de Klerk did.

00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:09.900
And -- and that Reagan wasn't

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:12.200
as unique whereas Gorbachev
and Mandela were unique.

00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:16.040
But I think Detente collapsed
for some of its own, you know,

00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:18.510
own internal problems
and contradictions.

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:24.250
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:59:24.250 --> 00:59:28.130
By 1980, between the, you know --

00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:30.470
you know, issues on
[inaudible] Afghanistan,

00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:34.100 position:56%
issues in the Third World where both
of us, you know, were still prepared

00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:37.260
to look for -- for unilateral
advantages in the Third World.

00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:44.540
Those were contradictions never
worked out by Detente, so.

00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:47.310
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much
for your wonderful talk.

00:59:47.310 --> 00:59:51.540
I wanted to ask a question
about a subset of your cases

00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:54.650
because when I think of
statesmanship, I think of statesman

00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:59.040
who hold the risk of the
survivability of their populations

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:05.590
at stake and the horrible choices
involved at -- on the cusp of war,

01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:07.830
for example, where they
have to risk everything.

01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:14.030
So FDR and Gorbachev, people who
rise above and take major risk

01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:18.520
and the consequences are so
huge, are almost a case apart.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.350
And I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit about what

01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:25.200
in your research has
come up about the --

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:28.490
the character of those
visionaries that allow them

01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:30.910
to overcome that huge hump.

01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:34.180
And when we look back at somebody
like Sir Edward Grey at the cusp

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:37.540
of World War I, in the July
crisis, he seemed to stall out.

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:41.820
And he could have been
there except for what?

01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:46.090
What are those character traits
in your view of the people

01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:48.100
who take the huge risks,
like the Gorbachev?

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:50.100
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jentleson: It's a
great -- it's a great question,

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:51.400
and I you know, in that --

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.250
it's a great question in
that who/why framework.

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:58.050
So I actually start with the
why part, I mean, you know,

01:00:58.050 --> 01:00:59.720
you see this progression
of a vision.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:02.410
I mean, Rabin is a good
example, right, here was somebody

01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:07.820
who was a general and who
came to the realization

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:10.980
that there was no guarantee that
peace would bring Israel security,

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:13.370
but Israel could have -- never
have security without peace.

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:15.390
And he got there through
experience --

01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:17.400
and so some of the
qualities that people have

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:22.000
like that Gorbachev had them too,
some others did, Mandela had it.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.650
I mean, really, you know,
we take it for granted,

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:25.300
27 years political
prisoner and you come

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:27.830
out thinking reconciliation, right.

01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:33.610
So there was an ability to have
a sense of society, you know,

01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:37.670
that understood the other side
was receptive in some ways

01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:39.030
to without totally accepting,

01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:41.100
but receptive to the
narrative of the other side.

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:48.960
A little bit of a flexibility of
mind and, you know, and so the --

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:53.920 position:56%
and sort of this -- this -- and then
this moral capital that gave them,

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.250
you know, the standing
to make the case.

01:01:56.250 --> 01:01:59.410
And when they didn't fully succeed
on that, you know, with the --

01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:03.740
particularly the symbolic
parts, you know,

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:06.230
like Gorbachev, it brings you down.

01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:08.440
And the political skills -- and
the political skills they try

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.430
to trace earlier in their careers,
you know, some of it is, you know,

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:14.620
the ability to build coalitions and
certain kinds of leadership skills.

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:18.580
So there's no one model, but
there's a general sense, you know,

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:21.660
you get into some of this
literature and it's almost

01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:22.960
like there's a template and sort

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:25.360
of the good news is we're not
waiting for the perfect person.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.260
If there were really opportunities
[inaudible] issues whether it's

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:32.080
climate change or others, for
all sorts of pp to step forward,

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.750
you know, so I mean, actually
I'm probably going to talk

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.080
about the Pope in the last chapter,

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.790
because what he's had is
a deeply held spiritually,

01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:42.360
but vision of commonality
in many respects, right.

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:45.230
And that can come from
a lot of places.

01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:49.200
And so that's really an important
quality, but you find this

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.720
in different combinations,
you know, sort of a --

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.630
there's not a rigidity of thinking.

01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:59.920
There's a certain receptivity
to, you know, new information

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.800
and there's an ability
to question your premises

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.760
when you see a need to
question a premises.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:08.340
And those are somewhat generic,
which is the good news I think,

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:10.820
you know, but they're not too
general, but they're somewhat,

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:13.620
you know, they're not -- they're
not the LaBron James or the Mozart,

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.490
you know, you find
somebody out there and,

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:17.410
you know, that's the person, so.

01:03:17.410 --> 01:03:20.210
&gt;&gt; Why don't we take one more.

01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:21.510
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jentleson: Okay.

01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:29.180
&gt;&gt; This man, gentleman
right here in the back.

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.440
&gt;&gt; You talk about global
peace and security,

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.490
but it seems to be your cases
are somewhat light on people

01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:37.380
who have done the simple thing,
the most obvious thing about peace

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.910
which is stop being
an armed conflict.

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:43.200
Is there any reason -- am I reading
that right, is there any reason

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:46.690
for that, that they're not
terribly well presented?

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:49.750
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jentleson: Well, you
know, the Northern Ireland case

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:53.620
in some ways tries to get at
that as an example of people who,

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:57.060
you know -- one was a secretary
at the Guinness Brewery, right,

01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.360
who were just everyday people

01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.720
and they had this personal
experience with it.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.510
And they, you know, sort of
woman in moment in that case,

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:05.240
they came out at a point where
Northern Ireland, you know,

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.920
had really sort of their hands up.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.580
Some ways the human rights
community, I think to the extent

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:10.880
that it's been involved in that.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:14.360 position:56%
They're probably some peace movement
ones, John, that I could think

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.890
of that might be interesting
to include.

01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:19.740
You know, we thought about
having sort of a appendix of lots

01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:22.450
of other cases that might bring
in, you know, without [inaudible].

01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:23.750
But I'd be interested
to talk with you more

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:25.350
about ones you might --
you might think about.

01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:27.650
I mean, you know, you could talk
about the Nuclear Freeze Movement

01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:31.730
of the 1980's, but -- but I don't
think it made its breakthrough,

01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:33.030
you know?

01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:34.330
&gt;&gt; But that didn't stop arm --

01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:36.890 position:56%
an armed conflict that tried to keep
them from happening, but that's a --

01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:38.190
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jentleson: Right.

01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:40.230
&gt;&gt; -- different issue than stopping
it, making peace in other words.

01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:42.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jentleson: Are you thinking
of any particular cases, or --

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.780
&gt;&gt; No.

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:45.080
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jentleson: Okay.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:46.380
We'll have to talk more.

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:47.680
&gt;&gt; Maybe it has something to
do with a category that --

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:48.980
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jentleson: Yeah, yeah.

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:50.280
I mean, I think I try to
get at the global peace --

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.580
I mean, there are many different
ways and at the beginning

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:52.880 position:56%
of the book I say -- I say there's a
little bit, you know, that this kind

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.560
of change, it's top down, middle
out and bottom up, you know,

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.250
there's the people power,
there's the [inaudible] square

01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:59.100
and there's the people power
that brought down Marcos

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:00.810
in the Philippines in the 1980's.

01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:04.210
And all of those are important
in global change, I'm just trying

01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:05.980
to focus on the particular
role of leaders

01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:07.530
without saying it's the
be all and the end all.

01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:09.870
And some of our political
science colleagues, of course,

01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:12.250
want me to get a larger
end and build a model

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:13.550
and do the regression analysis,

01:05:13.550 --> 01:05:15.290
but neither you nor I
go there in that, so.

01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:18.860
&gt;&gt; I think we'll stop there, so
please join me in thanking Bruce.

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:20.160
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jentleson:
Thanks very much.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.960
Thank you.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:27.070
