00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:04.537
Today, we are going to learn
about why comedy is funny,

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:08.907 align:start size:97% position:3%
and how to use humor to make
yourself rich and famous.

00:00:08.907 --> 00:00:10.710
(Brandon pops into existence)

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.544
- Whoa!

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:12.879
Are you Poppy?

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:13.913 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Welcome to my show

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.781 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I love you.

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:17.784
I'm going to be able to
write a hilarious bit

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.785
because of this
random situation.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:21.854 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Bits are my favorite
part about comedy,

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:24.123 align:start size:94% position:6%
because they're a perfect
way to tell jokes.

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:25.624
What's your best bit?

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:27.126
- Oh, my best bit?

00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:29.094
I have one about going to
a Justin Bieber concert,

00:00:29.094 --> 00:00:31.230 align:start size:84% position:16%
and he makes everyone
pray with him.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.099
- Justin Bieber is a celebrity,

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.067 align:start size:81% position:19%
and if you talk
about celebrities,

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:37.370
more people will
think you're funny.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.206
- Wow, I never really thought
about it like that, Poppy.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.241
I'm gonna tell more jokes
about famous celebrities,

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.477
and then I, too, will
be a famous celebrity.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:47.380 align:start size:97% position:3%
- The truth is, most
people have nothing to say.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.083 align:start position:0%
And because of that, most
people are unbelievably boring.

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:52.552
- Poppy, I love your videos,

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.820 align:start size:84% position:16%
because they make
my brain feel funny.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.155
- I love you, Brandon.

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:57.590
- I love you, too, Poppy.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.993
I love doing posts
and going viral.

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:01.261
- I love all of you.
