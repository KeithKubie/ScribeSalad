MATT PARKER: Okay, so, Lucas Numbers are named after a guy called Edward Lucas

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.320
Although, he was French, so 'Loo-cah', but I'm going to say 'Lu-cas' because I am lazy

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.440
And if it wasn't for Lucas, we wouldn't really care about Fibonacci, because Fibonacci did some things

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.560
he wrote those numbers down, didn't generalize them, didn't analyze them

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.470
He did introduce some interesting number systems to Europe, and he did some other cool bits and pieces

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.350
but these are more of a footnote to the story of his life

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.790
and Lucas went, "Hey, these are really
interesting", and he's the guy who promoted them

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.920
and he went with his own sequence which is better than the Fibbonacci Numbers

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.280
Then you think, okay, if Fibbonacci starts 1,1 what is our next option?

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.640
So Fibonacci starts 1, 1 and then it goes 2 and then 3 and then 5 and then 8 and then 13 and then onwards

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.680
Well, what if we start -- instead of starting 1, 1 what if we start 1, 2?

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.840
but we can't start 1, 2 because we're just starting here

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.920
All we've done is move along slightly and so we're going to get the same numbers if we start 1, 2

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.160
Lucas numbers, you start 2, 1 -- so you just swap them around and then you repeat exactly the same pattern

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.040
So 2 + 1 then gives us 3 and then we get 4 and then you get 7 and then you get 11 and 18

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.200
And these are the Lucas numbers!

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.320
And to my mind this sequence of numbers is far more interesting then the Fibonacci sequence of numbers,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.080
and these have a stronger link to the golden ratio

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.320
So if you take the golden ratio Φ (phi), which is equal to 1.61803398...

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.080
and then a 9, and so on

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.320
Okay, right, so we know for any of these sequences they're going to approach that ratio

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.560
But what if we start with the ratio, what if we want to take the ratio and then get a sequence of numbers?

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.560
So if you calculate Φ² --

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:57.200
Φ² = 2.6180..., which if you round to the nearest whole number is 3 (approximately)

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.200
Okay, so I'm going to do this column as rounding to the nearest whole number

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:09.960
if you do Φ³ -- Φ³ = 4.23606..., which if you round that to the nearest whole number is 4

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:17.840
Φ⁴ = 6.85410..., and rounded to the nearest whole number is 7

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.320
Φ⁵ -- and if I carry on and take each of these and round them to the the nearest whole number, what do I get?

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.960
Sure enough, these are the Lucas numbers appearing up here, and that will carry on all the way down

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.520
Every power of the golden ratio beyond the nearest whole number gives you the Lucas numbers

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.530
and so that's not the fact that the Fibonacci numbers are linked to the golden ratio

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.240
in a way that every other similar sequence is. If you start with the golden ratio and then take powers

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.800
-- is because what you're doing is multiplying each term by the golden ratio to get the next term

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.400
which is that wonderful property that everyone bangs on about

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.240
But these are the numbers it generates, if you start with that and then go to the sequence

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.520
and that's why I think the Lucas numbers are vastly superior

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.840
I've been very careful, I've never said Lucas sequence, which is a very good point,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.920
because Lucas sequence is, well, a family of other things.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.080
So Lucas did some amazing research into all the weird properties you get from these various sequences

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.040
and these numbers were just one specific example of a Lucas sequence

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.040
but they're the most common one and the most famous one, which is why they are called the Lucas numbers

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.680
but there are all sorts of amazing things you can do these numbers

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.069
You can -- everything from obviously wonderful ratios but you can use them to

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.989
test if a number is prime and, I mean, there is a whole amazing area of math

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.040
Lookup Lucas sequences, there is some incredible stuff in there

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.600
BRADY: One thing about this that strikes me though is

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.880
we often talk about how mathematics is very precise and perfect and this great thing

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.840
This sequence does match, but it only matches by kind of roughly rounding,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.040
and it seems like each time it kind of slightly misses the target

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.880
but it misses by such a small amount that it doesn't matter

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.760
This doesn't seem very much like a lot
of the other mathematics I see

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.349
it seems kind of a bit fuzzy and "almosty"

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:13.669
DR. PARKER: I think rounding -- people rain hate on rounding because you do it at primary school

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.590
and people view it as maths you did very early on, and very simple

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.760
and there's kind of a false --

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.909
People link mathematics with unnecessary precision

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.659
and they link mathematics with doing things that are pointless and over the top

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:35.019
and so, for some reason, one of the first things people would do when they're learning math at high school

00:04:35.019 --> 00:04:38.360
and want to look smart is write down an unnecessary number of decimal places

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.830
Right? because they think it's more maths-y -- the more numbers you write down, the more maths we're doing

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.910
and I think it's a shame, there are some amazing things that drop out of rounding

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.640
and so I think it's nice that the Lucas numbers

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.710
you do get these wonderfully precise answers out of the powers

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.750
then you round to the nearest whole number and that's where the beauty is, I like that.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:09.150

]MATT PARKER: 8,229 + 17,399 = 45,628

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.830
so I'll do it for a few of these and you can zip through it obviously

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.400
BRADY: So is this the Brady sequence?

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.210
This is the Brady sequence! We're going to call these the Brady numbers.
