00:00:04.067 --> 00:00:06.901
man: So welcome, Wade.
Welcome, Bob.

00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:09.067
I think we can start off,
and you can tell us a little bit

00:00:09.067 --> 00:00:11.067
about Large Animal
and what you're--

00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:13.067
what you've been showing off
here at Google I/O.

00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:14.734
Wade: Sure.
So Large Animal

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:17.601
is an independent game developer
and publisher.

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:20.234
We're based
out of New York City.

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:22.067
We've been in business
for eight years.

00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:25.067
We're always kind of focused
on casual online games,

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:29.234
and lately our focus
is on social-network games.

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:31.400
What we've been showing off here
is a game--

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.567
a game demo that we built
with O3D.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:37.234
So it's
a side-scrolling platformer

00:00:37.234 --> 00:00:39.400
in the tradition of, you know,
 &lt;i&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.567
and &lt;i&gt;Sonic&lt;/i&gt; and other platformers
like that.

00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:46.067
The bigger picture of the game

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:48.901
when it's finished and ready
to launch into the world

00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:51.767
is that it will be integrated
into social networks.

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:56.067
And every--every level
of this &lt;i&gt;Infinite Journey&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:56.067 --> 00:00:58.067
will be one that's been designed
and customized

00:00:58.067 --> 00:01:00.667
by one of your friends
on the social network.

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:02.234
So...
man: Very cool.

00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:04.234
So, Bob, I'm curious.

00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:05.901
You've been at I/O
for two days now.

00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:08.400
What kind of interesting
feedback and comments

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.567
have you gotten about the game,

00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:11.734
and what have you learned
here at I/O?

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:13.234
Bob: Yeah, a lot of people
are surprised

00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:14.801
it's playing in a browser.

00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:17.067
They'll ask us if--
well, if it was Unity

00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:19.901
or just other stuff.

00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:22.400
They're just amazed at
the graphics we're able to get

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.734
and the frame rates
we're able to get, so...

00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:25.734
man: Awesome.

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:27.067
Any new technologies,

00:01:27.067 --> 00:01:29.734
things you've heard about
just happenstance at I/O

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:31.567
that you're sort of thinking

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:33.234
about how you can use
in the future?

00:01:33.234 --> 00:01:35.901
Wade: Sure, sure. Well, I was
pretty psyched about Wave.

00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:37.067
And I think...

00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:38.734
I was just
immediately imagining

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:40.901
how we would use it
in the office to collaborate.

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:43.901
So that--you know,
that's pretty cool.

00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:48.067
We actually--we're putting
together a little blog,

00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:51.734
Large Animal blog,
just to put information

00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:53.734
about this
 &lt;i&gt;Infinite Journey&lt;/i&gt; project,

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:55.901
kind of concept art and video.

00:01:55.901 --> 00:01:58.901
And so at the keynote
on Wednesday,

00:01:58.901 --> 00:02:02.067
you know, they showed
the ability to just drop

00:02:02.067 --> 00:02:05.067
a little Friend Connect
chat window--

00:02:05.067 --> 00:02:06.234
copy and paste into it.

00:02:06.234 --> 00:02:07.901
So we did that on the blog.

00:02:07.901 --> 00:02:10.734
We put that on the blog,
and we're gonna release that

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:12.234
in the next week or so,

00:02:12.234 --> 00:02:13.901
just to kind of get
a conversation going

00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:16.901
with other developers
and get people's feedback, so...

00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:19.234
man: Very cool.
Wade: Excited about that.

00:02:19.234 --> 00:02:21.400
man: So I guess along
those lines, moving forward,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.234
so you're creating a blog
for the app.

00:02:24.234 --> 00:02:26.901
What else? What are the next
steps for Large Animal

00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:30.067
and the &lt;i&gt;Infinite Journey&lt;/i&gt;
in this space working with O3D?

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.100
Wade: Sure.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.567
Well, so the next step for us

00:02:32.567 --> 00:02:36.067
is to integrate it
with OpenSocial

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:40.734
so that we can put the game
into MySpace.

00:02:40.734 --> 00:02:42.567
We'll integrate
with the Facebook API,

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:45.901
put it into Facebook
and other OpenSocial containers

00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:47.234
so that, you know, we can do

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:50.567
the kind of Social Graph
connectivity that I mentioned.

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:54.567
And the business model would be
virtual goods within that world.

00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:56.400
So people could buy
special objects

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.567
that make their level
super special,

00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:00.167
that let them tag
their friends' levels

00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:02.234
as they're playing
through them,

00:03:02.234 --> 00:03:06.067
give them special abilities
within the world, so...

00:03:06.067 --> 00:03:09.067
And we're talking
with potential investors

00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:11.567
to help us raise the money to
undertake that bigger project,

00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:14.901
but we think with three or
four months of full-time work,

00:03:14.901 --> 00:03:18.400
we can do something amazing
that will really advance

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.901
the state
of social-network games.

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:22.400
man: All right.
Great.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.567
Well, it sounds like it's been
a great couple of days for you.

00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:26.734
Any parting words of wisdom

00:03:26.734 --> 00:03:30.567
or thoughts on I/O or O3D?

00:03:30.567 --> 00:03:32.567
Bob:
I/O's a great conference.

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:34.067
People should definitely come
out to it.

00:03:34.067 --> 00:03:35.901
You learn a lot of good stuff.
Wade: Thanks for the phone.

00:03:35.901 --> 00:03:38.734
[laughing]
Bob: Yeah.

00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:40.234
man: Probably getting that
a lot right now.

00:03:40.234 --> 00:03:41.901
Wade: Yeah, yeah.
man: All right, great.

00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:43.767
Well, thanks a lot, guys.
Wade: Thanks for having us.
