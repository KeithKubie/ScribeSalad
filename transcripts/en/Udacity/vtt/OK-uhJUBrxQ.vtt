00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.840
Third strategy is mediators. In mediator situation,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.420
a new implementation element is introduced for

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.480
each invariant. And it's called a Mediator. Each Mediator is responsible for

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.310
maintaining one invariant. And knows what the dependent components are.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.320
The independent event receiving component knows only that they

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.360
must inform the mediator, when their attributes change value. For example,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.270
when the Scrollbar is adjusted, it alerts the relevant Mediator. Which in turn,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.560
requests the new position from the Scrollbar. The Mediator realizes the new

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.320
content is required from the FileManager. Requests it, and pass it

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.580
to the ViewPort. That is each Mediator has knowledge and responsibility for

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.110
the maintain, maintenance of one invariant. And by the way, Mediator is

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.300
an example of a design pattern. Which we will explore later in the course.
