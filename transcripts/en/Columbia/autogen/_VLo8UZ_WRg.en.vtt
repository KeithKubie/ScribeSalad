during which time the you know I

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640
couldn't tell if anybody was listening
 

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:23.220
couldn't tell if anybody was listening
or not but it was quiet at least because

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:29.710
event I gave my little speech and my
 

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:34.049
event I gave my little speech and my
little speech basically said that this

00:32:34.049 --> 00:32:34.059
little speech basically said that this
 

00:32:34.059 --> 00:32:37.440
little speech basically said that this
would not just be a bad idea that this

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:37.450
would not just be a bad idea that this
 

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:39.630
would not just be a bad idea that this
would be a catastrophe and it would be a

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:39.640
would be a catastrophe and it would be a
 

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:45.240
would be a catastrophe and it would be a
catastrophe of such magnitude that the

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:45.250
catastrophe of such magnitude that the
 

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:48.120
catastrophe of such magnitude that the
United States would be infinitely worse

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:48.130
United States would be infinitely worse
 

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:50.640
United States would be infinitely worse

off than it is than it was at that time
 

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:56.659
off than it is than it was at that time
and that any regime any US government

00:32:56.659 --> 00:32:56.669
and that any regime any US government
 

00:32:56.669 --> 00:32:59.340
and that any regime any US government
regardless of who was in it and at that

00:32:59.340 --> 00:32:59.350
regardless of who was in it and at that
 

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:01.680
regardless of who was in it and at that
point you will recall it was really

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:01.690
point you will recall it was really
 

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:04.039

that they would look at the evidence

00:33:09.149 --> 00:33:09.159

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.039
they would look at the circumstances
which were quite well known they were

00:33:14.039 --> 00:33:14.049
which were quite well known they were
 

00:33:14.049 --> 00:33:15.450

not hard to figure

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:15.460
not hard to figure
 

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.789
not hard to figure
and they would come to the conclusion

00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:17.799
and they would come to the conclusion
 

00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:19.680
and they would come to the conclusion
that they would only make things worse

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:19.690
that they would only make things worse
 

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:21.269

there probably wouldn't be a war with
 

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:46.320
there probably wouldn't be a war with
Iran and this was all focused on just

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:46.330
Iran and this was all focused on just
 

00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:50.270
Iran and this was all focused on just
one year just the year ahead up I I

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280
one year just the year ahead up I I
 

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:54.240
one year just the year ahead up I I
mentioned this because I have continued

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:54.250
mentioned this because I have continued
 

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.730
mentioned this because I have continued
to take that view ever since that time

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:56.740
to take that view ever since that time
 

00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:02.310
to take that view ever since that time
and my personal view at this point is

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320
and my personal view at this point is
 

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.240
and my personal view at this point is
that if it really because a lot of

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:06.250
that if it really because a lot of
 

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:08.970
that if it really because a lot of
people thought in 2006 that Bush was

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:08.980
people thought in 2006 that Bush was
 

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.010
people thought in 2006 that Bush was
crazy and that certainly Cheney and

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:11.020
crazy and that certainly Cheney and
 

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:13.500
crazy and that certainly Cheney and
Rumsfeld were crazy and that that

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:13.510
Rumsfeld were crazy and that that
 

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:15.630
Rumsfeld were crazy and that that
rationality would have nothing to do

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640
rationality would have nothing to do
 

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.190
rationality would have nothing to do
with their decision that it was all

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200
with their decision that it was all
 

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:23.370
with their decision that it was all
ideology today I think you can say with

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:23.380
ideology today I think you can say with
 

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.670
ideology today I think you can say with
some conviction that the administration

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:26.680
some conviction that the administration
 

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.980
some conviction that the administration
in Washington may be wrong about things

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:28.990
in Washington may be wrong about things
 

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:31.410
in Washington may be wrong about things
but it's not crazy and that it is not

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:31.420
but it's not crazy and that it is not
 

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.930
but it's not crazy and that it is not
going to behave in a totally irrational

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:33.940
going to behave in a totally irrational
 

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:38.340
going to behave in a totally irrational
way so my own view right now is that

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:38.350
way so my own view right now is that
 

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:40.320
way so my own view right now is that
we're not going to have a war with Iran

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:40.330
we're not going to have a war with Iran
 

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:43.080
we're not going to have a war with Iran
and we're not going to have one with

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:43.090
and we're not going to have one with
 

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:45.359
and we're not going to have one with
Israel is not going to lead a war and

00:35:45.359 --> 00:35:45.369
Israel is not going to lead a war and
 

00:35:45.369 --> 00:35:47.460
Israel is not going to lead a war and
we're not going to be involved in it so

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:47.470
we're not going to be involved in it so
 

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:52.410
we're not going to be involved in it so

forward very much to the questions
 

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.590
forward very much to the questions
because I think they're going to be

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:13.600
because I think they're going to be
 

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.780
because I think they're going to be
really terrific and I'll step back and

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:15.790
really terrific and I'll step back and

question as to whether an Israeli attack
 

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:48.060
question as to whether an Israeli attack
on Iran that the US did not have

on Iran that the US did not have
 

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:51.300

in Tehran as being an attack by the

United States and he said yes and it was
very very forceful that I said yes

very very forceful that I said yes
 

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:02.670
very very forceful that I said yes
absolutely it would because the Iranians

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:02.680
absolutely it would because the Iranians
 

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:07.859
absolutely it would because the Iranians
do not believe that Israel can stage an

don't think it's an impossibility
I just am Not sure that the Iranians

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:26.910
I just am Not sure that the Iranians
 

00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:29.640
I just am Not sure that the Iranians
would agree that it is a that it is a

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:29.650
would agree that it is a that it is a
 

00:56:29.650 --> 00:56:30.359
would agree that it is a that it is a
possibility

00:56:30.359 --> 00:56:30.369
possibility
 

00:56:30.369 --> 00:56:33.180
possibility
could I just add one point to that and

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:33.190
could I just add one point to that and
 

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:35.880
could I just add one point to that and
that is that if Israel decides to act on

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:35.890
that is that if Israel decides to act on
 

00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:37.650
that is that if Israel decides to act on
its own and everybody is really worried

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:37.660
its own and everybody is really worried
 

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:41.760
its own and everybody is really worried
about that they are facing a real

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:41.770
about that they are facing a real
 

00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:46.220
about that they are facing a real
existential crisis because their real

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:46.230
existential crisis because their real
 

00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:50.160
existential crisis because their real
existence is determined and is supported

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:50.170
existence is determined and is supported
 

00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:53.510

by the United States and if they risk

by the United States and if they risk
 

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:57.359
by the United States and if they risk
giving up that break that bond

00:56:57.359 --> 00:56:57.369
giving up that break that bond
 

00:56:57.369 --> 00:56:59.730
giving up that break that bond
with the United States it might or it

Israel and I knew that that was one of
the potential costs that would go with

one reason for that is something that
others have have pointed to and that is

others have have pointed to and that is
 

01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:56.599
others have have pointed to and that is

Israel my question is it seems like it's
 

01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:43.309
Israel my question is it seems like it's
kind of easy to belittle the the threat

01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319
kind of easy to belittle the the threat
 

01:05:43.319 --> 01:05:46.270
kind of easy to belittle the the threat
when you're thinking only of a doom days

01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:46.280
when you're thinking only of a doom days
 

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:51.109
when you're thinking only of a doom days
scenario but then you mentioned that

01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119
scenario but then you mentioned that
 

01:05:51.119 --> 01:05:55.160
scenario but then you mentioned that
Arabs I think also Israelis are afraid

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:55.170
Arabs I think also Israelis are afraid
 

01:05:55.170 --> 01:05:58.089
Arabs I think also Israelis are afraid
of an arms race and a nuclear arms race

01:05:58.089 --> 01:05:58.099
of an arms race and a nuclear arms race
 

01:05:58.099 --> 01:06:02.180
of an arms race and a nuclear arms race
and then even before that you could

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:02.190
and then even before that you could
 

01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:04.730
and then even before that you could
expect terrorist organizations to be

01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:04.740
expect terrorist organizations to be
 

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:08.809
expect terrorist organizations to be
emboldened by a nuclear Iran and even

01:06:08.809 --> 01:06:08.819
emboldened by a nuclear Iran and even
 

01:06:08.819 --> 01:06:11.240
emboldened by a nuclear Iran and even
before that I think you see already now

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:11.250
before that I think you see already now
 

01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:16.280
before that I think you see already now
that with huge arms deal between Saudi

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:16.290
that with huge arms deal between Saudi
 

01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:17.710
that with huge arms deal between Saudi
Arabia and the

01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:17.720
Arabia and the
 

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:22.720
Arabia and the
and responding to that a huge Israeli

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:22.730
and responding to that a huge Israeli
 

01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:26.980
and responding to that a huge Israeli
deal with the US that it's very likely

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:26.990
deal with the US that it's very likely
 

01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:28.870
deal with the US that it's very likely
that it wouldn't have taken place

01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880
that it wouldn't have taken place
 

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:33.279
that it wouldn't have taken place
otherwise I'm just wondering what do you

01:06:33.279 --> 01:06:33.289
otherwise I'm just wondering what do you
 

01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:35.140
otherwise I'm just wondering what do you
think about the threat when you look at

01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:35.150
think about the threat when you look at
 

01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:39.970
think about the threat when you look at
it that way thank you could I just say

01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:39.980
it that way thank you could I just say
 

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:45.069
it that way thank you could I just say
that I I really do understand why people

01:06:45.069 --> 01:06:45.079
that I I really do understand why people
 

01:06:45.079 --> 01:06:48.309
that I I really do understand why people
in Israel are concerned about Iran I

01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319
in Israel are concerned about Iran I
 

01:06:48.319 --> 01:06:50.020
in Israel are concerned about Iran I
think they have every reason to be

01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:50.030
think they have every reason to be
 

01:06:50.030 --> 01:06:52.329
think they have every reason to be
concerned not only because of the

01:06:52.329 --> 01:06:52.339
concerned not only because of the
 

01:06:52.339 --> 01:06:54.670
concerned not only because of the
nuclear threat which i think is really a

01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:54.680
nuclear threat which i think is really a
 

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:58.750
nuclear threat which i think is really a
sort of false flag I think really the

01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:58.760
sort of false flag I think really the
 

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.279
sort of false flag I think really the
danger is more likely to come from

01:07:00.279 --> 01:07:00.289
danger is more likely to come from
 

01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:03.430
danger is more likely to come from
Hezbollah or from Hamas or or from some

01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440
Hezbollah or from Hamas or or from some
 

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:06.630
Hezbollah or from Hamas or or from some
other regional source rather than

01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640
other regional source rather than
 

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.279
other regional source rather than
suddenly an Iranian missile arriving

01:07:09.279 --> 01:07:09.289
suddenly an Iranian missile arriving
 

01:07:09.289 --> 01:07:11.109
suddenly an Iranian missile arriving
with a nuclear weapon on it when they

01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119
with a nuclear weapon on it when they
 

01:07:11.119 --> 01:07:12.339
with a nuclear weapon on it when they
don't have the missiles and they don't

01:07:12.339 --> 01:07:12.349
don't have the missiles and they don't
 

01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:14.289
don't have the missiles and they don't
have nuclear weapons that will fit on

01:07:14.289 --> 01:07:14.299
have nuclear weapons that will fit on
 

01:07:14.299 --> 01:07:16.180
have nuclear weapons that will fit on
them it did this and won't have for a

01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:16.190
them it did this and won't have for a
 

01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:19.599
them it did this and won't have for a
very long time but the threat is real

01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:19.609
very long time but the threat is real
 

01:07:19.609 --> 01:07:22.000
very long time but the threat is real
and there's another way to look at it

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:22.010
and there's another way to look at it
 

01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:24.490
and there's another way to look at it
too and that is and mostly people don't

01:07:24.490 --> 01:07:24.500
too and that is and mostly people don't
 

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:27.279
too and that is and mostly people don't
look at it this way that Israel and Iran

01:07:27.279 --> 01:07:27.289
look at it this way that Israel and Iran
 

01:07:27.289 --> 01:07:31.620
look at it this way that Israel and Iran
are in fact locked in a competition for

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:31.630
are in fact locked in a competition for
 

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:36.519
are in fact locked in a competition for
influence in the Middle East most people

01:07:36.519 --> 01:07:36.529
influence in the Middle East most people
 

01:07:36.529 --> 01:07:39.069
influence in the Middle East most people
don't think of it in that sense but in

01:07:39.069 --> 01:07:39.079
don't think of it in that sense but in
 

01:07:39.079 --> 01:07:42.220
don't think of it in that sense but in
fact if you why would you be concerned

01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:42.230
fact if you why would you be concerned
 

01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:44.200
fact if you why would you be concerned
if you earnest really just about the

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:44.210
if you earnest really just about the
 

01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:46.089
if you earnest really just about the
nuclear side yeah if there's an

01:07:46.089 --> 01:07:46.099
nuclear side yeah if there's an
 

01:07:46.099 --> 01:07:49.720
nuclear side yeah if there's an
expansion of other nuclear powers in the

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:49.730
expansion of other nuclear powers in the
 

01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:52.950
expansion of other nuclear powers in the
region but really it gives Iran a

01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960
region but really it gives Iran a
 

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.930
region but really it gives Iran a
leverage that makes it more influential

01:07:55.930 --> 01:07:55.940
leverage that makes it more influential
 

01:07:55.940 --> 01:08:00.130
leverage that makes it more influential
in the region and equal in some respects

01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:00.140
in the region and equal in some respects
 

01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:02.170
in the region and equal in some respects
to Israel which is presently the only

01:08:02.170 --> 01:08:02.180
to Israel which is presently the only
 

01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:05.769
to Israel which is presently the only
nuclear power in the region so that

01:08:05.769 --> 01:08:05.779
nuclear power in the region so that
 

01:08:05.779 --> 01:08:09.190
nuclear power in the region so that
unique position is broken down plus if

01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200
unique position is broken down plus if
 

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:12.700
unique position is broken down plus if
you assume that the way Iran does a deal

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:12.710
you assume that the way Iran does a deal
 

01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:15.609
you assume that the way Iran does a deal
is some kind of a deal with the United

01:08:15.609 --> 01:08:15.619
is some kind of a deal with the United
 

01:08:15.619 --> 01:08:17.829
is some kind of a deal with the United
States because I think that's what

01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:17.839
States because I think that's what
 

01:08:17.839 --> 01:08:22.150
States because I think that's what
everybody is talking about that is scary

01:08:22.150 --> 01:08:22.160
everybody is talking about that is scary
 

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:24.550
everybody is talking about that is scary
not just to Israelis but it's scary to

01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560
not just to Israelis but it's scary to
 

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.650
not just to Israelis but it's scary to
the Arabs too because they remember the

01:08:26.650 --> 01:08:26.660
the Arabs too because they remember the
 

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:29.019
the Arabs too because they remember the
days of the xiong and the United States

01:08:29.019 --> 01:08:29.029
days of the xiong and the United States
 

01:08:29.029 --> 01:08:30.849

some of the sanctions and things began
to move in a slightly different

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:28.190
to move in a slightly different
 

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:28.959

direction
that's actually a very big order but

01:10:32.109 --> 01:10:32.119
that's actually a very big order but
 

01:10:32.119 --> 01:10:33.100
that's actually a very big order but
it's not impossible

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:33.110

my guess is Israel and the Arabs would

01:10:37.209 --> 01:10:37.219
my guess is Israel and the Arabs would
 

01:10:37.219 --> 01:10:39.310
my guess is Israel and the Arabs would
survive that shock

01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:39.320
survive that shock
 

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.649
survive that shock

they would find a way to live with it
and they would find that it was not the

and they would find that it was not the
 

01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:48.100
and they would find that it was not the
worst of all possible worlds and so from

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:48.110
worst of all possible worlds and so from
 

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:51.189
worst of all possible worlds and so from
my point of view as an American who

01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199
my point of view as an American who
 

01:10:51.199 --> 01:10:54.729
my point of view as an American who
would like to see a different set of

would like to see a different set of
 

01:10:54.739 --> 01:10:56.740
would like to see a different set of
policies where war is not the only

01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:56.750
policies where war is not the only
 

01:10:56.750 --> 01:11:01.510
policies where war is not the only
answer to our dilemma that seems to me a

01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520
answer to our dilemma that seems to me a
 

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.970
answer to our dilemma that seems to me a
way out but it's more a diplomatic way

01:11:03.970 --> 01:11:03.980
way out but it's more a diplomatic way
 

01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:07.240

out than it is a war-making way out and

out than it is a war-making way out and
 

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:09.850
out than it is a war-making way out and

01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.260
would it changed the balance of power
 

01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:57.319
would it changed the balance of power
and what would be the consequences of

01:21:57.319 --> 01:21:57.329
and what would be the consequences of
 

01:21:57.329 --> 01:21:58.009
and what would be the consequences of
such a change

01:21:58.009 --> 01:21:58.019
such a change
 

01:21:58.019 --> 01:22:09.469
such a change
I agree actually with with Richard in

that there's going to be an unbridled

arms race in the Middle East I think is
 

01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:19.160
arms race in the Middle East I think is
not as likely there's a lot of pundits

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:19.170
not as likely there's a lot of pundits
 

01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:22.879

to changes so if Iran gets a nuclear

01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639
to changes so if Iran gets a nuclear
 

01:22:26.639 --> 01:22:28.699
to changes so if Iran gets a nuclear
weapon which I frankly don't think is

01:22:28.699 --> 01:22:28.709
weapon which I frankly don't think is
 

01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:30.199
weapon which I frankly don't think is
likely certainly not in the next five

01:22:30.199 --> 01:22:30.209
likely certainly not in the next five
 

01:22:30.209 --> 01:22:32.899
likely certainly not in the next five
years if they get a nuclear weapon in

01:22:32.899 --> 01:22:32.909
years if they get a nuclear weapon in
 

01:22:32.909 --> 01:22:36.830

the next 10 my guess is as that

01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840
the next 10 my guess is as that
 

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.600
the next 10 my guess is as that
countries in the region will adjust to

01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:38.610
countries in the region will adjust to
 

01:22:38.610 --> 01:22:39.890
countries in the region will adjust to

some of them might decide that the only
 

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:44.000
some of them might decide that the only
answer to this is to go ahead and

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:44.010
answer to this is to go ahead and
 

01:22:44.010 --> 01:22:46.669
answer to this is to go ahead and
develop a nuclear weapon of their own it

01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679
develop a nuclear weapon of their own it
 

01:22:46.679 --> 01:22:48.620
develop a nuclear weapon of their own it
seems to me we're putting some things in

01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:48.630
seems to me we're putting some things in
 

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:51.890
seems to me we're putting some things in
place that try to see that that doesn't

01:22:51.890 --> 01:22:51.900
place that try to see that that doesn't
 

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:55.189
place that try to see that that doesn't
happen that for instance the UAE now is

01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199

in a major way but it's going to be
 

01:22:59.789 --> 01:23:01.270
in a major way but it's going to be
peaceful nuclear power and they have

01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280
peaceful nuclear power and they have

peaceful nuclear power and they have
they have actually signed very very

01:23:04.399 --> 01:23:04.409
they have actually signed very very
 

01:23:04.409 --> 01:23:07.189
they have actually signed very very
stringent regulations about how their

would rely more on the United States for

01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280
would rely more on the United States for
 

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:24.799
would rely more on the United States for

they know they can't rely on themselves
 

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:29.600
they know they can't rely on themselves
and they would look more to us to do it

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:29.610
and they would look more to us to do it
 

01:23:29.610 --> 01:23:32.750
and they would look more to us to do it

and you can look on that as being a

terrible thing on the other hand it
would probably mean that our influence

01:23:36.739 --> 01:23:36.749
would probably mean that our influence
 

01:23:36.749 --> 01:23:38.509
would probably mean that our influence
in the region would go up substantially

01:23:38.509 --> 01:23:38.519
in the region would go up substantially
 

01:23:38.519 --> 01:23:41.000
in the region would go up substantially

Arab states so these are really
 

01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:45.649
Arab states so these are really
complicated questions and anytime you

2003 war especially and compare that
 

01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:37.980
2003 war especially and compare that
with potentially potential game that may
