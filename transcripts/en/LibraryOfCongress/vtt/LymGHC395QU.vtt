00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.760
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation:
Welcome back to Rare Books

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.060
and Special Collections Division.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.360
I'm Mark Dimunation.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.660
I'm chief of the division here.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.630
You're in for a real treat today.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.300
We're very excited to have Valerie
Lester here who will be speaking

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.830
on her biography of Bodoni, the
first in the English language yes?

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.130
&gt;&gt; Valerie Lester: Yes.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.430
Yes.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.730
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Yes.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.060
You will find some very
interesting things about Bodoni

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.650
who is the creator for
those of you who don't live

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.340
in my world of 18 century typeface.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.350
Perhaps one of the most
elegant typefaces developed

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.890
but there's many interesting
parallels between Bodoni

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.440
and the biography and
the biographer.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.660
Bodoni's font is among other
things noted for high contrasts

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.290
between thins and thicks and
thick and black and very narrow

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.860 position:56%
and certain moments in reading this
type it creates what's called dazzle

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.260
which is a vibration that's caused
by the relationship between thin

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.330
and thick and Bodoni's life
itself is full as we have learned

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.210
in the biography of something
far more than you would imagine

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.780
of a typographer full of dazzle and
highs and lows and thicks and thins

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.470
and so you'll have the experience
of learning them and hearing

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.320
about that today from Valerie
Lester whose own experience

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.820
as a biographer parallels
this kind of experience

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.700
that Bodoni's type has created for
us which is a lot of dazzle coming

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.170
from Italian later in life yes,
in order to conduct this biography

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.470
and she also comes

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.340
from a perspective a little
outside our field which means

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.570
that it's opened up to receive
Bodoni as a full-fledged,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.560
fleshed-out individual and not
merely a typographer but somebody

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.700
who lived life with
a good deal of gusto.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.600
So we're very thrilled
to have her here.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.310
This is an important book.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.020
She's been on a book tour already

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.060
and this is already quite a
phenomenon but before she gets

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.880
up to speak I thought we can't have
such an elevated individual here

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.870
without at least telling
a few stories about her

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.170
so I've asked Stan Nelson
to actually introduce her

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.760
so Stan would you come on up?

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.060
&gt;&gt; Stan Nelson: This is impromptu.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.210
I didn't plan on this.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.650
Valerie contacted me with questions
about the process of punch cutting

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.530
and it became very evident
that it would be just best

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.430
to have her come visit me
so she journeyed to the wild

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.840
and wonderful West Virginia and
joined me in my studio for a couple

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.950
of days and we were cutting
punches and she got her hands dirty

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.710
and learned something really
real about this process

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.870
of shaping letters in steel
and I think as a result began

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.840
to understand just what an
incredible accomplishment

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.700
that Bodoni had achieved his
life with all of the vast variety

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.750
of typefaces that were produced.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.220
And I of course, I had a
wonderful time working with Valerie

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.170 position:56%
and I was pretty impressed with her
ability to absorb all this material.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.750
She was carrying with her when she
arrived several wonderful books

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.050
in Italian and it was very
evident as we looked at those

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.660
that the problem has been that
this material was not available

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.960
in English.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.170 position:56%
The Italian's had produced wonderful
books about Bodoni but not books

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.220
that I could really appreciate
other than look at the pictures.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.120 position:56%
I understand better my grandchildren
looking at books and going oh

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.620
and not getting the text.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.390
So you're going to have a
very enjoyable time hearing

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.190
about this project and
what she's accomplished.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.000
It's a really remarkable
achievement.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.800
&gt;&gt; Valerie Lester: Thank you.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.580
[ Applause ]

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.990
Thank you Mark for having me here.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.640
Thank you Stan for introducing
me and for your hospitality

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.260
and thank you all for coming.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.520
This is great.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.750
Bodoni, all right.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.860
Born in Saluzzo in Piemonte
which is Northwest Italy in 1740.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:25.180 position:56%
He apprenticed in Rome and then he
spent his professional life in Parma

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.370
which is in north central Italy.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.490
This is a town in which he was
born and it's absolutely gorgeous.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.810
It's off the beaten path
and if you walk up any

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.180
of the narrow little streets
you'll see this massive mountain

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.540
which is called Monte Viso.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.610
It's the highest mountain
in the Cottian Alps

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.790
and it has three sources
of the River Po.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.000
They join together as they
come off the mountain.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.730
They go through Saluzzo and
then the mighty Po makes its way

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:09.240 position:56%
across the entire north of Italy and
eventually mouths into the Adriatic.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.940
This is the house in which he
was born and any speak Italian?

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.750
Well, if you did you
would understand

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:25.320 position:56%
that it is now a dry cleaners, a dry
cleaning and dying establishment.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.800
The plaque on the wall here
tells you that his date

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.580
of birth is February the
26th not the 16th as recorded

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.720 position:56%
by his principal Italian biographer.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.620
So I think this is right.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.960
Here's Bodoni's grandfather on the
left and his father on the right.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.130
He came from a family
of printers even

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.580
on his mother's side
there was printing.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:59.710 position:56%
His grandfather before him went to
Rome to get training and his father,

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:06.080
I don't think his father actually
went to Rome, but try to remember

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.420
that style of printing on
the right his father's style

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.680
and you will see it again.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:19.110 position:56%
This is the schoolroom, well this is
the school in which Bodoni studied

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.500
in Saluzzo and I understand
that in the winter

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:29.890
when it was very cold they would
put waxed paper over the windows

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.070
in order to see and you
imagine it is pretty cold

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:39.110
up near Monte Viso in the winter.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:46.450
When he was 17, nearly 18,
he and a good friend decided

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.580 position:56%
that they would go and conquer Rome.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.870
Bodoni wanted to become the
greatest printer who ever lived

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.780
and his friend wanted to become
the greatest servant of God

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.790
who ever lived so off they set
these two boys and made a journey

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:09.570
which was described as one of
the writers in Italian about him

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:15.210
as arduous and fatiguing to
Rome as indeed I'm sure it was

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.260
to get, to travel in those days.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:27.500
So they arrived in Rome and found
it very difficult to find work

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.530
and it was really challenging

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:34.310
and in fact beyond
protopriest went back home

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.340
where he did become a parish
priest and they remained in touch.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.410
Bodoni hung on and
eventually he found his way

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.900
to the College of the
Propaganda Fide.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:50.850
The Propaganda Fide being the
missionary arm of the Vatican

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:55.720
and thus an establishment that
printed Bibles and Missals

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.150
in exotic languages in order to
convert people in the Middle East

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:05.200
and the Far East, so
already there was exotic type

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.300
at the Propaganda Fide
when Bodoni arrived.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:14.560
He's so impressed Cardinal
Spinelli who was the head

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:21.740 position:56%
of the Propaganda Fide with his
little wood engravings he took these

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:27.880
along as samples of what he
could do and the story goes

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:33.020
that Cardinal Spinelli gave
him a test, asked him to design

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:38.200
and cut a Coat of Arms in a
couple of hours or something.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.810
Well Bodoni of course managed
and he was hired on the spot.

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:47.660
Spinelli also took him into
his own home which happened

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:53.050 position:56%
to be the Palazzo Valentini which is
the building on the right side here.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.360
So Bodoni just imagine he was
up in you know lowly apprentice,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.800
you know up in one of those
sky lit rooms up top there.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.480
So in the morning he could
roll out of bed and just walk

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:13.020 position:56%
down into the Forum of Trajan and
finds himself face-to-face with some

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:19.500
of the most important
lettering every cut.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:25.570
His first tasks, no
not his first task.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.940
He started very low.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.490
He did anything you know he
was kind if dog's body there

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:36.490
but he eventually started composing
and the first book he worked

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:41.570
on was what's called a
Pontificale, a book for Bishops

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:46.440
of services the Bishops would give

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:52.430
and this is actually quite
interesting and rare.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:59.230
On the left you have the first run,
Bodoni's first run at doing this

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:03.300
and so it's printed in two colors.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:07.990
It's printed in two
languages Coptic and Arabic.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:13.970
The powers that be were so
impressed by what he could do

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:18.220
that they then went on to print
lots more copies and allowed him

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.850
to sign his name, no
to print his name.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.090
It's not his signature, to
print his name at the bottom

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.540
which was very unusual
for a lowly typesetter

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.690
but they were so pleased about it.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:35.240
Now the one on the left is actually
in the Houghton Library at Harvard

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:43.810 position:56%
and it's quite a big book and it has
in pencil written in it "very rare."

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:49.120
So I was absolutely fascinated
because I went back to Parma

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:55.840
in February and presented the book
which was a wonderful moment for me

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.450
to go back to the city
where I'd worked so hard

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:03.290
with an actual product
which I'm not convinced

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:08.130
that they thought I was
capable of doing but I did.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.360
So I showed this image
and they had never seen it

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:17.740
so it is indeed very
rare the one on the left.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.500
Bodoni worked for six years in Rome

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.230
and then you know how
things come together

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.740
to make you make some
kind of move in life?

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:38.760
Cardinal Spinelli died and Bodoni's
immediate superior Abbe Ruggieri

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:47.430
killed himself, shot himself and
this was a terrible, terrible thing

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:53.970
for Bodoni because they
were very close and Bodoni,

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:59.930
Ruggieri was depressant and but
he found relief from depression

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.290
in the company of Bodoni.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:06.730
Bodoni was very vibrant and so
Bodoni in the mornings would go

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:13.920
over to the, to Abbe Ruggieri's
home and he would wait for him

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.830
until he was ready and then
they would walk together

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.800
to the Propaganda Fide.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.030
On this morning Bodoni went over.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:26.560 position:56%
The servant told him that Abbe was
not ready and then there was a sound

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.950
of the shot and he
had killed himself.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.080
Now if you think about the
circumstances there how terrible

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:38.620
that must have been for
Bodoni and you wonder

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:43.930
about Ruggieri's motivation
in killing himself

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:49.110
at that very moment it's kind of
one of these unsolved mysteries

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:54.030
but it set Bodoni up for
wanting to leave Rome.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:59.230
On the brighter side Bodoni had
met quite a few English tourists

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:06.960 position:56%
in Rome, part of the grand tour they
were there also carting goods back

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:13.930
to England to museums and to their
stately homes in England from Italy

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.790
and then had told him that there
are things happening in England.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.580
There's quite a lot of
innovation going on.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:25.810 position:56%
There's this chap called Baskerville
and Bodoni thought, yeah, I better.

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.230
I want to stretch my wings.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.970
I will go to England.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.970
Never mind that I didn't
speak English.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:36.300
Everybody in England was speaking
Italian because they liked opera.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:42.600
So off he went and he decided that
he would stop and see his parents

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.570
on the way in Saluzzo because
it's near directly north

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:51.760
and then he would go on to
England but on the way he fell ill.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:57.610
And we think it was malaria and
he was quite ill so he went home

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:00.680
to his mother and she
took care of him

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:06.000
and when he recovered he started
working again with his father

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.020
in the family printworks.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:16.460
Until the meantime in Parma the
young 18 year-old Duke of Parma

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:25.630 position:56%
and his wonderfully attractive Prime
Minister Guillaume Du Tillot wanted

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:32.910
to put Parma on the map and how
did you do that in those days?

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:38.850
Well you did that by setting
up a printworks in your city

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:41.690
so that you could advertise
your city

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:47.260
as being quite the most marvelous
and charming place in Italy.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.290
But how could they go about this?

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:57.550
How could they set out to
just start a printworks

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.740
and a press from nothing?

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.700 position:56%
Well, Guillaume Du Tillot being
French consulted a great connoisseur

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.760
in Paris called Pierre-Jean
Mariette.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:16.330 position:56%
Pierre-Jean Mariette was a wise man
and he said do not hire a Frenchman.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.330 position:56%
Hire an Italian because you're going

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.520
to be printing a lot
of works in Italian.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.750
If you want to get them
right hire Italian.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:30.720
The problem was there were no
Italian's suitable for the job,

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:43.830
so there was a librarian, ha, ha,
ha in Parma Paulo Maria Paciaudi

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:46.180
who had known Bodoni in Rome

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.180
and coincidentally they
were both from Piedmont.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:55.200
They were both Piedmontese and
they stick together Piedmontese

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.640
so he said, "I've met
this young man in Rome

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.510
and he is incredibly talented.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.160
He is absolutely superb."

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:10.280
And by this time Bodoni
had cut some punches.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.900
He had designed typer pages.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.880
He had worked with exotic type.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:21.920
In fact while he was in Rome he
was sent to La Sapienza University

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.740
of Rome where he studied
Hebrew and Arabic

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:31.340
and so he had working knowledge
of some exotic languages

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:37.200
and Paciaudi said, "I
think he would do."

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.080
So the Duke and the Prime
Minister sent off the invitation

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:48.680
and in February, 1768
Bodoni arrived in Parma.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:53.690
They set up the printworks
and his apartment above.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.800
That's called the Palazzo
della Pilotta

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:03.710
and it's an extraordinary building
built by the Farnese family

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:12.280
which includes the Farnese Theater
which is absolutely gigantic

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.540
and they could produce,
they could flood the floor

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.740
and produce naval battles in it.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.110
It's quite an extraordinary place.

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:28.000 position:56%
So Bodoni could print something
off, cross the bridge over the river

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:35.000 position:56%
and arrive at the ducal palace to
show the Duke anything that you know

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.050
if he needed his approval.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:44.820
Bodoni liked his food.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:50.220
He had come from Rome
where the food is very kind

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.810
of vegetable-aised,
olive oil, very healthy.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:59.160
Parma on the other hand,
you've heard of Parma ham?

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.710
You've heard of Parma cheese?

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:08.560
It's a very, very protein
driven diet mostly pork.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.770
There's a lot of pork
and of course oh,

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:16.400
I meant to tell you that's
tortelli di erbette which is a sort

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.730
of ravioli-like pasta that contains
Swiss chard or wheat greens.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.590
Do you know what we have here?

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:29.400
Can you tell what we
have here on the left?

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.700
&gt;&gt; Sausage maker.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.000
&gt;&gt; Valerie Lester: Yes.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.300
Yes, we do indeed have
the sausage maker.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.690
So this is in the 11th
century baptistery so already

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:41.100
in Parma they were
devoted to their salami.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:45.600
When Bodoni arrived he brought,
I think he brought a few punches

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.690
of his own but there was nothing.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:56.650
There was nothing in Parma so
he had to order type from France

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:02.620
and his great hero in
printing was Fournier

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:06.650
and so he ordered Fournier type.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:14.010
So in the beginning Bodoni is
Fournier and gradually as time went

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:21.020
on Fournier became Bodoni.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.060
This I think you will
feel reminds you

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:31.090
of his father's work is still
old-fashioned his father's work.

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:36.280
So this is the very first thing
he actually printed in Parma

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:43.810
of substance and it is it's
essentially a poem of thanksgiving

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:52.510 position:56%
for the recovery from once again,
malaria of Prime Minister Du Tillot.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:20:03.210 position:56%
The next big work was a presentation
volume for the marriage of the Duke

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:10.840
of Parma, 18 years old with
this Duchess of Austria,

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.130
one of the 16 children of
Maria Theresa of Austria.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:19.500
At this point Maria
Theresa had a rather a lot

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:25.090
of marriageable daughters that
she needed to get out in the world

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:30.060
so she sent this one to Parma
to marry the Duke of Parma.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:35.940
She sent Marie Antoinette to Paris
to marry the [inaudible] of France

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:41.020
and Carolina to Naples to
marry the king of Naples.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:45.810
This one as you can probably
tell is a piece of work.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:54.100
She very often she
Austrianized Parma.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.800
She got rid of Guillaume Du Tillot

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:02.510
and it became a very different
place while she was there.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:06.310
Anyway, to go back to this
fabulous presentation volume

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:12.450 position:56%
that they produced in celebration of
the wedding Bodoni worked in concert

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.830
with Petitot who was an architect.

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:19.520
He had come to Parma to
brighten the face of Parma,

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.670
to build a few new buildings
and to kind of rehab others

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:31.490
and he was very gifted and he
and Bodoni worked hand and glove

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:39.430 position:56%
on the book that you will see at the
bottom of this picture on the left.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:44.690
Petitot was so pleased
with the finished volume

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:51.860 position:56%
that he produced a funny little book
called "Masquerade a'la Grecque"

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.870
in which everybody in it is dressed
up in some sort of Greek outfit.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:22:00.340
Anyway, there's the book again up
on the left on top of the column

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.830
and here's the title page.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:08.720
Now you see the difference
between that

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.550 position:56%
and the previous thing I showed you.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.680
It's getting more Bodoni-like.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:21.200
So within this volume, this great
big folio volume there are lots

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.780
of illustrations and there
are illustrations of battles

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:34.840 position:56%
and uniforms and this is a Chinese
fair and this is an Arcadian theater

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:40.400
so the festivities went
on for weeks and one

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:47.660
of the performers was a local
soprano called affectionately La

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:52.800
Bastardella because ancestry was
a little suspect but she sang

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:58.730
in operas in celebration and
these were operas by Gluck

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:03.680
and take a very close
look at the next image.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:13.060
You know what's going on here?

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:19.480
Bottom enhancement.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.910
&gt;&gt; False bottom?

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.320
&gt;&gt; Valerie Lester:
Bottom enhancement.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.020
The pot down on the bottom right
has the words Colla du Parma.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:33.700
Colla is glue and the man doing the
enhancement is his name is Giusepe

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.000
du Colla.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.910
A lot of play on words here
and he actually married,

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:46.780
he married Lucrezia Aguiari
to give her her full name.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:57.180
And then at the end of the final
thing I've got is fireworks.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.960
Bodoni was starting by now.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.150
Fournier, gradually some of the
Fournier type was breaking down.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:08.000
Bodoni was cutting his own to
replace it so the shift is going

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.410
on between Fournier and Bodoni.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:17.260
Bodoni wanted to produce a specimen
book of ornaments so this page

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:22.720
of his hand drawing of
ornaments which is also

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:30.350
at the Houghton Library at
Harvard and he produced this.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:36.320
This is a facsimile of
it and it's still very,

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.620
this is still very like Fournier.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.180
Fournier has one of
these specimen books

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.790
that has a cover very like this.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:52.520
And that's from the interior and
do any of you recognize this?

00:24:53.840 --> 00:25:00.750
It's actually modern day ITC
Bodoni designed by Sumner Stone.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:07.660
Some of you may know him and so
you can actually decorate your work

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.850
with this.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:15.280
This is not Bodoni's
studio but his contemporary

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:21.330
so his printworks would have
looked very much like this.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.110
People would have been
wearing the same things.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.960
They would have been using
the same kind of equipment.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:33.390
There are big windows that face out
towards the river so that's very,

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:39.020
very much like what he would have
the space he would have worked in.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:47.020
Here is some of his punches and
the Bodoni Museum has them all,

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:51.300
huge collection, huge
collection of punches really,

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.420
really wonderful collection.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:26:02.000
These are Bodoni's
matrices and molds.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.040
This is not his press
but it's a facsimile.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:12.300
He had six presses going at one
point, at one time and but none

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:19.190
of them remain but they managed
to get a facsimile of one of them.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.860
This book is over on that table.

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:28.130
I'm very pleased that
we can see that book.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:33.080
An Epithalamia is a book written
in celebration of a wedding

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:40.230
and the wedding was that of the
prince of Piedmont so we're back

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:44.800
in Piedmont royalty among
Piedmontese and the prince

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.620
of Piedmont married Marie
Clotilde, the Princess of France,

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:57.500
a princess of France so Bodoni
produced another marvelous

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:04.260
presentation volume and in what he
did in it was he had 26 pages each

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:10.320 position:56%
with a different language, different
exotic type and the iconography

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:15.340
for the city that it
represented, the city in Piemonte

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:21.500
that it represented so this is the
page for Saluzzo for his hometown.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:29.110 position:56%
For some reason he chose to use
Armenian as the script and the image

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:34.100
above is of, it's actually got
rivers you know the tributaries

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:40.820
of the Po and various other
items of interest to Saluzzo.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:47.660 position:56%
That particular book made such an
impression on the Spanish ambassador

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:59.630 position:56%
who lived in Rome but came to Parma
and was astounded by Bodoni's talent

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:05.720 position:56%
and he felt very, very strongly that
Bodoni was wasting himself in Parma

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.170
when he should be actually in Rome.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.660
He felt that Bodoni
was printing ephemera.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:21.230
He was printing announcements,
invitations, playbills

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:25.310 position:56%
and silly sonnets for would-be poets

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:29.090
who wanted their work
printed by the great Bodoni.

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:33.030
And he said, "If you come
to Rome I will give you your

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:35.060
own establishment.

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:38.280
You will publish the classics.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.900
You will not have to do any

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:44.590
of this essentially grunt
work and so come to Rome.

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:47.170
Come to Rome."

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.900
Well Bodoni liked Parma.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.440
He was comfortable in Parma.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:59.590
However, in 1791 when the pressure
was really on from Azara to go

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:02.750
to Rome and Bodoni was
beginning to weaken and think

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:07.500
that you know it might be a good
idea the Duke heard about it

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:14.660
and he really didn't want to let
Bodoni go because Bodoni was,

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.300
well he was like a
rock star by this time.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.480
He attracted people to Parma.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:22.330
Tourists came to Parma
and they went first

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:25.420
to see Bodoni before they
paid tribute to the Duke.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:32.370
He was, it's hard to imagine
nowadays but it was you know it was

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:36.900
like what's his name,
Steve Jobs, right?

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:42.120
Somebody like that,
star quality, big name.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.460
So the Duke said, "No,
I can't let you go.

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.270
You must stay here but
here's what I'll do.

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:54.560 position:56%
I'll give you your own private press
so you can print anything you want

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.280
as long as just stay here
and print what I want."

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.810
So that's the deal they cut.

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:09.030
Well immediately Azara commissioned
him to producing "Horace"

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:18.720 position:56%
and now you see Bodoni doing what he
wanted expressing himself as Bodoni

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:25.460
with his perfect balance, his black
ink on really good white paper,

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:30.500 position:56%
his own recipe for his ink and he --

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:35.940
so from then on his work
just got better and better.

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:40.960
But there was another reason why
Bodoni wanted to stay in Parma.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.890
What do you think that was?

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:49.180
Well you may be wondering
about romance in Bodoni's life.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:57.010
He's by now 51 and if you scratch
around trying to find anything,

00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:05.120 position:56%
any whiff of scandal that -- you can
make guesses and many certainly have

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:11.790
but you know as a biography you've
got to hew to the facts so anyway

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:17.040
at the age of 51 he had begun
to suffer from the terrible gout

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:22.490
that pursued him for the rest
of his life and I think the idea

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:26.840
of a little sort of home
comfort seemed really good.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:36.750
He had come to know this young
woman Margherita dall'Aglio

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:46.270
but she was unfortunately engaged
to somebody else but Bodoni was

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:52.140
so famous and so attractive
that she managed to get rid

00:31:52.140 --> 00:32:00.450
of the other guy so
they got married.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:06.460
The little chapel in which
they got married in Parma

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:16.660
but all was not entirely right
in this big year of 1791.

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:24.930
Bodoni had had metal
workers from San Pancrazio

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:31.440 position:56%
which is a village outside Parma who
proved to be really useful working

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:39.200
with him two brothers and a nephew
and this is murky territory right?

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.720
This is murky territory.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.010
He taught them how to cut punches

00:32:44.010 --> 00:32:51.330
and so they were working alongside
him but they began to feel

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:52.980
that they were doing all this work

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:56.160
but they weren't getting
the acknowledgement

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:02.960
so there was a terrific
rift and they left

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.660
and started their own
printworks in San Pancrazio.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:16.030 position:56%
So I thought it would be interesting
for you to see their work compared

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:21.200
to Bodoni's and I think you
recognize the master, don't you?

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:30.010
Yeah. Round about the
same time Didot

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:36.070
in France the great
French printer got hold

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:38.590
of a copy of Bodoni's "Aeneid."

00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:47.360
Now he may have got a
hold of a final copy

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:54.580
but Bodoni believed he had got
hold of an uncorrected proof

00:33:54.580 --> 00:34:02.670
and it's possible that the
Amoretti brothers had been the ones

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:07.110
to get this uncorrected
proof to Paris.

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:09.190
As I say this is murky stuff.

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:12.140
It's not definitive.

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:14.660 position:56%
Didot then produces his own "Aeneid"

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:23.270 position:56%
and in the introduction he took
Bodoni to task and listed his typers

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:28.680
which I think is actually
just about as cruel a thing

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.580
as you can do to a competitor.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:38.420
However, in time they learned
to admire each other greatly

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:42.350
and I'm not sure that
all was forgiven

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:44.530
but certainly matters improved.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:50.460
I think Didot had to
back off a little bit

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:56.900
when Bodoni won a very prestigious
prize for printing in France

00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:01.300
that no foreigner had ever one.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:08.910
He was a workaholic and if
he wasn't actually designing

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:12.620
or printing he was cutting punches.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.740
He cut thousands and
thousands of punches

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:21.960
but I think this is the
entrance of Senora Bodoni

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.580
that they would have
conversation on Friday afternoons.

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:29.790
They would gather their friends
together and enjoy themselves.

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:33.090
I don't see any wine but maybe
it's a little early in the day

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:37.770
but anyway it's a very
interesting image to read.

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:43.890
On the far left you have Bodoni
and next to him is Giusepe de Lama

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:49.810
who would go on to write
the main biography,

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:54.200
the biography that people
always use and quote from

00:35:54.200 --> 00:36:00.990
but gets the birthday wrong
sorry, so they're clearly working

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:04.000
on something together maybe
Bodoni is telling him a bit

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.650
of his life's story.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:09.910
Behind them is DALMASTRO, the
manservant for the Bodoni's.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:16.190 position:56%
In the center are three good
friends from Parma rather well-born.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:17.490
One's a poet.

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:18.790
One's a count.

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:20.160
I forget what the third one is.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:26.110
Top right is Zambiagi the
foreman of the printworks and then

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:33.260
down below [inaudible] slightly is
Signori Bodoni and Fernando Paer

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:38.730
who was a composer who
wrote the wedding march

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:44.920
for Napoleon's second wedding.

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:51.300
This is Rosaspina, Francesco
Rosaspina who was the one engraver

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.670
that Bodoni trusted to
do illustrations for him.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:59.360
Bodoni very rarely
used illustrations

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.510
but when he did he
trusted Rosaspina.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:06.190
[ Inaudible question ]

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.720
You know I can't think.

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:14.800
I'm not sure of the dates of,
I'm not sure of the dates sorry.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.540
I think not, no when Fournier died

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.140
and the Didot's had
come in France, right.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:25.520
This is Pietro Miliani who was
a paper maker from Fabriano,

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:29.660
where Fabriano still
produces really good paper.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:32.660
He provided Bodoni
with fantastic paper.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:38.570 position:56%
The paper maker in Parma people were
jealous of Bodoni and if the kind

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:43.060
of [inaudible] he had at the
with the Duke at the court

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:48.210
and so he had to go
to -- can you see?

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:49.510
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:50.810
&gt;&gt; Valerie Lester:
There's a seat over here.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.110
Well, anyway.

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:57.460
Good I'm glad you can see so
Miliani was very loyal and kept

00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:03.590
on producing the good stuff.

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:04.890
Recognize this chap?

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:11.490
Franklin wrote a fan letter to
Bodoni and it's very interesting.

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.440
He said, "Oh, congratulations

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:17.450
on your marvelous work
in such and such a work.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:22.070
I really think it is
absolutely beautiful however,

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:26.950
had it been me I would
have done such and such."

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:33.240
So you know printers they
like a bit of rivalry.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:44.980
And the Pope went to Paris to crown
Napoleon emperor and while he was

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:51.140
in Paris he met Marcel who
was the young librarian

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:55.350
at the Bibliotheca Imperial

00:38:55.350 --> 00:39:02.850
and Marcel showed the Pope this
incredible volume he had just

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:13.480
produced which included 150
different types in many,

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:19.280
many exotic languages and the
Pope was deeply impressed.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:23.600 position:56%
On his way back to Rome after what
must have been a really discouraging

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:32.260 position:56%
moment for him crowning Napoleon he
stopped in Parma, went to see Bodoni

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:37.670
and said, "Okay, can you
do better than this?"

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:39.860
Well could he?

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:41.160
Yeah. Of course he could.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.440 position:56%
One hundred fifty-five so he did it.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:54.010
So this is from that work which is
an absolutely astonishing thing.

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:59.530 position:56%
The Chinese lettering is interesting
in it because it was the only,

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:05.060
only type that he cut in wood.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:08.360
Everything else he had cut in steel
but the Chinese he did in wood

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.880
and do you know why he
would have done that?

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.180
Do you know why?

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:16.600
Would it have been hard
to do that on the steel?

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.150
&gt;&gt; Stan Nelson: Well, it's
really easier in the wood.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.610
&gt;&gt; Valerie Lester: Easier
in the wood, right, right.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:28.410
Another wonderful moment for Bodoni
was when he became an Arcadian

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:35.490
which was a somewhat slightly
closed society of people

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:44.160
who were interested in keeping
the arts and writing alive

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:51.190
and so this is the big quite a
big piece of ephemera if you will,

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:56.600
printed in two colors and it's a
poem that Bodoni wrote in thanks

00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.730
to the man who proposed
him to become an Arcadian.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:03.680
This is in the Providence
Public Library

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.580
which has the Didot
Updike Collection

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:10.070
and a fabulous collection.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:11.970
This is interesting.

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:15.450
I only somehow I had missed it.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:17.740
I came to it right at the
end of writing the book

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.830
and I literally had
to say now hang on.

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:21.130
Hold the presses.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:30.250
Stop, stop I need more time and
partly Parma which was not inclined

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:35.390
to think too highly of people who
are not actually born in Parma

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:38.170
and that remains to this day.

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:41.690
I mean Parma is very
pleased with itself.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:46.440
Why would we go anywhere else
when Parma is so perfect?

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:52.630
Well, they finally produced a
gold medal in honor of Bodoni.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.130
Remember the Duke?

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:58.230
Right, Bodoni is still
working for the Duke.

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:04.560
The Duke was pious
to a fare-thee-well,

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:13.160
a religious bigot actually and
but he was also a roisterer.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:19.490
In the country I take honor he
has a hunting lodge and a chapel

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:22.450
so he could go off
roistering on Saturday evenings

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:25.430
and then go to chapel on Sunday.

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:36.850
Anyway he did love to eat and he
doesn't look so good, does he?

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:46.780
Anyway he died in 1802 and it
was a sudden and mysterious death

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.710
so in Italy when there is a sudden

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:55.010
and mysterious death
what do they figure out?

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:56.310
&gt;&gt; Poison.

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:57.610
&gt;&gt; Valerie Lester:
It was poison, right?

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:02.070
So that as a matter of fact
I've seen carved on a plaque

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:05.960
on the church where
he's buried it says

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.290
that he was [foreign
words] he was poisoned.

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:15.520
When the actual fact, I've seen
the doctor's records I think he had

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.240
something that is sort
of like a twisted gut.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.940
Black bile they called it.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:28.100
So anyway his having died
the Duchess became co-regent

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:35.150
with two others but within ten
days Napoleon had banished her.

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:41.480
There he is in the robes of the
King of Italy so she was banished

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:45.730
and he put in place this
man Moreau de St. Mery

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:49.330
as general administrator of Parma.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:53.780
Now Bodoni, Bodoni didn't
care who he worked for as long

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.940
as he got commissions
and he got paid.

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:58.170
He went with the wind.

00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:02.080
He was apolitical.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.590
Bodoni thought of Bodoni.

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:08.450
He didn't think of particularly
of loyalty or of causes.

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:13.210
He thought about printing
the best books so he

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:16.590
and Moreau became really
good friends.

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:20.730
Then he printed his "Homer."

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:30.400
Took a long, long time and he had a
very, very slow editor but it came,

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:35.490
it is the most gorgeous
book I have ever seen.

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:42.130
It is I first saw it in
Saluzzo in Bodoni's hometown.

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:47.890
Bodoni had given copies of
all his books to Saluzzo.

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:52.700
So I was there in the
library and the library

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:57.320
and Giancarla Bertero
she came staggering

00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:01.540
out of the trolley
three huge volumes.

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:09.980
It's very big and she took one
off and opened it on the table

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:14.340
at which I was working and I
thought I want to die here.

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:15.940
This is so beautiful.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.760
I want to lie down
in this book and die.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:26.960
It was so gorgeous and it
is in fact his favorite font

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:29.330
as we call it nowadays,
his favorite type.

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:34.420
He said that the Greek was
the one that he loved most.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.950
Well maybe he got a lot of practice

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:39.060
with it certainly working
on this book.

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:43.550
So yeah, keeping up with
not exactly the Joneses

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:49.160 position:56%
with Napoleon he gave a copy to
Napoleon and Napoleon was so pleased

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:53.740
with it that he made him
Chevalier of the Order of the Union

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:59.920
and gave him a pension for life.

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:06.870
Napoleon by now had gotten rid of
Josephine and he married, he was 39

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:11.300
and he married the 18 year-old
Marie Louise of Austria related

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:18.780
to the Duchess of Parma
but not related closely.

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:26.260
Napoleon wanted one thing
and she produced it, a son.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:30.280
This drawing is perfectly charming.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:36.240
I was in a museum called the
Glauco-Lombardi Museum in Parma

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.770
in the back offices talking
to the curator and it was

00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:43.600
on her desk this little
image and I said,

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.020
"Could I take a photo of this?"

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.740
And she said, "Oh sure."

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:53.090
So you stumble on wonderful things
when you actually spend time

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:57.330
in a place so to celebrate
the birth of the king of Rome,

00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:03.170 position:56%
Napoleon's son Bodoni did another of
these fabulous presentation volumes

00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:08.760
and unusually for his late
work he put a border around it

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:14.450
but as you can see it's a very
sort of austere grand border,

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:19.400
so it's a celebration of the
arrival of the King of Rome.

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:28.120
Still hanging in with the Napoleon
family he started working for Murat

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:34.830
who is I like to call
him the hot dresser.

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:40.180
Look at his green suede
boots for instance.

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:43.640
Anyway Murat was married
to Napoleon's sister

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:51.250
and Murat wanted his son to read
and learn the French classics

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:54.710
in books printed by Bodoni.

00:47:54.710 --> 00:48:00.360
So he commissioned Bodoni
to print the French classics

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:05.250
and this I'm told was
Bodoni's favorite type of page

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:13.030
because he managed to get the words
"Boileau Despreaux" on one line.

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:17.940
He had to cut special
punches to do it but he did it

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:21.710
and he got those two
words on one line.

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:26.860
Takes all sorts of
pleasures different people.

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:35.320
Bodoni died of complications
from his gout and some kind

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:41.050
of nasty chest infection which
his wife called [inaudible]

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:43.560
but which I think must have been,

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:48.070
it was probably bronchitis
or pneumonia.

00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:50.950
You can imagine the air he was
breathing in the printworks

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:55.860
for all those years that
he was working in Parma.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:49:04.080
Part of him is buried in the
cathedral and part of him is

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.130
in his parish church in
this rather unpleasant way

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:09.860
of eviscerating people and
putting bits here and bits there

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:12.980
but that's the way it was done.

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:20.380
So he leaves behind Ghitta
his wife and she's formidable.

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:24.620
She helped him so much
while he was alive.

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:29.840
She, well she spoke French
and she learned English

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:35.120
so that they can correspond
with his English customers.

00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.680
She did all his correspondence
for him.

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:44.530
She took care of him and he really
benefitted from this late marriage

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:51.730
of his and then the greatest
thing she did was to finish work

00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:57.900
on his Manuale Tipografico
essentially his life's work.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.130
It took her five years.

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:06.040
He had done, I mean it
was he had done the work

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.000
but it was not organized.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.660 position:56%
He had written an introduction but
she had to organize the whole thing.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.890
She said herself in
her own introduction

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:22.080
that it was a labor she did
not know if she could entrust

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.950
to herself but could and she did.

00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:30.540
So she in 1818 she
brought out and it's here.

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:35.960
It's two volumes there on the
middle of the table in the stand.

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:40.390
She brought it out and she
dedicated to the Duchess

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:46.330
of Parma Maria Luigia, Maria Luigia
was and now she's Maria Luigia

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:50.960
because she's Duchess of Parma.

00:50:50.960 --> 00:51:00.590
Here's the largest type he did and
I think it's there you can see it.

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:07.420
The smallest type right at the
beginning he dedicates to Parma.

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:11.660
This one he dedicates to
Saluzzo his birthplace

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.840
so essentially he's
gone full circle.

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:22.440 position:56%
The end of his great book is Saluzzo
the place he started his life.

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.480
Now you can't read this.

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.900
I know that but I have
it here for a reason.

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:30.420
This is another item in the
Providence Public Library.

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:33.400
People have always
said how many copy

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:37.330
of the great Manuale did he print?

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:38.860
Nobody knew.

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.120
Well nobody that I consulted knew.

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:45.630
This letter from Madam
Bodoni to a Mr. [Inaudible]

00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:52.970
who is obviously a customer
said, "I have printed 250 copies

00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:57.970
and I'm selling them for 125
francs each, no discounts."

00:51:57.970 --> 00:52:03.550
She was very firm about that.

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:08.780
This is the plaque, the memorial
to him in the Parma Cathedral.

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.990
It's a very big and
very impressive plaque.

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:18.670
Below is a plaque to his
widow and on the left is this

00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:21.700
which is rather nice to
know that the printers

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:24.880
of America have acknowledged
the great Bodoni.

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:32.190
I think you may have been
wondering what he looked like.

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:42.640
This is not Bodoni however, it
was said to be Bodoni for many,

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:47.060
many years until the clothing
historians got hold of it

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:54.160
and said he was too young in that
picture to be wearing that cravat.

00:52:54.160 --> 00:53:03.590 position:56%
All wrong, so here he is wearing the
same cravat as a mature man however,

00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:08.160
if you look at those two pictures
side by side it could be Bodoni.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.880
So many of the artists
were doing it from memory.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.180
I don't know.

00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:13.590
Anyway that's one of
those mysteries.

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:18.740
Very silly this one isn't it?

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:20.040
Very silly.

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:34.080
Now we have the modern ones which
just get sillier and sillier.

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:40.380 position:56%
The one on the right isn't it funny?

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:41.680
I love this one.

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.050
This is my favorite.

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:47.800
There he is in his
working gear working hard

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:52.780
and I think that's probably a
good likeness, a nice new sketch.

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:58.260
You know somebody working
quickly and here this is

00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:04.020
in his hometown this bust
of him and on it it says,

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:06.440
you may not be able to read it.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:11.090
It says in English, "The Best."

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:13.250
Can I give you two more minutes?

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:23.650
Yes? I want to tell you a
little bit about the experience

00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:28.720
of writing a biography of Bodoni.

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:35.090
So what work -- I had not
heard of Bodoni until going

00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:44.540
to a dinner party eight, nine
years ago and I was my host

00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:49.870
at this dinner party said you
know, he was very, very upset.

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:54.580
He'd just heard from a dealer
that he had a stolen book

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:57.980
that he had bought in all
innocence and he had to return it

00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:01.010
to the library from
which it was stolen.

00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:03.440
I at this point had
finished the first book.

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:07.440
I'd finished the translation and
I was looking for a new topic

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:08.830
and I thought oh stolen books.

00:55:08.830 --> 00:55:10.590
That's interesting, hmm.

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:13.260
So I looked into this
particular theft.

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:16.930
I looked into book theft in
general and it's disgusting

00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:18.820
so I thought I don't want
to do anymore with that

00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:22.950
but in the meantime I'd
become interested in Bodoni

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:25.370
and I wanted to go to Italy.

00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:28.610
I wanted to spend time in
Italy so I thought ooh,

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:30.410
this sounds like a good thing.

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:35.250
I knew practically
nothing about printing

00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:43.740
and my Italian was [inaudible] so
I started going to Italian classes

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:48.030
and then the next big thing if
you want to write a biography

00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:53.010
of Bodoni you start networking
and people put you in touch

00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:56.820
with other people and you of
course you eat Italian food.

00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:04.120
This is Sumner Stone who put
me in touch with James Mosley,

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:09.620
the great print historian and his
wife Jillian Riley who is an expert

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:12.290
on Italian cuisine
which he's written

00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:15.540
"The Oxford Companion
to Italian Food."

00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:18.670
They were so helpful
to me both of them.

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:24.300
My book is actually quite
reliable thanks to James Mosley

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:32.010
who is a very, very keen-eyed
as Stan will corroborate

00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:34.430
with me a very keen-eyed editor.

00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:41.610 position:56%
And then you get to meet Mr. Nelson,
Mr. Stan Nelson and spend a couple

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:45.760
of days with him in West
Virginia watching him cut a punch.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:49.200
It was a Caslon C as I
remember Stan, wasn't it?

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:54.770
Yeah, uh-huh and it took five
hours to cut that one letter

00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:59.600
and Stan is fast so
you think about Bodoni

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:04.030 position:56%
and the thousands of punches he cut.

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:07.250
I liken him to somebody who
is a nut about knitting.

00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:09.610
His hands could not be still.

00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:15.090
When he had a [inaudible]
he would cut another punch.

00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:20.940
Okay so you go to Parma but
in I think this is in 2008

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:27.110
or maybe 2008 there are
very few Wi-Fi hot spots and

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:29.350
but there was one on the steps

00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:32.600
of the 11th century
baptistery for some reason.

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:37.200
I never quite understood why and
I used to annoy the old priest

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:42.710
who came out with his brush to
sweep up the pigeon poo that was

00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:45.530
on the steps and I was
always sitting there

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:48.430
and he would glare at me.

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:53.370 position:56%
So if you're lucky you get to meet
handsome men and you get to converse

00:57:53.370 --> 00:58:00.560
with really charming women and
you get, you have to get beyond

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.640 position:56%
to the curator of the Bodoni Museum.

00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:08.560
You have to make real nice,
nice with her and then you get

00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:13.460
to meet her assistant who
turned out to be golden.

00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:16.730
She did anything she could for me.

00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:21.940
She's holding a fine
Bodoni volume here and she

00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:25.500
and her boyfriend would take
me out at weekends to outings

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:30.100
to the countryside to see places
that Bodoni would have gone

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:33.950
to see the Duke's country
palace at Corlono.

00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:38.130
We went to see hunting lodge and
the chapel that I mentioned before

00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:41.230
and we would eat out
so it was lovely.

00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:44.680
You know immediately I
had an Italian friend.

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:51.380
I did make from Jillian Riley
you remember the culinary expert,

00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:56.270 position:56%
the Italian she put me in touch with
a woman called Wallace [inaudible]

00:58:56.270 --> 00:59:02.180
who is a writer who lives in Parma
married to an Italian professor.

00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:06.240
She's American and she had a
writer's group which she invited me

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:09.160
to come and talk about
biography to them and they

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:13.060
because this is a small
society they sort of fell on me

00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:16.870 position:56%
because I was a newcomer and started
taking me out to other things

00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:20.710
and I felt very at home in Parma.

00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:24.440
I went a total of five
times to Parma.

00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:28.940
So if you're lucky you'll get

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:32.390
to meet [foreign words] The
Exquisite Man, [foreign name]

00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:37.330
who is probably the greatest
Bodoni scholar in Italy.

00:59:37.330 --> 00:59:40.680
Well, there's a couple of
others that contest that

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.890
but is certainly one
of the top three.

00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:53.340
And then Franco Maria Ricci
is an Italian publisher

00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:58.010
and Bodoni collector and
collector of neoclassical art

00:59:58.010 --> 01:00:03.430
and here we are looking for Bodoni
in one of his cabinets with part

01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:06.470
of his collection above us.

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:12.340
If you're lucky like I was
you're there during carnival.

01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:18.850 position:56%
This picture is funny because the
figures at the bottom are the people

01:00:18.850 --> 01:00:20.430
and the figures at the
top are the puppets.

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:26.730
[Laughter] And if you're
not so lucky you'll get

01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:31.650
to be there during an earthquake
and I was alone in this room

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:35.430
when the world started
shaking and the windows rattled

01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:37.550
and I thought all the books were
going to fall off the shelves

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:41.270
but they didn't fortunately
and we all ran outside.

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:44.150
It was quite dramatic.

01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:52.950
I was there during two winters
when it snowed and snow in Parma is

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:59.690 position:56%
because it's not a deeply cold place
although I must say I felt very cold

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:04.640
there sometimes, the snow will
melt quite quickly and then freeze

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:07.350
and it's a lot of cobblestones.

01:01:07.350 --> 01:01:13.150
It is treacherous and because
I was spending every morning

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:17.940
from 9 'til 1 reading
18th century Italian

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:24.990 position:56%
in spidery handwriting often written
on two sides of thin pages of paper

01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:31.130
by one [inaudible] I was like
this so and I couldn't walk,

01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:39.570
I couldn't get exercise so I
joined a gym called Fisi Labor

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:46.230
and Fisi Labor was set in a
palazzo so I was in this gym

01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:52.920 position:56%
with young Italian women a lot of
them with tattoos, a third of my age

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:59.370
and it was really challenging and
one day the teacher shouted at me

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:05.870
because I had slowed down a bit
and I said to her in Italian,

01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:09.650
"I'm 70 years old" and everybody

01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:12.080
in the room went ha-ha
and burst into cheers.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:16.000
[Laughter] It was so funny.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.200
So I was least getting my exercise.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:26.280
So then if you're working on a
biography of Bodoni you have to go

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.610
to Rome because you think
you might find something

01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:33.390
about the six years he
was in Rome and I managed

01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:38.300
to get myself a little visiting
fellowship for five weeks

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:43.610
at the American Academy
which is very grand and

01:02:43.610 --> 01:02:48.210
but in actual fact you can't
find anything about Bodoni there

01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:52.160
because he was a lowly apprentice
and he did not leave a trace.

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.460
He did not.

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:54.830
There is no trace to follow.

01:02:54.830 --> 01:03:01.770
So what I did while I was there
was I found his geography.

01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:06.080 position:56%
I found where he lived in the
Palazzo Valentini and I visited that

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:10.780
and I found you know 18 Propaganda
Fide which has now been moved

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:14.310
to the Vatican itself
so it's now a museum

01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:18.150
where the people don't know
anything you know about the press.

01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:20.630
It was very disappointing.

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:28.870
I was there during a flood on
the Tiber but this I did find

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:34.680
and this is the Vatican
printing press so this is

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:39.880
where the Propaganda is printing
its material nowadays very,

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:42.860
very hi-tech.

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:50.200
So when in Rome right get a haircut
like the hairdressers, right?

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.360
But avoid buying shoes like this.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.660
&gt;&gt; Oh wow.

01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:56.960
&gt;&gt; Valerie Lester: Can
you imagine walking

01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.100
around on the cobblestones
like that?

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:10.330
And then if you go to Testaccio
there's a section there of streets

01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:11.950
that are named for printers.

01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:19.170
There's the Aldo Manuzio and
there's the via Benjamino Franklin

01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:24.810
and there is of course via
Giovanni Battista Bodoni.

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:28.020
Giambattista you know
that's his full name

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:31.520
but it was always compressed
into Giambattista.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.310
So by now you're tired aren't you?

01:04:34.310 --> 01:04:39.760
And you see a wine shop and
so you think I'll just go in

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.510
and have a nice glass of wine.

01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:54.410
[ Music playing ]

01:04:54.410 --> 01:05:00.510
So that's it folks.

01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:13.380
[ Applause ]

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.910
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: [Inaudible] I
didn't know about Volare but I have

01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:18.350
to say that's a first
for the Rosenwald Room.

01:05:18.350 --> 01:05:21.330
If you'd like we can take
a few minutes for questions

01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:26.320
if you're not exhausted and then
afterwards we'll show you the

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.790 position:56%
Tipografia and the Celebration Book.

01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:31.490
When we do that we'll ask the
people on the benches to get

01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:34.970
up push the benches and move
away so we can have you come by

01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:36.470
and as I always say we'll be happy

01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:38.910
to show you anything
you'd like to see.

01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:43.300
And also before you if you find
yourself leaving there are two

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:47.230
bookmarks here advertising
events of the Museum of Women

01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:52.590
in the Arts booklet arts
related that are coming up soon

01:05:52.590 --> 01:05:58.370
but let's have questions
for our speaker if you will.

01:05:58.370 --> 01:06:03.180
&gt;&gt; Valerie Lester: Don't
you want to go to Parma now?

01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:05.340
It's lovely, lovely, really lovely.

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:06.640
Oh, silenced them with that last.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:08.280
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Why
don't we clear the room.

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:11.270
We'll have some time you can
talk with Valerie afterwards

01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:12.570
but let's thank her again.

01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:14.370
That was really --

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:19.550
[ Applause ]

01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:23.210
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
