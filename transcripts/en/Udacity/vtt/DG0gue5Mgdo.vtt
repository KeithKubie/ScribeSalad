[Norvig] But we don't just have 1 property class; we have 5 property classes.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We've got the nationalities and the pets and so on.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And so if we want to make all the different ways of making assignments

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of all 5 properties to all 5 houses

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
so each house will have a color, a nationality, a pet and so on

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in each of the possible ways of making that assignment,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
how many is that?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Is it 5 times 5 factorial;

00:00:26.000 --> 09:59:59.000
5 factorial squared; 5 factorial to the 5th; or 5 factorial factorial?
