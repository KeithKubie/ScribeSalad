00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:05.339
("Hail to the Chief"
by James Sanderson)

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.040
- Hello my fellow Americans,

00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:09.476
this is my anger
translator, Luther.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.677
- Hi.

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:12.479
- Today is Martin
Luther King, Jr. day.

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:15.048
A day in which we
celebrate a great leader.

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:16.984
- And all y'all do is
remember him one day a year

00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:18.118
and then name some
lame ass streets

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:19.786
after him, fuck y'all.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.389
- Now more than ever, it's
important that we remember

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:23.624
his message of peace.

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:25.192
- And I will punch
you in the mouth

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.194
if you do not remember
Martin Luther King, Jr.'s

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:27.861
message of peace.

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:29.429
(karate yelling)

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:32.065
- He taught us that one
man can raise awareness

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.734
and make social change.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.135
- Because of Martin
Luther King, Jr.

00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:36.904
I can walk into any
white man's house

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:39.106
without invitation and
say, "This my house now.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:40.174
"Get the fuck out."

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:41.608
- Nope, nope, no you can't.

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:42.576
- You cannot do that, Luther.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:45.646
Stop making shit up, damn!

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.715
- I mean, you haven't
done that, right?

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:51.084
- I got to make
some phone calls.
