00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.850
Although using the standard error of the estimate can help us assess the

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.090
accuracy of our predictions. We can make even more accurate predictions by

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.260
computing confidence intervals for our predicted values, our y-hats. In other

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.000
words, when we get our regression line, we have our expected value which is

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.720
this y-hat naught, for a specified value x-naught. However, the actual value

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.440
might be anything from up here, to down here, or it might be exactly equal to

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.120
our predicted value. Therefore, we might want a confidence interval around our

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.440
expected value for where the actual value might be. Similarly, we might want a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.440
confidence interval for the true slope. We'll have a certain regression line

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.030
and we'll have calculated the slope for that regression line based on our

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.180
sample data. And this is just an example, the slope could be this, or flatter

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.080
down to here. A confidence interval for a slope can tell us the range for which

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.739
the true population's slope might be. You won't actually calculate the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.140
confidence interval in this lesson, because we're going to assume that you'll

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.340
use a computer to get it. The important thing is that you know what it means.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.810
For example, let's say we have some sample data that looks like this. We

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.215
calculate that the regression line is y equals bx plus a. Some slope and some

00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:28.900
intercept. But let's say then that we're able to look at all the population

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.720
data. And it looks like this. Now it looks to be slightly downward sloping.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.799
Since we're assuming this is the true regression line, we'll use the common

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.500
notation for the regression coefficients for the population. Oh, and these

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.040
should have hats since they're the predicted values. If this were the case,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.490
where the sample regression line is positively sloping. But the true regression

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.120
line for the population is negatively sloping. That would mean that the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.399
confidence interval for b has a negative lower bound and a positive upper

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:07.050
bound. It includes zero within this range. Therefore, if we run a two-tailed

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.030
hypothesis test for whether or not the slope is equal to zero. We would fail to

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.990
reject the null, meaning there's no evidence that there's a linear relationship

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.260
between x and y based on that sample. In fact, let's get more into hypothesis

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.300
testing for slope.
