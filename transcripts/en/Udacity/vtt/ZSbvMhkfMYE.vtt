00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.810
And here is the illustration
of this example.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.390
The user logs into bank.com and
keeps a session alive.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.100
So the browser has
the cookie to bank.com.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.355
Meanwhile, the user is phished
to visit attacker.com.

00:00:12.355 --> 00:00:16.743
And in return, the web browser
gets this malicious content.

00:00:16.743 --> 00:00:20.732
When this malicious page is
displayed on the user's browser,

00:00:20.732 --> 00:00:25.190
the browser will make the request
on the user's behalf to bank.com.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.740
And since the user is still
logged into bank.com,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.930
the user's cookie is also sent to
bank.com along with the request.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.275
And so the bank website believes that
the request is from the user, and

00:00:37.275 --> 00:00:39.470
therefore, the payment
request is fulfilled.
