00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.550
Let's see if we can name
this guy right here.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.790
In all of these problems, I
guess you can call them, we

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.456
look for the longest chain or
the longest ring, and this one

00:00:09.456 --> 00:00:10.490
is pretty obvious here.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.130
The ring in the middle is
clearly the longest carbon

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.830
structure here.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.470
It has one, two, three,
four, five, six,

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.800
seven, eight carbons.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.020
Let me highlight that.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.570
It is eight carbons, so we will
be you using the prefix

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.830
oct-, and it is in a cycle, so
it will be cyclooct-, and it's

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.500
all single bonds, so
it's cyclooctane.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.106
This right here tells us that
our core is cyclooctane.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.890
Now let's look at the different
subgroups or the

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.660
different branches off
of the main ring.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.760
Over here, we have a one, two,
three, four-carbon group.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.040
It is in a cycle or it's in
a ring, so this is cyclo-.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.420
Four carbons are but-,
cyclobutyl, -yl because it's a

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.710
subgroup or it's off of the main
chain or the main ring,

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.390
so that is our cyclobutyl
right there.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.000
We also have another cyclobutyl
right here, four

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.330
carbons in a ring, so that's
another cyclobutyl.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.400
Up here, we have three
carbons in a cycle.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.920
The prefix for three carbons
is prop-, so this is

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.170
cyclopropyl.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.070
Then down here, let's start with
the common names, because

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.020
those tend to be a little
bit easier.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.850
We have one, two, three,
four carbons.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.520
Actually, we have it
there and there.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.330
One, two, three, four, these
are the same groups.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.800
We're going to be dealing with
but- if we do common names,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.110
and you see it has
this Y shape.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.255
We're kind of connected to the
base of the Y in either case,

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:05.790
so we are dealing
with isobutyl.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.070
The Y shape tells us that we're

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.500
dealing with iso-, isobutyl.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.530
That's both of these
right there.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.020
Now, we have to figure out how
we're going to number, where

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.520
we're going to number ourselves
on this ring.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.770
And to do that, we look for
the group that is first

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.590
alphabetically.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.200
This is a little bit of a
confusing point sometimes.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.940
If this was a tert-butyl or
sec-butyl, we would consider

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.900
the B, but when it's isobutyl,
it's all considered one word,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.370
so we'll consider the I.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.950
We need to compare the I to the
C, to the C, to the C, so

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.170
the C's definitely
win out on the I.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.580
If we look at all of these
cyclos, cyclobutyl definitely

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.350
takes precedence over
cyclopropyl.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.960
It comes first alphabetically.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.350
Let's make our starting point
this cyclobutyl, although you

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.150
could have made it that
cyclobutyl as well, so we'll

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.880
make that our starting point.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.220
We're going to go in a clockwise
direction, so that

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.690
we could get to this one first,
so that the next group

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.580
is only going to be a two.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.260
Otherwise, the next group would
have been at three.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:24.050
So one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, so this is a

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.960
1-cyclobutyl.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.230
This is a 6-cyclobutyl.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.590
This is a 7-cyclopropyl.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.580
This is a 2-isobutyl, so this is
a 2-isobutyl and this is a

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.850
4-isobutyl.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.090
We want to write them all
in alphabetical order.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.160
The cyclobutyls win, so we
have a cyclobutyl at one.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.130
We have a 1-cyclobutyl.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.320
We also have a 6-cyclobutyl.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.900
we have two of them, so
it is dicyclobutyl.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.820
Let me capitalize since that's
where we're starting.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.580
So we got those two guys out
of the way, and then

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.620
alphabetically, cyclopropyl
is next, so then we have a

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.980
7-cyclopropyl.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.120
Let me do that in that orange
color of the cyclopropyl.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:25.660
7-cyclopropyl, got that
guy out of the way.

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.610
Then at two and four we
have an isobutyl.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.570
We have a 2,4-, and we have
two of them, so it is

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:49.160
diisobutyl, and then finally
cyclooctane.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.320
We got the 2,4-diisobutyls out
of the way, and then we have

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.540
our cyclooctane, so I'll just
write the cyclooctane.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:02.810
And we're done.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.420
This was the common naming.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.370
Now, if we want to do systematic
naming, we would

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.460
have to use something else
other than the isobutyl.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.010
And to do that, let me
do that over here.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.300
What you do is you use your
connection point as one, and

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.520
you just branch.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.240
Let me do this in a color I
haven't used for before.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.510
Green.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.370
So let's make that our core
chain, so that is one, two,

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.990
three, carbons, so it's propyl,
and then on the second

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.650
carbon, on the number two carbon
that we are attached

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.720
to, you have a methyl group.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.970
So this is 1-methylpropyl.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.690
That's what each of these--
that's a 1-methypropyl and

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.810
then that is a 1-methylpropyl.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.280
Another way to think about, an
isobutyl is the same thing as

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.070
a 1-methylpropyl.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.330
This is the propyl part, and
then this right here-- let me

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.250
do that in that color--
that right there

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.780
is the methyl part.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.370
Oh, sorry, this isn't
a 1-methlypropyl.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.790
Let me be very careful
with my numbering.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.780
This is the one carbon, two
carbon, three carbon.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.090
The methyl comes off of
the second carbon.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.200
So this is a 2-methylpropyl:
one, two, three.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.400
Methyl comes off of
the second carbon.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.070
This is a 2-methylpropyl
group.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.620
And now when we look at it
alphabetically, methylpropyl

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.550
still comes after cyclobutyl, so
it definitely won't change

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.790
the numbering of things, and so
it still would be last. It

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.480
also comes after cyclopropyl.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.360
If we were to do the systematic
naming, it would be

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.040
1,6-dicyclo-- there's something
very strangely fun

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.290
about this-- dicyclobutyl.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.670
Then you have your cyclopropyl,
7-cyclopropyl.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.960
It's like a secret code.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.200
And then you have your-- now,
this is interesting.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.340
You have two of these
guys, right?

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.150
Now you don't say di- when you
have this kind of more complex

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.000
naming or this systematic
naming.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.590
Instead you use the word
bis-, so we have bis-.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.790
So let me write it.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:21.930
We're at two and four,
2,4-bis, this thing.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.180
I can just bis-(2-methylpropyl).

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.940
So this part right here
is the exact part as

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.970
that part right there.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:37.990
This the common name.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.980
This is the systematic naming.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.250
And then we have our
cyclooctane.
