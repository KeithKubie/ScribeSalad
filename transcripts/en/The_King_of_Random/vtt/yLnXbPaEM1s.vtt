00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.180
[Captions by Jeffrey D. at Y Translator]
Hey guys in today's video,

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.920
we're trying out an idea
suggested to us by Todd Crowell.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.360
Who wants to know if we can make 
a ninja ball full of ooze?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.680
[Intro music plays]

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.400
Here's the basic plan.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.100
We already know how to make
a ninja ball using flour as filling,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.589
but we're gonna try
and mixing up a batch of ooze,

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.300
and seeing if we can fill
the balloons with that instead.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.460
Will we get the same type of ninja ball?

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.400
Will it have the same
squishing properties?

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.180
Or will we find something else?

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.000
First off, let's run through
a refresher course

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.100
on how to make the standard
flour-filled ninja balls.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.660
We've got a bottle
with a fairly wide neck at the top,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.220
and then a regular water bottle
that I've cut in half.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.840
Let's use measuring cup
and add Â¾ of a cup of flour

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.860
into our bottle.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.140
Now by tapping our funnel bottle,
all of the flour will drain down

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.500
into the wide necked bottle.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.440
With our 3/4 of a cup of flour
in our wide neck bottle,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.100
we now need to blow up
a balloon just a little bit.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.960
It doesn't need to be very full.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.680
[Music]

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.180
That'll work.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.760
Once we've blown it up.
We want to twist it -- about four times

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.780
to really make sure
that the neck is pinched off,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.240
and no air can escape.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.030
After twisting we want to stretch the neck

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.880
of the balloon over the neck of the bottle
at which point we can let it untwist.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.180
So, it's just got equal pressure
inside the balloon and the bottle.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.120
Once we're at that step,
we can hold the neck in place,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.400
flip the bottle upside down
and start squeezing the flour down

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.280
into the balloon.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.420
Let's pinch off the neck of the balloon

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.120
and remove it from the bottle,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.520
and then slowly begin
to let out the extra air.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.440
At this point
all the floursâ€™ light and fluffy

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.100
and full of air.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.420
So, if we're not careful, some of that flour
could just start shooting up

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.900
out of the neck of the balloon like this:

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.420
We don't really want that to happen.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.460
We want our flour to stay in the balloon.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.520
So once all the extra air is gone,
pinch the balloon off

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.520
and then start squeezing the flour
around inside the balloon.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.900
This will help remove any excess air,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.900
and we can then let that
escape out of the top.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.300
Once we have all the extra air
squeezed out of our balloon,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.380
we need to cut the neck off.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.400
We'll probably have a little bit
of flour spill when that happens,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.380
but that's not a problem.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.860
Now, see we've got our flour
filling up our balloon.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.420
We now need to seal that in there
so it doesn't leak everywhere.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.260
Let's grab another balloon
of the same color

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.580
and cut the neck off of it as well.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.900
We now need to take
this second balloon,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.860
stretch the neck of it open,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.740
and wrap it all the way around
the flour filled balloon.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.060
The flour is now sealed inside
and can't escape,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.120
but just to give it a little bit
of extra strength and durability,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.640
let's take one more balloon
and wrap that around as well.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.000
We now have a nice squishy ball
that does this kind of weird thing

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.620
where it almost holds it shape
into what you squish it into.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.180
These are great as stress balls
or if you're learning to juggle,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.160
they work well for that.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.260
There's a final decorative
element we can add:

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.860
which is why we call them ninja balls.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.220
It's sort of a ninja mask

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.160
for the stress ball.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.040
Let's take one more balloon
of a different color,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.060
cut the neck off,
and then cut some more holes in it,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.440
that will allow us to stretch it over
and give us a cool mask effect.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.980
One hole cut in the top,
one in the bottom,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.120
one on each side,
and then we can fold it in half

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.920
and add a final cut.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.540
We now have a balloon
that's been sort of turned

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.200
into a rubber ninja mask.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.780
We can stretch that over our ball,

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.260
and we've now given our little stress ball

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.000
something of a ninja mask.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:21.800
[Music]

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.900
That, is how you make
the regular ninja balls using flour.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.260
And now, we want to see
if we can do the same thing

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.480
but using slime rather than flour.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.100
Will it give us a similar texture?

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.740
Will it still hold its shape
when you squish them down?

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.520
What's gonna be the same
and what is going to be different?

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.180
First let's mix up some ooze.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.600
We've got one cup of water.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.060
Now, we need to add
1/2 teaspoon of borax.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.940
Next, we need half a cup of water
and five ounces of clear glue.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.440
Now this ooze
is probably gonna end up

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.680
inside of a balloon.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.340
So whether or not it has color
might not make a difference,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.840
but it's a lot more fun.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.840
So we're going to add some color.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.540
Also adding the color helps you see

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.070
when the glue
and the water are mixed together.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.960
So that's another plus.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.560
That looks pretty well mixed.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.720
So now we need to combine our two:

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.520
We've got our borax solution,
and our glue solution.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.080
These of course start mixing
and forming our ooze very quickly.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.560
Gets to a point
where it really just makes more sense

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.320
to use your hands than a spoon.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.760
[Music]

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.360
Now, we need to figure out a way
to get this slime inside of a balloon,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.920
and I think we're gonna try
mostly the same techniques.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.660
Although, I think we can probably
cut out the water bottle funnel,

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.240
and just sort of force the slime down
into the wide mouth bottle.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.480
All right, I'm just gonna see
if I can start pulling off pieces

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.160
of our slime and letting them turn
into sort of long stringy bits

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.040
and fitting them down inside the bottle.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.060
Whoo!

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.760
One big old bottle full of ooze.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.500
That's pretty cool.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.720
Now we need to try
and squeeze that into a balloon.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.660
Same method as before.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.360
We'll blow it up, twist it off,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.140
fit it over the neck of the bottle.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.140
Now we just have to hope

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.200
that we can get our ooze out of the bottle,
down into the balloon.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.120
[Laughs]

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.880
Well it's in the neck of the balloon?
There's a little bit of ooze

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.680
just sort of stuck there
and it's sort of dangling down

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.360
into the main body of the balloon.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.560
All right so my thought is that,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.340
maybe we can fit more
of the neck of the balloon over the bottle.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.200
So, it's just going directly
into the wide part of the balloon.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.360
There we go.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.260
You can see the neck of the bottle
Is now entirely inside the balloon.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.200
Hopefully, that'll let us squeeze
our ooze more to where we want it.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.460
Get in there, ooze!

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.120
[Baloon noise]

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.880
That's a fun noise.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.420
Okay, that right there

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.640
looks like about the right amount.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.940
I think we're gonna try this.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.320
Pretty similar in size.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.080
The ooz doesn't try and squeeze itself
out the top like a flour does.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.060
Ooop! Now it's trying to escape.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.620
Stay in there, ooze!

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.980
I need to get another balloon
on there before it all escapes.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.320
I have to keep my finger on it
until I get that of the balloon on.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.360
Otherwise it just decides:
"I'm leaving!"  and erupts out.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.340
I can tell you one thing for sure:

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.140
This is definitely more troublesome
with ooze than it is with flour.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.420
Flour isn't actively trying to escape
all the time.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.140
I think I got it, that was tricky!

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.920
And one more layer just for safety
which should be a lot easier

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.520
since I no longer have to hold it in
with one finger

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.860
while I'm trying to do everything else
with the rest of my hands.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.980
There we go,
nice and contained.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.700
Now let's just give it a ninja mask.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:07:00.400
[Music]

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.420
Preliminary results.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.320
We now have a ninja ball
that is full of ooze.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.660
It's blue ooze which might not make
a difference inside the blue balloons,

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.950
and we can compare that to our
ninja ball full of flour; which is standard.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.620
Uhh... They feel about the same,
they weigh about the same.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.580
But even when
I'm just lightly holding them,

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.820
I can feel that there's a difference.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.260
The one made of flour feels solid

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.420
until you really squish it,

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.760
at which point it has an interesting give,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.920
and kind of holds its shape
after you've squished it.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.400
The ninja ball full of ooze
has more give initially

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.700
and then when you squeeze it:

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.680
it bounces back into shape a lot more.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.660
It doesn't stay flattened
the way you can do with flour.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.700
See that the flower ninja ball
really flattens out,

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.880
and the ooze ninja ball
just kind of bounces back.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.080
Speaking of bouncing,
that's another pretty clear difference.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.200
The ooze ball bounces,
whereas the flour ball

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.660
just sort of stops dead.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.120
Maybe has a tiny little bounce.
The ooze ball is just-- it's bouncy.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.340
I'm gonna make another one.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.700
Like a good size.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.720
Yeah, a little bit smaller than last time.
It's actually a little bit smaller

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.340
than our standard ones too,
but I want to see what the difference is

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.120
between an over-packed ninja ball
and the less packed ninja ball.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.040
And this one is still trying
to squish it out.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.310
I was hoping that by having less,
it would just stop trying to escape

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.380
but that's not the case.
It's still trying to escape.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.300
Get back in there.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.360
Stay. In. There!

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.400
So I still have to use one finger

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.340
to hold it closed

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.760
while use the rest of my hands

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.820
to prepare the other balloon.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.920
Here we go.
Two different sizes of a ninja ball.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.979
Full of the ooze and I'd say
they react about the same,

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:40.120
they feel about the same squishiness.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.390
They really have the more,

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.110
classic stress ball feel
when you use the flour.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:48.550
When you use the ooze you get --
it's still a good squishy ball.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.740
There's certainly nothing bad
about that for squishing stuff.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.320
Still works for juggling.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.540
I'm curious how much I can 
get it to bounce.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.160
So, I'm gonna try
and throw it really hard.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.100
[Music]

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.460
Got about, six feet of bounce.
Let's try the other one.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:09.200
[Music]

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.820
Ooh, that deformed it a little bit.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.120
We forced it out of some of its layers.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.440
Squished so hard
that some of the layers of the balloon

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.460
started pulling away in spots.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.760
Or it might have actually
just started ripping.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.440
Oh I think it did.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.500
Yeah, it started ripping that away.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.980
I just want to step on it till it pops.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:34.200
[Music]

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.140
Took quite a bit of effort.
I thought it was going to be

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.920
a little more fragile than that
but I basically had to jump on this

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.000
to get it pop open.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.300
So, I think if you're just playing around
with it unless you're on really rough

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.780
or scratchy or spiky surfaces,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.160
they'll probably be pretty durable.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.100

idea to try using our ninja ooze
