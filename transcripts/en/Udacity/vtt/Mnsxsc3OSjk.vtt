We just found out that the opposite sides of our quadrilateral in black here,

00:00:04.646 --> 00:00:09.110
are the same length. MN is equal to PQ and NP is equal to QM. But is there

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:13.744
anything else that is special about this black shape? You may remember from

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:18.693
Geometry that any quadrilateral whose opposite sides are equal to one another is

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:23.574
called a parallelogram. So, the opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:28.790
to one another or of equal length, but they are also something else. They are

00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:32.885
parallel to one another. But how can we tell they're parallel, mathematically?

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.997
And what does being parallel really mean? That's what we're going to look at

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.254
next.
