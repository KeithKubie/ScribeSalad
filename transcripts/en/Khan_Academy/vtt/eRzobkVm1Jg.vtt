00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.530
Welcome back.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.140
We're on problem
number twelve.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:13.880
The perimeter of a rectangular
plot of land is 250 meters.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.500
If the length of one side of the
plot is 40 meters, what is

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.960
the area of the plot
in square meters?

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.410
So let me draw a
rectangle here.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.189
We know that one side of
the plot is 40 meters.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.050
Well it's a rectangle.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.210
So if this side is 40,
then this side is

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.440
also going to be 40.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.700
And let's say we don't
know the other side.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.260
Well if this side is
x, this is also x.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.090
So what is the perimeter,
expressed in these terms?

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.750
What's 40 plus 40, which
is 80, plus x plus x.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.660
So if 80 plus 2x is the
perimeter, and we know that

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.850
the perimeter is 250.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.349
And so solving for x we get 2x
is equal to, what's 250 minus

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.920
80, that's 170.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:17.220
At that x is equal to 85.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.770
And now if we want to get the
area of this, we just multiply

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.350
the base times the height.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:30.550
So 85 times 40, put a 0 here,
and 4 times 5 is 20.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.930
4 times 8 is 32, plus 2 is 34.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.740
So the area is 3400
square meters.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.650
I hope I didn't do something
wrong with the math, but I

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.700
think you get the point.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.950
Next problem.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.420
Problem thirteen.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.410
A school ordered $600 worth
of light bulbs.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.340
Some of the light bulbs cost $1
each, and others cost $2.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.910
So some were $1, some
were $2 each.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:10.199
If twice as many $1 bulbs as
$2 bulbs were ordered, how

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:14.270
many light bulbs were ordered
all together?

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.410
Fascinating.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.850
So let's let x equal
number of $1 bulbs.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.950
I could introduce a variable y,
but I could just say that x

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.490
is the number of $1 bulbs, and
we know that twice as many $1

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.730
bulbs as $2 bulbs
were ordered.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.680
So how can I express the
number of $2 bulbs?

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.090
Well we know that twice
as many $1 bulbs were

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.220
ordered as $2 bulbs.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.530
So this would be
x divided by 2.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.470
There are half as many
$2 bulbs as $1 bulbs.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.290
And we know that if we add up
the total number of bulbs,

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.640
well actually we don't know.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.400
So what is the total cost if we
get x $1 bulbs, and if we

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.150
get x divided by 2 $2 bulbs?

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.120
What is going to be the
total cost of this?

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.143
Well, I'm going to get x $1
bulbs, and they're each going

00:03:13.143 --> 00:03:14.800
to cost $1.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.400
Plus, I'm going to get x over
2 $2 bulbs, and they're each

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.940
going to cost $2.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.040
And when I add it all up it's
going to equal $600.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.680
So x times 1 is, of course, x.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.060
And then x over 2 times 2,
that's lucky that worked out,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.990
plus x is equal to $600.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.150
So 2x is equal to 600.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.780
x is equal to 300.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.460
And they want to know
how many lightbulbs

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.210
were ordered all together.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:54.650
So we got 300 $1 bulbs, and we
got 1/2 as many $2 bulbs, x

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:55.450
divided by 2.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.370
So we got 150 $2 bulbs.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.490
So together we got 450 bulbs.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.740
Next problem.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.685
Image clear.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.850
I'll do it in a new color
so we don't get bored.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.550
Fourteen.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:32.440
If 4 times x plus y times x
minus y is equal to 40, and we

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.660
also know that x minus y is
equal to 20, what is the value

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.360
of x plus y?

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.510
Well, we know x minus y is equal
to 20, so we can just

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.540
substitute that right here.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.027
So then we get 4 times x plus y
times, instead of writing x

00:04:46.027 --> 00:04:51.510
minus y we can just write times
20, is equal to 40.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.390
Or, if we multiply 20 times 4,
we know that 80 times x plus y

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.700
is equal to 40.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.240
Then we know, divide both sides
by 80, and we get x plus

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.200
y is 40 over 80.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.905
Which is the same
thing as 1/2.

00:05:06.905 --> 00:05:08.060
And that's our answer.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.500
x plus y is equal to 1/2.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.750
Next problem.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.250
Fifteen.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.420
In a rectangular coordinate
system, that's what we're

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.600
familiar with, the center of a
circle has coordinates 5, 12.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.590
So I draw a circle, and then the
center of the circle has

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.840
the coordinates 5, 12.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.990
And the circle touches the
x-axis at one point only.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.580
What is the radius
of the circle?

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.710
So it just touches the x-axis.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.190
And the only place where it can
touch the x-axis only in

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.840
one point is this exact.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.690
Because the x-axis is
essentially a horizontal line.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.870
And where else can you
touch the x-axis?

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.650
You could touch it
here, on top.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.870
But if the x-axis was up here,
then the y coordinate would

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.940
not be positive.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.730
So this has a positive y
coordinate, so we know it has

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.300
to be above the x-axis,
it's at 12.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.690
So we know the only place where
you can touch the x-axis

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.850
just once is right here, just
right at the bottom.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.480
So it's gotta be like that.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.540
That's gotta be the x-axis.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.700
That could be the x-axis and
then the y-axis could be out

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.010
here someplace.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.610
Just so you have a frame
of reference.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.900
And if that's the x-axis,
then what's the radius?

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:39.920
Well, this is the point 5,
12, this is y equals 12.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.310
So what is this height?

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.980
This is a radius.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.450
Well that's just the
y-coordinate, it's 12.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.440
So the radius is equal to 12.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.790
They're just saying what is
the radius of the circle,

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:50.850
well, the radius is 12.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.890
It's the y-coordinate.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.140
Next problem.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.200
Whoops.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.840
I say whoops a lot.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.090
Problem sixteen.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:11.610
They have this men, women,
woman, and then they say

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.480
voting age population.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:21.850
So population, and then
registered, and they say 1200,

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:30.341
1000, 1300, and 1200.

00:07:30.341 --> 00:07:33.290
They say, the table above gives
the voter registration

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.060
data for the town of
Bridgeton at the

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.930
time of a recent election.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.280
In the election, 40%
of the voting age

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.880
population actually voted.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.430
So this is the voting
age population.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.400
And we know that 40%
actually voted.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.360
If the turnout for the election
is defined by the

00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:02.990
number who actually voted,
divided by registered, what

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.000
was the turnout for
this election?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.830
So what's the number
who actually voted?

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:10.310
It's 40% of the voting
age population.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.830
So what's the voting
age population?

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.310
Well the total population
is the men and

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.470
women, so that's 2500.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.740
Just add these two up.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.110
And what's 40% of 2500?

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:26.110
That's 2500 times 0.4.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.470
Let's see.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.800
4 times 25 is 100.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.590
Two more zeros.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.120
0, 0.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.710
And then, of course,
one decimal.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.370
So it's 1000.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.090
I just took 40% of 2500.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.950
1000 people voted.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.740
And if we want to know the
turnout, we just have to say

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.570
the number voted, which is
1000, divided by the

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.390
registered voters.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.890
Well the registered voters,
there's 1000 men, 1200 women,

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:53.780
so you add that up.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.310
That's 2200 total registered
voters.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:06.670
That's the same thing
as 10/22, or 5/11.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.360
That's our answer.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.410
That's the fraction
that voted.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.560
That's what they wanted.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.525
To find to be the fraction, so
you can write it as this

00:09:12.525 --> 00:09:14.630
fraction, 5/11.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:16.340
I'll see you in the next video,
hopefully I didn't make

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.090
them mad there.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.090
See you in the next video.
