00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.150
A baby's T-shirt requires 4/5
yards of fabric, or 4/5 of a

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.470
yard of fabric.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.190
How many T-shirts can be
made from 48 yards?

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.250
So what we want to do is we
essentially want to say how

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.430
many groups of 4/5 of a yard
can we make with 48 yards?

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.680
So you literally view this as
we want to take 48 yards and

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.810
divide it into groups of 4/5
of a yard, and say how many

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.610
groups are there?

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.430
Because each of those
groups can make

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.740
one to baby's T-shirt.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.110
If you give me 4/5 of a yard,
one baby's T-shirt, so the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.720
number of groups of 4/5 is the
number of babies' T-shirts.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.340
Now, when we divide by a
fraction, we just have to

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.970
remember that that is the same
thing, that is completely

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.030
equivalent to multiplying
times the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.365
reciprocal of the fraction.

00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:56.700
So if we have 4/5 here,
that'll be 5/4, the

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.660
reciprocal.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.960
Now, you still might say, hey, I
have a whole number here and

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.470
a fraction, and you just have
to remember any whole number

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.099
can be written as a fraction.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:11.340
This is the same thing
as 48/1 times 5/4.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.040
Now, we could just multiply it
out at this point and figure

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.380
out what 48 times 5 is and
that'll be over 4, but that'll

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.650
get big numbers and it'll be
hard to kind of divide and all

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.700
that, but we could divide at
this stage right here.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.230
We could divide the numerator
and the denominator by 4.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.240
Or we could say, look, this is
going to be equal to 48 times

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.070
5, whatever that is, over 4.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.370
Now, let's divide the
numerator by 4.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.500
Well, we could divide 48 by 4,
and we will get to 12, and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.090
whatever we did to the
numerator, we have to do to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.750
the denominator, so if we
divide 4 by 4, we get 1.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.090
So then we're left with 12 times
5, which is equal to 60.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.820
12 times 5, which is equal to
60/1, which is the exact same

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.540
thing as 60.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.960
So you can actually make 60
children's or babies' T-shirts

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.300
from 48 yards if each of
them use 4/5 of a yard.
