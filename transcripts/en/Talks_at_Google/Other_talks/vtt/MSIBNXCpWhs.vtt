00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740
&gt;&gt; Hi everybody. I'm Claire Johnson and I
know some of you [laughs] and I work in online

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.759
sales, in the sales organization, and I'm
very excited to introduce one of our "Authors

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.420
 @ Google" speakers because she is a friend
of mine and Amy and I went to business school

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.360
together now a long time ago [laughs] which
is like shocking to me now and I will say

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.050
that one of the things that you - if you've
heard anything about her book or read the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.750
bio in the announcements about this talk is
Amy is true to her background which is highly

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.460
creative, versatile person who proves that
an MBA is not a death sentence on your creativity

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.730
or your ability to think across functions
and what I would say is if you think about

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.250
what she's done before business school working
in museums and then after working both in

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.370
very unique finance companies as well as getting
an art degree in - I think in painting as

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.899
well as doing some work again but more on
the strategy for the tape in London, I think

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.149
you'll see that she shows sort of a proof
that you can move around and probably add

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.719
a lot of value because you're breaking down
a silo across organizations. And one of the

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:20.520
things that I think we try to do at Google,
and I think largely we're successful but sometimes

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.399
we're not, is to think beyond our current
place, whether that's with a product or when

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.319
we think about innovation and how we reach
our advertisers in a lot of dimensions. So

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:37.389
I think what Amy is going to do today is talk
 -- give a little bit of a talk that she has

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:43.779
tailored for this Google audience and also
then read from "Museum Legs" which is her

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:48.360
latest project in addition to some other side
projects that she was filling me in on last

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.929
night and I would just say there are people
you'll meet in your life who make you think

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:58.050
differently and ask you questions that make
you reconsider sort of your world view and

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.079
Amy is one of them and I hope – and I imagine
she will do that for all of you today so with

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:08.149
that, Amy Whitaker, author of "Museum Legs".
[applause]

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.739
Amy Whitaker: Thanks so much for being here.
Thanks Pepe and everyone else for hosting

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:21.600
me and thanks Claire for the kind introduction.
I would say likewise when you -- if you decide

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.269
to go business school, you show up, and there
are people there and you think, 'Wow, do I

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.819
get to business school with people like this?',
and

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.909
Claire is definitely that person so - I am
going to talk a little bit about a book called

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:39.130
"Museum Legs" and I'm going to start by giving
a little bit of background on why I wrote

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.739
the book and contextualizing it in a larger
concept of art and creativity. If, if at any

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:52.930
point I'm hard to hear, just raise a hand
please and I'll speak up. So I started writing

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.349
this book many, many millions of years ago,
just out of business school when I noticed

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:04.590
two different things happening at the same
time. One is that this is around 2001 and

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.129
museums were expanding architecturally at
record rates and they also had record breaking

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.600
numbers of visitors. At one point in time,
there were 52 pending expansion projects in

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.750
the United States alone that would have added
4 million square feet of exhibition space

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.930
at a combined cost of 4 billion dollars which
is I think double the operating budget of

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.920
the two hundred largest museums in the United
States. So I was noticing this at the same

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.670
time. Every time I took my friends to museums
they looked a little bit more like this so

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.069
this is a classic case of numbers or success
metrics on the one hand and stories or experiential

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.810
knowledge on the other and I wanted to be
able to reconcile these things and the first

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.879
thing I learned is that museum fatigue is
not a new concept at all. There's a wonderful

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:59.069
man named Benjamin Ives Gilman who wrote a
book in 1918 called "Museum Ideals of Purpose

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:05.360
and Method" and he devoted an entire chapter
to seats as preventatives of fatigue, these

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.079
wicker stools he thought everyone should carry
around. These are images illustrating the

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:16.480
fact that artwork is often hung at the wrong
height. He made an observation that still

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.250
holds true that museums are one of the only
areas of modern life where you are asked to

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.510
stand to concentrate and to sit to rest. Offices,
cinemas, theaters are all different from that.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.670
And the question remains how would you design
a museum that has original works of arts where

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.660
people could actually sit in front of them
and you could have more than five people in

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:46.160
a gallery at the same time. If you know an
answer to that, let me know. I haven't figured

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.340
it out myself. So I decided, given this conundrum,
that I would write not for the policy architects

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.880
of museums but for people who go to them.
I thought that the fact my friends were getting

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.030
bored and tired in museums might be a marker
of what is essentially political disenfranchisement,

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.180
this idea of feeling a little bit left out
of the

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:10.840
conversation around, especially contemporary
art. So the book took this form as academically

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.400
researched. I was lucky to have a Harvard
library card at the time I started but also

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:22.340
written in this more anecdotal personal format.
So skepticism toward modern art is nothing

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.880
new, it's been around as long as modern art
has been in the United States. It made its

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.150
debut in what's called "The Armory Show" in
1913 when a bunch of people who'd seen groundbreaking

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.600
modern work in Europe decided to bring it
to New York. This is what the installation

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.020
of the show looked like and it was so controversial
at the time that Theodore Roosevelt, among

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:51.130
others, took the time to write about it and
I just want to read a quick passage of what

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.350
Theodore Roosevelt wrote.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.090
[pause]

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:04.160
He, as you might imagine, is a very gracious
man so he thanked the organizers profusely

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.230
and then went on to say that "the lunatic
fringe was fully in evidence. The Cubists

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.860
are entitled to the serious attention of all
who find enjoyment in the colored puzzle pictures

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.870
of the Sunday newspapers. There is no reason
why people should not call themselves Cubists

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.240
or Octagonists or Knights of the Isosceles
Triangle or Brothers of the Cosine, if they

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:32.540
so desire; as expressing anything serious
or permanent, one term is as fatuous as another."

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:39.160
He went on the compare the now iconic painting
"Nude Descending a Staircase #2" unfavorably

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:45.910
to a Navajo rug in his own bathroom.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:52.760
"If you wanted to call the rug 'a well dressed
man going up a ladder' the name would in fact

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.210
fit the facts just about as well as in the
case of the Cubist picture of the naked man

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.050
going downstairs. From the standpoint of terminology,
each name would have whatever merit inheres

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.820
in a rather
cheap straining after effect; and from the

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.500
standpoint of decorative value, of sincerity,
and of artistic merit, the Navajo rug is infinitely

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:19.461
ahead of the picture." This kind of skepticism
still exists. This is a work by Joseph Boyes

00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:24.270
called "Lightning Stag". I have the dubious
distinction of having accidentally seen almost

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.340
every version of it in the world. This is
it up close. I have a friend who refers to

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.870
it as an Olympic turd and these are people
in the installation; this is "Lightning Stag"

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:39.280
over here. So these are the people that the
book is really for and if you're asking a

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.840
question of why museums bore or tire people,
what you're really asking is why that matters.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:50.870
No one would write or read a whole book about
tiredness by definition and to me it matters

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:56.020
for two other reasons and one is that political
life of museums as institutions and the other

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:01.140
is the widespread presence of creativity as
a basic human attribute. So I like to call

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:08.331
these the first principles of art; visual
thinking, imagination, and creativity. Visual

00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:13.680
thinking; we live in one of the most visually
overwhelming cultures of all time. We're constantly

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.460
making sense of the built environment. We
even create machines that can read things

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:25.530
like this and machines that can read things
like this. They scan for zip codes and where

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:30.090
they fail, there are people that have crazy
brains that remember all of the zip codes

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:38.120
in the United States and they serve the same
function. This conversely is from a company

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.810
that will hand address junk mail so that it
gets

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:47.820
opened so then we're having to decide if this
looks like someone we know sent it or it looks

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:53.001
like a magazine subscription offer. In fact,
almost everything that exists in the world,

00:08:53.001 --> 00:08:59.960
with the exception of abstract expressionists
paintings, is drawn before it comes into existence.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.970
This is a Rubik cube. Almost
every patent application has an attached drawing.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:13.250
This is the 1939 Museum of Modern Art Building.
At MoMA, it's probably one of the great art

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:18.380
projects of the 20th century. It was founded
by three women who met by accident and opened

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:26.230
the doors ten days after the Stock Market
Crash of 1929. Between 1929 and 1939, they

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:31.490
didn't have a permanent home. That's the model
for the building and a lot of people will

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:36.430
say I'm not really an artist, I can't draw,
I can't draw a stick figure. These are, I

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:40.810
think, exquisite stick figures by an artist,
David Shrigley, and if you really think that

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:48.530
you can't draw consider that you have a signature.
So one of the most basic parts about drawing

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:54.870
is that it requires present mindedness of
actually noticing the world around you, of

00:09:54.870 --> 00:10:02.610
actually looking at a vase well enough to
draw the specific contour of it and one of

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.390
the things that noticing and present mindedness
allows is innovation, essentially imagining

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:12.300
relative to what's there and what's possible
and the example I'm using here of imagination

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.890
is a man named Roger Bannister. Some of you
probably know who he is. Roger Bannister was

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:23.760
the first person to run a mile in under four
minutes. At the time he did it, in May of

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:30.530
1954, people thought it was physically impossible
as if a law of nature that you could not run

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:34.750
that fast. He did it with help from his friends
and a lucky day of weather and last minute

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:41.150
encouragement from a coach he happened to
bump into and after he did it, he only held

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:48.030
the record for 45 days before he was beat
by a bunch of other people and now the current

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:53.700
world record in the mile is 3 minutes and
46 seconds so there's this kind of basic notion

00:10:53.700 --> 00:11:02.630
of progress, that something seems absolutely
impossible, someone demonstrates it,

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.600
and then a lot of people best that effort.
Another example of imagination; this is a

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.950
man named George Fairchild. George Fairchild
grew up in a very poor sharecropping family

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:16.740
and reinvented himself a number of times over.
First as a publishing executive and then as

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:24.490
the Chairman of the company that became IBM.
So in 1916, when he was the Chairman of IBM,

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:30.270
the company was first listed on the New York
Stock Exchange. So imagine the feeling of

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.840
being at a pinnacle of achievement at that
point and then imagine how much technology

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:41.140
and IBM has changed since then. So imagination
and creativity have this notion of a kind

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:46.760
of point and time at which someone is making
a creative work but a much longer arch of

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.920
how that might be interpreted and museums
are often kind of taking the more aerial view

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:56.230
as opposed to the person in the woods starting
at a tree view of creativity where you are

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:02.110
often appreciating something from a great
distance and this is just a reminder that

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:07.339
creativity and imagination are everywhere
and they're a lot messier and unpredictable

00:12:07.339 --> 00:12:14.110
then one might think looking at them in hindsight.
As one more example, some of you, I'm sure,

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:21.330
know this man better then I do. This is Whitfield
Diffie. He is the computer scientist who is

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:27.330
largely credited with inventing public and
private key encryption and what I really appreciate

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:33.830
about his story is that Diffie, first of all,
didn't learn to read until he was ten years

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:39.050
old and then it wasn't seen as a big deal.
He plowed through a book and subsequently

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:46.810
learned about ciphers in the 5th grade and
took a great interest in cryptography when

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:52.630
he was an adult. He read a 1,200 page book
called "The Code Breakers" and then spent

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:56.910
1973 driving around the country in a Datsun
510 visiting libraries; this is pre Internet;

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:03.570
to read all the books he could find on encryption.
He ended up in the Stanford campus, had a

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:10.670
half hour meeting that led to a research appointment,
and a PhD application. He had all this training

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:15.540
in what is essentially the craft of computer
science. He'd studied artificial intelligence

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:21.690
but the actual moment of creative breakthrough
came in May of 1975 when he was living in

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:27.240
the house of a professor John McCarthy, also
an artificial intelligence pioneer, acting

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:38.360
as a "house husband" taking care of McCarthy's
daughter so this is how this breakthrough

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:44.070
is described. Diffie's routine at the time
was to fix Mary, his wife, whom he met on

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:49.589
the Datsun drive through breakfast before
she went to work at her job analyzing geologic

00:13:49.589 --> 00:13:54.220
findings at British Petroleum. Then he would
spend the rest of the day alternating between

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:59.200
domestic chores and research. Sometime during
that afternoon he altered the course of cryptography

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.481
by "splitting the key." So this is Diffie
talking about his experience. "The thing I

00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:07.850
remember distinctly is that I was sitting
in the living room when I thought of it the

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:12.590
first time and then I went downstairs to get
a Coke and I almost lost it. I mean, there

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:17.360
was this moment when I was thinking about
something. What was it? And then I got it

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:24.750
back and didn't forget it." So this is the
notion of creativity that I think is so important

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:30.779
and that is what museums are important in
relation to and I just want to - I'm going

00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:36.130
to keep showing this to replicate my own experience
of bumping into it in museums all over the

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:43.220
world. So the thing about this work is that
the artist, Joseph Boyes, is the person who

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:47.440
most famously said that everyone is an artist
and that comment can seem a little bit rich

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.649
coming from someone who mostly worked in felt
and lard, this piece excepted but I think

00:14:53.649 --> 00:14:57.069
that there's a lot of truth in it and I want
to just go through two examples before I read

00:14:57.069 --> 00:15:05.930
a passage from the book. So, does anyone know
who this is a picture of?

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.020
&gt;&gt; Frank Lloyd Wright.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.860
Amy Whitaker: It's Winston Churchill. He's
a person who liked to smoke a cigar while

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:15.420
painting. So we think of Winston Churchill
as a savior of the free world because of his

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:21.390
role as the Prime Minister and Minister of
Defense during World War II. In 1915, he left

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:26.240
a job as the First Lord of the Admiralty.
He truly thought his career in politics was

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.160
over and he took up painting as a hobby.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.240
[pause]

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:39.160
Here he is again, I love the cigar. These
are what his paintings looked like and he

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.459
says - he wrote an essay called "Painting
as a Past Time" and I'm just going to read

00:15:42.459 --> 00:15:48.730
a short bit starting from here. "I hope this
is modest enough: because there is no subject

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:53.540
on which I feel more humble or yet at the
same time more natural. I do not presume to

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.550
explain how to paint, but only how to get
enjoyment. Do not turn the superior eye of

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:01.480
critical passivity upon these efforts. Buy
a paint box and have a try.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.580
[pause]

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.779
[background talking]

00:16:04.779 --> 00:16:09.300
It would be a sad pity to shuffle or scramble
along through one's playtime with golf and

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.839
bridge, pottering, loitering, shifting from
one heel to the other, wondering what on earth

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:18.399
to do - as perhaps is the fate of some unhappy
beings - when all the while, if you only knew,

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:23.470
there is close at hand a wonderful new world
of though and craft, a sunlight garden gleaming

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:30.540
with light." So I think that again, this point
in time of creativity, Churchill had no idea

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:36.380
that his life would probably be his greatest
work of art and that 25 years after he left

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:41.990
this position, he would be called to so much
more governmental duty and I think all of

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.649
us probably have the kind of elastic possibility
but it's hard to be reminded of it all the

00:16:46.649 --> 00:16:54.590
time. This is Alfred Barr, also a consummate
artist. Alfred Barr happens to be the founding

00:16:54.590 --> 00:17:00.120
director of the Museum of Modern Art. He was
chosen when he was 27 years old and they plucked

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:05.539
him out of a teaching job at Wellesley College.
He was recommended by a man named Paul Sachs

00:17:05.539 --> 00:17:10.299
who used to teach a legendary connoisseurship
class at Harvard. Paul Sachs happens also

00:17:10.299 --> 00:17:15.659
to have been a retired Goldman Sachs partner
who was related to both Goldman and Sachs.

00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:21.259
Alfred Barr essentially fashioned an entire
museum from scratch, working closely with

00:17:21.259 --> 00:17:25.699
these three women who were the founders. He
modeled the multi-departmental plan after

00:17:25.699 --> 00:17:32.860
the syllabus of his own course and he was
so pioneering that in 1943 they stone cold

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:37.850
fired him. They thought he was not being enough
of a scholar when he in fact he was being

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:43.779
a professional manager. Barr had such loyalty
to the institution, he stayed on at half his

00:17:43.779 --> 00:17:51.279
salary and a title of Director of Collections.
They much later realized what he had done

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:59.639
and honored him but he basically created an
institution that grew to a public scale and

00:17:59.639 --> 00:18:05.259
I'll just give you two quick examples of that.
MoMA has one of the best known photography

00:18:05.259 --> 00:18:09.820
departments in the world. The way the photography
department came about, and I say this to people

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:17.369
who work for one of the most creative start
up companies of our generation, there is a

00:18:17.369 --> 00:18:22.739
man named Beaumont Newhall who was hired in
as the librarian. Beaumont Newhall wasn't

00:18:22.739 --> 00:18:27.230
getting paid very much and so Barr use to
give him extra work taking installation photos

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.651
so every time they had an exhibition, he'd
go around and take a picture of the gallery

00:18:30.651 --> 00:18:36.309
itself. So they didn't have a darkroom so
Beaumont Newhall used to develop the film

00:18:36.309 --> 00:18:41.320
in the men's room of the townhouse where they
were and one day Barr came up to him and said,

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.730
"What do you think about trying to host a
photography exhibition?" Long story short,

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:49.639
Beaumont quickly realized he was being tapped
to organize it and then it went well and he

00:18:49.639 --> 00:18:58.789
became the founding director of the department.
The second story is that in 1957 or 1958,

00:18:58.789 --> 00:19:05.840
the MoMA building actually caught on fire.
I have a picture of this. While members of

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:11.950
the trustees and senior staff were in standard
issue fire brigade helmets, members of the

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:17.129
public were standing across the street and
as a couple of people recalled they would

00:19:17.129 --> 00:19:23.221
unsolicitedly walk over and deposit a dollar
or five dollars on the membership desk and

00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:28.529
then leave. That kind of public sentiment
toward museums has probably not been engendered

00:19:28.529 --> 00:19:39.960
in this country for a long time. So the public
sentiment in this notion of trust in museums

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:45.470
is what this passage I'm about to read is
about so this is a piece from a chapter called

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:55.590
"The Insulated Judiciary" and I'll read several
pages, and then break, and then read a little

00:19:55.590 --> 00:20:05.309
bit from the Epilogue of the book. Can I switch
microphones mid stream? Okay. [pause] Can

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:14.999
you all hear me on this?
[talking in background] I'm sorry? Oh. [more

00:20:14.999 --> 00:20:26.859
talking in background and laughter] Umm, okay.
There are few things in life that can be counted

00:20:26.859 --> 00:20:32.519
upon, but one of them is that, if you are
in a museum standing in front of a work by

00:20:32.519 --> 00:20:37.159
Lucio Fontana, someone will probably be standing
next to you saying, “Anyone could paint

00:20:37.159 --> 00:20:41.499
that.” Of course, the person is using the
term “paint” loosely. Many of Fontana’s

00:20:41.499 --> 00:20:46.629
finest pieces are not exactly painted, per
se. They consist of canvases stretched over

00:20:46.629 --> 00:20:55.800
a frame, left raw or coated in a solid color
and then slit with a knife.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.800
[pause]

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.259
The canvas spreads and folds back at the slits,
a little like a loaf of bread dough about

00:20:59.259 --> 00:21:04.559
to be put in the oven. Fontana’s pieces
are lightning rods, seemingly put there to

00:21:04.559 --> 00:21:11.049
collect stray skepticism toward abstract art.
To its credit, Fontana’s work exhibits fastidious

00:21:11.049 --> 00:21:16.009
craftsmanship. It is harder than it looks
to slit a canvas that neatly or to paint it

00:21:16.009 --> 00:21:21.320
that uniformly. But his work still falls into
a long line of inadvertent rebuttals to the

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:26.350
idea that technical mastery, especially of
a representative nature, is required to make

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:32.379
art. As Ben Lewis, a commentator for the Evening
Standard, once phrased it in a review titled

00:21:32.379 --> 00:21:38.610
“A Lesson in Art History from Mrs. Blobby”.
A whole sub-genre of art has appeared which

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:42.450
trades on the fact that it looks as if it
has been tipped out of a rubbish sack while

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:47.322
making important philosophical statements
about the nature of creativity, the myth of

00:21:47.322 --> 00:21:52.739
the artist-genius and the act of creation.
In the case of artworks that most elicit a

00:21:52.739 --> 00:21:59.190
speechless “What the …?”, why does a
museum choose to own them? And what are the

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:04.559
grounds for the visitor’s confidence in
the museum’s judgment? The viewer's trust

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:09.480
in the museum is the springboard for the museum’s
educational mission. Trust is what makes the

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:14.009
viewer patient. As if in a principle of physics,
the steadier the base, the further the cantilever

00:22:14.009 --> 00:22:19.080
can extend, meaning the greater the center
of gravity of trust, the greater the range

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:26.059
of comfort and experimentation with uncomfortably
new art.

00:22:26.059 --> 00:22:27.389
[pause]

00:22:27.389 --> 00:22:33.799
In the fall of 1997 I took my parents to the
Museum of Modern Art to see On the Edge: Contemporary

00:22:33.799 --> 00:22:38.889
Art from the Werner and Elaine Dannheisser
Collection. For purposes of this story, it

00:22:38.889 --> 00:22:44.340
is important to characterize my parents as,
above all, patient people, academics in specialized

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:50.249
fields with a Herculean tolerance for things
that take a long time to understand, and indulgent

00:22:50.249 --> 00:22:55.020
in experiencing their children’s professional
lives. I had visited the show the day before

00:22:55.020 --> 00:23:00.970
with a friend who was installing it and I
had been struck by how majestic the art looked

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:05.630
when all of the cranes and the art handlers
were still around. Messy and real in the Velveteen

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:10.739
Rabbit sense, it was not suffering the false
appearance of ease that a pristine art installation

00:23:10.739 --> 00:23:16.299
shares with a world class figure skater or
an extremely well groomed person. The tour

00:23:16.299 --> 00:23:21.230
began with two paintings that could best be
described, compositionally, as doodles, the

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:25.499
swirly kind you would make if your Bic pen
were running out of ink, except blown up four

00:23:25.499 --> 00:23:31.330
thousand percent. The scribble paintings were
decidedly unexpressive. I was unsure if this

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:36.159
was the point. Equipped with this knowledge,
a term I use loosely, we rounded the corner

00:23:36.159 --> 00:23:41.769
past neon signs by Bruce Nauman. These were
at once totally intelligible, words that light

00:23:41.769 --> 00:23:50.239
up, and completely foreign; why these words?
Beyond the Nauman, we proceeded past what,

00:23:50.239 --> 00:23:55.279
in a horror movie, would be the first, nearly
overlooked sign of impending disaster. It

00:23:55.279 --> 00:23:59.740
was a leg sticking out of the wall, about
a foot above the floor. Made of strangely

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:05.080
translucent wax and covered meticulously with
leg hair, it had a shoe and sock on one end

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:10.080
and a trouser leg disappearing into the wall
at the other. The sock and trouser hem framed

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.139
that snippet of skin you would see if someone
in a suit was wearing short socks and crossed

00:24:14.139 --> 00:24:20.230
his legs. Before I had time to process this
image fully, we wandered into the Jeff Koons

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:25.970
room. I knew Koons’s early work consisting
of vacuum cleaners lit up majestically with

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:31.580
fluorescent tube lights and displayed in the
vacuum seal of perfect Lucite boxes. To pay

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:35.009
for the Hoovers, the artist had famously worked
as a commodities

00:24:35.009 --> 00:24:39.299
trader, a job second in iconic status only
to his stint selling memberships at the Museum

00:24:39.299 --> 00:24:44.899
of Modern Art. He still claims the record
for having sold the most. He is perhaps better

00:24:44.899 --> 00:24:50.740
known for his subsequent work - the gigantic
topiary puppy outside the Guggenheim Bilbao,

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:56.570
his Banality series sculpture of Michael
Jackson and his pet chimpanzee Bubbles, or

00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:01.139
the photographs of him and his then wife engaging
in various sex acts against My Pretty Pony,

00:25:01.139 --> 00:25:07.519
cotton candy backdrops. I would show obscene
work here but it didn't see merited relative

00:25:07.519 --> 00:25:15.840
to the need for the example. The cumulative
effect of doodles, neon signs, and a wax leg

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:21.020
was already overloading our brains and slowing
down our pace when we swiveled around and

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:26.350
there it was, the piece de resistance. We
all stared for a moment. My clinician father,

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:31.990
no stranger to thorough analysis and nimble
intuition, turned to me. Pausing for a moment,

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:37.379
with that nonjudgmental air of a parent surveying
a child's abstract art project, he asked,

00:25:37.379 --> 00:25:43.660
in a kind and curious tone, "So Amy, why are
the basketballs floating in the fish tank?"

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:49.110
The short answer was that I had absolutely
no idea. I could see that there were three

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:53.770
of them, that their demi-submersion formed
a kind of composition against the half full

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:58.799
tank. We could see the NBA branding, a few
incongruities, and some evidence of formalism.

00:25:58.799 --> 00:26:03.240
Yet we were in exactly that cantilevered moment
of deciding whether to trust the museum, to

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:07.720
call a bluff, or to say “uncle” and end
the mental arm wrestle and adjourn to the

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:13.039
cafe. This was exactly when trust in the museum
mattered, as if that trust were an instruction

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:19.169
from a judge to us as the jury about granting
the museum generosity on the burden of proof.

00:26:19.169 --> 00:26:24.840
As in, be compassionate; this work is new
to the museum too. This kind of compassion

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:30.409
is often inversely proportionate to how arrogant
or extortionate or pretentious the voice of

00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:36.659
that presentation is. If the museum has spoken
with intellectual empathy, in the spirit of

00:26:36.659 --> 00:26:42.549
conversation, I wipe my eyes, resign myself
to the dull headache, and reboot to try, try

00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:47.200
again. In this case, abject confusion coincided
with admiration for the curator, and so I

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:52.400
purchased a copy of the exhibition catalogue
on our way out of the museum. As I sat down

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:57.519
with a book and a bracing cup of coffee, I
saw that MoMA’s then chief curator Kirk

00:26:57.519 --> 00:27:02.919
Varnedoe’s warm introduction had given us
some retroactive fair warning: “To its great

00:27:02.919 --> 00:27:10.679
credit, this collection seems to have nothing
‘easy’ about it.” Rob Storr, the curator

00:27:10.679 --> 00:27:14.100
of the exhibition, had written the bulk of
the catalogue, an alphabetized collection

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:19.100
of essays about the artists. It seemed that
the wax leg could have been foreboding after

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:27.970
all. As Storr writes, and I quote, "A work
of art by Robert Gober is a true or false

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:32.970
question for which the only adequate answer
is anxious indecision, since the exquisite

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:38.070
falsehood of the objects that provoke this
response is also the purveyor of basic, disquieting

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:44.320
emotional truths.” Even the title of the
wax leg, Untitled, was disquieting, no mask

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:51.599
for the list of materials: “wax, cotton,
leather, human hair, and wood.” Storr himself

00:27:51.599 --> 00:28:00.269
is trained as a painter and is someone I trust
implicitly to elucidate difficult art and

00:28:00.269 --> 00:28:06.509
I'll just tell a couple of quick stories summarizing,
some of these are in the text. I had a friend

00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:11.289
who was his personal assistant and she bet
me once to get his autograph because he was

00:28:11.289 --> 00:28:14.999
doing a program with the artist Chuck Close
and swarms of people were asking for Chuck

00:28:14.999 --> 00:28:18.799
Close's autograph and he was just sitting
there by himself and the reason the joke was

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:22.909
funny is that he'd just come off of a red
eye flight and was probably delighted to sit

00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:26.549
by himself so I didn't have any paper and
took up a copy of this book I had just bought

00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:30.830
called "Teach Yourself Post Modernism", part
of the same series as "Teach Yourself Bridge"

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:35.519
which I also own, and he looked at it and
said, "I didn't write this book." And I said,

00:28:35.519 --> 00:28:40.889
"Well, it's a guide to postmodernism. It would
be appropriate if you signed it." And he signed

00:28:40.889 --> 00:28:47.549
it Pierre Menard aka Robert Storr which is
a reference to a Borges story about an author

00:28:47.549 --> 00:28:52.799
whose work coincides word for word with a
whole section of "Don Quixote" by Cervantes.

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:59.179
I don't know anyone who makes pithy Borges
references when jet lagged, apart from Rob

00:28:59.179 --> 00:29:04.720
Storr. He also, I think, loves art enough
that you'll see him at exhibition openings

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:09.730
at the Museum of Modern Art. He's also currently
the Dean of the Art School at Yale and I saw

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:16.260
him most recently at an open studio for a
long time MoMA art handler so these are the

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.659
guys who take the painting out of the crate
and put it on the wall and Rob Storr is the

00:29:19.659 --> 00:29:26.879
kind of guy who shows up to see their art
so I trust him personally. I think he is incredibly

00:29:26.879 --> 00:29:32.450
intelligent and a very decent man, but personal
trust is a little bit of a straw man when

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:36.269
you're talking about an art museum. It's like
saying you trust the government because your

00:29:36.269 --> 00:29:39.659
best friend from high school happens to be
the President, and what you're really striving

00:29:39.659 --> 00:29:46.889
for is a sense of institutional trust. So
the chapter kind of goes on to describe the

00:29:46.889 --> 00:29:51.269
time of the founding fathers as a golden age
of innovation, not in the Fine Arts directly

00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:56.359
but in the exceptionally creative act of fashioning
a constitutional government from scratch.

00:29:56.359 --> 00:30:02.409
I'll just - [laughs in audience]. I think
everyone here can, however restily, remember

00:30:02.409 --> 00:30:08.379
sixth grade civics class where you studied
that in fact there's a separation of powers

00:30:08.379 --> 00:30:13.880
so this is obviously how our American democracy
is structured but there are a lot of other

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:18.659
things that have a similar separation of powers.
It's the same way that back office accounting

00:30:18.659 --> 00:30:26.389
teams and third party auditors are separate
from traders or how in the case of a film

00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:33.950
you might have separate screenwriters, directors,
and editors. That can definitely work magnificently

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:38.409
but you might also end up watching an actor,
director, editor, writer whose on screen girlfriend

00:30:38.409 --> 00:30:46.919
laughs at all his jokes and is 20 years his
junior. This is a bit unfair. So the thesis

00:30:46.919 --> 00:30:51.559
here is that in relation to this larger definition
of art that I went through before with the

00:30:51.559 --> 00:30:54.480
visual thinking and imagination and creativity,
museums have a capacity to be an insulated

00:30:54.480 --> 00:31:04.570
judiciary, a bit the same way that the Supreme
Court is separate. Everyone here runs museums

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:10.960
wears black but not the same kind of outfits
and what I'm really trying to say is that

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.960
museums can function a lot the way libraries
do. This is an old fashioned and radical way

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:20.680
of thinking because a lot of people, like
myself who have MBA's, go work in museums

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:25.219
and apply business thinking to the management
of nonprofit organizations. Nonprofits by

00:31:25.219 --> 00:31:31.080
definition are market failures. There is some
reason that we believe they should exist apart

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:36.320
from their making money directly by virtue
of their activities. They make money through

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:42.559
donations and foundation support and other
means so the bottom line is that museums will

00:31:42.559 --> 00:31:45.989
 - they compete with leisure activities for
peoples' time but they'll never compete apples

00:31:45.989 --> 00:31:54.539
to apples with cinema or shopping or anything
else and then in fact, the only difference

00:31:54.539 --> 00:32:00.629
between what they do and what libraries do
is that book are by nature private goods economically

00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:05.869
and paintings are by nature public goods so
if you put together an exhibition, many people

00:32:05.869 --> 00:32:10.999
can enjoy it at the same time and it's a high
fixed cost activity but very few people try

00:32:10.999 --> 00:32:16.489
to read lots and lots of books at the same
time. One person's enjoyment of a book takes

00:32:16.489 --> 00:32:24.929
away from another person's enjoyment so people
use them one at a time. So what I'm trying

00:32:24.929 --> 00:32:28.970
to say is that we can embrace this public
role of museums circa The Museum of Modern

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:35.460
Art and the fire and people feeling this desire
to give money to it as opposed to the current

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:40.989
state of those institutions. MoMA was among
the ones in 2000 that had huge architectural

00:32:40.989 --> 00:32:47.580
expansions and when they opened in 2004, they
increased the admissions charge 67% to be

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:52.869
twenty dollars. There is an artist who suggested
people bring the twenty dollars in pennies

00:32:52.869 --> 00:33:00.619
which would weigh about twelve and a half
pounds but there's a trend where things that

00:33:00.619 --> 00:33:05.970
start as creative projects then become public
and then once they're public, there's an inertia

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:10.210
toward becoming commercialized and there's
this active creative reinvention that has

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:14.580
to happen so you go back to this first stage
of recreating in order to maintain one's self

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:18.570
as a public institution and I think this is
the same thing that happens to successful

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:25.200
artists and to successful companies as well.
The market would encourage you to keep producing

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:30.590
the same thing, essentially becoming a branded
commodity product as opposed to constantly

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:35.149
reinvent so you can imagine that U2 has a
successful first or second album and that

00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:41.330
they're pressured by record producers to continually
produce work that sounds the same, or artists

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:46.179
to produce work that looks the same so that
it's recognizable on an art market and that

00:33:46.179 --> 00:33:52.510
the trick is to kind of maintain a liveliness
of an existing institution and that's no easy

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:58.919
to do so I'll just read a bit of the conclusion
of this chapter. The insulated judiciary is

00:33:58.919 --> 00:34:03.450
not something we can do without because it
alone is what creates a sense of trust in

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:09.139
museums. If trust erodes, superficial spectacle
can intercede as an attempt to shore up the

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:13.050
institution when the underlying substance
has gone awry. And the pursuit of spectacle

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:18.270
for its own sake damages the credibility of
museums and hampers, in a boy who cried wolf

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:23.710
way, the pleasures of spectacle when it arises
naturally on its own, for example, when the

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:28.549
winner of the Tate’s Turner Prize is genuinely
and wholeheartedly a married cross dresser

00:34:28.549 --> 00:34:34.730
in a taffeta baby doll dress elaborately embroidered
with a miniature penis motif. This is a vase

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:39.450
by the artist in question, Grayson Perry.
This is Grayson Perry dressed up with

00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:46.440
his wife and child. Here he is with his art;
here he is making his art. I don't think he's

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.919
trying. I don't think the spectacle in this
case is like a sugar high. I think it's integral

00:34:50.919 --> 00:34:56.369
to his work and there's a need to protect
that. A market favors spectacle because it

00:34:56.369 --> 00:35:01.060
brings people in like a flash of light but
ultimately it kind of cheapens the experience

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:09.380
that everyone has. This is a picture of Alfred
Barr at the end of his career and I'll just

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:15.140
read a quotation from Nicholas Serota, the
director of the Tate, but I think it applies

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:22.770
to Barr's life and to the art. "Essentially
this is a plea for patience, that your skepticism

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:30.880
will gradually diminish, and your fear will
turn to love. All art was modern once." So

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:39.490
if I can just go from this sort of critique
of museums to a little bit more of what I

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:44.210
hope happens with them; the metaphor in the
book for how museums are in relation to the

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:50.789
leisure industry is that if you're trying
to compete apples to apples with film or anything

00:35:50.789 --> 00:35:54.730
of that ilk, it's a bit like watching little
kids on the soccer field where everyone goes

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:58.140
to where the ball is because that's where
the excitement is instead of staying open

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:05.740
for a pass. I also think if museums are planning
to expand architecturally, they can have more

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:11.549
space for people to make art. I would love
for more people to feel invited, not just

00:36:11.549 --> 00:36:15.950
to participate in a conversation around art,
but to identify with the artist's whose work

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:20.980
is in museums and some practical knowledge
of making work is important. The same way

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:25.600
that playing a musical instrument makes it
more interesting to listen to music. I think

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:32.450
you can understand the architecture of something
by trying to do it, even at the most basic

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:37.480
level so I'm a huge proponent of everyone
having an opportunity to be an artist. So

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:42.500
I'll just read a little bit more from the
epilogue of the book and there's no spoiler

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:49.690
here and then I'll open it up to questions.
I started to write this book because I wanted

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:54.279
to figure out why museums bore my friends,
at the same time that visual thinking, a main

00:36:54.279 --> 00:36:59.710
attribute of art, is omnipresent. This question
is a subset of a larger, more philosophical

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:04.510
one that only yields to an indirect approach:
What is art, and how do people have it in

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:10.530
their lives? As I write, I am sitting in La
Rhumerie in Paris, where a friend suggested

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:14.940
coming for “hot milky things” but which
I have learned upon sitting down is actually

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:21.250
La Rhumerie as in rum. To my left, two elegant,
slightly older women fold in on their table

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:27.640
in conversation. To my right, glamorous Parisians
banter in wicker chairs. We are surrounded

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.500
by tribal art, Caribbean music, and a generally
happy, almost

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.450
transporting feeling. It would be possible
to hang out in a place like this your whole

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:40.380
life and never go to a museum and have a lively
and creative sense of the world. And that

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:45.780
kind of awareness is, to me, either the definition
of art or art’s more basic reason for being.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:52.610
But Paris being an art capital and myself
being a museum person, I went out in the afternoon

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:57.500
to the Musee d’Orsay, the converted train
station where a disproportionate number of

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:02.420
the world’s great Impressionist paintings
live. Upon arrival I trundled down the main

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:10.470
atrium to Edouard Manet’s massive canvas
Le Dejeuner sur l’herbe. I was lost in thought

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:15.190
looking at the painting from point blank range
when a young woman tapped me on the shoulder.

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:19.690
Holding a camera in one hand, she asked me,
in the less polite verb form, to get out of

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:24.309
the way so that she could take a photograph.
I obliged, wondering why she didn't just buy

00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:30.319
a postcard. Did she want to see the painting
or to have a record of it for later? She called

00:38:30.319 --> 00:38:36.490
to mind a line from an Italo Calvino short
story from 1955, “The Adventures of a Photographer”:

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:40.250
“It is only when they have the photos before
their eyes that they seem to take tangible

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:49.069
possession of the day they spent. The rest
can drown in the unreliable shadow of memory.”

00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:53.590
The only concrete definition of art I have
ever encountered was written by lawyers working

00:38:53.590 --> 00:39:00.029
for shipping and insurance companies, clauses
about originality, read: irreplaceability,

00:39:00.029 --> 00:39:05.549
as pertains to decorative objects that hang
on walls. At that particular point in time,

00:39:05.549 --> 00:39:12.930
art was what Federal Express would ship internationally
but UPS would not. The German philosopher

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:16.680
Martin Heidegger wrote that a work of art
is that which not only creates

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:22.849
something new but creates the new world in
which that thing can exist. By that definition,

00:39:22.849 --> 00:39:27.180
the change in fundamental structure of global
warfare after 9/11 and the world’s response

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:32.250
would both qualify as art: a new thing that
changes the world to make room for itself.

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:37.760
The question becomes: Is inventive national
security policy art? Michelangelo did, after

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:42.779
all, build defense walls in addition to painting
the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. The rebuttal

00:39:42.779 --> 00:39:47.630
comes from Bob, a proprietor of a used furniture
store that used to have a charming sign; “We're

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:52.690
cheaper than we look”; who eyed me once
and said, “You're not going to tell me everything’s

00:39:52.690 --> 00:40:00.270
art. That cabinet is art. Legislation is art.”
Well, actually, Bob, I am. It’s not that

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:08.240
everything is art but that it could be. So
with that, I'll close and happily take any

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.480
questions from the audience.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:12.430
[pause]

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:15.369
Yes?

00:40:15.369 --> 00:40:47.950
&gt;&gt; So I share from my experience that audio
guides can be a very good tool to enrich my

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:48.950
experience and art dealer, I do lots of kind
so all that will help. I also noticed only

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:49.950
like a very few people at Google use it. That
may be because it's easier thing to send out

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:50.950
initial price so I'm wondering if you know
or would enrich a viewer's experience or is

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:51.950
it something that we should learn?

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:52.950
Amy Whitaker: Right. So you're asking about
people's experience of audio guides and the

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:58.190
economics. Yeah, so this is a really interesting
question of how people have complementary

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:02.609
information. There's a chapter in the book
called the "Revenge of the Homunculus". Claire

00:41:02.609 --> 00:41:08.940
is actually in it. It's about that word appearing
in a wall label and about this whole question

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:13.730
of how museums talk to visitors. So there
is a lot of innovation happening at the moment

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:18.670
in that field. The North Carolina Museum of
Art is opening a new building in the Spring

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:24.329
and they've very consciously gotten their
most senior curators to record audio guides

00:41:24.329 --> 00:41:29.270
that sound conversational, as if you were
just walking around with a person. Other museums

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:34.730
are figuring out how to have it be more casual
so to be a number that you can punch in on

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:40.839
your cell phones so that you don't have to
pay such a steep price and I think - what

00:41:40.839 --> 00:41:44.849
I hear from people a lot is that they really
need that information, especially in the case

00:41:44.849 --> 00:41:51.119
of modern art but that what's more compelling
than someone saying how important a work is,

00:41:51.119 --> 00:41:56.090
is someone telling you the story of the artist
so you can relate to this person who actually

00:41:56.090 --> 00:42:02.569
made something and was compelled for a reason,
whether economic or a need to create a work

00:42:02.569 --> 00:42:07.839
of art. It's kind of what happened from the
blank canvas point of view so I would agree

00:42:07.839 --> 00:42:13.410
with you that the economics are off and I
think what happens in a lot of other media

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:18.200
industries may happen to audio guides where
people realize how cheap the underlying technology

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:23.130
is and either try to produce it in house,
which a lot of museums do, or it gets priced

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:27.170
out or - I don't want to say pirated because
I don't think that that would exactly - there's

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:32.599
too much research required. I personally think
it would also be wonderful if, when you bought

00:42:32.599 --> 00:42:36.619
your tickets to go to a museum exhibition
or when you planned to, you could go on the

00:42:36.619 --> 00:42:41.510
website ahead of time, the way that you print
a boarding pass to take a plane flight, and

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:46.440
you could print the material and take it with
you so that you don't have to walk over to

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:50.099
the wall and read the label. There's a passage
in "Revenge of the Homunculus" about a reporter

00:42:50.099 --> 00:42:54.930
who clocked people in exhibitions to see how
long they looked at the art and they spent

00:42:54.930 --> 00:43:01.339
50 seconds reading the wall label and 4 seconds
looking at the art. But I think you're kind

00:43:01.339 --> 00:43:07.660
of getting at this underlying issue of open
ended curiosity in looking at art and trying

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:12.910
to understand the importance of something
and to appreciate it. Appreciation is more

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:17.789
in the mode of an art historian or a critics
point of view and open ended curiosity is

00:43:17.789 --> 00:43:20.589
more identifying with the artist. Yes?

00:43:20.589 --> 00:43:28.049
&gt;&gt; I get your point about people experiencing
art because as reading, we have the inability

00:43:28.049 --> 00:43:36.010
class that we can transport into our class.
We know how successful that was. Are there

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:43.970
any existing example you have of that, where
museums might be willing to create art as

00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:44.970
engagement?

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:49.530
Amy Whitaker: Well I think a lot of - so this
is a question about - I'm supposed to repeat

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:55.119
the questions for the benefit of anyone watching
this later. I can hear you loud and clear.

00:43:55.119 --> 00:43:59.400
This is a questions about whether there are
any good examples of museums currently bringing

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:03.900
people in to feel a sense of creative ownership
and making work in the gallery. There's a

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:10.119
story in the book in a chapter called "On
Boredom" about a group of miners in the north

00:44:10.119 --> 00:44:16.019
of England who started making their own art.
It's one of my favorite stories in the book.

00:44:16.019 --> 00:44:20.140
So yes, there are a lot of museums who have
interesting art making activities. Most of

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:25.640
them tend to be geared toward children and
they do have art making classes for adults

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:30.600
and at one point I looked at the offerings
of the Museum of Modern Art and all of the

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:35.440
studio classes were sold out well ahead of
time, granted there were fewer of them, so

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.480
I think there's an appetite. One of the things
that I've really been looking at is the way

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:44.440
in which people interact with art outside
of museums. For example, there's a company

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:50.289
in the outskirts of Philadelphia called SEI
Investments that has a world class collection

00:44:50.289 --> 00:44:55.589
of contemporary art so people live near it
and they have open plan work spaces. All the

00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:59.510
desks are on wheels and there are power cables
that come out of the ceiling every so often

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:06.470
and literally someone will work next to a
life size handsewn Hummer or a wall covered

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:11.549
in fiber glass poisonous mushrooms or a pair
of men's wing tip shoes that are made out

00:45:11.549 --> 00:45:17.089
licorice and are three feet tall so I think
that there's this question of kind of art

00:45:17.089 --> 00:45:22.799
in everyday life but I think there's a real
dearth of opportunity for people to make work

00:45:22.799 --> 00:45:30.109
and I've given a related talk in a corporate
setting and had people draw and you can feel

00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:34.130
the energy in the room change when people
are given a marker and asked to look at each

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:40.430
other and draw without staring at their paper
so I'd like to see more of it. If I had one

00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:45.900
recommendation from the book, it would be
the importance of studio art, not just to

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.940
museums but to people's overall lives. Yes?

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:49.730
&gt;&gt; So you talk about giving us the answers
to insulated judiciary. How can museums balance

00:45:49.730 --> 00:46:13.589
 - I guess how can they keep themselves from
turning into insulated in a way? And maintain

00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:14.589
that cycle of innovation, even from just saying
good art and all the things we have, that's

00:46:14.589 --> 00:46:15.589
what art is, you know?

00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:17.279
Amy Whitaker: So this is a very related question
about how museums keep themselves from becoming

00:46:17.279 --> 00:46:24.519
overly insulated to a elite judiciary and
it's a political structural question and the

00:46:24.519 --> 00:46:29.809
answer has everything to do with more people
making art. So for me, if you describe museums

00:46:29.809 --> 00:46:35.829
as a judiciary, then they're a political institution
and all political institutions in a democracy

00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:41.859
exist in relation to a notion of citizenship
so what I would say is that the idea of being

00:46:41.859 --> 00:46:46.920
a citizen of the art world is to be an artist
oneself, not just to be an appreciator of

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:52.220
art. So I would invite more and more people
into the conversation around art and into

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:59.819
the public debate around the role of museums
and art and society and I think therefore

00:46:59.819 --> 00:47:04.400
you get this countervailing force. You get
an insulated judiciary on the one hand and

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.079
then you also get what the same founding fathers
would have called "factions" on the other,

00:47:08.079 --> 00:47:11.869
this colliding molecules view of a lot of
viewpoints and I think we don't have that

00:47:11.869 --> 00:47:17.690
now because there are a lot of exceptionally
smart, curious, creative people who apply

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:23.509
these first principles of art in other areas
but without it being connected to art as a

00:47:23.509 --> 00:47:30.880
discipline. I mean, art is as basic as writing
or math as a mode of communication but it's

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:36.470
also interpreted as a rarefied disciplinary
area so exactly to your point. I think if

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:40.619
more people participated in the conversation
that would counteract that worry.

00:47:40.619 --> 00:47:41.619
&gt;&gt; So I was wondering if you'd talk a little
bit more about museums focused on like the

00:47:41.619 --> 00:47:42.619
big ticket items like the blockbusters versus
like continuing with their educational mission

00:47:42.619 --> 00:47:57.930
and one example that comes to mind is the
DeGross Clinic meaning that it was in like

00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:00.710
a hospital in Philadelphia and this famous
painting, they were going to sell it to Arkansas

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:03.599
but then the city banded together to raise
money and it was a big rallying cry but that's

00:48:03.599 --> 00:48:12.720
just one painting that you'll see in one room.
How do they like band together and traffic

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.319
in other areas?

00:48:14.319 --> 00:48:20.619
Amy Whitaker: Yeah. So this is a really interesting
questions of museums focusing their attention

00:48:20.619 --> 00:48:25.880
on blockbuster exhibitions and on single famous
iconic paintings and how to get people to

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:31.820
put their attention elsewhere. Is that fair,
Cliff? So I thin part of this is just basic

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:38.430
human psychology that people like to respond
to a crisis or go see a particular thing.

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:43.780
I think museums are suffering in a way. They're
really struggling to figure out how to appeal

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:50.940
to a broad audience and they think that one
of the ways to do that is to have these masterpieces

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:55.099
and these big exhibitions. There are a couple
of quotations that I didn't read from the

00:48:55.099 --> 00:49:00.650
book about all the banners furling and unfurling
in front of a museum as not a flush of health

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:07.910
but a flush of fever and I think that you're
exactly right. My feeling is that if museums

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:13.009
 - it's a chicken, egg problem but if they
stopped having blockbuster exhibitions and

00:49:13.009 --> 00:49:18.260
they stopped feeling this need constantly
to expand, which is a function of donors being

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:23.740
excited by a concrete project or needing to
call us, the momentum of staff around something

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:29.269
tangible. If people could wean themselves
off of that temporarily and turn scholarly

00:49:29.269 --> 00:49:34.520
attention to their own permanent collections
and create real information about other works

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:39.750
of art, and if you didn't have to pay so much
to go to a museum so it wasn't structured

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:44.390
like an all you can eat buffet economically,
you could champion the drop in visit and someone

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:48.940
could go - really feel invited to look at
any work of art that appealed to them and

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:53.809
kind of have it 'normed' that looking at one
thing or three things before you leave is

00:49:53.809 --> 00:49:59.690
totally reasonable, much more perfume counter,
much less all you can eat buffet so I think

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:03.980
that what happens is that there's not a lot
of information about other works in the collection

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:09.259
because they spend so much time constantly
hustling to get exhibitions off the ground

00:50:09.259 --> 00:50:12.780
and they pay a lot of money for some of them
too. It'll cost a million dollars to bring

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:22.460
in a traveling show, just the fee to the organizing
institution so I think a lot of that is just

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:27.880
psychology. The notion of betterment as opposed
to the notion of growth and I would love to

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:32.099
see it happen. The only other thing I would
suggest along those lines is there's some

00:50:32.099 --> 00:50:38.519
museums that justify expanding architecturally
because they have so many wonderful works

00:50:38.519 --> 00:50:43.029
in storage but what I think would actually
be great is if they are only showing the top

00:50:43.029 --> 00:50:47.829
five or ten percent of their collection, if
they took the next fifteen or twenty percent

00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:52.201
and sent it on a semi-permanent loan to regional
museums then I think there would be many,

00:50:52.201 --> 00:50:56.780
many more works of art for people to go look
at because often you get this dynamic of a

00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:01.619
big blockbuster show coming to a regional
city because they have work in their collection

00:51:01.619 --> 00:51:05.849
by major artists but it might be third rate
work and therefore they talk about it in terms

00:51:05.849 --> 00:51:10.029
of the importance of the artist overall and
not just in terms of the actual work of art.

00:51:10.029 --> 00:51:12.559
But I would love to see more of that happen.

00:51:12.559 --> 00:51:26.060
&gt;&gt; Are there any efforts in the way of

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:29.250
Amy Whitaker: So Pepe is asking if there are
projects to create more virtual museums online.

00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:34.750
Yes, absolutely, very much so. A lot of museums,
I think, see it as a chance to have a scholarly

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:39.599
database to - they have a lot of material
that's geared toward teachers. The Metropolitan,

00:51:39.599 --> 00:51:46.349
the Museum of Modern Art, the Tate, a lot
of the big museums have exceptionally good

00:51:46.349 --> 00:51:52.240
databases. I don't think that so many of them
have organized them as virtual tours because

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:58.869
there's this whole question of the importance
of seeing an original work of art. This is

00:51:58.869 --> 00:52:02.350
the same as the question of finding enough
places to sit. If you didn't believe in the

00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:06.539
original work of art, museums could project
up enormous copies of things and have tons

00:52:06.539 --> 00:52:10.490
of seats in the middle and everybody could
see well enough so I think they currently

00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:16.829
see it as a compliment to and not a substitute
for the work of art but that's changed over

00:52:16.829 --> 00:52:23.269
time. If you had asked that question in 2000,
2001, there was tremendous excitement around

00:52:23.269 --> 00:52:26.540
monetizing their collections in that fashion,
to cross subsidize other activities.

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.640
&gt;&gt; I had one other question. Are there things
that the art museum world can learn from like

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:41.926
science museums and like the science industry
and things like that?

00:52:41.926 --> 00:52:44.720
Amy Whitaker: Yeah, that's a really interesting
question. How much art museums can learn from

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:50.490
science and industry museums. I think art
museums - there's something that's always

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:56.160
a little bit subjective about them so if anything
they grow out a tradition of science museums

00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:03.029
because the earliest instances of
museums were scholarly cabinets of curiosity

00:53:03.029 --> 00:53:10.420
or what are essentially libraries so they
were taxonomic and I think that comes directly

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:15.529
from science museums and if anything I think
art museums are experimenting with growing

00:53:15.529 --> 00:53:22.619
away from that tradition and embracing subjectivity
more so. One of my favorite formats of exhibition

00:53:22.619 --> 00:53:27.750
is called "Label Talk" where the Williams
College Museum of Art does this under that

00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:32.039
name, a few other museums do it otherwise
where they invite lots of people to come in

00:53:32.039 --> 00:53:37.230
and write essays about the same work of art
so instead of a single "this is the scientific

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:42.410
truth of this painting", you'll have three
or four labels. Say it's a picture of George

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:48.860
Washington; there'll be a historian, there'll
be an artist, there'll be a scientist talking

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:52.539
about how they would look at the painting
so I think, if anything, they're growing away

00:53:52.539 --> 00:54:20.941
from it a little bit. Is there - we have time
for one more question or we can go ahead and

00:54:20.941 --> 00:54:21.941
wrap up. Yes?

00:54:21.941 --> 00:54:22.941
&gt;&gt; Along the same concept ,is there like an
increase

00:54:22.941 --> 00:54:26.309
Amy Whitaker: Mm hmm. So there's this question
of increased interactivity in museum exhibitions.

00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:30.490
I think absolutely they do have that. There
are a lot more computers in the galleries

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:36.309
and there aren't quite a number of companies
that do exhibition design that focus on those

00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:43.140
kind of whistles and bell. In my opinion,
and I'm very old fashioned this way, I prefer

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:47.099
just to be able to sit in front of a work
of art and for the work of art to speak on

00:54:47.099 --> 00:54:53.680
its own. A bench is an invitation to sit and
to have information as much as I want but

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:58.059
the ways in which I've most enjoyed seeing
computers used is to further a conversation

00:54:58.059 --> 00:55:04.329
so there'll be computers where people can
log anonymous comments that are then posted

00:55:04.329 --> 00:55:09.220
on the wall of the exhibition so they are
used to create a framework for a conversation

00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:15.980
more so then this kind of whistle and bell.
I think this is the kind of last side of - you

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:20.250
know, if you take a Van Gogh painting and
you shine a strobe light on it, it doesn't

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:25.490
become this. [laughs from audience] And I
think the same thing is true of having computers

00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:33.020
in the galleries. There's so much contemporary
work that's made in that way and absolutely

00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:39.020
if the work is made out of computers, technology
is integral but I think there are natural

00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:44.950
limitations to feeling that putting a kiosk,
you know, with Van Gogh activities for children

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:49.119
next to a Van Gogh painting, that can be great
but I don't think it's necessarily an end

00:55:49.119 --> 00:55:54.850
all be all. I think having simply a piece
of paper and a pen is often the most revolutionary

00:55:54.850 --> 00:56:01.470
way of interacting that you can have. So I'll
just close again by saying thank you so much

00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:08.839
for having me here. I'm very honored and I
care a lot about people's relationship to

00:56:08.839 --> 00:56:14.509
museums but that's really because I care about
museums relationship to how people think as

00:56:14.509 --> 00:56:20.039
they're walking down the street on any given
Tuesday so I hope you embrace your own creative

00:56:20.039 --> 00:56:26.170
projects at work or otherwise and that that
helps you enjoy museums and that museums help

00:56:26.170 --> 00:56:31.460
you enjoy those things so thanks again very
much and I'll leave it there. [applause from

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:31.950
audience]
