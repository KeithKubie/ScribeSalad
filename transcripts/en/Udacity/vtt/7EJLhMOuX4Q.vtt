00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.830
Now that we have compared and contrasted interrupts and

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.460
signals, let's see how we can visualize these concepts.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.250
We'll use again an illustration within a toy shop,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.670
where we will try to make an analogy between an interrupt and

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.460
a snowstorm warning, and a signal and a battery is low warning.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.280
The reason for these two choices is to make it a little bit more similar with

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.790
the interrupt being generated by an event that's external to the CPU.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.220
So, an event that's external to the toy shop.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.730
Whereas the signal is more generated from within, so

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.770
the battery is low is directly caused by the toy shop worker fixing a toy.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.390
First, each of these types of warnings need to be handled in specific ways.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.460
Second, both of them can be ignored.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.030
And last, we can think about both of them as being expected or unexpected.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.990
In a toy shop, handling these types of events may be

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.750
specified via safety protocols or certain hazard plans.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.280
This is not uncommon.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.860
There may be,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.340
however, situations in which it's appropriate to just continue working.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.090
And finally, situations like the fact that the battery died are pretty frequent.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.910
They happen regularly, so they're expected.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.710
Whether or not it is expected for

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.370
a snowstorm to occur, that will really depend on where the toy shop actually is.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.500
If we think about interrupts or signals, well, both of them are handled in

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.280
a specific way and that's defined by the signal handler.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.170
Next, both interrupts and signals can be masked, as we said.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.380
And in that way, we can ignore them.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.230
And finally, as we previously discussed,

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.290
these types of events can appear synchronously or asynchronously.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.130
So we have some analogy between these two contexts again.
