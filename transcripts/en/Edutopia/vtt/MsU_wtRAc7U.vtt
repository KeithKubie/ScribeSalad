00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:11.416
&gt;&gt;Hillary: Providence is an
old manufacturing community.

00:00:12.196 --> 00:00:15.526
A lot of the houses you're gonna
see are really mill worker houses,

00:00:15.526 --> 00:00:19.736
which are struggling these days.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:24.206
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Like many once great
industrial centers, Providence,

00:00:24.206 --> 00:00:26.116
Rhode Island, has big problems.

00:00:26.246 --> 00:00:29.696
&gt;&gt;Hillary: We have the third highest
child poverty rate in America.

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:33.476
What we're finding is a very high
transiency rate with our students,

00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:37.296
because they're moving around
and extremely vulnerable.

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:40.396
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Hillary Salmons and her
colleagues have been doing something

00:00:40.476 --> 00:00:43.956
to better the lives of Providence
youth since two thousand and four,

00:00:44.236 --> 00:00:48.666
when they created the Providence
After School Alliance, or PASA.

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.596
&gt;&gt;Woman: And you can reach
inside and you can pet the cats.

00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:52.446
Cats like to be pet like this.

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:55.326
&gt;&gt;Narrator: PASA is a
network of organizations

00:00:55.326 --> 00:00:58.856
that delivers high quality after
school programs for middle schoolers,

00:00:58.856 --> 00:01:01.116
connecting them to
community resources

00:01:01.116 --> 00:01:02.816
in different zones of the city.

00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:06.266
Offerings range from
animal care to the arts.

00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:09.526
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So guys, you need to
print a different color today.

00:01:09.526 --> 00:01:12.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: From musical
instruments, to scientific ones.

00:01:12.246 --> 00:01:13.636
&gt;&gt;Man: This is what we
use to test what's going

00:01:13.686 --> 00:01:14.996
on in the water, all right?

00:01:15.396 --> 00:01:17.596
&gt;&gt;Narrator: PASA fulfilled
a campaign pledge made

00:01:17.596 --> 00:01:19.936
by Providence mayor, David Cicilline.

00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:24.766
&gt;&gt;David: It's premised on this simple
idea of really taking responsibility

00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:28.526
as a community for children, from
the moment they open their eyes

00:01:28.526 --> 00:01:30.336
in the morning, till the
moment they go to bed at night,

00:01:30.796 --> 00:01:33.726
and connecting a whole
network of opportunities

00:01:33.836 --> 00:01:37.266
and then applying very clear
quality standards to those programs

00:01:37.746 --> 00:01:40.366
and collecting good data
so we know what we're doing

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.646
and whether it's having an impact.

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:43.886
And the real key part of
this has been partnerships.

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:45.116
&gt;&gt;Hillary: Thinking
about some programming

00:01:45.176 --> 00:01:46.566
to bring the arts world in.

00:01:46.776 --> 00:01:49.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The mayor helped
convene some two hundred partners,

00:01:50.146 --> 00:01:52.406
including representatives
from the schools,

00:01:52.406 --> 00:01:55.226
police and parks departments,
who came together

00:01:55.226 --> 00:01:59.086
to assess their resources and
develop a unified plan for their use.

00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:02.616
&gt;&gt;David: We divided the city into
AfterZones, and what they do is,

00:02:02.616 --> 00:02:05.936
they connect a middle school and
a public library and a rec center

00:02:05.976 --> 00:02:08.476
and create really a campus
of activities for kids,

00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:12.076
and a transportation system
so the young people can move

00:02:12.076 --> 00:02:15.326
from the rec center to the
library, and ensure that in each

00:02:15.326 --> 00:02:18.886
of these places, there are really
enriching, really exciting programs

00:02:18.886 --> 00:02:21.766
that are aligned with the work that
young people are doing in school.

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:25.726
&gt;&gt;Hillary: The core ingredient of
an AfterZone is a unified schedule.

00:02:26.106 --> 00:02:30.106
Getting all of our YMCAs, Boys and
Girls Clubs, arts organizations,

00:02:30.106 --> 00:02:33.916
recs, departments and libraries
to agree to a schedule that runs

00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:38.906
from two thirty to five on a four
day basis, and enables us to bring

00:02:38.906 --> 00:02:41.616
in providers and sort of
develop a plug and play program.

00:02:42.236 --> 00:02:44.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After the
logistics were resolved,

00:02:44.336 --> 00:02:47.766
PASA hired a social marketing
firm to create a look and feel

00:02:48.056 --> 00:02:50.856
that would make the after
school programs more appealing

00:02:50.856 --> 00:02:52.336
to urban middle school youth.

00:02:54.176 --> 00:02:56.186
And when working with
existing resources,

00:02:56.336 --> 00:02:58.456
like a one hundred
year old cafeteria,

00:02:58.906 --> 00:03:01.596
the key to cool was
changing attitudes.

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:04.576
&gt;&gt;Alejandro: We don't repaint the
place, we don't change the furniture.

00:03:04.816 --> 00:03:07.736
We basically change the vibe, the
way adults treat young people.

00:03:07.736 --> 00:03:09.596
Instead of yelling at them
and calling boys and girls,

00:03:09.736 --> 00:03:10.856
it's "Hey, how you doing?"

00:03:10.936 --> 00:03:11.316
by their name.

00:03:11.536 --> 00:03:12.176
&gt;&gt;Ryan Mendoza?

00:03:12.636 --> 00:03:12.756
&gt;&gt;Yes.

00:03:12.756 --> 00:03:14.176
&gt;&gt;Alejandro: So it's
about customer service,

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:15.736
building that relationship
with young people.

00:03:15.736 --> 00:03:16.576
&gt;&gt;Tell me about your day.

00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:19.396
&gt;&gt;Narrator: PASA also
provides learning opportunities

00:03:19.396 --> 00:03:22.576
that most schools don't,
like this martial arts class.

00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:24.436
&gt;&gt;Brian: All right, let's
go over a couple of things.

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:26.166
Number one, guys, girls.

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:28.376
&gt;&gt;There's just something about the
black belt and there's something

00:03:28.376 --> 00:03:30.086
about the martial arts,
the mystique of it.

00:03:30.206 --> 00:03:34.536
And the younger kids, in the
beginning, relate martial arts

00:03:34.536 --> 00:03:37.156
to strength and toughness,
which it has nothing to do with.

00:03:37.286 --> 00:03:39.406
&gt;&gt;Okay, does everybody remember
a double back break fall?

00:03:39.526 --> 00:03:40.876
&gt;&gt;It's actually the opposite.

00:03:41.236 --> 00:03:43.966
You're actually teaching them
to respect the physicalness

00:03:44.016 --> 00:03:46.056
and do something with
their frustration,

00:03:46.056 --> 00:03:47.186
or do something with their energy.

00:03:47.496 --> 00:03:50.596
So that's the thing I instill in
these kids, and the philosophy

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:52.626
on being a better person, you know.

00:03:52.676 --> 00:03:55.586
Being a black belt is one thing, but
being a great person is everything.

00:03:55.796 --> 00:03:57.256
&gt;&gt;Somebody walk me through this.

00:03:57.666 --> 00:03:58.276
What do I do?

00:03:58.566 --> 00:04:01.096
&gt;&gt;Hillary: Kids just really
connect when they see a hands

00:04:01.096 --> 00:04:06.836
on leader really electrified by what
their passion is, and transferring

00:04:06.836 --> 00:04:10.086
that knowledge and skill over to
them, and giving them a sense that,

00:04:10.086 --> 00:04:14.646
"I can actually do a roll on a
mat and know how to protect myself

00:04:14.646 --> 00:04:16.516
if someone were to throw a punch."

00:04:16.676 --> 00:04:18.446
&gt;&gt;Brian: Take it away,
throw it, pit throw, hup!

00:04:19.246 --> 00:04:19.656
Perfect.

00:04:19.856 --> 00:04:21.806
&gt;&gt;Hector: I've been here,
'cause I can make more friends.

00:04:21.876 --> 00:04:24.626
I learn fitness and everything
that happened in school,

00:04:24.626 --> 00:04:28.496
I leave it behind, and I just come
here to learn something different,

00:04:28.916 --> 00:04:31.336
and to do new things
to protect yourself

00:04:31.336 --> 00:04:33.426
in the new world that
they have outside.

00:04:33.636 --> 00:04:34.816
&gt;&gt;Brian: Here I am,
my inner strength.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.056
Here's my tiger, right?

00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:39.186
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Don't forget, you
roll your ink on your Breyer,

00:04:39.276 --> 00:04:42.796
then you roll it as evenly
as you can on your plates.

00:04:43.546 --> 00:04:46.256
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The nonprofit
organization, Providence City Arts

00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:49.016
for Youth, offers this
print making class.

00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:51.336
&gt;&gt;Barbara: We're experiencing
a diminishing amount

00:04:51.336 --> 00:04:54.216
of arts opportunities that
are happening in schools,

00:04:54.696 --> 00:04:58.466
and so we're seeing an increased
need in the out of school time hours

00:04:58.546 --> 00:05:01.206
to really try to provide
those arts opportunities.

00:05:01.306 --> 00:05:03.126
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yes, so there
wasn't any ink on your plate.

00:05:03.356 --> 00:05:06.826
&gt;&gt;Barbara: More and more families are
coming to social service agencies,

00:05:06.826 --> 00:05:10.396
or coming to us because they
see the value of arts education.

00:05:10.536 --> 00:05:13.956
And so people are really reaching
out to programs like City Arts,

00:05:14.316 --> 00:05:17.756
so that those opportunities can stay
alive in their child's development.

00:05:17.756 --> 00:05:21.256
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Hey, check it out,
that came out so great, Diago.

00:05:21.256 --> 00:05:21.936
&gt;&gt;Thank you.

00:05:21.936 --> 00:05:22.606
&gt;&gt;What do you think?

00:05:22.636 --> 00:05:23.846
&gt;&gt;Banging.

00:05:25.106 --> 00:05:27.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Children who
live only blocks away

00:05:27.196 --> 00:05:30.926
from Narragansett Bay might never
experience being out on the water,

00:05:31.286 --> 00:05:33.936
if not for PASA's Explore
the Bay program.

00:05:33.936 --> 00:05:35.506
&gt;&gt;Man: All right, so let's
read another number here.

00:05:35.506 --> 00:05:37.086
&gt;&gt;Twenty-six point three.

00:05:37.276 --> 00:05:37.446
&gt;&gt;Yep.

00:05:37.926 --> 00:05:41.536
&gt;&gt;John: I like the program because
I get to learn a lot about the ocean

00:05:41.536 --> 00:05:43.126
and the animals that
live inside the ocean.

00:05:43.126 --> 00:05:45.316
And I learn more in the after
school than I learn in school.

00:05:46.116 --> 00:05:47.276
&gt;&gt;David: You know, we're
not a city where lots

00:05:47.276 --> 00:05:50.726
of parents have the resources
to go, you know, hire a teacher

00:05:50.726 --> 00:05:54.546
for a violin lesson, or go hire
a tutor for something special.

00:05:54.546 --> 00:05:57.566
So if it doesn't happen in
a system that we've built

00:05:57.566 --> 00:05:58.876
for them, it won't happen.

00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:01.556
&gt;&gt;Man: Don't be afraid
to let the beauty

00:06:01.556 --> 00:06:05.446
of the guitar tone
shine through, see?

00:06:05.446 --> 00:06:08.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: PASA carefully
monitors all of its programs

00:06:08.266 --> 00:06:11.766
with regular quality
assessments and tracking software

00:06:11.766 --> 00:06:13.726
that records attendance trends.

00:06:14.136 --> 00:06:16.186
And PASA is proving successful.

00:06:16.596 --> 00:06:18.496
Attendance at their
school sites is up,

00:06:18.766 --> 00:06:22.566
and Providence kids are choosing
the AfterZones over the streets.

00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.456
&gt;&gt;Dean: I have three
children in this city.

00:06:24.456 --> 00:06:28.256
I've got twenty-six thousand children
too, and they're all my children.

00:06:28.926 --> 00:06:32.536
And the same effort and concern
that's put into raising my children

00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:34.786
by my wife and I needs to be put

00:06:34.786 --> 00:06:36.416
into raising all the
children in this city.

00:06:36.916 --> 00:06:38.376
So we keep 'em busy after school.

00:06:38.996 --> 00:06:40.396
We keep 'em busy in the summertime.

00:06:40.856 --> 00:06:41.906
We keep 'em busy on the weekend.

00:06:42.846 --> 00:06:45.346
Works for my children, it
would work for all children.

00:06:45.536 --> 00:06:48.926
&gt;&gt;Rudy: One thing I really
enjoy is to hear kids laughing,

00:06:49.166 --> 00:06:52.556
kids hearing playing,
hearing kids having fun.

00:06:53.106 --> 00:06:55.836
And normally, our main
focus is academics.

00:06:55.976 --> 00:06:58.346
Because of our structure, we
don't have time for recess,

00:06:58.346 --> 00:07:00.086
we don't have time for breaks.

00:07:00.596 --> 00:07:05.126
What the AfterZone provides is an
opportunity for them just to be kids.

00:07:05.556 --> 00:07:07.636
&gt;&gt;Hillary: What we're really
trying to do is get kids excited

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:10.966
about coming to school so that they
can participate in the after school,

00:07:10.966 --> 00:07:15.356
which is the social emotional
fun stuff, as well as hands

00:07:15.356 --> 00:07:16.556
on learning that's relevant.

00:07:16.696 --> 00:07:18.696
&gt;&gt;Man: You think anything in
the water uses that oxygen?

00:07:19.166 --> 00:07:19.276
&gt;&gt;Yes.

00:07:19.526 --> 00:07:20.466
&gt;&gt;Yeah, what in the water uses it?

00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:20.606
&gt;&gt;Fish.

00:07:20.826 --> 00:07:23.526
&gt;&gt;Hillary: It's really about seeing
the potential to make connections,

00:07:23.596 --> 00:07:27.006
seeing assets in your community
everywhere, and having sort

00:07:27.006 --> 00:07:35.866
of a can do spirit that there's never
enough that we can do for the kids.

00:07:36.196 --> 00:07:38.176
