- I just grabbed her, I kept
bangin' her fuckin' head.

00:00:05.672 --> 00:00:07.507
"I don't give a fuck,
you fuck.

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.709
I'm--" and I know, I know a lot
of you motherfuckers like,

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.544
"Joey, you can't hit a woman--"
She's a fuckin' nun.

00:00:12.544 --> 00:00:14.547
Big fuckin' difference, okay?

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:15.882
Big fuckin' difference.

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:17.550

[cheers and applause]

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:22.615
- He's one of my best friends in
the world.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.417
You guys'll love him.
He's awesome.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.586
Ladies and gentleman,
Joey Diaz.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.254
[cheers and applause]

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:35.094
- I got a three-year-old, you
know, and I look at her.

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:36.795
She's beautiful. I look at her,
and I'm like,

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.965
"You know, when she gets older,
I don't think I'll have the

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:42.435
heart to fucking smack her to
discipline her."

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:44.470
You know what I'm saying?
Like, I throw, like,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.673
a sneaker at the cat from time
to time and shit like that.

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:49.475
When I look at my daughter, I
don't have the heart.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:51.377
Like, I look at her, like, I
could probably punish her

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:54.380
and send her to her room, but
can I fucking hit her?

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.484
No, like, I don't think I have
the balls to do it.

00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:00.519
But they always say that if you
grew up in a house

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:03.222
that you got fucked up at that
you'll probably have a house

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:05.191
that you fuck people up at.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.060
You know, like, if your
parents--and I'll tell you what.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.962
I grew up in the '70s.
My mom fucked me up, okay?

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:11.831
My mom fucked me up.
Not like fuck--it was as a

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:14.533
controlled beating, okay?
Let's get this shit straight.

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:17.236
Everybody in this room got a
controlled beating at one time.

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:19.639
That means you're not gonna
fucking die, okay?

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.008
You know, you're gonna get a
couple punches to the head,

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.043
you'll go down, and in two days,
you get a doll.

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:26.146
No big fucking deal.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.213
That's a controlled fucking
beating, all right?

00:02:28.213 --> 00:02:29.916
You're not gonna die, you know?

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:32.518
And when I was a kid, you know,
I used to bust my mom's balls,

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:34.654
and, you know, she's Cuban and,
you know, a single mom,

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:37.323
and she would lose her temper
from time to time.

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.425
And, you know, you get, like, my
mom would hit me with, like,

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:43.162
the straight punch to the head,
the fucking overhead right.

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:44.897
In Spanish, it's called...
[speaks Spanish]

00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:46.866
It means a fucking airplane.

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.334
And then they had, like,
different names to them.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:51.037
Then they have the fucking...
[speaks Spanish]

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:52.438
That's the bitch slap.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:54.707
You know, that's the Stockton
slap, right?

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:56.675
And then my mom had the
backhand.

00:02:56.675 --> 00:02:58.044
[speaks Spanish.]

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:00.513
That's just to throw you off to
open you--yeah.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:03.015
It opens you up for a sidekick
to the body, right?

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:04.583
That's what that does.

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:06.285
You're like, "Ahh," bam, and all
of a sudden,

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:08.221
you get kicked and shit,
so I took a beating.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:11.457
Listen, my mom threw a beating
on me one time on 86th Street

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.359
when I was, like, six, 'cause I
wouldn't get off a mule

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.395
in front of--there's a bank on
86th and Broadway,

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:18.965
and I--there was a mule, some
fucking dude with a mule,

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:21.867
and you give him, like, $3, and
he'd put a cowboy hat on you,

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:23.969
you know, and let you get on the
fucking mule with a vest and

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:25.738
shit, and I wouldn't get off the
mule.

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:27.906
My mother beat the fuck out of
my with her purse.

00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:31.077
That was a good one, like, a
live appearance-type beating.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.579
You don't get those.

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.414
But that was it.
Like, as I got older,

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:37.283
I never really got hit, and my
mom was single,

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:39.252
and my mama would always tell
me, "Don't ever let nobody

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:41.087
"touch your face; a really man
doesn't let nobody

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:42.588
"touch their face.
Don't let nobody

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:43.889
fucking touch your face."

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.425
So being Cuban, I was also
Catholic,

00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:48.494
so my mom
would scare me with the nuns.

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:50.262
She'd go, you fuck up, I'm
gonna send you to school, and

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:51.831
those nuns will fuck you up.

00:03:51.831 --> 00:03:53.466
Well, after torturing my mom

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:55.334
for a few years, she said,
fuck it, I'm puttin' you

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:57.102
in Catholic school, I'll let
the nuns deal with you.

00:03:57.102 --> 00:03:59.305
And I think my mom knew the nuns
were gonna fuck me up.

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:01.340
She just didn't want to know.
You know what I'm saying?

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.641
Like, she was like, they're
gonna fuck you up,

00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:04.343
but I don't wanna know about it.

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:06.446
So it was one of those schools--
Sacred Heart School for Boys--

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:08.781
you went on Sunday, and you came
home on Thursdays.

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:11.183
And the nuns were complete
fuckin' douchebags.

00:04:11.183 --> 00:04:12.951
I mean, complete douchebags.

00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:14.686
And I'm not lying, I don't give
a fuck if you don't--

00:04:14.686 --> 00:04:16.588
it's the truth, they were
fuckin'--

00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:18.625
I think about it now,
30 years later, and it really

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.125
was mild abuse.

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:21.627
It was very mild--I could've

00:04:21.627 --> 00:04:24.497
dialed 911 on those bitches,
but, you know,

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:27.967
nobody would've listened to my
cries, you understand me?

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:31.036
They say nuns don't--whatever,
so there was this one nun,

00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:33.172
Sister Anna, there was Sister
Marie,

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:34.606
there was Sister Heissons,

00:04:34.606 --> 00:04:37.510
and there was Sister--some--
Sister Patricia.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.313
Sister fucking Heissons was the
most evil person

00:04:41.313 --> 00:04:43.950
that ever walked the fucking
face of the Earth.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.117
They didn't hit me at that
school

00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:46.685
'cause I was a bad person.

00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:48.353
They used to hit me 'cause I
didn't like milk.

00:04:48.353 --> 00:04:50.323
Till this fucking day--listen,
to this day,

00:04:50.323 --> 00:04:52.057
I fucking hate milk, okay?

00:04:52.057 --> 00:04:53.559
I'm not allergic to it.

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.528
I just don't fucking like it.
That's it.

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:57.496
A milkshake, completely fucking
different.

00:04:57.496 --> 00:04:59.565
I'll drink ten of those
motherfuckers.

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:02.467
But milk plain out of a bottle,
I don't like that shit.

00:05:02.467 --> 00:05:04.670
It smells like dick.
I don't fucking like it.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.906
That's it.
I've never fucking liked it.

00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:09.708
I don't like broccoli then.
I don't like them now.

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:11.677
I don't give a fuck.
I don't like it.

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:13.346
But they would abuse me.

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:15.348
If I didn't drink the milk,
they'd put it on my head

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:17.016
and then bitch slap me, like,
three fucking times.

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:20.486
And then when I went down, she
hit me with the tray of food.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.488
These people were fucking
savages.

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:25.691
And this one fuckin' nun, Sister
Heissons--she's New Jersey,

00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:29.027
she looks just like Governor
Christie, all fucked up.

00:05:29.027 --> 00:05:33.733
She was like 5'2", 310--
the bitch didn't fuck around.

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:36.502
And if you look at a nun, they
have a fuckin' ring of Jesus.

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:38.271
They're married to Jesus.

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:40.172
And before she'd hit you, she'd
turn it around,

00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:42.208
and that's how they'd fuckin'
cut you and shit like that.

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:44.443
No, and these nuns don't
fuck around, guys.

00:05:44.443 --> 00:05:48.113
This is real old-school fuckin'
Catholicism, and, no,

00:05:48.113 --> 00:05:50.616
no, I wasn't molested--I was an
ugly kid, they didn't fuck

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:52.551
with me,
you know what I'm sayin'?

00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:55.087
Fuck you. I was an altar boy,
but I never hung out.

00:05:55.087 --> 00:05:57.790
Fuck you.
I don't want to play cards,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.394
and I don't want no hard ice
cream, cocksucker.

00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:03.229
I'm a Carvel motherfucker
anyway.

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:04.764
You know what I'm saying?

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:06.398
I'm a Carvel motherfucker.

00:06:06.398 --> 00:06:10.302
Fuck that hard ice cream, bitch.

00:06:10.302 --> 00:06:11.737
Fuck you think you're dealing
with?

00:06:11.737 --> 00:06:14.540
I got morals.
You know what I'm saying?

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.410
So I'm in the fuckin' fifth
grade, I'd been there

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.415
for like three years--
not in the fuckin' fifth grade,

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:26.452
I had--I had been at the school
fuckin' three years.

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:28.821
I started in the third grade,
and I stayed there till

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:31.891
the fifth, but there was
a reason why, and I didn't know,

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:34.827
I didn't know if I was like 30 I
wanted to make my Confirmation.

00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:37.396
I'm like, why am I makin' my
Confirmation at 30?

00:06:37.396 --> 00:06:39.632
And I remembered this story,
this is why.

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:41.567
Because in the fifth grade,
I couldn't take it no more.

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:44.804
Now, my dad died when I was
three, so my parent--my mom

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:47.573
at the time put me in kung-fu,
like karate with the brothers,

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:49.908
these black motherfuckers
on 90th Street.

00:06:49.908 --> 00:06:52.344
And they would teach you like
ghetto karate, like fuckin'

00:06:52.344 --> 00:06:54.480
judo and shit,
I was out of my mind.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.482
Between that and Bruce Lee,
I was ready to kill

00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:58.150
a motherfucker,
you know what I'm sayin'?

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.853
And Bruce Lee had died, and I
was all fucked in the head,

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:03.789
and my dad had died.
And between the pain and the

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:06.992
fuckin' low self-esteem and the
anger, I was boilin' inside.

00:07:06.992 --> 00:07:09.328
And one day, I'm in the fuckin'
Catholic school, and they're

00:07:09.328 --> 00:07:11.497
these two little twins,
they're like half mo-mos,

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:13.865
Rafael and Nino,
you know what I'm sayin'?

00:07:13.865 --> 00:07:15.835
They're fuckin' cryin', I'm
like, "What're you cryin' for?"

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:18.971
They go, "Sister Heissons--
My mommy's having a baby,

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:22.307
and Sister Heissons won't let us
call the hospital."

00:07:22.307 --> 00:07:25.444
And I'm like, "You know, not for
nothing.

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:27.880
Jesus don't pay for these
fucking lights."

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.181
[laughter]

00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:30.816
"Your mom and dad do.
Get up.

00:07:30.816 --> 00:07:32.718
"Just go call your fucking mom.
It's an emergency."

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:35.487
And the nun, Sister Heissons,
heard us, and she goes, "Really?

00:07:35.487 --> 00:07:37.323
All three of youse,
go outside and wait."

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:40.058
Now, when a nun told you to wait
outside the class,

00:07:40.058 --> 00:07:42.661
that means you were getting
a fuckin' beating, like you're

00:07:42.661 --> 00:07:44.663
getting the shit knocked out
of you, all right?

00:07:44.663 --> 00:07:49.502
So the bell rings...
the bell rings,

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:51.203
you know, she comes out,
she goes,

00:07:51.203 --> 00:07:53.673
so what did you three guys--
what were you talkin' about?

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:55.975
And there were two twins;
she took the one twin first,

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:59.011
smacked the fuck out of him
like 15 times, he went down.

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:00.979
[laughter]

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:03.582
She went to grab me, and I'm
like, I'm lookin' at the twin,

00:08:03.582 --> 00:08:05.184
I'm like, "That's your brother,
get in there,

00:08:05.184 --> 00:08:06.752
motherfucker," right?

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:09.355
"Why am I fighting for you?
Get in there, you fuck."

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:11.823
She grabbed him, fucked his
world up,

00:08:11.823 --> 00:08:14.660
and then she grabbed me,
and started bitch-slappin' me.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.695
But I kept thinking about my
mom.

00:08:16.695 --> 00:08:18.731
I got sick and tired of this
motherfucker hitting me

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:21.567
every time I wouldn't drink my
milk, and I was about to snap,

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:24.102
so I put my hands up, and she's
bitin' her tongue--

00:08:24.102 --> 00:08:25.504
I'll never forget this--goin',

00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:27.606
put your hands down,
put your hands down.

00:08:27.606 --> 00:08:29.708
I'm like, fuck, you've
gotta work for it,

00:08:29.708 --> 00:08:32.044
you know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't puttin' shit down.

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:33.378
She's hittin' me in the fuckin'
temple.

00:08:33.378 --> 00:08:35.047
This bitch is fucking me up.

00:08:35.047 --> 00:08:36.381
So finally she goes, "You're not
gonna put your hands down,

00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:38.050
then get in the utility closet."

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.118
That's basically where they
fucking killed you right there.

00:08:40.118 --> 00:08:42.388
They just fucking killed you,
then they called your mother

00:08:42.388 --> 00:08:45.624
and said, "He died of
pneumonia," and that was it.

00:08:45.624 --> 00:08:47.560
Creep motherfuckers, those
Catholics.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.394
I'm telling you right now.
I'd look behind the curtain.

00:08:49.394 --> 00:08:50.762
They're creepy motherfuckers.

00:08:50.762 --> 00:08:52.731
So she says, "Get in the utility
closet."

00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:55.200
That's where they had, like, the
books and the fucking

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.203
protractors and all that shit.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:59.271
So we get in there, and she
fucking doesn't even

00:08:59.271 --> 00:09:00.906
slam the door, guy.

00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:03.709
She just fuckin' japs me right
in the mouth, like...

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:05.277
[speaks Spanish]

00:09:05.277 --> 00:09:07.479
And I feel the blood, but I put
my hand up, and she's like,

00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:09.915
"Don't you ever tell on me," and
she's just smackin' me, guy.

00:09:09.915 --> 00:09:13.653
She's just going at it, bam,
bam, and she had elbows.

00:09:13.653 --> 00:09:16.288
She had kicks. This is way
before "UFC Unleashed."

00:09:16.288 --> 00:09:17.923
This bitch is going off.

00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:19.425
She's kicking my legs to lower
my hands,

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:21.160
and she's smackin' me.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.930
I'll tell you what, guys, I--I,
you know, I was fuckin' pissed.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.666
I--I couldn't believe this lady
was doin' this to me.

00:09:27.666 --> 00:09:29.402
And at one point, I go,
I'm--I'm gonna fuckin'

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.637
take this bitch out.

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:33.606
I'm just gonna take this
motherfucker out.

00:09:33.606 --> 00:09:35.107
I don't give a fuck.

00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:38.010
But if I go for her,
I gotta fuckin' go for it.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.445
'cause she's 320.

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:41.480
You following me?
I'm, like, 100 with a

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.483
crucifix in pocket.

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:47.353
If I go for it, I got to go for
this motherfucker.

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:49.121
So finally, she's like,
"Put your hands down."

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:50.856
I wouldn't put 'em down,
but I started tastin' the blood

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:53.258
in my mouth, and I started
fuckin' losin' it,

00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:54.994
and something just made me go,
I'm gonna go for this

00:09:54.994 --> 00:09:57.195
motherfucker, but I'm gonna
grab her by the ears,

00:09:57.195 --> 00:09:59.198
and I grabbed her by the veil,
'cause that's where all

00:09:59.198 --> 00:10:01.466
the magic powers are, right?

00:10:01.466 --> 00:10:03.802
I grabbed her by the fuckin'
veil, and I'm like, "Don't you

00:10:03.802 --> 00:10:07.039
"ever fuckin' hit me again,
you cocksucker!

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:08.274
I hate you!"

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.374
And I'm just cryin'.

00:10:09.374 --> 00:10:11.143
This is seven years of anger

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:14.212
and pain--I missed father;
what's goin' on in my house?

00:10:14.212 --> 00:10:16.982
I just grabbed her, I kept
bangin' her fuckin' head.

00:10:16.982 --> 00:10:19.184
"I don't give a fuck,
you fuck. I'm--"

00:10:19.184 --> 00:10:21.720
And I know, I know a lot of you
motherfuckers like, "Joey,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.289
you can't hit a woman--"
She's a fuckin' nun.

00:10:24.289 --> 00:10:26.191
Big fuckin' difference, okay?

00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:27.960
Big fuckin' difference.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.696
She don't suck no cock, they
don't take it in the ass,

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:33.165
these motherfuckers are angry,
all right?

00:10:33.165 --> 00:10:35.333
They don't eat no pussy.
They just walk around

00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:36.835
with a fuckin' black suit on.

00:10:36.835 --> 00:10:38.504
Something's got to be done.

00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:40.172
It's fucked up.

00:10:40.172 --> 00:10:42.641
You got to eat something.
You know what I'm saying?

00:10:42.641 --> 00:10:45.477
You got to eat something.

00:10:45.477 --> 00:10:47.412
You're walking around like
somebody died.

00:10:47.412 --> 00:10:50.416
Yeah, your fucking pussy, that's
what died.

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:54.152
[laughter]

00:10:54.152 --> 00:10:57.523
So I got her by the fuckin' ears
now, and I ain't lettin' go,

00:10:57.523 --> 00:10:59.491
because I know she's gonna
fuck my world up.

00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:02.561
And I'm poundin', poundin',
poundin', but the black dudes,

00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:05.063
they taught me judo, too.
So I went to give her like

00:11:05.063 --> 00:11:10.035
a hip throw, but she's 320, I
couldn't do it, so I just

00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:12.338
settled on a headlock,
and I'm grabbin' her by

00:11:12.338 --> 00:11:14.573
the fuckin' head, and I'm
squeezin', and she's goin',

00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:16.108
"You're gonna go to hell!"

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:18.944
And I'm like, "So the fuck
are you, motherfucker!"

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:21.079
And I'm squeezin'
her fuckin' head,

00:11:21.079 --> 00:11:23.549
"Fuck you!
Fuck you!"

00:11:23.549 --> 00:11:25.684
And finally, there was a little
mad mafia kid--

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:28.553
thank God for
fuckin' Italian people.

00:11:28.553 --> 00:11:31.123
Thank God for fuckin' Italian
people.

00:11:31.123 --> 00:11:34.860
They don't give a fuck about
the rules or nothin'.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.394
This guy's like,
"What's goin' on?"

00:11:36.394 --> 00:11:37.797
I go, "This bitch
tried to kill me."

00:11:37.797 --> 00:11:41.067
And he's like,
"Fuck this bitch."

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:44.803
He took her arm, and he twisted
this motherfucker.

00:11:44.803 --> 00:11:46.405
I got her in a headlock,
this little eight-year-old's

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:50.375
twisting her fuckin' arm,
and she's like "Ahh!"

00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:53.144
And we don't give a fuck.
The other nuns are around.

00:11:53.144 --> 00:11:54.646
But lemme tell ya what happened.

00:11:54.646 --> 00:11:56.748
Now, the door was open,
and there was a bunch of kids,

00:11:56.748 --> 00:12:00.419
and they're yellin',
"Coco! Coco! Coco!"

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:02.954
Now I gotta kill her--
you understand me?

00:12:02.954 --> 00:12:05.991
There ain't no turnin'
fuckin' back.

00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:09.461
[laughter]

00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:11.931
So we take her out of the
utility closet.

00:12:11.931 --> 00:12:14.166
They're yelling, "Call the
police."

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:16.902
I'm like, "Call the police.
I'm fuckin' bleeding.

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:18.904
I don't give a fuck.
Call the cops."

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:20.739
We're twisting her.
The kids are coming over.

00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:22.507
They're kicking her and shit.

00:12:22.507 --> 00:12:23.942
It's--the Puerto Ricans too.

00:12:23.942 --> 00:12:25.978
They don't give a fuck either.

00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:28.313
A couple Roberto Clemente
motherfuckers

00:12:28.313 --> 00:12:30.816
kicking her and shit.

00:12:30.816 --> 00:12:32.518
[laughs]

00:12:32.518 --> 00:12:36.254
[laughter]

00:12:36.254 --> 00:12:38.590
So I don't know nothin'.
I don't fuckin' know nothin'.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.159
They call the police.
The kids are clapping.

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:41.660
It's fuckin' crazy.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.029
We're taking over the whole
fuckin' hallway.

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:47.465
And I go, "Fuck it, let's call
my mother."

00:12:47.465 --> 00:12:49.001
So we drag this nun in a half

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:52.604
a armbar and a headlock,
and we took her shoes off.

00:12:52.604 --> 00:12:54.806
I don't know why till today.

00:12:54.806 --> 00:12:56.775
300--she had those big fuckin'
fat feet

00:12:56.775 --> 00:12:58.977
with no nail polish and shit.

00:12:58.977 --> 00:13:01.780
We took the feet out from under
her and just dragged her.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.316
Her head was turning red, and
one of the Puerto Ricans

00:13:04.316 --> 00:13:06.651
called the number and put it
to my ear, and I called my mom,

00:13:06.651 --> 00:13:08.820
Mima...
[speaks Spanish]

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.522
That means the nun hit me.
Let me tell ya somethin'--

00:13:10.522 --> 00:13:12.991
Kearny, New Jersey, is about

00:13:12.991 --> 00:13:15.660
22 minutes from inner-city
New Jersey--my mother made it

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.829
in eight minutes.

00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:19.831
She shows up with eight Puerto
Ricans

00:13:19.831 --> 00:13:22.067
and a SanterÃ­a
priest with a live chicken--

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:23.535
you understand me?

00:13:23.535 --> 00:13:26.705
That's when shit
goes down motherfucker.

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:28.306
So they finally got me off the
fuck.

00:13:28.306 --> 00:13:30.843
She's--her hair's fucked up.
The veil's off.

00:13:30.843 --> 00:13:33.178
My mom's telling her, "You want
to hit my son,

00:13:33.178 --> 00:13:35.580
"you've got to get fucked in the
ass and have your own kid,"

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.182
and all this shit.

00:13:37.182 --> 00:13:39.818
I'm loving it.
My mom got my back and shit.

00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:41.186
So now we're sitting down,

00:13:41.186 --> 00:13:42.888
people are holding on to their
heads,

00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:45.990
got the priest in the room, the
principal,

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:47.692
and they tell my mom, "He's out,

00:13:47.692 --> 00:13:49.528
him and his other fucking
cohorts,"

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:51.596
like, eight of us, "They're
fucking out of here."

00:13:51.596 --> 00:13:53.265
And my mom's listening to this.

00:13:53.265 --> 00:13:57.169
She's got half a bag on.
She's a little drunk and shit.

00:13:57.169 --> 00:14:01.373
And she's like, "He ain't goin'
fuckin' nowhere."

00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:04.109
And they're like, "No, he's got
to go. He's out of here."

00:14:04.109 --> 00:14:06.377
Listen, when I was growing up,
there was this Jew bookie

00:14:06.377 --> 00:14:10.015
in the neighborhood, tremendous.

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:12.351
Let me tell you something.
Thank God for Jewish people.

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:13.752
[laughter]

00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:15.521
All right, this motherfucker was
a bookie,

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:17.889
but in the early '70s, if you
beat him for, like, $2,000 or

00:14:17.889 --> 00:14:21.292
$3,000, he would show up at your
house with $500 bills.

00:14:21.292 --> 00:14:23.761
And he'd say to you, "You want
me to pay you, I'll pay you,

00:14:23.761 --> 00:14:25.731
but I've got to give you 500s."

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:27.199
"Ahh, let it roll till next
week."

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:30.568
Then the next week, he got you.
You following me?

00:14:30.568 --> 00:14:33.572
So he always had your fucking
money.

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:35.707
He would just lie to you that he
had $500 bills.

00:14:35.707 --> 00:14:37.576
Who the fuck has, like, a $500
bill.

00:14:37.576 --> 00:14:40.245
People would believe it; that's
an old Jew trick right there.

00:14:40.245 --> 00:14:41.647
Let me tell you what my...

00:14:41.647 --> 00:14:43.415
[laughter]

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:46.618
You got to learn; you got to
fuckin' learn, cocksuckers.

00:14:46.618 --> 00:14:48.653
[laughter]

00:14:48.653 --> 00:14:50.421
He goes to throw my mom out,
and my mom goes,

00:14:50.421 --> 00:14:52.124
"Listen, he ain't goin' nowhere,

00:14:52.124 --> 00:14:54.593
or I want my deposit back in
fives."

00:14:54.593 --> 00:14:55.827
That's an old Jew trick too.

00:14:55.827 --> 00:14:57.629
It blew their mind.
"Fives?"

00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:59.131
[laughter]

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:02.100
"We don't have no fuckin' fives
till Sunday."

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.970
"Then my fuckin' son stays,
motherfuckers, okay?"

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.672
And they let me graduate,

00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:08.106
They let me finish out the year,
but you know what?

00:15:08.106 --> 00:15:09.808
A nun never fuckin'
hit me again.

00:15:09.808 --> 00:15:11.443
That's my story.
Thank you very much.
