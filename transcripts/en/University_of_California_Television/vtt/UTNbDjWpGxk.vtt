(techno music)

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.100
- Welcome to A Conversation with History,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.440
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.500
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.870
Our guest today is Linda Greenhouse,

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.130
who has covered the Supreme Court

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.320
for the New York Times for 30 years,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.710
and has just joined the faculty

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.240
of the Yale Law School.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.000
Linda, welcome to Berkeley.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.833
- Thanks for having me.

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:47.360
- Where were you born and raised?

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.640
- I was born in New York City.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.170
My parents moved out of New York City,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.420
back to my father's hometown

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.090
of New Haven, Connecticut
when I was a baby,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.550
so I grew up outside of New Haven.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.540
- And, what was the conversation

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.550
like around the dinner table?

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.200
Was there discussion of the law,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.630
or is this something that just came

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.463
to you later,

00:01:05.463 --> 00:01:06.296
an interest in law?
- No,

00:01:06.296 --> 00:01:07.129
there wasn't discussion of law.

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:08.103
My father was a doctor,

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.750
he and my mother were
interested in public affairs,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.230
so we talked about, you
know, current events,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.340
not like the Kennedy's, not, you know,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.650
I don't wanna exaggerate.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.333
But, no, not law per se.

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.710
- And looking back, how do you think

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.926
your parents shaped your
thinking about the world?

00:01:25.926 --> 00:01:29.383
- Well, I think they had a, basically,

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.440
progressive outlook on the world.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.680
They weren't politically engaged,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.233
but they were democrats,

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:41.350
and, you know, I think I
grew up with that, kind of,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.480
basic orientation,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.003
that FDR was a great president.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.200
I guess my first political
consciousness was in the JFK era,

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.730
when Kennedy became president,
I was in junior high school,

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.750
and I was very taken with him,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.760
and his whole, you know,
what he represented.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.720
And so, that was kinda my
own political awakening.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.860
- Was it natural

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.610
that you fall into being
a Supreme Court reporter?

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.240
I'm just looking at this early period,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.290
we'll talk about your education--

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.840
- Oh no, I mean really,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.680
I think somebody outside looking
at a career path like mine

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.190
would say, oh, she spent 30
years covering the Supreme Court

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.023
for the New York Times,

00:02:25.023 --> 00:02:27.820
this must've been according
to some grand design.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.570
But, I think, like a lot of careers,

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.050
it really was quite random.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.720
What I wanted to be was a journalist.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.820
And I think, in part,

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.110
because of my fascination
with the young John Kennedy,

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.890
and so on, I read The
Making of the President

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.890
in 1960, the great Theodore White book,

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.450
which was really the first book ever

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.670
to get behind the scenes of
a modern political campaign.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.670
And what I took away from it
at the age of 16 or 15 was,

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.817
you know, people got paid for
flying around the country,

00:02:58.817 --> 00:03:03.160
writing articles about
my hero and, you know,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.550
maybe this was a job
that one could aspire to.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.090
So, what I wanted to be was a journalist,

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.900
and what I wanted to be
was a political journalist.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.312
And that's what I started
out being, actually.

00:03:13.312 --> 00:03:15.650
- And, before we get to that choice,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.520
where were you educated?

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.710
- Went to public school
in Hamden, Connecticut,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.620
and then I went to Radcliffe
College, which is now Harvard,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.440
so I, Harvard I would say.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.524
- Yes, and what did you major in?

00:03:27.524 --> 00:03:28.980
- I majored in American Government.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.153
- Aha, so you had the politics bug,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.749
plus the journalism bug.

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:37.580
- Yeah, I mean I, you know,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.810
wasn't, sort of, out
there on the front lines

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.010
of anything, I mean, I
wasn't a political activist,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.840
you might say, like a
number of my friends were

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.960
in the late 1960s.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.250
But, I was very interested
as then, and as a subject.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.290
- And, what about your skills as a writer,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.237
which are quite good? (laughs)
- Thank you.

00:03:55.246 --> 00:03:59.740
- Did that just come naturally
through your education

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.090
at Radcliffe, Harvard?
- I think so.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.160
Well, in high school I had teachers

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.580
who really prized writing,

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.760
and we got a lot of writing in school.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.400
And, I always was working
on the school paper,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.220
and I was editor of the
high school newspaper,

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.410
and always did a lot
of writing on the side.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.500
And was an editor of the Harvard Crimson,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.770
the Harvard daily paper.

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.890
So, yeah, I would say,

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.580
I mean I never took a
course in a formal way

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.810
on writing or on
journalism, for that matter,

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.540
but, it sorta came.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.240
- And, did you go right into journalism

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.700
after your graduation?

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.390
And, what did you cover?

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.790
- Yes, I was one of the
few people that I knew

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.310
that didn't go to graduate school.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.977
I went out in the--
- Lucky you.

00:04:45.977 --> 00:04:48.357
- Lucky me, I went out in the workplace,

00:04:48.357 --> 00:04:52.830
and I was very fortunate
to get hired as an intern

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.600
by James Reston, who was then one

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.078
of the most famous newspaper
columnists in the country.

00:04:59.078 --> 00:05:00.964
James Reston, of the New York Times,

00:05:00.964 --> 00:05:04.560
had his own, kind of, clerkship program,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.670
that he actually had modeled

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.370
after a Supreme Court clerkship,

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.580
where he would take a kid every year,

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.623
out of college, from a
college newspaper background,

00:05:12.623 --> 00:05:15.810
and they would get to work with him,

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.660
doing research for him,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.070
doing whatever, learning the business

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.720
at his side for one year.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.870
And then, typically get a chance

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.157
to have a staff tryout
at the New York Times.

00:05:29.157 --> 00:05:31.270
And so, that's what happened to me.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.670
- And what do you think
you learned from him?

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.670
Because he was a unique
figure in American journalism,

00:05:41.545 --> 00:05:45.860
and some might say that we
don't see as many columnists

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.920
like that these days.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.127
- Oh, he was a unique figure in many ways,

00:05:50.127 --> 00:05:54.487
and in fact, my years
experience with him was unusual

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:58.130
among the 20 or 30 young people

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.010
who had the chance that I had,

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.530
because the year that I
worked for him, actually,

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.830
we were not in Washington,
which was his home base.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.300
There were some kind of
internal political crisis

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.150
at the New York Times,

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.690
I don't even know exactly what it was,

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.460
but he became, just at the
time that I was graduating,

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.900
to go to work for him,

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.363
he became executive editor
of the New York Times,

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.620
for that one year.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.970
So, his base of operations moved

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.332
to New York, and he
kept writing his column,

00:06:24.332 --> 00:06:26.400
and I kept doing research

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.780
and handling column-related
chores for him.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.740
But he was also running the newspaper.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.650
So, he had a staff of grownups
that were working for him,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.850
and, you know, I didn't
have anything to do

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.020
with that side of it.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.700
So, you know, but what I got
was a kind of a ringside seat

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.440
at the internal workings of the newspaper.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.510
So, I certainly learned a lot.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.910
- And, Reston, as I think back,

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.123
was somebody who was kind of

00:06:54.123 --> 00:06:59.123
at the center of the center which existed

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.477
at that time in American politics.

00:07:01.477 --> 00:07:03.550
- Yes he--
- Did you experience any

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.810
of that, in the sense of
getting the impression

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.260
of the way American politics worked,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.600
national politics at the New York Times,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.850
in what must have been a different era?

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.970
- Well, it was the Vietnam era.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.930
We're talking--
- It was coming unraveling,

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:21.763
a bit--
- That's right.

00:07:21.763 --> 00:07:25.520
We're talking 1968,
1969, it was the election

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.105
of Richard Nixon.

00:07:27.105 --> 00:07:29.174
The cities were burning.

00:07:29.174 --> 00:07:31.720
Washington was filled with demonstrations.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.760
It was a very--
- So, it was after then,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.593
after the period

00:07:35.593 --> 00:07:36.426
that I was describing.

00:07:36.426 --> 00:07:37.800
- It was a very tumultuous time,

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.110
and it was disturbing to him,

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.070
because he was a man of the establishment,

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.940
you might say.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.730
And, things weren't supposed
to work the way they worked.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.610
Although, when I say establishment,

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.650
I mean, he was no fan of Richard Nixon,

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.240
and in fact, that was
my first election, 1968.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.820
In those days you had to
be 21 in order to vote.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.580
And, I remember I was very dismayed

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.520
about the course of politics,

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.500
and, you know, Hubert
Humphrey didn't seem to me

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.490
to embody the kind of change,

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.730
you might say in today's
parlance, that I wanted.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.350
And I said, oh I don't know,
maybe I'll just vote for Nixon.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.050
And I remember he growled at me,

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.020
and he said, Greenhouse,

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.910
you are voting for Humphrey (laughs).

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.160
Yes, Sir.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.903
So, you know, he was a
person of strong views.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.300
But, you know, what I got
to witness at his side,

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.520
was he worked really hard.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.540
And, he was always on the phone,

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.480
he was always talking to people.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.340
He wasn't one of these pundits

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.240
that would sort of sit in an ivory tower

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.070
and talk to himself.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.380
And, I remember one thing

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.380
that he told me, he didn't
give me a whole lot of advice,

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.530
he was very busy running the newspaper,

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:55.130
but he did make an observation
that really stuck with me,

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.636
which is that,

00:08:56.636 --> 00:09:00.390
don't be afraid to ask questions
while you're interviewing

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.210
or reporting, or you're
at the scene of an event,

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.140
because if you're too
shy, or feel too inhibited

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.459
to ask the question then,

00:09:08.459 --> 00:09:10.800
and you sit down to write the story,

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.510
that's when you really
need to know the answer,

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.710
and then it's too late.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.190
So, always get your questions out there,

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.667
and always try to learn more than 100%

00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:25.000
of what you're going to have
to disgorge in your writing.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.840
If you're just at that 100%,

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.560
and you have no reserve,
you're on pretty thin ice.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.700
And of course, if you know less than 100%

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.310
of what you need to know,
you're really in trouble.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.797
So, I carried that with
me into my later career,

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.700
and always did try to go the extra mile,

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.050
and learn more than I knew I was going to

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.260
be pressed to know in the,

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.208
just in the context of
the daily journalism.

00:09:53.208 --> 00:09:55.910
- Your first assignment was what?

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.270
Once you left being at Reston's side?

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.260
- I was a reporter on general
assignment on the metro staff

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.420
at the Times for, oh,
maybe about six months,

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.010
and then they sent me to
one of the suburban bureaus,

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.585
West Chester County,

00:10:09.585 --> 00:10:12.450
a suburban county just
north of New York City.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.380
And, I stayed there for almost four years.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.690
- And then, did you go
to Albany after that?

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:18.523
Or, yeah--
- Yeah,

00:10:18.523 --> 00:10:22.230
then I had a little stint on
what they called night rewrite.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.580
So, I would come in every
day, late in the afternoon,

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.670
and just do whatever.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:27.628
You know, don't forget,

00:10:27.628 --> 00:10:31.000
those were the days when there
was actually a news cycle.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.940
And, you know, the paper
came out in the morning,

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.290
and that's when people got their news.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:38.340
It wasn't the 24/7 news
cycle that we have today.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.360
So, I covered some very trivial things,

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.710
I covered some very major things.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.997
I remember one of the major
things was the coup in Chile,

00:10:47.997 --> 00:10:51.060
the murder of Salvador Allende.

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:55.300
And, we didn't have an obit
of Allende in the files,

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.900
because there was no anticipation

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.670
that he was soon to die.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.440
And so, I remember
having to cobble up that,

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.700
right on deadline, and
recount the whole history,

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.550
the modern political history of Chile,

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.120
using whatever resources
we had immediately at hand.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.810
And I'm not talking about
Google or the internet.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.660
I'm talking about, you know,
clip files with hard copy.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.497
So, it was very exciting,
and I learned a lot,

00:11:17.497 --> 00:11:18.840
and I really liked it, actually.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.670
It was fabulous training.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:25.670
So, I did that for, mm,
maybe about 3/4 of a year,

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.730
and then got the chance to
go to the Albany bureau,

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:29.940
covering the state legislature.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.320
- And, what was it like
covering state politics?

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.530
I mean, what did you learn
from that experience?

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.960
Because, just thinking about it,

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.340
it must've been very different

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.216
from covering the Supreme Court.

00:11:42.216 --> 00:11:46.460
- Oh well, I mean, any
young reporter should try

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.660
to work covering a state capital.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.720
Because, just on the simplest level,

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.930
it's fantastic good fun.

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.300
I mean, it's a three-ring circus,

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.260
no matter what the capital is,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.720
if it's Sacramento, if it's Austin,

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.570
and Albany, certainly was that.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.470
So, that was just, you know, pure fun.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:04.948
But, on the substance,

00:12:04.948 --> 00:12:08.930
those were the years, in
the mid to late 1970s,

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.470
the years of the New
York City fiscal crisis,

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.190
which folks here may not remember,

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.830
but, the fiscal--
- We have our own (laughs).

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.440
- You have your own, and
now the country has its own,

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.950
since we're talking in September of 2008.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.810
But, back in the 1970s,

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.093
New York City was technically bankrupt.

00:12:27.093 --> 00:12:30.789
And, this was an amazing evolution,

00:12:30.789 --> 00:12:32.980
and the question was what to do about it,

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.670
and it had taken years for
that crisis to mount up.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.300
And it took years for it to be resolved.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.510
And, I was there on the
resolution side of it.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.890
So, it was really fascinating.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:48.360
Now, New York had a really
outstanding governor, Hugh Carey.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.580
The first democratic governor
in New York in, I think,

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.150
16 years, right after the
Rockefeller era ended.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.620
And, he didn't know anything

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.690
about municipal finance,

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:57.880
and neither did anybody.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.990
But, they knew they had
to learn it really quick.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.260
And so, they called on some

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.670
of the smartest people on Wall Street.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:07.690
Felix Rohatyn is a name
people might recognize,

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.400
was just a young investment banker,

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.870
he was brought in.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.760
And everybody put their
shoulder to the wheel

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.230
and worked out a way of
getting through this crisis.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.500
And I was really on the
front lines covering it

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.510
on a daily basis.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:23.470
So, I learned the substance
of municipal finance,

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.240
I learned about politics.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.720
I was exposed to some
fascinating personalities,

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.115
and it was just a great experience.

00:13:29.115 --> 00:13:30.610
- Would it be fair to say

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.597
that covering the Supreme Court is more

00:13:33.597 --> 00:13:35.829
like an academic exercise

00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:38.970
than covering state politics?

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.800
In the sense that you're looking

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.800
at decisions, cases out there
from an office (laughs)?

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:50.303
- Well, I mean,

00:13:50.303 --> 00:13:53.440
it certainly doesn't have
the face-to-face quality

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.190
that covering a political institution has.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:01.190
But, I think what my
Albany experience gave me

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.490
was a bit of a sense of a court,

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:10.970
the Supreme Court as an institution

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.460
that's inherently a part
of our political process.

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.040
And so, when you say academic, I mean,

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.210
it may have a sort of an academic feel,

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.610
that you're sitting and
reading most of the time,

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.840
instead of, kind of, mixing
it up with the news makers.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.390
But, I think what I tried to bring

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:32.017
to my reporting on the court
was a sense of context,

00:14:32.017 --> 00:14:34.010
and a lot of times it's political context,

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.700
because Supreme Court cases
don't just drop out of the sky.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.430
They come out of something,

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.030
they come out of some conflict in society

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.770
that leads to litigation,

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.290
that leads to lower court decisions

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.367
that leads directly to the Supreme Court.

00:14:46.367 --> 00:14:49.560
And I tried to maintain a sense of that,

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.530
and give my readers a feel for that.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.363
- Right.

00:14:52.363 --> 00:14:54.800
So I guess, what I was
making was a distinction

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.520
of how you gather the information,

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.350
versus the actual writeup, and so on.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.936
So, in Supreme Court work,

00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:06.550
you're following the cases, obviously,

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.360
that are out there in the country,

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.190
that are coming before the court.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.283
But, are you doing a lot of interviewing?

00:15:12.283 --> 00:15:13.840
- No, I'm not doing a lot of interviewing,

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.610
but I'm following more than the cases.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.470
I'm following the, kind
of, political landscape

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.160
to understand the context

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.200
in which these cases are occurring.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.080
- Yes.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:30.080
And, you've written in some
of, both in the Blackmun book

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
and in your articles about
the dynamics within the court,

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.320
which I found interesting.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.660
In the Blackmun book, you wrote

00:15:45.625 --> 00:15:48.260
about the court's processes.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:53.260
You said, there was a fluidity
with which coalitions formed

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.230
and shifted, and formed again,

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.610
depending on the issue.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:01.350
It was extremely foolish ever
to write off a likely opponent

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.180
or to take a potential ally for granted.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.800
With so many cases under
consideration at once,

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.410
a colleague might, at any given moment,

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.550
be both opponent and ally.

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:16.500
So this was a dynamic that you
came to see over the course

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.333
of your term.

00:16:17.333 --> 00:16:18.447
Now, talk a little about that.

00:16:18.447 --> 00:16:19.741
- Well, I think that was,

00:16:19.741 --> 00:16:23.370
I was writing about a
period in the 1970s and 80s,

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:24.790
but it's still true today,

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.223
I mean, in the, kind of,
small-group dynamic of nine people,

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:31.690
you know, you can't take
anybody for granted.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:35.290
And, what happens at the court, you know,

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.480
somebody gets assigned to take a try

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.372
at crafting a majority opinion,

00:16:40.372 --> 00:16:43.780
and, you know, that's
just taking a crack at it.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.870
And, nobody can speak

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.720
for the court unless four
other people sign their name

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.750
on what you're circulating.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.960
So, I think, for instance,

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.860
a lot of people ask me,

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.910
well, after Bush against
Gore, the 2000 election case,

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:04.530
which was so hard fought, and
so bitterly dissented from

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:06.253
by the four dissenters,

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.590
you know, how could
they get back together?

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:10.310
How could the court function?

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:11.969
And, you know, I always answer,

00:17:11.969 --> 00:17:14.106
they knew they had to get back together.

00:17:14.106 --> 00:17:16.130
Because it's not like Congress,

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.470
where, you know, you can be part

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.430
of a caucus that goes off and sulks

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.750
in the cloak room until things
start breaking your way.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.350
You don't have that luxury
at the Supreme Court,

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:27.310
you've gotta get onto
the next case pronto.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.910
And you've gotta be able to count to five

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.000
if your gonna get anything done.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.500
So, I think that is a basic dynamic

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.035
that keeps the court going,

00:17:35.035 --> 00:17:40.035
even in a period where there
are pretty sharp disagreements,

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:41.590
and the court is quite polarized

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.260
on a lot of important things.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:48.260
- And, you have friendships
that cross, you know,

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.530
intellectual barriers, so to speak.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.850
I believe Ginsburg is a friend of Scalia,

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.250
and in the case of Blackmun,

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.040
he had been close to Burger,

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.700
but over the course of years,
they went different ways.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.300
- Yeah, I mean, I think
friendship, or lack of friendship,

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:11.270
could be, sort of, you know,
too easily exaggerated.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.520
I mean, I think they
all try to be collegial,

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.723
they're all grownups.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.340
But, I don't think where
the rubber meets the road

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.070
in terms of how you're
gonna vote in a case,

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.730
it's not, again, it's not
like a political branch,

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:29.493
where there would be vote
trading or, you know,

00:18:29.493 --> 00:18:32.420
you're a good guy, I'll
support your project today,

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.410
on the expectation

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.610
that you'll support my
pet project tomorrow,

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:36.610
it's not like that.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:39.313
You just vote how you think
the case should come out.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.840
- Let me show your Blackmun
book, we'll get into it,

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.470
Becoming Justice Blackmun.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:48.710
It's an intellectual biography,

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.465
a biography and the story
of his life on the court,

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:54.910
and, actually, his life even before that.

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:58.190
And, from this book I got the sense

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.960
that law clerks can be very important.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.871
I mean, the justice is still in charge,

00:19:03.871 --> 00:19:08.133
but often they are a kind of a source

00:19:09.718 --> 00:19:14.490
of stretching the intellectual boundaries

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:16.310
of what's in the judges mind.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:17.940
Although they don't necessarily,

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.110
I'm not saying they decide the decision,

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:25.110
but they help stretch a
justices mind, is that fair?

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.570
- Well, I think that was probably true

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:29.393
in Blackmun's case, I'm not
sure it's true in every case.

00:19:29.393 --> 00:19:31.160
It's a very intimate relationship,

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.770
the justice and the law clerks.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:34.970
Each justice has four law clerks,

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.221
and they serve for a year.

00:19:37.221 --> 00:19:39.420
And they are the best and the brightest

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.040
of the recent law school graduates.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.500
They've all been law review editors,

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.100
and they've all clerked on some
other court before they come

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:45.933
to the Supreme Court.

00:19:45.933 --> 00:19:50.500
So, the justices who
use them well, I think,

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.030
use them as a source
of intellectual energy

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.033
and refreshment,

00:19:54.033 --> 00:19:56.670
because, you know, you're
up in your ivory tower

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.680
as a Supreme Court justice,
and you're kind of, you know,

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.237
not necessarily in the mix of, kind of,

00:20:02.237 --> 00:20:07.090
the current ferment over the
constitution, or whatever.

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.740
So, the reason they use this system,

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.610
and not every court does,

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.314
I mean, there are courts that have,

00:20:13.314 --> 00:20:15.980
not the federal courts,
but there are state courts

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.150
or whatever, who have a cadre

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.870
of professional clerk research staff,

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.440
and they don't turn over every year,

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.540
and that's another model.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.490
But the reason

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.370
that the federal clerks
use this clerkship model is

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:33.113
there's an affirmative
benefit from it to the judges.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:39.160
- Has, do you think that the
way the court is perceived

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:44.430
by society has changed a lot
in the course of your career?

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:50.080
Has the court become
politicized at a new level?

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.840
Or does this just periodically happen

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.723
in American history, as was
the case in The New Deal?

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.700
- Well, I mean, your question seems

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.430
to assume that I think
the court is politicized.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.630
- No, I'm asking, I'm just asking.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.350
In other words, as an observer,

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.980
I'm not a legal scholar,
looking from afar,

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.510
it seems that we've gone
through a recent period

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:16.750
of high politicization.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.710
And, I guess I should
define what I mean by that.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:22.407
I mean the way the Supreme Court becomes

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:29.030
an object of political concern
in the greater society.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:30.590
I'm not talking about,

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.550
necessarily, the politicization
among the members

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.640
of the court, which would
be a different question.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.750
- Well, I started covering
the courts, sort of,

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.300
at the long shadow of the Warren court.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.370
And, you now, Richard Nixon came

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.059
to national political prominence,

00:21:44.059 --> 00:21:46.790
and ran for president in 1968,

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.920
running against the Supreme Court.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.932
So, I mean, the Supreme
Court is a very handy target

00:21:52.932 --> 00:21:54.380
for politicians.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.690
And that is certainly nothing new.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.900
In fact, I think right now
the political discourse

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.760
about the court is at a lower level,

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.550
is almost beneath the radar.

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:08.290
I keep waiting for the
presidential candidates this year

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.590
to have a good, rip-roaring discussion

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:11.423
about the Supreme Court.

00:22:11.423 --> 00:22:12.470
That has not yet occurred,

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.390
and it never occurred
in the Clinton years,

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:16.820
although I kept waiting for it then, too.

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:21.820
So, you know, I think the court
can serve political purposes

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:27.970
when a national politician
thinks it's in their interest

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.520
to make it, but that
isn't necessarily anything

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.920
that's inherent in the court itself

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.223
at one period or another.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.370
- You write, let me give you another quote

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:41.513
about the Supreme Court from your book.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:45.430
Maybe this was from
the book, I'm not sure.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.190
In fact, it is most
often the Supreme Court

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:49.600
that is the follower.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.870
You're talking about it's
relationship to society.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.650
It ratifies or consolidates change,

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.040
rather than propelling it.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.276
Although, in the midst of
heated debate over a major case,

00:22:59.276 --> 00:23:02.140
it can appear otherwise.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.560
You go on to say,

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.579
I'm simply offering my
empirical observation

00:23:06.579 --> 00:23:07.800
that the court lives

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.340
in constant dialog with
other institutions,

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:11.480
formal and informal.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.030
And when it strays too far
outside the existing political

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:20.000
or social consensus, the
result is palpable tension,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.510
both inside and outside the court.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:24.190
I believe this actually
appeared in the New York Times,

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.910
your farewell--
- Yeah, that was in a kind

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.890
of a retrospective piece

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.330
that appeared in July.
- Kinda comment on that.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.740
Do you wanna say anything more than that?

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.800
Because it's obviously the case

00:23:37.873 --> 00:23:41.270
that in particular cases, Roe v. Wade,

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:45.250
which you discuss, because,
in the Blackmun book,

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.406
because he, of course, wrote the opinion.

00:23:47.406 --> 00:23:52.406
That was a case where the
court may have gone too far,

00:23:55.821 --> 00:23:58.510
not in the sense of women's
rights, but in the sense

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:01.150
of the way the society reacted.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:04.250
- Well, or I would, to be more,
say more current about it,

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:07.193
I mean, on my watch at
the court, certainly,

00:24:07.193 --> 00:24:09.840
affirmative action was a big,

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.940
was a hot topic.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.843
And the court wrestled with it,

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:19.167
the Bakke case, 1978, was
one of the first major cases

00:24:19.167 --> 00:24:20.550
that I covered.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.270
And, you know, ended up
with a four to four to one,

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:25.470
the one in those days was the swing voter

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.000
on the court in those
days, Justice Powell.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.250
And that continues to be something

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:36.250
that the court hasn't
come to a real consensus

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:40.980
of the most recent
affirmative action case,

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.707
the case is from the
University of Michigan,

00:24:43.707 --> 00:24:47.900
from about five years ago,
was sort of the last word,

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.470
and bought the court and
bought society some time.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:53.797
But, that's been a real pressure point.

00:24:53.797 --> 00:24:54.820
And so, when I say

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.590
the court is most comfortable

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.590
following the existing consensus,

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:02.450
and when it feels that
it's getting out in front,

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.739
gets, there's a kind of
an institutional tension.

00:25:05.739 --> 00:25:06.860
I think what I had

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.270
in mind was the affirmative
action line of cases.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:14.030
On abortion, I mean, what's so
interesting when you get back

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:17.850
in the actual papers that lead to,

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:20.370
that informed the courts consideration

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:24.100
of Roe against Wade in 1971, 72, 73,

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.900
January of 73, the
opinion finally comes out,

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.510
is the court was fairly clueless

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.893
about how that opinion was gonna fly.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:39.860
The court didn't really
feel itself out in front.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.320
In fact, I think the seven justices

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.870
who signed the majority opinion felt

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:50.640
that they were ratifying
what had come to be the,

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.940
at least the elite
consensus in the country.

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.810
And, they were right,
there was Gallup polls

00:25:56.810 --> 00:26:00.050
that backed this up, that people had come

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:02.980
to think that the regime
of criminal abortion laws,

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.380
and throwing doctors in jail

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.640
for performing abortions was,

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:09.468
had actually created a
public health crisis.

00:26:09.468 --> 00:26:12.040
Because women were
having abortions anyway,

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.253
as they always were, and always would,

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:16.940
but they weren't safe.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.750
And so, it was an effort

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:23.750
to kind of just bring that whole
area into the 20th century.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.240
- You talk a great deal about that case

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.073
in the Blackmun book,

00:26:30.073 --> 00:26:32.130
'cause of course he wrote the opinion.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:34.690
And let's talk a little about that,

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:38.770
because it actually conveys a sense

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:43.770
of the way personality comes
to play, the background

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:48.890
of a particular judge, the
fortuna of getting chosen

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.370
to write the opinion, and so on.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:56.230
And, Blackmun had an
interesting background,

00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:01.230
because he was appointed
by President Nixon

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:04.480
after President Nixon had failed

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.639
in getting two appointments,

00:27:06.639 --> 00:27:09.188
Haynsworth and Carswell,

00:27:09.188 --> 00:27:11.400
through the senate,

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.490
and then he turned to Blackmun,

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:18.873
who was a lifelong
friend of Justice Burger.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.110
- Chief Justice Warren Burger, right,

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:23.700
they had grown up together

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.670
in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.500
- So the expectation would be

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:31.426
that Blackmun would tilt
toward the conservative side,

00:27:31.426 --> 00:27:34.350
not based on his legal background,

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.140
but just the politics.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.830
- Well, based on his
legal background, too.

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:42.853
I mean, when the Nixon
administration was considering him,

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:44.613
a young lawyer

00:27:44.613 --> 00:27:46.760
in the Justice Department
named William Rehnquist

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.720
was given the assignment

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.720
of checking out Harry Blackmun's record

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.560
on the Eighth Circuit, the
Federal Court of Appeals

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.612
that was based in, that
is based in Saint Louis,

00:27:55.612 --> 00:27:59.650
to make sure he was
conservative enough, and he was.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:02.955
I mean, there was very
little in his record

00:28:02.955 --> 00:28:05.420
as an appeals court
judge that would indicate

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.550
that he was gonna end up 24 years later

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:10.140
as the most liberal member
of the Supreme Court.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.040
And, when he started out on the court,

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.720
he was quite conservative.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.730
I mean, the first big
constitutional controversy

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:22.300
that he confronted in his
time at the Supreme Court,

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.050
it was not abortion, it
was the death penalty.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:30.050
And, in 1972, when the
court, in the Furman case,

00:28:30.732 --> 00:28:34.120
held unconstitutional
every death penalty statute

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.650
in the country, Blackmun dissented.

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:40.002
And, a couple years later,
in the Pentagon Papers case,

00:28:40.002 --> 00:28:41.530
when the court held

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.710
that the government did not have the right

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.330
to block the publication
of the Pentagon Papers

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.370
by the New York Times
and the Washington Post,

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:49.760
Blackmun dissented.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:54.193
So, he was a quite conservative
justice when he started out.

00:28:55.637 --> 00:28:58.029
- But, there's some, and
I should say, not but,

00:28:58.029 --> 00:29:03.029
there was some fascinating
items in his background

00:29:03.467 --> 00:29:08.467
which really stand out in your
wonderful judicial biography,

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:10.743
I guess you would say.

00:29:10.743 --> 00:29:15.090
And that is that for 10
years after graduating

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:16.160
from the Harvard Law School,

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.400
he was chief counsel for the Mayo Clinic,

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.050
which kind of exposed him

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:25.290
to the world of medicine
and legal problems

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:26.420
that arise thereof.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.480
- Well, he loved medicine.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.339
He had considered going to medical school.

00:29:29.339 --> 00:29:31.180
And the only reason, actually,

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:34.114
he chose law school
over medical school was,

00:29:34.114 --> 00:29:37.650
it was cheaper and it had
fewer requirements to get in.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:40.220
So, he was really drawn to medicine.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.360
He practiced with a big
law firm in Minneapolis

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.580
that had as a client the Mayo Clinic.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.210
And he actually did a lot of tax work

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:48.070
for the Mayo Clinic.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:51.270
And so, then he, the
Mayo Clinic asked him,

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:53.410
was setting up an in-house position

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.220
as general counsel, and
they offered him the job.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.800
And he decided to leave private practice,

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.310
and go work full-time at Mayo.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:04.900
And, you know, his job wasn't,
obviously wasn't medical,

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.870
though, sort of, malpractice

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:07.873
and medical issues came up.

00:30:07.873 --> 00:30:11.530
But, he would go on the grand
rounds with the Mayo doctors,

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:16.110
you know, as they went around,
you know, with the patients.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:19.240
And he loved it and
found it very fascinating

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.900
and fulfilling.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.730
- And, what is fascinating in this story,

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:30.730
as it unfolds, is when
the case was decided,

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:37.790
the justices, or at least
Blackmun was focused

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:43.370
on the liability of doctors
who performed abortions.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.000
There was a great concern

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.347
that the whole malpractice issue,

00:30:48.347 --> 00:30:50.638
and I guess even criminal statutes

00:30:50.638 --> 00:30:53.860
that some states had against abortion,

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:57.200
was a real threat to the
practice of medicine.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.412
And then, in addition, if
the court didn't decide,

00:31:00.412 --> 00:31:05.412
then judges were lacking guidance on how

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.910
to respond to such cases.

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.870
The bottom line being
that you're suggesting

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:15.490
that the concern about
women, and their situation,

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:19.200
was kind of a third-order
priority in making that decision.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.990
Is that a fair reading
of what you're writing?

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:23.730
- Well, yeah, and I
think it's the only way

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.590
to read what actually occurred.

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.434
I mean, this isn't just
my thought about it.

00:31:28.434 --> 00:31:32.030
There's a lot of anachronistic thinking

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:34.170
about Roe against Wade.

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:38.510
Roe against Wade preceded
the modern women's movement.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:41.760
And at the time it made its
way to the Supreme Court,

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.827
in the beginning of the 1970s,

00:31:43.827 --> 00:31:47.750
the court didn't have, kind of,

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:50.870
sex discrimination or
women's rights, in mind.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:51.920
It really didn't.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:55.227
And, Roe presents, and if people read it,

00:31:55.227 --> 00:31:56.970
and of course most people are happy

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:58.580
to talk about it without
ever having read it,

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:00.850
but if people actually
sit down and read it,

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:03.600
they will find in it a
doctor's bill of rights,

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.410
not a women's bill of rights.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:06.930
And, of course, doctors were the ones

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:09.030
who were being criminally prosecuted.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:11.420
Women weren't being prosecuted
for having abortions.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.850
The crime was to perform an abortion.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.850
So, it was doctors who were on the line,

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:19.030
and there had been a
number of cases, you know,

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.150
there had been a German measles epidemic,

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:24.520
and doctors wanted to perform

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.960
for their patients what were then known

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.600
as therapeutic abortions,

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:31.360
because these fetuses would
be predictably badly damaged

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.490
by the German measles.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:35.303
There had been the thalidomide episode,

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.130
where a woman famously left the country

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:41.170
and went to Scandinavia
to have an abortion.

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:44.410
And so, change was in the wind,

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:48.360
and the leading medical organizations,

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.400
like the American Medical Association,

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.460
the American Public Health
Association, and so on,

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.140
that had, for decades,

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.220
had a position against
legalizing abortion,

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:59.830
had very recently changed their position.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.190
And so, the courts consideration

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:05.430
of this issue was reflecting those trends

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:09.090
and those observations, and
what they had in mind was,

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:11.130
we've got a public health issue,

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:15.180
and we're treating it as
resolving a public health problem.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:18.920
- And so, what your saying is, in a way,

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.064
that they're focus was such

00:33:21.064 --> 00:33:24.360
that they didn't realize
that they were moving ahead

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:29.270
of society in the way that
ultimately became the case,

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.900
in terms of the almost immediate reaction.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.000
And you tell the story

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.910
that Blackmun has a speaking engagement

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:38.370
after he delivers the majority opinion,

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:39.380
and there were pickets,

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.180
and he, opposing the decision,

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.030
and he was taken aback because he didn't,

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:49.910
he didn't understand the politics yet.

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:51.723
- Right, well, you know,

00:33:51.723 --> 00:33:54.044
when you say the court was
moving ahead of society,

00:33:54.044 --> 00:33:56.793
I actually don't think so.

00:33:56.793 --> 00:34:00.640
I think the court was pretty
much where society was.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.880
What happened was, it became a wedge issue

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.600
in the hands of a political movement

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.529
that was happy to hitch its
wagon to that particular star.

00:34:10.529 --> 00:34:12.417
And that's what happened,

00:34:12.417 --> 00:34:14.740
and it got away from the court.

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:17.193
But, at the time the court ruled,

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:20.330
there were, you know, polling,

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:23.410
and it was clear that there
was a public consensus

00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:25.530
that the question of abortion was

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.230
between a woman and her
doctor, and not for the state.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:34.610
- And, in the decision,
there was an opening

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:39.610
for the notion that at some
point a state interest came

00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.946
into play, when you
considered the whole term

00:34:44.946 --> 00:34:47.920
of the pregnancy.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.920
So, but, the decision itself was based

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:56.360
on the penumbra of privacy

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.610
that they found in the ninth amendment.

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:02.840
- Well, yeah, in part, in
the fourteenth amendment,

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.153
and so on.

00:35:04.153 --> 00:35:07.610
But, yeah, I mean you're talking
about the trimester system,

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.314
where the court said, and, you know,

00:35:10.314 --> 00:35:12.540
lots of people have criticized, kind of,

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:15.530
the trimester aspect of Roe.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.900
But when you think about it, you know,

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.060
it's not a foolish concept

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:23.410
to say that it's a balancing

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:25.892
of the state's interests
and the woman's interests,

00:35:25.892 --> 00:35:30.892
and once a fetus is viable,
in the third trimester,

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:37.273
the state's interest in
the life-preserving aspect

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.410
becomes a good deal stronger
than at the very beginning.

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:43.312
I mean, we could debate
the kind of philosophy

00:35:43.312 --> 00:35:44.700
of this, but certainly

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:49.700
what the court had in mind was
that in the first trimester,

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.520
when abortion is notably safer

00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.238
than carrying a child to term,

00:35:55.238 --> 00:35:57.624
the state really has no interest

00:35:57.624 --> 00:35:59.450
in preventing abortion.

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:02.075
And it's only interest is making
sure that it's done under,

00:36:02.075 --> 00:36:05.950
you know, safe, medically
appropriate conditions.

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:10.430
In the second trimester, the
state's interest grows a bit,

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:14.260
because abortion becomes
more dangerous medically.

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.740
And, finally, in the last trimester,

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.200
the state's interest is pretty strong.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.050
But, still cannot trump
the interests of the woman

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:23.089
in preserving her own life and health.

00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:26.363
And that's still our law today.

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:29.916
- And, after the decision,

00:36:29.916 --> 00:36:32.290
the political movement,

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:35.250
the anti-abortion political movement,

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:38.340
created a political context

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:42.800
where various states began taking,

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.010
I think you call it guerrilla action,

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:50.010
against the opinion by
looking at the various ways

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:55.193
in which the abortion could
be obstructed or prevented.

00:36:58.770 --> 00:36:59.990
Talk a little about that,

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:02.770
because it's a classic case

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:06.800
where the Supreme Court
reaches a decision,

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.550
you're saying it really
reflected the views

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:13.652
of society, but then the
turbulence came, as you say,

00:37:13.652 --> 00:37:17.850
when a political movement emerged
to take advantage of this.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:19.510
- Yeah well, I mean it's
still going on today.

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:21.300
It's going on this very day.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.160
So, what you had were states,

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:27.700
I mean, Missouri was a major
one, Pennsylvania, Ohio,

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:31.985
Illinois, where they
couldn't prohibit abortion.

00:37:31.985 --> 00:37:34.370
But, they could create obstacles

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.590
and make women and their doctors jump

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:37.860
through a set of hoops.

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:41.080
And so cases came up about, well,

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.750
do you need your husband's consent?

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:46.320
The court said, no, you can't
require the husband's consent.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.160
Well, how about the husband's notice?

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.500
The husband has to be on notice.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.150
No, you can't require that either.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:55.210
Well, doctors have to read
women a certain script

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:57.500
to make them think again, or think harder,

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.510
or go home, or whatever.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.170
And initially the court
said, no you can't do that.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:04.140
Then the court, a more conservative court,

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.640
said yes, you can do that to some extent.

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:09.187
There's a case making its
way to the court right now,

00:38:09.187 --> 00:38:11.450
from the Eighth Circuit from South Dakota,

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:16.450
where doctors are required to
read a truly offensive script

00:38:16.912 --> 00:38:20.050
before going ahead with the abortion.

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:22.250
And it's being challenged
as an infringement

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.170
on the first amendment rights of doctors,

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:26.460
compelled government speech.

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.030
So, these things are still going on,

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:32.763
and they have generated dozens of cases,

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.600
whether this obstacle or
that obstacle presented,

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.060
in the courts analysis,

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:42.433
a quote, "undue burden" on
the woman's right to abortion.

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:48.637
- Are you surprised by the litmus test

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:53.040
that abortion has become in the politics

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:58.620
of appointments to the Supreme Court?

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.795
Are there other cases of
a narrow focus like this

00:39:02.795 --> 00:39:05.330
in the history of the court?

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.170
- Well, I think there are in the sense

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:11.440
that you certainly
couldn't nominate somebody

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.900
to the Supreme Court that, for instance,

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:14.450
thought Brown against
The Board of Education

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:16.160
was a bad decision.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.870
And, there was a time when, you know,

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:23.563
that was, people had to be
pretty clear about that.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:28.000
I think what's different about abortion is

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
that society, or at least,
kind of, civilized society,

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.790
pretty quickly settled
on Brown against Board

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:38.480
as a correct decision.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.580
But, yet, there's obviously, as we know,

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:43.000
still a number of people
that think Roe against Wade

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.630
was the opposite of a correct decision.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:47.672
So, it's still, it remains a battleground.

00:39:47.672 --> 00:39:51.730
So, you know, I guess it's not surprising.

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:53.900
What I think is, um--
- Bizarre?

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:57.440
- Well, kinda self-defeating,

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.510
for the Republican party to have this

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:02.760
as a one-dimensional litmus test,

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:07.300
it disables them from considering a lot

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.600
of highly qualified
conservative lawyers and judges

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:17.470
who are not necessarily
anti-abortion movement activists.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:19.660
I mean, that's what
brought us Harriet Miers.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.660
You know, in 2005, when
President Bush felt,

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:28.610
correctly I think, that after
Sandra O'Connor's announcement

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:29.960
that she was going to retire,

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.500
it was important to have
another woman on the court.

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.940
But, there were very few women

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:38.160
who could pass the
anti-abortion litmus test,

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.790
even though there were a number

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:44.790
of superbly qualified
Republican, female judges

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.080
and lawyers in the country,

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.350
they were passed over immediately.

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:51.810
And the administration basically ran out

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:53.040
of potential nominees.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.700
So, I think that's
self-defeating for them,

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.931
but I'm not one of them, so, you know.

00:40:57.931 --> 00:41:00.563
- In your book on Blackmun,

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:06.188
you record, through a careful
examination of his papers,

00:41:06.188 --> 00:41:09.500
his intellectual growth on certain issues,

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:14.500
how he came to see the
broader context of problems.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.434
And an example here would
be the whole question

00:41:18.434 --> 00:41:22.887
of women's rights, which
he didn't perceive,

00:41:22.887 --> 00:41:26.310
even though he discussed
the decision beforehand

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:28.470
with his three daughters and his wife,

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:32.577
but he didn't, sort of,
understand the broader context

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:35.103
of women's rights.

00:41:35.103 --> 00:41:37.810
But he grew, and that changed.

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:42.810
Do you think that his story tells us a lot

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:48.130
about the way many justices
on the Supreme Court grow

00:41:52.233 --> 00:41:53.066
on the court?

00:41:53.066 --> 00:41:54.820
Not all, but many.

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:55.653
- Well, that's a good question.

00:41:55.653 --> 00:41:57.270
And, of course, these are loaded words,

00:41:57.270 --> 00:42:01.380
because you and I can say
grow with, kind of, approval.

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.140
Now, on the other side, you know,

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.550
that's viewed as a kind
of a liberal, you know,

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:08.250
kind of throw away.

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:12.660
But, it is true that once somebody gets

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:17.660
to the Supreme Court, no
matter where they come from,

00:42:17.707 --> 00:42:22.430
they've got to take a
broader look at things.

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:25.140
And things look different up there.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.900
Now, there's been a fair amount

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:30.170
of recent social science research on this.

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:35.170
On justices who changed from
their starting ideology.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.982
And what the current research has shown,

00:42:37.982 --> 00:42:40.300
and Blackmun is a paradigm case,

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:44.430
is that justices who come
from outside of Washington,

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:49.110
from beyond the beltway,
without prior experience working

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:52.960
for the executive branch, are
the most likely to change,

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:56.274
to move to the left, to define our terms.

00:42:56.274 --> 00:42:59.040
And those who come from inside Washington,

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.580
or have prior federal
government experience

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.700
are least likely to change.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.730
And, you know, when you think
about it, it makes sense.

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:09.130
Because a move to Washington in mid-life,

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:12.620
Blackmun was 60 or 61
when he came on the court,

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:15.070
had never, didn't have
any Washington experience.

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:19.270
You know, it's very disruptive,

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:22.810
and mind-bending, and mind-opening.

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:26.310
So, it's not surprising that this happens,

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:27.990
and this happened to a lot more people

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:29.240
than just Harry Blackmun.

00:43:30.231 --> 00:43:34.050
- Do you think that it's better, well,

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:38.730
let me get your evaluation of the category

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:41.410
of appointees to the court.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:46.410
Do you think, how do you
evaluate putting lawyers

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.050
who also have been in politics

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:55.050
at the state level, or
even at the national level,

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:58.080
as opposed to coming to the court

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.010
from a circuit court?

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:03.860
- Well, personally I think
it would be a very good thing

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:05.610
to, sort of, mix it up a little,

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:07.670
and have some politicians on the court.

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:11.970
The court we have now,
every single justice had,

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:14.500
as their immediate past job, service

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:16.000
on a federal court of appeals.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.680
That's unique in the country's history,

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.200
that hadn't happened before.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.380
The Warren court, I believe
I'm right in saying,

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:24.450
not only was it headed by Earl Warren,

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:26.260
who had never been a judge of any kind,

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.170
three-time governor of California,

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:29.470
but, I think there was nobody

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.830
on the Warren court who
had been a federal judge.

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:34.190
Justice Brennan had been a
state judge in New Jersey.

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:35.720
No one had been a federal judge.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:38.781
And so, you know, that court
had a sort of a grounding

00:44:38.781 --> 00:44:41.502
in the political life of the country

00:44:41.502 --> 00:44:44.067
that came from that background.

00:44:44.067 --> 00:44:46.401
Or if people look at Justice O'Connor,

00:44:46.401 --> 00:44:49.010
who had been a state
court judge in Arizona,

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:50.530
but had also been majority leader

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:53.570
of the Arizona State Senate,
and had run for election.

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:55.600
And she was really a kind
of a political animal,

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:59.090
and she brought a sort of
a pragmatic, grounded sense

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:01.590
of what the country needed

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:04.820
to her 20 plus years on the court

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.260
that I think was very salutary.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.228
So, I would hope that the next president,

00:45:09.228 --> 00:45:10.732
whoever wins the election,

00:45:10.732 --> 00:45:13.240
would look outside the box,

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.685
and find somebody with
a different background.

00:45:15.685 --> 00:45:18.447
- Your on campus as
the Jefferson Lecturer,

00:45:18.447 --> 00:45:22.460
and I know you're gonna be
talking about the mystery

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:25.127
of Guantanamo, and that set of decisions.

00:45:25.127 --> 00:45:30.127
What is, one gets the sense as
I've read about these cases,

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:34.228
I've read your articles,
and one gets the sense

00:45:34.228 --> 00:45:37.960
that the Guantanamo decisions, let's call,

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.750
not just the last decision,

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:44.750
it's really about the
court drawing a line,

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:51.330
and trying to judiciously
inform the executive

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.350
that it didn't buy into
where it was drawing the line

00:45:58.350 --> 00:45:59.183
in the sand.

00:45:59.183 --> 00:46:00.830
Is that a fair assessment?

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:04.891
And, the decision seemed
to almost be saying,

00:46:04.891 --> 00:46:07.570
you didn't listen to our last decision.

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:09.170
Is that a correct reading?
- Yes,

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:10.910
I think that's an excellent, you know,

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:13.040
25 word or less summary of my, kind of,

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.876
long, complicated lecture,

00:46:14.876 --> 00:46:17.150
which I call The Mystery
of Guantanamo Bay.

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:19.700
And the mystery is, how can it be

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:21.220
that the Bush administration has

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:25.340
lost case after case after
case in the US Supreme Court,

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:28.500
but yet has never been
ordered by any judge

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.820
or any person or body in
a position of authority

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:35.430
to release, against its will,
a single Guantanamo detainee?

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:37.390
This is a mystery, how can this be?

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:38.890
And so, it really is the story

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:42.820
of the administration pushing
and pushing and pushing,

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:46.604
the court drawing first a gentle line,

00:46:46.604 --> 00:46:49.990
and then a less gentle
line, and then last June,

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:52.293
two months ago, in the
Boumediene decision,

00:46:52.293 --> 00:46:56.120
granting constitutional
rights to habeas corpus

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.239
to the detainees.

00:46:57.239 --> 00:46:59.659
You know, a firmer line, and it's like,

00:46:59.659 --> 00:47:02.470
what part of the rule of
law don't you understand?

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:05.350
It's been a kind of a one-way dialog,

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:10.060
and very unusual in our
history, and very fascinating.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:15.060
- Is it because of the,
two elements come to mind,

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:18.410
I'm gonna go to your lecture
so I'll know the answer later,

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:23.030
but is it about, one, the
fragility of the coalition

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:26.370
on the court, and also the uniqueness

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:29.109
of this experience that
we all went through

00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:32.472
at 9/11, namely that we were attacked

00:47:32.472 --> 00:47:36.124
on our homeland by an organization

00:47:36.124 --> 00:47:37.930
that isn't a state.

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:39.950
Is that involved?
- Well,

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:42.370
those are elements of the whole picture.

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:43.690
That's not what I focus on.

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:45.970
What I'm focusing on, really,

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:49.384
is the separation of powers element

00:47:49.384 --> 00:47:51.320
to the way this has played out.

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:53.070
And, you know, the court,

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:56.103
as we said earlier, the
court is basically a modest,

00:47:56.103 --> 00:47:59.150
and quite conservative institution.

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:02.180
So, when the first cases reach the court,

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.974
the court rules quite modestly.

00:48:03.974 --> 00:48:07.250
Not making a sweeping
constitutional pronouncement,

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:09.320
they just decide what they have to decide.

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:12.710
And what they basically decide
on the first round, in 2004,

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:17.640
is, you know, you bet
wrong when you decided

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:20.936
to put the detainees at Guantanamo,

00:48:20.936 --> 00:48:23.850
you bet that this would be
outside the jurisdiction

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:25.410
of the federal courts.

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:28.300
And, you know, it's
functionally the United States.

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.770
We exercise complete
power and control there,

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:33.580
it is within the statutory jurisdiction

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.220
of the federal courts
to entertain petitions

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:37.150
for habeas corpus.

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:38.810
That's all the court said.

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:40.550
One might think that was enough.

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:43.830
But the administration
basically ignored that,

00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:45.240
and kept right on going.

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.880
And so, that set in motion a dynamic

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:51.720
where the court, with increasing dismay,

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:56.600
alarm, and I think almost
a sense of disbelief,

00:48:56.600 --> 00:49:01.150
kept learning that it's message
was just not being received.

00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:04.240
And so, you know, finally the decision

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.957
that came down in June of this
year, the Boumediene case,

00:49:07.957 --> 00:49:10.670
you know, do we have to
hit you with a two by four?

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:12.710
We mean habeas corpus.

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:15.570
So, it's just been a
fascinating trajectory.

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:20.570
- And, to what extent does
the court, or do we know yet,

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:23.490
have a very different view

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:27.800
of the president's power
vis a vis treaties,

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:28.700
international treaties?

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.980
'Cause on the one hand,
in these Guantanamo cases,

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:34.658
it's saying that Article III applies,

00:49:34.658 --> 00:49:36.490
from the Geneva Conventions.

00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:40.140
But, on the other hand, in
this recent Mexican case,

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:42.410
I don't know if we can mix
these different things,

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:45.023
where they allowed the state of Texas

00:49:45.023 --> 00:49:48.180
to do what it's legal process had said,

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:49.730
and said, you know,

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:52.314
put aside the treaties that were involved.

00:49:52.314 --> 00:49:55.370
- Well, yeah, I mean, I
don't think those are--

00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:57.130
- They're not related, okay
- They're not really related.

00:49:57.130 --> 00:49:59.250
I mean the case you're talking
about is the Medellin case,

00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:01.810
where the Mexican death row inmate had

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:03.880
not gotten read the rights

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.960
that are required under the
treaty that we've signed,

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.020
called the Vienna Convention.

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.610
What the court held there is

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:15.610
that the Vienna Convention
governs relationships

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:18.830
between the signatory,
among the signatory states,

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:22.760
the countries, and can't
be, is not self-executing

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.340
and it can't be invoked by an individual.

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:26.853
So, that was a kind of a
technical reading of the treaty,

00:50:26.853 --> 00:50:30.260
a different kind of
international law thing.

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:33.300
- But, then, but what
about the application

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:34.660
of the Geneva Conventions?

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:35.790
I mean, is this a,

00:50:38.698 --> 00:50:40.290
well, it's probably a court

00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:42.900
that wants to find the narrowest grounds

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.350
to make the dec--
- Well, that's right.

00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:47.157
Yeah, I mean the court
basically is deferential

00:50:47.157 --> 00:50:50.367
and wants the political
branches to figure this out.

00:50:50.367 --> 00:50:52.310
And so, what the court said in the middle

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:55.580
of these three cases,
the Hamdan case in 2006,

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:58.050
which was the case about the legitimacy

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:01.375
of the military commissions
that the President had set up

00:51:01.375 --> 00:51:05.190
to conduct the criminal
trials of the detainees is,

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:07.610
you've gotta set this
up within the framework

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:08.840
of the Geneva Conventions,

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.940
and you've gotta get congressional input.

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:14.290
It can't be just a unilateral
executive decision.

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:17.420
And so, that then went back to Congress,

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:20.661
and Congress did, in the
Military Commissions Act of 2006,

00:51:20.661 --> 00:51:23.160
reconfigure the military commissions.

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.320
Now, what they also did was
strip the federal courts

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.740
of jurisdiction to hear
habeas corpus petitions.

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.480
And that's what lead to the next decision.

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.890
But, yeah, the court took, you know,

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.593
took account of the Geneva
Conventions in that case.

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.983
- As you leave the Times, what,

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:46.020
and this program is aired nationally,

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:49.720
what would you like the message

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:54.250
to an audience of not
necessarily, some lawyers

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:56.710
in the audience, but
not the legal community,

00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:59.290
what is the lesson you would like

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:01.560
to leave them with about
what you've learned

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.453
about the Supreme Court?

00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:08.270
Is there a simple way

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:13.270
of putting how we should
understand the court's role

00:52:13.515 --> 00:52:16.010
in the evolution of our democracy?

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:17.230
Big question.

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:18.520
- Well, what I ended up,

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:21.350
that retrospective piece
that you referred to earlier,

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:24.430
was with the sort of ironic observation

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:26.638
that, you know, we get
the court we deserve.

00:52:26.638 --> 00:52:29.450
And people say to me,
what do you mean by that?

00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:32.850
And I mean, you know,
the court requires us

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:35.890
to do the work of paying attention

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:39.603
to what it does, and, you know,

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:43.430
desiring it to reflect the
best that our system has

00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:48.430
to display, and I think
what I've come away with is

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:52.890
that, I mean, I respect the
court as an institution,

00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:55.360
maybe more than a mere journalist should,

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:59.252
but I do expect, you know, I
hope for the best from them.

00:52:59.252 --> 00:53:03.600
And, I think that it takes work

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.963
to follow what the court does.

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:11.500
It requires a lot of the
public to really stick with it.

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:12.940
I think good journalism

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:15.574
about the court can enable
the public to do that,

00:53:15.574 --> 00:53:18.890
to the extent that a lot of newspapers

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:20.450
and news organizations are cutting back

00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:22.400
on Supreme Court coverage.

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:25.560
I think that's a disturbing trend,

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:27.610
but I would say to people, you know,

00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:29.700
stick with it, 'cause
it's really important.

00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.700
And it's important that it be understood,

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:33.980
and that the court, and the presidents

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:36.310
who make the appointments
that make up the court,

00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:37.260
be held to account.

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:40.320
- I wanted to read you one quote

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.030
from you farewell article,

00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:44.370
because you've actually watched a lot

00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:47.823
of history during this period

00:53:47.823 --> 00:53:49.780
that you've been covering the court.

00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:51.910
And, you're talking about, here,

00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:56.370
about Sandra Day O'Connor
and Ruth Ginsburg,

00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:59.390
and I found this amusing,

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:01.220
but I want you to just,

00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:04.060
years later my daughter
bluntly reminded me

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.310
that today's young women have the luxury

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:08.687
of taking for granted the
pioneering accomplishments

00:54:08.687 --> 00:54:12.220
of Sandra Day O'Connor
or Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:14.330
When I observed that I was out of college

00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:17.440
before I ever met a
woman who was a lawyer,

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:21.060
your teenage daughter
regarded me with compassion,

00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:24.924
face it mom, you've led a sheltered life.

00:54:24.924 --> 00:54:29.924
Does that convey the
changes that you've watched,

00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:33.893
as you've watched this
important institution--

00:54:33.893 --> 00:54:36.300
- Well, in part, and I
guess what, you know,

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:39.040
was kind of amusing
about that is, you know,

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.590
I don't think I have led a sheltered life,

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:42.060
I've had a ringside seat at history.

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:44.380
So, you know, I feel very lucky

00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:47.090
to have not had a sheltered life.

00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:48.636
- And, one final question,

00:54:48.636 --> 00:54:51.250
what should we be watching for

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:53.623
as we go through the
presidential election?

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:57.670
Well, first the court, as you said,

00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:00.710
is not a topic of discussion.

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:03.800
But, as an informed observer,

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.490
what would you be concerned about,

00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:08.330
and what would you hope would happen?

00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:10.088
- There's a very good book out now,

00:55:10.088 --> 00:55:11.740
that I've recommended to people,

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:14.470
it's called The Next Justice,
it's by Christopher Eisgruber,

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:16.650
who's the provost of Princeton.

00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:17.810
He's a Supreme Court scholar,

00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:19.040
and former Supreme Court law clerk.

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.767
And, his point in this book,

00:55:20.767 --> 00:55:22.620
it's a book that looks

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:24.590
at the Supreme Court confirmation process,

00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:28.300
but he makes an obvious, but
very infrequently made point,

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:31.130
which is that before we get into a debate

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:33.840
about what kind of justice
we'd like on the Supreme Court,

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.399
when the next vacancy occurs,

00:55:35.399 --> 00:55:37.680
we need to come to some
common understanding

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.030
about what is the judicial function?

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:42.040
What do Supreme Court justices do?

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.770
What do we expect of the court?

00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:47.960
So, I would like to see
that kind of conversation,

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.750
and not just the sound
bites about, you know,

00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:52.357
I want justices who follow the law

00:55:52.357 --> 00:55:53.510
and not make the law.

00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:54.490
You know, what does this mean?

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:55.879
It's completely meaningless.

00:55:55.879 --> 00:55:58.750
But, really, you know,
understand what we ask

00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:00.660
of the court, and what the court does.

00:56:14.769 --> 00:56:15.800
