00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:01.416
&gt;&gt;Janice Lombardi: Right in here.

00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.366
This is wonderful.

00:00:02.876 --> 00:00:05.776
&gt;&gt;Counselor: So I'm going to be
talking with you today about ways

00:00:05.776 --> 00:00:07.836
that students can prepare for college.

00:00:07.996 --> 00:00:08.866
The application process, filling

00:00:08.896 --> 00:00:11.396
out financial aid paperwork,
and scholarships.

00:00:11.696 --> 00:00:12.396
&gt;&gt;Counselor: [Speaking Spanish].

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:19.046
&gt;&gt;Janice Lombardi: Over 80 percent

00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:21.666
of our students are first-time
college goers.

00:00:22.076 --> 00:00:24.186
And Early College gives them a lift up.

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:26.976
And not only does it change their lives,
but it changes their families' lives.

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:37.336
&gt;&gt;Janice Lombardi: An Early
College, by definition,

00:00:37.426 --> 00:00:40.736
serves underserved students,
first-time college goers.

00:00:41.696 --> 00:00:44.926
As a consequence, they
don't have experience

00:00:45.026 --> 00:00:48.796
in the study skills,
the academic background.

00:00:49.076 --> 00:00:52.716
&gt;&gt;Kenya: When you come from a family
that doesn't have school experience,

00:00:52.716 --> 00:00:55.546
like, for example, my dad, he
dropped out of fourth grade,

00:00:55.546 --> 00:00:59.866
my mom just got her GED, coming to
this school kind of helped me find

00:01:00.116 --> 00:01:05.276
that motivation to succeed.

00:01:05.276 --> 00:01:08.286
&gt;&gt;Travis Smith: The ideal situation
is that a student will graduate

00:01:08.376 --> 00:01:12.336
with their diploma as well
as their Associates degree.

00:01:12.636 --> 00:01:16.526
&gt;&gt;Georgette: With this school, you
have two years of college experience

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:19.566
on a full tuition, so you
don't have to pay the classes.

00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:23.166
As an incoming freshman, I
was not confident at all.

00:01:23.636 --> 00:01:26.386
Teachers always supported me, and
they said that I was very bright,

00:01:26.846 --> 00:01:28.646
and that I was going to blossom.

00:01:28.936 --> 00:01:31.656
&gt;&gt;Janice Lombardi: We take
each student and grow them

00:01:31.826 --> 00:01:33.976
into phenomenal college ready students.

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:38.956
And we do that through
a variety of strategies.

00:01:39.206 --> 00:01:45.386
We start with college classes
that are not intensely academic.

00:01:45.386 --> 00:01:47.306
&gt;&gt;Kenya: They give us,
basically, the easier classes.

00:01:47.646 --> 00:01:51.266
And then as we start going up, sophomore
year starts getting a little bit harder.

00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:52.726
&gt;&gt;Janice Lombardi: And
in the tenth grade year,

00:01:52.726 --> 00:01:55.676
they can take college
trig, college algebra.

00:01:55.746 --> 00:01:57.816
&gt;&gt;Kenya: So as you start going up,
the classes start getting harder,

00:01:57.856 --> 00:01:59.236
the work starts getting heavier.

00:01:59.726 --> 00:02:02.066
And it gets pretty tough at times.

00:02:02.906 --> 00:02:06.056
&gt;&gt;Sam Rodgers: So of course,
that means the radius is 7P.

00:02:06.556 --> 00:02:09.416
&gt;&gt;It's beneficial that they
can get high school credit

00:02:09.416 --> 00:02:10.966
and college credit as well.

00:02:11.456 --> 00:02:15.096
They get the same course,
and everything is expected

00:02:15.096 --> 00:02:16.996
of all students that are enrolled.

00:02:17.906 --> 00:02:21.056
&gt;&gt;Felonie: Taking the dual credit
classes, you have to be responsible

00:02:21.196 --> 00:02:23.306
and decide, "I'm going
to take this lesson home.

00:02:23.306 --> 00:02:24.636
I'm going to get in a study group."

00:02:24.876 --> 00:02:28.056
If you don't, well then
you fail, and it's on you.

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:31.986
&gt;&gt;Janice Lombardi: The supports that
we offer to our students are varied.

00:02:32.296 --> 00:02:34.466
We do offer counseling support.

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:39.026
One of the things that we see with
this scaffolded instruction is

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:41.566
that students become anxious.

00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:43.386
And so we have counselors

00:02:43.386 --> 00:02:47.036
who can identify their
strengths, what they want to do.

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:48.686
&gt;&gt;Miss Crawford: All right, so
go ahead, look at the choices

00:02:48.686 --> 00:02:49.826
that you have for next year.

00:02:49.826 --> 00:02:52.496
&gt;&gt;Juan: Miss Crawford is great.

00:02:52.626 --> 00:02:55.876
She always tries to make sure I
get the best schedule I can have.

00:02:56.076 --> 00:03:00.716
I'm trying to balance out my classes enough, so I can get to my goal,

00:03:00.716 --> 00:03:03.276
which is Associates degree,
or at least close to it.

00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:04.676
&gt;&gt;Miss Crawford: Put your
dual credit check there.

00:03:05.236 --> 00:03:07.086
You also have to take the
Economics and Government.

00:03:07.726 --> 00:03:09.036
Those two are needed to graduate.

00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:11.206
And then, of course, we'll
give you a Ace Period,

00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:12.296
which is time for you to study.

00:03:12.296 --> 00:03:18.106
&gt;&gt;Janice Lombardi: We have
dedicated Study Halls for students,

00:03:18.226 --> 00:03:21.386
because we know, given
their home circumstances,

00:03:21.446 --> 00:03:23.866
they may not have a place
to study, or a computer.

00:03:24.216 --> 00:03:26.816
&gt;&gt;Sigifredo: It's very useful to me,
'cause it helps me catch up on my work.

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:28.626
&gt;&gt;Xitlally: College classes
are sometimes hard,

00:03:28.806 --> 00:03:30.866
because they give us a lot of tests.

00:03:30.936 --> 00:03:34.296
So we have to study, study, study.

00:03:34.346 --> 00:03:35.096
&gt;&gt;Eduardo: We strongly believe

00:03:35.096 --> 00:03:38.986
that it has helped our daughter
amazingly getting her experience

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:40.006
in college.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:42.876
&gt;&gt;Janice Lombardi: Parents
are an essential ingredient

00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:44.786
in this whole Early College movement.

00:03:45.126 --> 00:03:46.976
We do treat them as equal partners here.

00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:48.446
&gt;&gt;How are you doing today?

00:03:48.606 --> 00:03:49.626
&gt;&gt;Good, how about you?

00:03:49.626 --> 00:03:49.926
&gt;&gt;Good, good.

00:03:50.336 --> 00:03:52.246
&gt;&gt;Parent: The high school
that has assisted us

00:03:52.286 --> 00:03:54.266
with applications for universities.

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:55.846
&gt;&gt;Counselor: Colleges will be looking
at the student's high school transcript.

00:03:56.516 --> 00:04:00.000
&gt;&gt;Counselor: [Speaking Spanish].

00:04:05.156 --> 00:04:09.806
&gt;&gt;Janice Lombardi: Our culture of high
expectations really means you can do it.

00:04:10.246 --> 00:04:11.006
&gt;&gt;Good to see you.

00:04:11.006 --> 00:04:15.196
&gt;&gt;"If you will join us, we'll
go down this pathway together.

00:04:15.686 --> 00:04:17.066
You will be successful."

00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:20.986
&gt;&gt;Kenya: It's helped me
mature throughout these years.

00:04:21.106 --> 00:04:25.476
I currently have 21 credits, and I'm
taking four college classes right now.

00:04:25.476 --> 00:04:28.946
So I should have my Associate's
degree in 2016.

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:32.696
&gt;&gt;Georgette: Having four younger
brothers that are aspiring

00:04:32.696 --> 00:04:37.286
to pursue higher education, I want
them to see that dreams do come true

00:04:37.286 --> 00:04:39.536
if you pursue it with your
heart and with passion.

00:04:39.536 --> 00:04:44.166
After graduation, I plan to
attend Baylor University,

00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:46.706
and then go on to UT
Southwestern Medical School.
