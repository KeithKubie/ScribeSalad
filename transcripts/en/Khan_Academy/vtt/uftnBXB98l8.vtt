00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:02.764
- [Voiceover] Chelsea asked 600 people

00:00:02.764 --> 00:00:04.770
at her school their favorite color

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.182
and graphed the results.

00:00:06.182 --> 00:00:08.746
Some colors are not on Chelsea's graph.

00:00:08.746 --> 00:00:10.545
How many people chose colors

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:13.334
other than those on Chelsea's graph?

00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:16.204
So, here's Chelsea's graph,
she made a bar graph,

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:18.347
and she listed some favorite colors,

00:00:18.347 --> 00:00:20.990
blue, green, red, yellow, pink,

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.650
and graphed people who
had those favorite colors.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.205
But, some of these 600 people, like me,

00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:28.093
had a different favorite color.

00:00:28.093 --> 00:00:30.255
My favorite color, orange,
isn't on the graph.

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:32.692
So, we're asked how many people like me

00:00:32.692 --> 00:00:34.250
were not graphed.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.827
How many people picked a
different color besides

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:39.345
blue, green, red, yellow, and pink?

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:41.076
So, the way we can figure this out

00:00:41.076 --> 00:00:43.444
is if we look at the graph
and find out how many

00:00:43.444 --> 00:00:46.361
of the 600 people are on the graph,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.039
then we can take that away
from the total 600 people

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.552
to find out how many are not on the graph.

00:00:54.552 --> 00:00:57.168
So, we'll start by looking at the graph.

00:00:57.168 --> 00:01:01.379
First one, blue, this bar lines up to 90.

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.546
So, 90 people picked blue.

00:01:04.753 --> 00:01:08.003
Plus, next one, green, lines up to 135,

00:01:09.594 --> 00:01:11.594
135 people picked green.

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:16.961
Moving over to red,
this bar lines up to 75,

00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:18.544
75 more picked red.

00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:22.385
Yellow and pink, the bars
are the same heights,

00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:25.452
that means the same amount of
people picked yellow and red,

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:28.761
and we can move over and
see that that was 120,

00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:32.844
so 120 picked yellow, and
another 120 picked red.

00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:38.335
So, if we combine all of these numbers,

00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:40.965
combine all of the people
that are on the graph,

00:01:40.965 --> 00:01:42.274
that will help us to figure out

00:01:42.274 --> 00:01:45.142
how many are not on the graph.

00:01:45.142 --> 00:01:47.082
So, let's start, let's
start with the ones.

00:01:47.082 --> 00:01:50.332
Zero ones, plus five ones is five ones,

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:55.201
plus five more ones is
10, plus zero is still 10,

00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:59.158
plus zero is still 10, so we have 10 ones,

00:01:59.158 --> 00:02:02.178
plus, let's look at our tens,

00:02:02.178 --> 00:02:05.261
nine tens plus three tens is 12 tens,

00:02:06.418 --> 00:02:09.335
12 tens plus seven tens is 19 tens,

00:02:11.293 --> 00:02:13.626
19 tens plus two is 21 tens,

00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:20.253
and two more tens 21 tens
plus two more tens is 23 tens,

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:23.840
so we have 230 tens, or 230,

00:02:25.432 --> 00:02:28.226
that zero because we're
talking about tens,

00:02:28.226 --> 00:02:30.976
plus, we can now do our hundreds,

00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:33.421
only a few of these had hundreds,

00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:34.836
we had one hundred,

00:02:34.836 --> 00:02:37.485
plus another one hundred is two hundreds,

00:02:37.485 --> 00:02:42.155
plus another is three
hundreds, so three hundreds,

00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:43.972
we have two zeros now because
we're talking about hundreds,

00:02:43.972 --> 00:02:45.222
three hundreds.

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:49.465
And, if we add all of these,

00:02:49.465 --> 00:02:51.465
10 plus 230, 230 is 240,

00:02:54.305 --> 00:02:55.722
and 240 plus 300,

00:02:57.547 --> 00:02:59.873
well, let's see, that will still be 40

00:02:59.873 --> 00:03:02.803
but 200 plus another 300 is 500.

00:03:02.803 --> 00:03:05.470
So, 540 people are on the graph,

00:03:07.193 --> 00:03:11.430
but we're asked how many
are not on the graph.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.368
So, up here, we see there are
600 total people were asked,

00:03:16.368 --> 00:03:17.785
600 total people,

00:03:19.343 --> 00:03:23.510
and we want to take away the
540 who were on the graph,

00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:28.252
and that will tell us how
many were not on the graph.

00:03:28.252 --> 00:03:30.740
If we take these people away,

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.887
everybody who's left is like me,

00:03:32.887 --> 00:03:35.823
who's favorite color is not on the graph.

00:03:35.823 --> 00:03:37.298
So, let's do that.

00:03:37.298 --> 00:03:40.966
If we started with 600
and we're subtracting 540,

00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:43.482
let's first subtract the 500.

00:03:43.482 --> 00:03:45.232
600 minus 500 is 100.

00:03:46.536 --> 00:03:49.392
But we still need to subtract the 40.

00:03:49.392 --> 00:03:53.924
100 is like 10 tens, minus
40 which is four tens,

00:03:53.924 --> 00:03:57.036
10 tens minus four tens is six tens,

00:03:57.036 --> 00:03:57.869
or 60.

00:04:00.002 --> 00:04:02.824
So, there were 60 people who chose colors

00:04:02.824 --> 00:04:04.758
other than those on Chelsea's graph.
