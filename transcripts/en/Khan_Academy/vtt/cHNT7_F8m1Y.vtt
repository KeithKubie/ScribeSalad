00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.182
- [Voiceover] Hi everyone.

00:00:01.182 --> 00:00:03.326
Here and in the next few videos
I'm gonna be talking about

00:00:03.326 --> 00:00:07.493
tangent planes of graphs,
and I'll specify this is

00:00:10.287 --> 00:00:12.338
tangent planes of graphs
and not of some other thing

00:00:12.338 --> 00:00:14.780
because in different context
of multivariable calculus you

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.728
might be taking a tangent plane
of say a parametric surface

00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:20.975
or something like that but here
I'm just focused on graphs.

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:24.586
In the single variable
world a common problem that

00:00:24.586 --> 00:00:26.673
people like to ask in calculus
is you have some sort of

00:00:26.673 --> 00:00:30.736
curve and you wanna find at a
given point what the tangent

00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:33.520
line to that curve is,
where the tangent line is.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.560
You’ll find the equation
for that tangent line

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.708
and this gives you various
information how to,

00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:40.305
let's say you wanted to approximate
the function around that

00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:42.940
point and it turns out to be
a nice simple approximation.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.649
In the multivariable world
it's actually pretty similar

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.547
in terms of geometric intuition
it's almost identical.

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:50.771
You have some kind of graph of a function,

00:00:50.771 --> 00:00:52.904
like the one that I have
here, and then instead of

00:00:52.904 --> 00:00:55.420
having a tangent line,
because the line is a very

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.687
one-dimensional thing and here
it's a very two-dimensional

00:00:57.687 --> 00:01:02.026
surface, instead you’ll have
some kind of tangent plane.

00:01:02.026 --> 00:01:04.554
This is something where it's
just gonna be barely kissing

00:01:04.554 --> 00:01:06.426
the graph in the same way
that the tangent line just

00:01:06.426 --> 00:01:10.042
barely kisses the function
graph in the one-dimensional

00:01:10.042 --> 00:01:12.592
circumstance, and it could be
at various different points

00:01:12.592 --> 00:01:14.256
rather than just being at that point.

00:01:14.256 --> 00:01:17.329
You could move it around and
say that it will just barely be

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.166
kissing the graph of this
function but at different points.

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.444
Usually the way that a problem
like this will be framed

00:01:23.444 --> 00:01:27.511
if you're trying to find such
a tangent plane is first,

00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:30.820
you think about the specified
input that you want.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.773
In the same way that over
in the single variable world

00:01:32.773 --> 00:01:36.397
what you might do is say,
"What is the input value here?"

00:01:36.397 --> 00:01:39.183
Maybe you'd name it like x
sub 0, and then you're gonna

00:01:39.183 --> 00:01:42.190
find the graph of the
function that corresponds to

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.732
just kissing the graph
at that input point.

00:01:44.732 --> 00:01:49.102
Over here in the multivariable
world, move things about,

00:01:49.102 --> 00:01:51.942
you'll choose some input
point like this little red dot

00:01:51.942 --> 00:01:54.035
and that could be at
various different spots,

00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:55.091
it doesn’t have to be where I put it,

00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:56.827
you could imagine putting
it somewhere else.

00:01:56.827 --> 00:02:00.232
Once you decide on what
input point you want,

00:02:00.232 --> 00:02:02.252
you see where that is on the graph,

00:02:02.252 --> 00:02:04.679
so we go and say, "That
input point corresponds to

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:06.570
such and such a height,"
so in this case it actually

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.409
looks like the graph is
about zero at that point

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.765
so the output of the
function would be zero.

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:13.188
What you want is the plane

00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:15.414
that's tangent right at that point.

00:02:15.414 --> 00:02:16.552
You’ll draw some kind of plane that's

00:02:16.552 --> 00:02:18.885
tangent right at that point.

00:02:19.817 --> 00:02:22.504
If we think about what this
inner point corresponds to

00:02:22.504 --> 00:02:24.655
it's not x sub 0, a single variable input

00:02:24.655 --> 00:02:26.842
like we have in the single variable world,

00:02:26.842 --> 00:02:29.339
but instead that red dot
that you're seeing is gonna

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:33.506
correspond to some kind of
input here, x sub 0, y sub 0.

00:02:35.414 --> 00:02:37.537
The ultimate goal over
here in our multivariable

00:02:37.537 --> 00:02:40.199
circumstance is gonna be to
find some kind of new function,

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.198
so I'll write it down here,
some kind of new function

00:02:43.198 --> 00:02:47.299
that I'll call L, for linear,
that's gonna take in x and y,

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.001
and we want the graph of that
function to be this plane,

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:53.112
and you might specify that this
is depended on the original

00:02:53.112 --> 00:02:55.500
function that you have and
maybe also specify that it's

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.454
depended on this input point
in some way, but the basic idea

00:02:58.454 --> 00:03:00.901
is we're gonna be looking
for a function whose graph

00:03:00.901 --> 00:03:03.554
is this plane tangent at a given point.

00:03:03.554 --> 00:03:05.552
In the next couple of videos
I'm gonna talk through

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:06.649
how you actually compute that.

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:08.789
It might seem a little intimidating
at first because how do

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:11.880
you control a plane in
three dimensions like this?

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.790
It's actually very similar
to the single variable

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.548
circumstance, and you just
take it one step at a time.

00:03:17.548 --> 00:03:19.381
See you in next video.
