00:00:00.438 --> 00:00:01.362
- [Narrator] When you look at

00:00:01.362 --> 00:00:02.405
the moon in the night sky,

00:00:02.405 --> 00:00:04.718
it might seem reasonably close.

00:00:04.718 --> 00:00:08.665
But it's actually incredibly far away.

00:00:08.665 --> 00:00:10.685
Right over here is a scaled picture

00:00:10.685 --> 00:00:12.136
of the distance between

00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:14.763
the earth and the moon.

00:00:14.763 --> 00:00:16.271
Earth has a diameter

00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:18.688
of approximately 8,000 miles.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.653
While the moon has a diameter

00:00:22.653 --> 00:00:25.070
of approximately 2,200 miles.

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.241
So, a little bit more

00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:30.663
than one fourth the diameter of earth.

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:33.057
Now the distance between the two

00:00:33.057 --> 00:00:34.474
is 239,000 miles.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.939
Which you can imagine is incredibly far.

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:44.189
Now one thing that is very interesting,

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:45.628
this is why the moon looks like

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:48.641
it's the same size as the sun in the sky,

00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:50.569
even though it is one four hundredth

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:52.150
of the diameter,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.916
is the ratio between

00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:55.069
the distance to the moon

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:56.915
and the diameter of the moon

00:00:56.915 --> 00:00:58.370
is roughly the same as

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.196
the ratio of the distance

00:01:00.196 --> 00:01:02.316
of the sun to the diameter of the sun.

00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:03.570
So, for the moon,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.492
that ratio, the distance to the moon,

00:01:05.492 --> 00:01:07.909
239,000 miles over the radius

00:01:11.132 --> 00:01:13.449
of the moon, 2,200.

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:14.662
It's approximately the same

00:01:14.662 --> 00:01:15.998
as the ratio between

00:01:15.998 --> 00:01:17.499
the distance from earth

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:18.979
to the sun which would be

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.729
93 million miles over

00:01:24.731 --> 00:01:26.898
865,000 miles in diameter.

00:01:29.954 --> 00:01:31.041
So this number is roughly

00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:33.068
400 times larger than that number.

00:01:33.068 --> 00:01:34.196
And this number is roughly

00:01:34.196 --> 00:01:36.117
400 times larger than that number.

00:01:36.117 --> 00:01:37.296
But what's neat is,

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:39.025
and this depends on where earth is

00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:39.960
in its orbit,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.380
but this is approximately equal to 108.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.514
This gives me goosebumps

00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:45.856
whenever I think about it

00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:49.021
because it didn't have to be this way.

00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:50.543
That the moon and the sun,

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:51.863
even though they have these vastly

00:01:51.863 --> 00:01:53.509
different diameters,

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.658
that they look roughly the same size

00:01:55.658 --> 00:01:57.850
in the sky because the ratio

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.834
of the distances is comparable

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:02.188
to the ratios of their diameters.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.421
And this is why the number 108

00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:05.029
is actually an auspicious number

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.927
in some cultures,

00:02:05.927 --> 00:02:07.519
especially in Hinduism.

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:08.437
Now, when you're discussing

00:02:08.437 --> 00:02:10.383
the moon and especially the moon

00:02:10.383 --> 00:02:11.656
as viewed from earth,

00:02:11.656 --> 00:02:12.931
one of the obvious questions

00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:16.304
is why does the moon go through phases?

00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:18.188
Why do we see different portions

00:02:18.188 --> 00:02:19.021
of the moon lit up

00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:20.354
from day to day?

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:23.328
This right over here is a diagram

00:02:23.328 --> 00:02:25.727
from NASA's website.

00:02:25.727 --> 00:02:27.019
And what you see here,

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.317
clearly this is not at scale.

00:02:28.317 --> 00:02:29.850
This picture over here,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.133
this inner picture,

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:32.197
the size of the moon

00:02:32.197 --> 00:02:33.960
and the earth is roughly at scale,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.080
but clearly the distances

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.338
between them are not.

00:02:36.338 --> 00:02:38.271
You don't see that 239,000 miles

00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:39.203
between them.

00:02:39.203 --> 00:02:40.362
In this inner circle,

00:02:40.362 --> 00:02:41.748
what you see is that the moon

00:02:41.748 --> 00:02:43.653
and the earth is always lit

00:02:43.653 --> 00:02:45.310
up from the right.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.146
So, it's assuming that the sun

00:02:46.146 --> 00:02:47.999
is 93 million miles

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.063
in that direction.

00:02:50.063 --> 00:02:51.299
And it is lighting up

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.057
both the earth and the moon

00:02:53.057 --> 00:02:54.954
from the right.

00:02:54.954 --> 00:02:58.371
Now, as the moon rotates around the earth

00:02:59.305 --> 00:03:01.196
in its 28 day cycle,

00:03:01.196 --> 00:03:02.946
and if you're wondering,

00:03:02.946 --> 00:03:04.403
gee a 28 day cycle

00:03:04.403 --> 00:03:06.941
seems awfully close to a month,

00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:08.474
that is not a coincidence.

00:03:08.474 --> 00:03:09.980
The notion of a month comes

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.812
from the cycles of the moon.

00:03:12.812 --> 00:03:13.645
In fact,

00:03:13.645 --> 00:03:14.916
even the word month

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:16.936
and the word moon

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:18.416
have the exact same root

00:03:18.416 --> 00:03:20.471
in old English.

00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:21.767
And in proto Germanic.

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:24.755
They are essentially the same word.

00:03:24.755 --> 00:03:26.253
But what you see is the moon goes

00:03:26.253 --> 00:03:28.439
in this 28 day cycle,

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.744
when the moon is roughly between

00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:32.857
the earth and the sun,

00:03:32.857 --> 00:03:34.577
the lit up half of the moon

00:03:34.577 --> 00:03:36.061
is away from what

00:03:36.061 --> 00:03:37.508
we can see here on earth.

00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:39.099
And so, we see the non lit up side

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.327
which would be a new moon.

00:03:41.327 --> 00:03:42.985
Now, as the moon goes,

00:03:42.985 --> 00:03:44.985
this is viewing from above the earth,

00:03:44.985 --> 00:03:46.923
this would be the North
Pole right over here,

00:03:46.923 --> 00:03:48.633
as it goes counter clockwise

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:50.278
as viewed from above the earth,

00:03:50.278 --> 00:03:52.058
we start to be able to see

00:03:52.058 --> 00:03:53.779
a little bit of that half of the moon

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:55.051
that gets lit up.

00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:56.202
So, when the moon is in this position,

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:58.064
we see, us from earth,

00:03:58.064 --> 00:03:59.360
from this vantage point,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.049
we're able to see a little bit

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.372
of the lit up side.

00:04:02.372 --> 00:04:03.708
When the moon is over here,

00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:05.342
we're able to see half

00:04:05.342 --> 00:04:06.419
the lit up side

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.189
and half the non lit up side.

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:09.849
And that's called a first quarter moon.

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.019
And that keeps on going.

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.402
When we're halfway through

00:04:12.402 --> 00:04:13.273
our cycle here,

00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:14.445
at a full moon,

00:04:14.445 --> 00:04:16.355
the earth is between the moon

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:19.337
and the sun and so from our vantage point,

00:04:19.337 --> 00:04:20.968
we are able to see

00:04:20.968 --> 00:04:22.885
the entire lit up side.

00:04:23.836 --> 00:04:25.931
And that's why it is a full moon.

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:27.035
And then we keep going

00:04:27.035 --> 00:04:28.670
all the way until we get back

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:29.837
to a new moon.

00:04:30.725 --> 00:04:33.291
Now, one question that
might be bothering you,

00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:35.386
it bothered me for many years,

00:04:35.386 --> 00:04:37.462
is as soon as I understood this,

00:04:37.462 --> 00:04:38.586
the cycle of the moon,

00:04:38.586 --> 00:04:40.524
how the moon has this 28 day cycle

00:04:40.524 --> 00:04:43.464
as earth rotates around the sun,

00:04:43.464 --> 00:04:45.881
I always wondered well the new moon,

00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:48.048
it looks like the moon is between

00:04:48.048 --> 00:04:50.374
the earth and the sun,

00:04:50.374 --> 00:04:52.550
why doesn't it block out the sun

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.473
every time we have a new moon?

00:04:54.473 --> 00:04:55.865
Why don't we have a solar eclipse

00:04:55.865 --> 00:04:57.032
every 28 days?

00:04:58.051 --> 00:04:58.884
Similarly,

00:04:58.884 --> 00:05:00.268
for the full moons,

00:05:00.268 --> 00:05:01.883
when we're in this position,

00:05:01.883 --> 00:05:03.111
it looks like the earth

00:05:03.111 --> 00:05:05.688
is between the moon and the sun.

00:05:05.688 --> 00:05:07.274
Why doesn't earth's shadow

00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:08.999
block out the sun

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:10.641
so that we have a lunar eclipse

00:05:10.641 --> 00:05:12.110
instead of a full moon

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.029
and we would have one of those

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:14.362
every 28 days?

00:05:14.362 --> 00:05:16.034
Why don't we see that?

00:05:16.034 --> 00:05:17.685
Think about it yourself.

00:05:17.685 --> 00:05:19.667
What's a plausible explanation?

00:05:19.667 --> 00:05:20.670
In the next video,

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.021
we'll actually talk about why eclipses,

00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:25.115
both solar eclipses when the moon

00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:26.569
blocks out the sun,

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:28.018
and lunar eclipses when

00:05:28.018 --> 00:05:29.497
the earth's shadow

00:05:29.497 --> 00:05:30.624
falls on the moon,

00:05:30.624 --> 00:05:33.760
why they're not happening every 28 days.
