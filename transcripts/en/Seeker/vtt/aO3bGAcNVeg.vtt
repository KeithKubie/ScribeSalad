Wine can be sophisticated, classy and robust
-- but in it's awkward teenage years it totally

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.819
has acne too.

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:09.430
[[MUSIC]]

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.219
Hey gang, Trace here for DNews -- Acne is
pretty gross.

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.640
It happens when a human pore gets clogged
and pus builds up inside that clogged pore.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.760
Considering we have literally millions of
pores on our skin it's rather amazing we don't

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.939
have zits more often!

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.460
They can be caused by excess skin lipids or
accidental rapid cell division.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.489
Normally, bacteria on the skin just hang out,
feeding on sebum we produce to lubricate our

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.489
hair shafts.

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.879
But when the follicle gets clogged more bacteria
show up and can cause inflammation.

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.649
The bacteria in question is called Propionibacterium
Acnes, and it's a completely normal thing

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.100
to have growing on human skin -- somewhere
it probably shouldn't be growing though, is

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.890
on the grapes from which we get the nectar
of the gods... wine.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.399
And yet... scientists in Italy have found
human acne bacteria on wine grapes.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.390
The kicker is, it's not actually the same
bacteria, it's an adaptation... basically

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.640
it evolved to live in a new place.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.750
Propionibacterium acnes type Zappae lives
in the bark and pith of the grape vine.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.619
It gets its name from Frank Zappa, because
the Italian scientists who discovered it were

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.260
listening to a Zappa album at the time.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.649
The scientists know P. acnes type Zappae is
related to the human version, because there

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.400
are gene markers in its DNA.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.980
They traced its genetic history to when they
were one species living on human skin, 7,000

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:32.980
years ago!

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.939
This aligns with the time humans were first
beginning to cultivate grape vines!

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.259
The discovery is INTERESTING because speaks
to microorganisms ability to adapt to new

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.869
environments and lifestyles to propagate themselves.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.530
It's NOTABLE because it is the first time
ever, when a HUMAN bacteria jumped to a plant.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.530
Chances are ancient peoples planted the grape
vines, and infected them with P. acnes.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.329
The scientists believe the type Zappae has
since infected every grape vine in existence,

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:00.329
thanks humans.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.329
Geez.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.149
Most importantly, this infection probably
happened 7,000 years ago when grapes were

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.789
first taken from the Middle East.

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.619
While yes, there is acne bacteria all up on
those grape vines, it's not a food safety

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.619
thing.

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:14.019
They've been there for as long as we've been
growing them.

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.360
They're friends!

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.599
In comparison, humans have had acne for more
than 10,000 years!

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.909
King Tut had acne treatments in his tomb!

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.069
It's not going to hurt the grapes, but more
study is planned to find out how a human infection

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.620
crossed over onto plants...

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.769
How do you feel about this?

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:30.769
