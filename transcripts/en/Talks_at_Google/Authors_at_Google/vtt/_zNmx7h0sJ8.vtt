00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:12.010
&gt;&gt;man: Well, welcome everyone to another great
AuthorsGoogle session. We have the amazing

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:20.670
honor and privilege to have here at Google
once again, Condoleezza Rice. You folks may

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.079
have been at her, the great talk that we had
a couple years ago when Secretary of State,

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.550
she was here with Foreign Secretary, David
Miliband, from the UK. And we had a great

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:39.550
session then. And we're here to talk this
time about her book. Obviously, she needs

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.030
very little introduction from me, but we really
would love to get in to her; have her talk

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.560
about her new book, which is really, really
fascinating in terms of her upbringing in

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:59.580
Alabama. We were talking before the show here
and before the session. I actually have a

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.890
fairly personal connection. It turns out we
have some to-do items after the fact here

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:13.150
because, if you've read any of the book, you'll
discover that Secretary Rice's maternal grandfather's

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.560
name was Albert Ray, was from Alabama, outside
of Birmingham. Turns out my maternal grandfather's

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.030
name was Edward Ray, also from outside of
Birmingham, Alabama and my mother was born

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.840
right outside of Birmingham. So, we're thinking
there's some connection--

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.840
&gt;&gt;Rice: Some connection there.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.920
&gt;&gt;man: So if I call her cousin in the middle
of the session--

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.920
[laughter]

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.580
you will, you will know why. So, I think what
we're gonna try to do is, through a Q&amp;A format,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.671
try to talk a little bit about the book and
what's going on, Stanford football--

00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:44.040
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yeah.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.490
&gt;&gt;man: those kinds of things.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.490
[laughter]

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.750
And then have some time for you all to ask
some questions, too. So, the first thing I

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.711
wanted to ask was, obviously in the book,
you talk a lot about your childhood in Birmingham

00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:05.130
and you described it as the most segregated
city in all of America in the 50s and 60s.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.250
So, can you share with us a little bit? I
know this is in the book, but can you share

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.480
with us a little bit about your experiences
with segregation and how that affected your

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.480
aspirations growing up?

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.650
&gt;&gt;Rice: Absolutely. Well, first of all, thanks
for having me here. It's great to be here

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.130
and I can only tell this story by saying first
of all that I was born in 1954, in Birmingham,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.110
Alabama. Now, before you start counting, that
makes me 55; 56 next month.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.110
[laughter]

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.980
And Birmingham in 1954 was really two very
separate societies. On the one hand, I grew

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.510
up in black middle-class Birmingham; a little
conclave in Birmingham called Titusville,

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.900
and we had, in our schools we had instrumental
band. I had piano lessons, ballet lessons.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.210
My parents, in many ways, were, as I have
said in the book, ordinary people. My mom

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.590
was a school teacher, an English teacher.
She actually taught, as one of her first students,

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.780
Willie Mays, and he said that she told him,
"Son, you're gonna be a ball player and if

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.900
you need to leave class a little bit early,
you go right ahead." So, he appreciates that.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.030
[laughter]

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.320
My mom also was a musician; quite elegant
lady who believed in the democracy of the

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.840
arts and so in her very tough neighborhood
high school, introduced operettas and fine

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.819
music. My dad was a high school guidance counselor,
Presbyterian minister; later on a University

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.550
administrator. His domain was sports. I was
supposed to be an all American linebacker

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.550
named "John"--

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.550
[laughter]

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.110
and he had bought John's football and much
to his surprise he had a daughter. But he

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.280
was a big and imposing man and very interested
in politics and history. But they were in

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.170
that way ordinary people, but they were also
extraordinary for the times in which they

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.870
lived and in Birmingham, it really was very
separate society. She couldn't go to a restaurant,

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.690
you couldn't go to a movie theatre. I did
not have a white classmate until we moved

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.920
to Denver when I was 12. It was completely
segregated. Most of the time because my little

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.500
enclave was one where the kids were very much
the center of attention and taken care of,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.470
segregation didn't intrude every day. You
lived in this little separate cocoon, but

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.560
occasionally, you had to meet the outside
world and I tell a couple of those stories.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.990
For instance, going to see Santa Claus when
I was five years old. And you know what the

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.400
drill is; you go to the department store,
you stand in line, Santa Claus puts you on

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.130
his knees, says "What do you want for Christmas?"
Well, my parents were watching this particular

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.720
Santa Claus take the little black kids and
stand them out here and take the little white

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.540
kids and put them on his knee. And my father,
I overheard my father say to my mother, "Angelina,

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.070
if he does that to Condoleezza, I'm gonna
pull all that stuff off of him and show him

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.210
to be the cracker that he is."

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.210
[laughter]

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.440
And, as you might imagine, little five year
old Condie goes ahead with a kind of trepidation.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.660
Ok, Santa Claus, Daddy, Santa Claus, Daddy.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.660
[laughter]

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.590
But Santa Claus must have felt my father's
size because he pulled me on his knee and

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.520
said, "Little girl, what would you like for
Christmas?" So, all's well that ends well,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.110
but it shows how racially charged Birmingham
could be and so that's the community I grew

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.110
up in.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.199
&gt;&gt;man: Right. Now, so, despite the segregation
and discrimination, you've also said in the

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:31.199
book that this community was a place where
you had them convinced that you could be President

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.199
of the United States.

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.700
&gt;&gt;Rice: Absolutely. You couldn't have a hamburger
at Woolworth's lunch counter, but you could

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.540
be President of the United States if you wanted
to be. And it wasn't just me, it was really

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.729
the entire community where teachers were the
most important people in the community, where

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.680
principal's of schools were giants in the
community. One of the principals there was

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.229
a man named R. C. Johnson, who was the principal
of Parker High School, the largest black school

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:05.110
in Birmingham. He was the father of Alma Johnson
Powell, who is Colin Powell's wife. And this

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:12.789
community told you there are no victims. There
are no excuses. You are gonna have to be twice

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:17.900
as good and it was, by the way, not said as
a matter for debate, it was said as a fact.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:24.240
And I think that way, instilled in us this
sense that if we were educated, it was gonna

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.460
be transforming. It was armor against racism,
even if "they" meaning the white man--

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.460
&gt;&gt;man: Right.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.590
&gt;&gt;Rice: didn't like you, "they" would have
to respect you and that's how I grew up.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.831
&gt;&gt;man: And so you did lots of things besides
school. You did skating; you wanted to be

00:06:40.831 --> 00:06:41.831
a figure skater.

00:06:41.831 --> 00:06:44.480
&gt;&gt;Rice: Oh. I wanted to be a figure skater.
Yes, piano lessons.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.020
&gt;&gt;man: Piano lessons and you still perform,
I understand--not as much.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.419
&gt;&gt;Rice: Well, piano is actually an interesting
story because I studied piano from age three.

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.949
My grandmother taught piano lessons. I took
piano lessons with her. I was gonna be a great

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:01.580
concert pianist. I went off to college; majored
in music for two years and then went to the

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.470
Aspen Music Festival School where I met 12
year olds who could play from sight, everything

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.390
that had taken me all year to learn. I thought,
"I'm about to end up teaching 13 years olds

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.330
to murder Beethoven for a living, or maybe
I'm gonna play at Nordstrom, but I'm not gonna

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.350
play Carnegie Hall."

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.150
[laughter]

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:22.330
I went back and I had one of those uncomfortable
conversations with my parents, you know, "Mom

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.509
and Dad, I'm changing my major." "What are
you changing your major to, dear?" "I don't

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:29.900
know." "What do want to do with your life?"
"Well, after all, it's my life." "Well, after

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.590
all, it's our money. Find a major."

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:33.590
[laughter]

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:39.910
And, fortunately for me, I wandered into a
course in International Politics, taught by

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:45.350
a Soviet specialist and his name was Joseph
Korbel. He was Madeleine Albright's father.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:51.060
And Joseph Korbel opened up this incredible
world to me of things international, things

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.330
Russian, and I knew what I wanted to do. I
wanted to be a Soviet specialist and luckily

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.611
for me, when I went home and said, "Gee, Mom
and Dad. I found it. I wanna be a Soviet specialist."

00:07:59.611 --> 00:08:00.611
[man laughs]

00:08:00.611 --> 00:08:03.610
They didn't say what's a nice, black girl
from Birmingham, Alabama--

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:04.610
[laughter]

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:08.259
talking about being a Soviet specialist? They
said, "Go for it," and that's how I got into

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:09.259
the field.

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:13.979
&gt;&gt;man: Right. But yet, you're memoir at least,
so, hopefully this means there's perhaps a

00:08:13.979 --> 00:08:14.979
part two? Because your--

00:08:14.979 --> 00:08:15.979
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yes.

00:08:15.979 --> 00:08:18.530
&gt;&gt;man: your memoir is focused on your childhood
and your upbringing--

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.530
&gt;&gt;Rice: That's right. That's right.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.870
&gt;&gt;man: so, can we expect a part two about
your career and--

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:26.444
&gt;&gt;Rice: Well, yes, as I was leaving government
I had to decide what I was gonna write and

00:08:26.444 --> 00:08:30.180
I will, everybody writes the obligatory Secretary
of State's eight year memoir--

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.180
&gt;&gt;man: Right.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.719
&gt;&gt;Rice: and I will write that memoir--

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:33.719
[man laughs]

00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:38.599
and, in fact, writing it now. But, I'm very
often asked how did you become who you are?

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:39.599
&gt;&gt;man: Yeah.

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:44.899
&gt;&gt;Rice: And I felt that people had to know
John and Angelina Rice in order to answer

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:51.699
that question. And I wanted to do this as
a book that shows how important good parents

00:08:51.699 --> 00:08:58.110
are, how important good community is, how
important focus on education and values can

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:05.619
be and how even in the extraordinary circumstances
of segregated Birmingham, this little community

00:09:05.619 --> 00:09:07.649
raised extraordinary kids.

00:09:07.649 --> 00:09:08.649
&gt;&gt;man: Mm-hmm.

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:13.970
&gt;&gt;Rice: I'm not, by the way, even the first
PhD in my family. My grandfather managed to

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:19.810
get a college education. My aunt, my father's
sister, was a professor of Victorian literature

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.420
of all things. She wrote books on Dickens.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.420
[man laughs]

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:29.309
And the in my community, the first black woman
governor of the International Monetary Fund,

00:09:29.309 --> 00:09:33.379
the man who is currently the President of
the University of Maryland, Baltimore, the

00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:38.329
man who is currently President of the University
in Missouri, Kansas City, two Pulitzer Prize

00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:43.399
winners, but that little community, thanks
to the way that this community dealt with

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:45.430
its kids; very accomplished.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:51.980
&gt;&gt;man: Right. Well, I wanted to ask you a
couple of other questions about race. Sometimes,

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.420
we get a tendency to hear people talk about
an authentic black experience.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.529
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:57.529 --> 00:10:02.819
&gt;&gt;man: And oftentimes, sometimes it's equated
with what your political views happen to be.

00:10:02.819 --> 00:10:03.920
&gt;&gt;Rice: Right.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.829
&gt;&gt;man: And it's no mystery to most people
that you've had political views that are not

00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:17.470
necessarily the same as the vast majority
of, at least expressed, in the ballot box.

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:18.470
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yeah.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:23.389
&gt;&gt;man: The majority of other black Americans.
How do you, when someone says, "Well, she's

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:24.689
a Republican, so how can--

00:10:24.689 --> 00:10:25.689
&gt;&gt;Rice: Right.

00:10:25.689 --> 00:10:26.689
&gt;&gt;man: she's not really black."

00:10:26.689 --> 00:10:27.689
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yeah. Right.

00:10:27.689 --> 00:10:29.070
&gt;&gt;man: How do you deal with that?

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.070
[laughter]

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:34.019
&gt;&gt;Rice: Well, the first thing I tell people
is I don't need anybody to tell me how to

00:10:34.019 --> 00:10:35.019
be black.

00:10:35.019 --> 00:10:36.019
[laughter]

00:10:36.019 --> 00:10:40.139
I've been black all my life; I know how to
do that, right? And, in fact, the unfortunate

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:44.759
thing is that it doesn't just relate to being
a Republican. That's fine and I can explain

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:51.420
to you why I'm a Republican; came from foreign
policy initially and didn't care much for

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.680
Jimmy Carter's response to the invasion of
Afghanistan by boycotting the Olympics. I

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.279
thought surely the United States can do better
than that.

00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:58.279
&gt;&gt;man: Mm-hmm.

00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:05.119
&gt;&gt;Rice: And I voted for Ronald Reagan, but
my views are eclectic political views. I say

00:11:05.119 --> 00:11:10.629
in the book I favor affirmative action. I'm
also a fierce defender of the second Amendment.

00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:14.649
So, my views are all over the place as I think
most Americans view are--

00:11:14.649 --> 00:11:15.649
&gt;&gt;man: Right.

00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:21.389
&gt;&gt;Rice: and I think we get very much putting
people into little boxes, but it is also the

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:27.119
case, unfortunately, that this stuff about
authentically black, which I have no idea

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:32.720
what that's supposed to mean, has begun to
translate into, "Well, you're not authentically

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:38.079
black if you study hard," and "You're not
authentically black if maybe you major in

00:11:38.079 --> 00:11:42.089
engineering." That's shooting yourself in
the head.

00:11:42.089 --> 00:11:43.199
&gt;&gt;man: Right.

00:11:43.199 --> 00:11:49.699
&gt;&gt;Rice: To me, authentically black meant black
Birmingham was going to achieve at a level

00:11:49.699 --> 00:11:51.589
that white America couldn't ignore it.

00:11:51.589 --> 00:11:52.589
&gt;&gt;man: Mm-hmm.

00:11:52.589 --> 00:11:58.910
&gt;&gt;Rice: And I think that's the most authentically
black that I can possibly express.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:05.149
&gt;&gt;man: Absolutely. Well, one of the questions
in the book you talk about your view of the

00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:06.149
term "African American."

00:12:06.149 --> 00:12:07.149
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yeah.

00:12:07.149 --> 00:12:10.680
&gt;&gt;man: So, can you explain a little bit how
you see that term that's so frequently used?

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.959
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yes. I don't actually like this term,
"African American." I prefer black and I'll

00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:22.670
tell you why. I think that African American
mimics an immigration narrative that is actually

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:30.149
not the black narrative. Europeans and Africans
came to this country together; Africans in

00:12:30.149 --> 00:12:31.149
chains.

00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:32.149
&gt;&gt;man: Right.

00:12:32.149 --> 00:12:37.959
&gt;&gt;Rice: And we built this country together,
not because Africans came here by choice,

00:12:37.959 --> 00:12:45.619
but because Africans were forced to come here.
We also have all kinds of crazy, intertwined

00:12:45.619 --> 00:12:53.569
genes in the American gene pool and I fear,
I understand why it was done. It was meant

00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:59.309
to make a connection to Africa, but I fear
that it actually lets us off the hook for

00:12:59.309 --> 00:13:04.209
dealing with, first of all, the birth defect
of slavery and all of that mess. Secondly,

00:13:04.209 --> 00:13:09.220
dealing with the fact that the immigration
narrative, there is one black immigration

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.230
narrative; West Indians who came here, like
Colin Powell's parents.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.230
&gt;&gt;man: Right.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:19.850
&gt;&gt;Rice: But for the children of the Confederacy,
the children of Dixie, I like black and white.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.420
That's about as clear as it can get--

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.420
[man laughs]

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:28.540
that this was a country built by forced labor
of African slaves.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:32.540
&gt;&gt;man: Right, right. Well, another question
about the book. So, you wanted to target it

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.540
to young adults.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.540
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yes.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.540
&gt;&gt;man: Well, another question about the book.
You wanted to target it to young adults.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.540
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yes.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.000
&gt;man: And so I wanted you to talk a little
bit about that and some of the lessons that

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
you're hoping to convey.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.410
&gt;&gt;Rice: Well, I'm hoping to convey to young
adults that really, my story shows that just

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:55.220
about anything is possible. There is no earthly
reason that a little girl who grew up in Birmingham,

00:13:55.220 --> 00:14:00.929
Alabama under those circumstances should have
ended up as Secretary of State of the United

00:14:00.929 --> 00:14:06.459
States of America and certainly getting there
by the circuitous path of being a Soviet specialist.

00:14:06.459 --> 00:14:13.919
And so, I try to say to young adults, "Don't
let anybody define what it is you want to

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:18.839
be by looking at you and saying,' Oh, well
you shouldn't be interested in those things.'"

00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:24.839
I mean, my passion was something that really
was pretty odd for a black kid from Birmingham,

00:14:24.839 --> 00:14:28.859
but it just happened to be my passion and
because it was my passion, I was actually

00:14:28.859 --> 00:14:35.879
good at it and that led to a whole set of
outcomes. The other thing is to say what my

00:14:35.879 --> 00:14:39.799
parents believed fervently, "You may not be
able to control your circumstances, but you

00:14:39.799 --> 00:14:41.829
can control your reaction to your circumstances."

00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:42.829
&gt;&gt;man: Right, right.

00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:49.869
&gt;&gt;Rice: And if you see yourself as a victim
of something, then you're gonna feel aggrieved

00:14:49.869 --> 00:14:56.600
and the other half of the coin of aggrievement
is actually entitlement. Now, they owe me

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:04.129
this and they owe me that. And that is a dead
end in a society that doesn't reward aggreviement.

00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:08.339
&gt;&gt;man: Yeah. So last week you were, you met
with President Obama--

00:15:08.339 --> 00:15:09.339
&gt;&gt;Rice: I did.

00:15:09.339 --> 00:15:12.129
&gt;&gt;man: in the Oval Office and I assume you
gave him a copy of the book.

00:15:12.129 --> 00:15:15.929
&gt;&gt;Rice: I did. I gave him a copy of that book
and a copy of the young adult version for

00:15:15.929 --> 00:15:17.169
Malia and Sasha.

00:15:17.169 --> 00:15:18.169
&gt;&gt;man: Right, excellent.

00:15:18.169 --> 00:15:19.169
[laughter]

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:21.399
So was this the first time you've been there
since?

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:25.160
&gt;&gt;Rice: I've been to the White House, but
not to see the President.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.240
&gt;&gt;man: See the President?

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.240
[laughter]

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.240
So, you--

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.240
[laughter]

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.290
&gt;&gt;Rice: No, I mean, I've been to the White
House since the Obama Administration.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:32.290
[laughter]

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:36.459
&gt;&gt;man: Understood. So we have to ask you:
did you talk about foreign policy a little

00:15:36.459 --> 00:15:37.459
bit?

00:15:37.459 --> 00:15:41.379
&gt;&gt;Rice: Ahh, yeah. We did.

00:15:41.379 --> 00:15:43.839
&gt;&gt;man: Ok. So--

00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:44.839
[laughter]

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:48.809
in any of the counsel, the sage counsel that
you can tell us about?

00:15:48.809 --> 00:15:53.649
&gt;&gt;Rice: Actually, one thing that may be worth
noting is it's not that unusual for the sitting

00:15:53.649 --> 00:15:54.959
President to invite back--

00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:55.959
&gt;man: Sure.

00:15:55.959 --> 00:16:00.749
&gt;&gt;Rice: cabinet, a former cabinet office,
particularly foreign policy because despite

00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:05.889
all of our twists and turns and doing things
a little bit differently, there really is

00:16:05.889 --> 00:16:10.919
a lot of continuity in American foreign policy
and it's awfully important that people in

00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:12.779
the world understand that it's bipartisan.

00:16:12.779 --> 00:16:13.959
&gt;&gt;man: Mm-hmm.

00:16:13.959 --> 00:16:19.809
&gt;&gt;Rice: And so President Bush would, from
time to time, have former cabinet officials

00:16:19.809 --> 00:16:24.850
back. So the President and I had a chance
to cover the waterfront and talk a whole variety

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:31.249
of things and I had known him before because
when I was Secretary of State, he was on the

00:16:31.249 --> 00:16:35.290
Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate,
which oversaw the State Department. And so,

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.379
we've gotten to know each other before.

00:16:38.379 --> 00:16:42.329
&gt;&gt;man: Right, great. So, in terms of foreign
policies these days, I mean, what, how are

00:16:42.329 --> 00:16:47.339
you thinking about it? Are you currently optimistic
about the American foreign policy in the state

00:16:47.339 --> 00:16:48.339
of the world, or pessimistic and how do you
think about it?

00:16:48.339 --> 00:16:56.180
&gt;&gt;Rice: Well, in the long run I'm optimistic.
First of all, just because I'm an optimist

00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:02.649
to begin with, but also because I've seen
the United States go through bad times and

00:17:02.649 --> 00:17:08.889
come out where what seemed impossible later
on seems inevitable. I used to always remind

00:17:08.889 --> 00:17:14.959
myself, when I was Secretary, that today's
headlines and history's judgments are rarely

00:17:14.959 --> 00:17:21.250
the same. And I would keep portraits of Secretary's
of State near me to remind me of that; Thomas

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:25.880
Jefferson, first Secretary, everybody kept
him, George Marshall, probably the greatest

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.980
Secretary, everybody kept him, but I kept
Dean Acheson who, when he left, was remembered

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:37.870
for who lost China; doesn't, not now. And
I kept William Seward; he bought Alaska.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:38.870
&gt;&gt;man: Mm-hmm.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.679
&gt;&gt;Rice: When he bought Alaska, you wanna talk
about rough congressional hearings, how could

00:17:42.679 --> 00:17:48.850
you have spent seven million dollars on that
ice box to the Czar of Russia? And several

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.590
years later I was talking to the man who became,
who was the Defense Minister of Russia, Sergei

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:56.789
Ivanov, he said, "You know, Condy, I went
to Alaska. It is so beautiful. It reminds

00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:57.789
me of Russia."

00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:58.789
[man laughs]

00:17:58.789 --> 00:18:03.341
Sergei used to be in Russia. So we have to
remember today's headlines, history's judgment

00:18:03.341 --> 00:18:09.290
are never the same. And so saying that, I
think we've got some big challenges; big challenge

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:15.820
in Afghanistan and Pakistan. But I think we
will get it right if we're patient with the

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:20.809
fact that Afghanistan was the fifth poorest,
is the fifth poorest country in the world.

00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:22.360
It was always gonna be tough.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.360
&gt;&gt;man: Right.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:29.409
&gt;&gt;Rice: I think we're making progress on the
Iranian problem because the Iranian regime

00:18:29.409 --> 00:18:36.350
is inherently weak, particularly after what
happened to it in June of 2009. The sanctions

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:42.750
are biting on an economy that is very weak.
I think there are new challenges on the horizon,

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:52.909
like Mexico. The border with Mexico is beginning
to resemble a failed state, where the Mexican

00:18:52.909 --> 00:19:00.639
police can't be trusted and the Mexican army
is outgunned by the drug cartels. That's really

00:19:00.639 --> 00:19:06.649
dangerous. And I'll tell you, in 1996, I went
with the Stanford football team to the Sun

00:19:06.649 --> 00:19:13.210
Bowl in El Paso, I was provost, and we held
the big banquet across the border in Juarez.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:18.720
I went to the Sun Bowl this past year with
Stanford. Nobody went anywhere near Juarez

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:24.000
and in that period of time, that border has
become exceedingly dangerous. So we have some

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.970
new challenges, but I think we'll come through
them.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:32.000
&gt;&gt;man: Ok. Great. Well, in a moment I wanna
open it up for some of your questions. There

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.059
was one Google related question I had to ask
you--

00:19:35.059 --> 00:19:36.059
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yes, yes, yes.

00:19:36.059 --> 00:19:40.419
&gt;&gt;man: when I had the opportunity, but last
time you were here, we talked a fair bit about

00:19:40.419 --> 00:19:44.000
something that's really important to us here
at Google, which is Internet freedom; free

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.440
expression on the Internet and while you were
Secretary, you actually did a lot of work

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.440
in that area--

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.440
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yes.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.770
&gt;&gt;man: and really advanced the ball forward.
How do you, I know you have some really great

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:55.770
thoughts about this--

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.770
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yes.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.320
&gt;&gt;man: how do you see this going and what
would you counsel a company like Google, who

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.789
cares deeply about this, what would you counsel
us to do? To do with government, instead,

00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:04.789
to deal with this?

00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:07.789
&gt;&gt;Rice: Well, let me take the big one; the
elephant in the room is China.

00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:09.590
&gt;&gt;man: Yeah, there you go.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:14.129
&gt;&gt;Rice: And when people say to me, "When will
China surpass the United States as the most

00:20:14.129 --> 00:20:21.550
important global economy and political player?"
I say one thing, "Can you imagine that a country

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:26.120
that is as terrified of the Internet, that
is hacking into people's servers and trying

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:31.539
to find that last human rights advocate, is
that country gonna lead the knowledge based

00:20:31.539 --> 00:20:37.950
revolution?" No. And so you have, with the
Internet, in countries particularly like China,

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:43.710
this clash between something that is democratizing,
something that is information giving, something

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:50.299
that allows people to remotely organize themselves
and the authoritarians need to control all

00:20:50.299 --> 00:20:57.610
of those. My view is that, and I understand
short term issues, like today's earnings or

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:03.470
the quarterly earnings, I used to be a corporate
director. But I also know that an enlightened

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:09.970
long-term view says that is these countries,
these authoritarians, don't come to terms

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:15.170
with the aspirations of their people and allow
more freedom of expression, it's not gonna

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:19.279
be very stable. And you're not gonna be doing
business in China anyway because if China

00:21:19.279 --> 00:21:25.360
goes the wrong direction, we're going to be
looking at an even more closed and even more

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:31.519
authoritarian place where foreign business's
will be shut out, where IPR will be protected

00:21:31.519 --> 00:21:36.990
even less than it is now. And so, it seems
to me that the long term view is to do what

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:43.269
you can to enhance the capacity of citizens
in these countries to use the power of the

00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:44.269
Internet.

00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:49.169
&gt;&gt;man: Great. Well, let's open it up to some
of your questions. We have a first one, right?

00:21:49.169 --> 00:21:50.169
Right away, sir.

00:21:50.169 --> 00:21:53.580
&gt;&gt;audience male #1: You're regards about your
experience about being required to be twice

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:59.529
as good is related a lot with our experiences
of growing as Jewish children in Russia.

00:21:59.529 --> 00:22:00.529
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yes.

00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:05.389
&gt;&gt;audience male #1: In this respect, I wanted
to ask you in as students persue the Russian

00:22:05.389 --> 00:22:09.309
studies at Stanford and what do you tell your
students in general, what is your focus at

00:22:09.309 --> 00:22:10.309
Stanford?

00:22:10.309 --> 00:22:13.500
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yes, thank you. Well, my focus at
Stanford, I'm teaching for the Business School

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:18.409
and I'm teaching a course called The Global
Context, which basically says, "Remember that

00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:24.030
governments are the principle architects of
the environment in which you will be." I then

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:27.909
teach undergraduates; a course called Challenges
and Dilemmas in US Foreign Policy, but it

00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:33.970
won't surprise you that given my long association
with things Russian, I continue to teach about

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:40.669
Russia in both of those courses. And what
I say is that I think Russia, which went through

00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:47.820
a very difficult period of time in the 90s,
leading to the late 90s, the rise of Vladimir

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:54.700
Putin, the rise of a more authoritarian instinct
is actually now, there's a kind of battle

00:22:54.700 --> 00:23:00.690
going on in Russia. On the one hand, you have
those who want to continue to take Russia's

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:06.539
power and might on the basis of extractive
industries, oil-based economies, where the

00:23:06.539 --> 00:23:11.980
economy is great if the price of oil is 140
dollars a barrel and not so great if it's

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:20.919
70. Where it's authoritarian, where it's external
manifestation is more like "empire" and there

00:23:20.919 --> 00:23:24.799
are those who are saying, "Well, you know,
that isn't where Russia should be. Russia

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:31.129
should be leading the global knowledge revolution."
President Medvedev has said several times,

00:23:31.129 --> 00:23:37.700
"Russia has the best software engineers in
the world." And I always thought to myself,

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.409
"Yes, and they're all working in the United
States and Israel."

00:23:40.409 --> 00:23:41.409
[laughter]

00:23:41.409 --> 00:23:47.590
And that's the problem. And to the degree
that Russia can mobilize it's human potential

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:53.639
toward a more open, creative society; to take
advantage of all that creativity, we're all

00:23:53.639 --> 00:23:58.990
gonna be better off. And so yes, I continue
to follow Russian affairs and I actually think

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:04.350
where Russia ends up in this is very important
to international peace and stability.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:05.770
&gt;&gt;audience male#1: Thanks a lot.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:06.770
&gt;&gt;Rice: Thank you.

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:07.770
&gt;&gt;man: Go ahead, sir.

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:12.970
&gt;audience male #2: Hi, thanks for coming.
I wanted to ask you a question along the lines

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:20.970
of how can we all get along. The politics
today is so, it seems counterproductive and

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:24.440
I don't know, I view you as somebody who could
actually make a difference there.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.690
&gt;&gt;Rice: Thank you.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:30.509
&gt;&gt;audience male #2: What could you or other
people do to take a leadership role in making

00:24:30.509 --> 00:24:31.509
things more productive?

00:24:31.509 --> 00:24:36.639
&gt;&gt;Rice: Right. And I agree with you. To be
fair, our politics have always been a little

00:24:36.639 --> 00:24:41.960
rough in the United States. I mean, Thomas
Jefferson leaked a letter saying George Washington

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.320
was senile because he thought Washington was
too close to Alexander Hamilton. I mean, our

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.390
politics have always been a little rough.

00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:49.390
[laughter]

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:57.429
But I think that the pace of our politics
now, driven by 24 hour news cycles and cable

00:24:57.429 --> 00:25:01.590
television, which I listen to like everybody
else, but can you even tell what people are

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:06.440
saying anymore? They're so busy yelling at
each other; nobody stops to listen. And in

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:12.779
a political system, like the United States,
where the founding fathers separated power

00:25:12.779 --> 00:25:19.419
between the branches of government, you need
time. You need time for people not to have

00:25:19.419 --> 00:25:24.379
to go to their corners and have a mic shoved
in front of their faces the minute a problem

00:25:24.379 --> 00:25:30.700
comes up. They commit to a particular solution
and now they're stuck. And if they move toward

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:36.720
the other side, they're considered to be flip-flopping
or they're considered to be wavering or they're

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:42.440
not principled enough. Politics really is
like sausage-making. It's tough. It's not

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.679
that you abandon your principles, but I can
assure you, I write in the book about the

00:25:46.679 --> 00:25:51.990
Civil Rights Legislation of 1964 and 1965,
which actually allowed me to go to a restaurant

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:57.360
for the first time. That would never have
happened with cable television because Lyndon

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:06.679
Johnson would not have been able to put together
that coalition of northern Republicans and

00:26:06.679 --> 00:26:11.379
Texans and others to put them together and
overcome this extremely difficult issue. So,

00:26:11.379 --> 00:26:17.269
here's my prescription: let's turn down the
volume. Let's just turn down the volume and

00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:22.570
stop yelling at each other and accusing each
other. Let's recognize that we have some very

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:28.570
crucial problems in the United States. But
we know some of the elements of how to solve

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:33.789
them. We know that private sector led growth
is important or we're not gonna have jobs.

00:26:33.789 --> 00:26:38.710
We know that fiscal discipline is important
or we're not gonna have investors. We know

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:45.309
that immigration is important to our country
because it keeps us from the tragic demographics

00:26:45.309 --> 00:26:50.980
of Russia and the sclerotic demographics of
Europe. And I don't understand don't believe

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:56.799
this is my country when I hear people say
we ought to deny citizenship to the children

00:26:56.799 --> 00:27:01.019
of illegal immigrants who were born here.
I don't recognize that kind of country. Let's

00:27:01.019 --> 00:27:07.760
all agree that we need free trade so that
exports can grow and let's all agree that

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:13.740
the K-12 education system is a crime when
I can look at your zip code and know whether

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:20.240
you're gonna get a good job. And then let's
work from those basic principles. I think

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:27.529
if actually we could re-focus on some of those
principles and turn down the volume some;

00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:30.720
maybe we can get back to the place where we
have workable politics. Thank you.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.169
&gt;&gt;audience member #2: Thanks.

00:27:32.169 --> 00:27:33.619
&gt;&gt;man: Great. Next question.

00:27:33.619 --> 00:27:40.220
&gt;&gt;audience male #3: I have a question about
day's past. Back when the United States decided

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:48.340
to go to Iraq, you went to Russia and discussed
at length why it is a good idea to go to Iraq

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:55.259
and you spent quite a while behind closed
doors with then President Putin. What did

00:27:55.259 --> 00:27:56.460
you discuss?

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.460
[laughter]

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:04.419
&gt;&gt;Rice: Well, that I will talk about. I think
that, let me say one thing about Russia and

00:28:04.419 --> 00:28:11.149
President Putin. Things got difficult toward
the end, but in global affairs, for the most

00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:15.639
part, we have a very good cooperation with
Russia, on the Middle East, on North Korea,

00:28:15.639 --> 00:28:21.149
on the War on Terrorism; very good cooperation,
on Afghanistan. We had trouble with Russia

00:28:21.149 --> 00:28:27.769
when we got involved in what Russia considered
to be its periphery; Georgia, Central Asia,

00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:33.059
Ukraine and the states of the Warsaw Pact
like Poland and the Czech Republic. But on

00:28:33.059 --> 00:28:40.629
Iraq, I have to give President Putin credit.
He, they voted for resolution 1441, which

00:28:40.629 --> 00:28:49.249
was a resolution that said Saddam had to open
up his WMD sites or face serious consequences.

00:28:49.249 --> 00:28:57.690
But Putin told us "I cannot agree to a resolution
that will take us to war." And he said it

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:02.720
from the very beginning. All that you can
ask of another leader is that they tell you

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:07.940
from the very beginning what they can do and
what they can't do. There were some leaders

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:13.960
who said, "Oh, yes, we'll be with you." And
then when things got tough, they weren't there.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:18.679
I didn't respect that. I do respect when people
tell you what they can do and what they can't

00:29:18.679 --> 00:29:25.460
do. We did not have a disagreement with Russia
about Saddam's weapons of mass destruction.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:31.320
They thought he had them, too. He did have
capability and infrastructure. What he didn't

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:36.659
have was stock piles. But we disagreed with
Russia about what that meant in terms of what

00:29:36.659 --> 00:29:42.299
needed to be done in Iraq. But I will say
also about Russia that once the war was over,

00:29:42.299 --> 00:29:49.039
Russia quite quickly became part of the solution,
not part of the problem. Now, one reason that

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:53.299
Russia did that is if they were very clear
that they wanted their oil and gas contracts

00:29:53.299 --> 00:29:59.169
to be honored by the new Iraqi government
and I always felt that Russia's economic interests

00:29:59.169 --> 00:30:02.010
were more important here to Russia than almost
anything else.

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.929
&gt;&gt;audience member #3: Thank you very much.

00:30:03.929 --> 00:30:04.929
&gt;&gt;Rice: You're welcome.

00:30:04.929 --> 00:30:05.929
&gt;&gt;man: Ok. Next question.

00:30:05.929 --> 00:30:09.679
&gt;&gt;audience member #4: Yeah, I guess to help
us get past caricatures and stereotypes of

00:30:09.679 --> 00:30:14.240
foreign figureheads, can you elaborate on
some of your closest personal relationships?

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.059
Some of your best friends, anything, conflicts,--

00:30:17.059 --> 00:30:18.059
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yes.

00:30:18.059 --> 00:30:21.649
&gt;&gt;audience male #4: and maybe talk about people
that struck you as either impressive or who

00:30:21.649 --> 00:30:22.679
had areas for improvement?

00:30:22.679 --> 00:30:23.679
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yes.

00:30:23.679 --> 00:30:24.679
[laughter]

00:30:24.679 --> 00:30:35.059
The person that I think of, there's several
that I, Tony Blair. Not only was he kind of

00:30:35.059 --> 00:30:40.940
a rock star and that was clear, but he also
was somebody of real principle. When he said

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:45.100
he was gonna do something he did it. I think
that he believed, fundamentally, in the proposition

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:50.090
that no man, woman or child should live in
tyranny. And that brought us close to him.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:57.179
And I have enormous admiration for him. Also,
what he did in Middle East as the Cortez envoy

00:30:57.179 --> 00:31:03.460
for the Middle East was quite impressive.
Ariel Sharon, who was a tough, little tank

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:11.820
driver and was somebody who nobody would have
thought to be interested in peace because

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:19.100
he was brought to power to defeat the Palestinian
Resistance, but by 2003, he had taken a whole

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:24.779
part of the Israeli political spectrum and
put it in support of a two-state solution.

00:31:24.779 --> 00:31:30.960
And I think he may, ultimately, be one of
the reasons we will get to a Palestinian state.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:39.440
I quite admire Angela Merkel, who I think
is, as German Chancellor, maybe in the most

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.919
important position in Europe right now. The
European Union is going through some very

00:31:43.919 --> 00:31:49.149
difficult times. When you have German newspapers
that suggest that the Greeks sell the Acropolis

00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:52.309
to pay their debt, we have a problem--

00:31:52.309 --> 00:31:53.309
[laughter]

00:31:53.309 --> 00:31:59.029
of European unity. And Angela Merkel is trying
to steer this course where the German taxpayer

00:31:59.029 --> 00:32:04.850
no longer wants to pay for proliferigate spending
in the rest of Europe and she wants to hold

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:10.830
the European Union together. And I think she's
done a remarkable job. Ellen Sirleaf Johnson,

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.499
the President of Liberia.

00:32:12.499 --> 00:32:13.499
&gt;&gt;man: Mmhmm

00:32:13.499 --> 00:32:18.440
&gt;&gt;Rice:Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the President
of Liberia, a country that was on the front

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:26.480
pages of The New York Times in 2003 with 13
year old boys with AK-47s running the streets.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:33.279
Where the United States sent a hundred marines
in to stabilize the ports in the airport and

00:32:33.279 --> 00:32:39.259
that country now has a chance. It's desperately
poor. Twenty five years of civil war, but

00:32:39.259 --> 00:32:44.309
I will never forget one of the most remarkable
moments; we went, Laura Bush and I, went to

00:32:44.309 --> 00:32:49.119
her Inaugural and she was giving her speech
and all the African Heads of State were there

00:32:49.119 --> 00:32:55.139
and all of a sudden she said, "And today,
every member of my cabinet, and I personally,

00:32:55.139 --> 00:33:01.730
will publish our personal finances." And all
these African leaders who had been cheering

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:05.059
everything she said, this didn't sound like
such a great idea.

00:33:05.059 --> 00:33:06.279
[laughter]

00:33:06.279 --> 00:33:10.980
And I thought, "She's changing the whole face
of Africa by what she's saying here." So,

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:17.070
those are some of the people that I admire
most. Probably the oddest that I met was Muammar

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:18.070
al-Gaddafi.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:19.070
[laughter]

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:23.519
I was the first Secretary of State to go to,
and Coby's laughing because he was the advance

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:29.700
on that trip, but when Gaddafi said that he
wanted me to meet him in his tent--

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:31.429
[laughter]

00:33:31.429 --> 00:33:34.320
we decided we didn't know what that meant,
but it didn't sound very good.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.320
[laughter]

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:44.720
And so, but it was quite something. He's actually
more rational to have a conversation with

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.720
than you might imagine.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.720
&gt;&gt;audience member #4: Thank you.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.059
&gt;&gt;man: Ok, we've got about five more minutes
for questions, so let's keep them coming.

00:33:49.059 --> 00:33:54.960
&gt;&gt;audience member #5: I found it fascinating
just all these connections you had with kids

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.840
you grew up with that came from Birmingham
and it seems like, especially impressive given

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:05.999
that underprivileged environment, but it seems
like one factor you had was this extreme privilege

00:34:05.999 --> 00:34:10.919
of engaged parents. And it seems like that's
not, and I think that's something that's shared

00:34:10.919 --> 00:34:15.030
here in this room by a lot of people, how
do you, it's not really something that I think

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:20.149
is focused on enough in education today. What
are your thoughts on I guess that and how

00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:23.139
can that, how can your experience be a model
for that type of--

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:26.869
&gt;&gt;Rice: Absolutely. I think you're exactly
right. You've gotten, you've broken the code.

00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:30.809
It is engaged parents, but if you don't have
engaged parents, you'd better have an engaged

00:34:30.809 --> 00:34:36.679
adult with every child. And whether it's the
Boys and Girls Clubs of America, where I'm

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:40.619
on the national board, I think they do a fine
job of engagement with the kids, particularly

00:34:40.619 --> 00:34:45.139
from underprivileged environments, whether
it's a teacher that takes an interest in those

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:51.990
kids, a pastor or the community, every child
has got to have some adult that says, "Here's

00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:58.349
how you navigate to get to be successful."
And it is just, we can't just leave it on

00:34:58.349 --> 00:35:03.030
the schools to do it all. Some adult has got
to be engaged with every child.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:05.550
&gt;&gt;audience member #5: Do you think parents
themselves are aware enough?

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:09.920
&gt;&gt;Rice: I do think parents, you know one of
the things that I did when I came back here

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.230
the last time, was I formed something called
The Center for a New Generation. There are

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:18.849
now five of them in East Palo Alto, Redwood
City, East Menlo, and they're an after school

00:35:18.849 --> 00:35:25.180
enrichment program for kids from that region,
that part of the state and you know that's

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:30.180
a very impoverished part of the state. But
the idea that their parents didn't care was

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:36.349
just exploded. These parents were just trying
to get their kids into the center. So, sometimes

00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:40.920
I think parents don't have the means, they
don't have the right language, they don't

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:45.520
know how to access the school system, but
they care. And whenever we had a performance

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:49.510
at The Center for a New Generation with the
school band, I mean the instrumental band

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:54.200
and so forth, those parents were there taking
pictures and being proud of their kids. So,

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.099
I think there's a lot to work with.

00:35:56.099 --> 00:35:57.280
&gt;&gt;audience member #5: Thank you.

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.280
&gt;&gt;Rice: Thank you.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:03.930
&gt;&gt;audience member #6: All right. So, we touched
briefly upon race relations because obviously,

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:08.280
you contribute a large portion of that in
your book and as well to political friction

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:13.350
in the country. There are a number of, or
there is a current that believes that race

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:17.260
relations are starting to rear their head
again in politics and the NAACP just put out

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.829
a paper called Tea Party Nationalism.

00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:19.829
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yeah.

00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:24.290
&gt;&gt;audience member #6: About the radical right
and racism in the Tea Party movement and the

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:30.180
up rise of that. What are your thoughts as
a black conservative on the Tea Party and

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.990
these unsavory aspects of it?

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:35.240
&gt;&gt;Rice: Right, right. Well, there are unsavory
aspects to a lot of movements, right? There

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:39.589
are extremists in a lot of movements. I think
on balance the tea party is a grassroots movement

00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:43.530
of folks who don't like where their country
is going and they're trying to express that.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:48.540
And sometimes they express it in ways that
I don't agree, like on immigration or on free

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:52.140
trade, but sometimes they express it in a
way with which I completely agree; that the

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:57.059
conversation in Washington and the conversation
in the rest of the country is not the same

00:36:57.059 --> 00:37:01.230
conversation. And I think they're trying to
get Washington's attention that people out

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:06.619
here are worried about having gone to college,
majored in Accounting cause they wanted to

00:37:06.619 --> 00:37:11.369
be English majors, but they had to find a
job, buying a home, as David Brooks said recently,

00:37:11.369 --> 00:37:16.170
buying a home they actually could afford and
now they find the equity is half of it. I

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:22.609
think that's what these people are expressing.
And we don't do any good by branding them

00:37:22.609 --> 00:37:28.339
with a kind of broad brush. Yes, I think there
are some people who've expressed racist views,

00:37:28.339 --> 00:37:32.119
but frankly, I didn't like it very much when
people said George Bush was a racist because

00:37:32.119 --> 00:37:37.430
of Katrina. Suddenly, he was a racist because
a hurricane hit one of the poorest parts of

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:44.410
America in New Orleans? This is a term we
need to stop throwing around because given

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:50.349
our deep wounds as a country, the worst and
most incendiary thing that you can do is call

00:37:50.349 --> 00:37:54.829
somebody else a racist. And you better be
sure that that's actually what's going on

00:37:54.829 --> 00:38:00.720
rather than you just have a political disagreement.
And so, I would tell people in the Tea Party

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:05.260
stop saying those things and I would tell
people in NAACP stop saying those things.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:12.720
And let's focus on the problems that we share
jointly because America is an extraordinary

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:19.569
place where two black Secretaries of State,
a black President of the United States and

00:38:19.569 --> 00:38:24.700
with the heritage and history that we have
that means we've come a very long way. So,

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:31.040
while I fully understand that there are elements
of many movements that I don't agree with

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:37.140
and that there's racism in some of them, it's
really something that we ought to step back

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:42.010
from. And I said turn down the volume, well;
this is one where we really better turn down

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:49.010
the volume because we will actually empower
the most extreme elements of our society if

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:53.960
we're constantly pointing to, pointing to
them and giving them a megaphone.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:54.960
&gt;&gt;audience member #6: Thank you.

00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:55.960
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yeah.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.960
&gt;&gt;man: Let's try to get the last two questions
over here.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:57.960
&gt;&gt;Rice: Sure.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.290
&gt;&gt;audience member #7: So, from the outside
looking in, it seems like there's a schism

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:03.550
between government and policy and technology,
at least in the US. Which seems interesting

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:13.299
because at Google, we're in the business of
changing the world and essentially, so are

00:39:13.299 --> 00:39:17.500
you. So, how do you think, ideally, we could
bridge that gap between the technologies we're

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:26.180
developing here and what policy makers are
trying to do from an implementation or an

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.180
efficiency standpoint?

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:32.170
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yeah. I'll give you two examples where
I think a lot of work could be done and some

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:40.380
work is being done. Technology may actually
help with the school problem that I was talking

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:47.349
about because I would rather have the very,
very, very best teacher in every classroom

00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:52.670
and we outta strive for that, but sometimes
you have to make up for teaching that may

00:39:52.670 --> 00:40:00.309
not be optimum and technology is a way to
do it. And so, I think technology and K-12

00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:04.210
education and improvement of K-12 education
is something where we can bridge some of the

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:10.609
policy problems we have and what the technology
can offer. And the other big one is in democratization.

00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:14.980
There is no doubt in my mind that the fact
that people can get on the Internet, and by

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:19.780
the way, a lot of my Chinese students and
friends tell me they can try and block, they

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:25.500
can try and filter, we'll always find a way
around it. And so, it is having a democratizing

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:32.760
effect. We saw the effect of it in Iran where
the regime just couldn't shut down all of

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:37.260
the technological outlets and I think if we're
more conscious about it, I thought Hilary

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:41.680
Clinton, Secretary Clinton, gave a very good
speech about this and I think these are things

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:47.560
that could be followed up on. Now, I'm not
asking companies to become either part of

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:54.609
the policy process or to become social entrepreneurs.
I'm just saying that for all of us, for the

00:40:54.609 --> 00:41:01.680
long term benefit to all of us, for our long
term interest, for technology to play a role

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:08.280
in the betterment of K-12 education and in
democratization around the world is gonna

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:12.320
benefit both policy and the technology sector.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.120
&gt;&gt;audience member #7: Thank you.

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.180
&gt;&gt;man: Great. Last question.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:21.000
&gt;&gt;audience member #8: Dr. Rice, thank you
for coming to speak with us today. This is,

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.381
I'm too short for this. In your book, you
write, you mention several times about how

00:41:25.381 --> 00:41:31.599
much books have shaped the way you think today.
You write that one of your proudest moments

00:41:31.599 --> 00:41:36.610
was when your father gave your grandfather's
books to you and Auntie Teresa read some of

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:42.670
her books 25 times. And I wanted to ask you,
what are some of the books from your childhood

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:44.180
that you really cherished?

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:49.590
&gt;&gt;Rice: Yes, well thank you. Boy, you really
read the book; that's great.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:50.590
[laughter]

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:56.950
Well, I tended, as a child not to be the voracious
reader that my parents were; that they wanted

00:41:56.950 --> 00:42:00.349
me to be. So, they tried a lot of things,
you know, classic comics and all kinds of

00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:07.160
things. And then they realized that I discovered
and loved biography. And it started with the

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:14.220
biographies of the Founding--of the great
composers. So, Mozart's biography, I wanted

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:20.930
to be Constance Mozart. Most little girls
had a crush on Elvis; I had a crush on Mozart.

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:21.930
[laughter]

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:27.400
I, my parents gave me all these books about
the composers. As I went through life, it

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:35.260
has been biography that has been most stimulating
for me. I read, during 2006, the lives of

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:41.950
the Founding Fathers, a series of really great
biographies: Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison,

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:48.480
Franklin. And it really convinced me of this
belief that I have that what seems impossible

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:53.030
one day later on seems inevitable because
when you read their biographies; there is

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:57.059
no earthy reason the United States of America
should have ever come into being. With a third

00:42:57.059 --> 00:43:01.820
of George Washington's troops down to smallpox,
taking on the greatest military power of the

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:08.270
time, and so, I loved those biographies. I've
gone on to read a wonderful biography of Teddy

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:13.069
Roosevelt, which is kind of the opening of
the frontier of the United States. And I've

00:43:13.069 --> 00:43:17.920
read a couple of really excellent biographies
recently of Joseph Stalin, which, I think,

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:27.950
has given me new insights to Russia. So, I
find through people's lives and people's experiences

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:34.170
that not only does history open up to me in
a way that it doesn't if I just read the history,

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:41.349
but the lessons of the triumph of the human
spirit, both for good and for evil, opens

00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:49.549
up to me. And so, I continue to be a dedicated
biography reader and maybe one reason that

00:43:49.549 --> 00:43:55.060
I wanted to write this book, which is a kind
of autobiography, although it's really my

00:43:55.060 --> 00:44:01.109
parents story, is that I think we learn more
through the vibrancy of people's lives than

00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:02.940
in any other way.

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:09.440
&gt;&gt;man: Well, speaking of biography, we wanted
to have a chance for a book signing. I think

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.280
you'll be available for awhile longer--

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.280
&gt;&gt;Rice: I will be, that's right.

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.289
&gt;&gt;man: to do that. I encourage all of you,
if you haven't picked up a copy of the book

00:44:15.289 --> 00:44:19.810
to do so. But we're just really, really thrilled
to have you here again, Dr. Rice and thank

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:20.810
you so much for coming.

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:21.810
&gt;&gt;Rice: Thank you. Thank you and thanks for
a great conversation.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:21.811
[applause]
