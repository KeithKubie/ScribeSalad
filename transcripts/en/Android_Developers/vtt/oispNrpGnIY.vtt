[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:07.690
JONATHAN CARMEL:
Well, thank you.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.030
I'm Jonathan Carmel.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.520
I'm a product manager
for Android Instant Apps,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.620
and you've come to the
session for an introduction

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.280
to Instant Apps.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.570
So, I'm really excited to
highlight a lot of the partners

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.230
that we have live today,
many are in the audience.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.970
But before we dive
into that, let's talk

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.310
about the foundation of Instant
Apps, which are Android apps.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.380
We love Android apps.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.870
Android apps are getting
better and better.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.810
They are fast,
seamless, beautiful,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.880
and take advantage of
device capabilities.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.690
Let's take a look at some of
them on my home screen today.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.270
We have Ticketmaster,
who has a beautiful end

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.900
to end experience.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.610
So let's say I wanted to
go see LCD Soundsystem.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.650
Well, I would just
go into Ticketmaster,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.080
I would search for
LCD Soundsystem.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.690
And due to NDK's support
and their seat view,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.860
I can find the
exact seat I want,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.960
see what it looks like in the
venue, and buy right there.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.870
Next day, I can actually get
into the concert with my phone.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.350
Then you have Citymapper, which
has saved me a lot this week,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.130
because I'm actually staying
in a Mountain View hotel.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.710
And I'm riding my bike
because I didn't want

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.220
to hit the traffic you all hit.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.210
It's a 30 minute
bike ride and I have

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.590
no idea how to navigate the
backwoods of Mountain View.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.190
So, I open up Citymapper,
tells me the exact transit,

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.870
and due to the map
view support, I

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.450
can dive in and figure out
that turn that I just missed

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.230
and go back a few miles.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.070
Then you have Red Bull
TV, a lean back experience

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.470
for immersive television.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.090
All of these add up
to great Android apps.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.510
All of you in the crowd
have done an amazing job

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.510
developing apps, but
you told us in order

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.250
to get that experience
you first have to install.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.860
And there's a friction
point, and you

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.750
don't have as many users
using your best experience.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.330
So what if we could have
that same experience,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.436
but with just with a
click you dive into it?

00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:11.810
And that is Android
Instant Apps.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.720
They are native Android
apps that run instantly

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.870
without installation.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.900
So let me dive into a
very simple example.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.720
I have a friend Joyce
and she loves Buzzfeed.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.690
She's on the BuzzFeed
app all the time just

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.400
looking through videos.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.100
The other day she told me
that there are seven ways

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.690
to make chicken wings.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.870
Now you and I all know,
that there are only six ways

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.580
to make chicken wings.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.600
So, I usually would have to
download the BuzzFeed video

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.070
app from the Play Store, wait,
open it up, and then search

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.990
for the video she's
talking about.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.780
But now, all I have to
do, she sends me a link,

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.570
all I have to do is click, I
dive right into the native app

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.660
experience.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.800
And unfortunately, I find out
there are actually seven ways

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.740
to make chicken wings.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.079
Now I might not want
to use Buzzfeed.

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.120
I just want that experience
right then and there.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.340
I don't necessarily want
to save it to my phone,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.490
and with Instant Apps you
don't necessarily have to.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.280
So let's talk about a few of our
additional live partners today

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.660
that I'm really
excited to talk about.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.650
The first one is Dotloop, which
is a contract signing app.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.300
I don't sign
contracts every day,

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.780
but when I get that email
that says, "Time sensitive,

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.930
you have to sign this contract
right now," and I'm in transit,

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.200
I don't want to have to wait to
get back to my desktop to sign.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.394
Don't worry, Dotloop
has you covered.

00:03:37.394 --> 00:03:39.310
They have this beautiful
native app experience

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.710
that really guides you
through the flow, telling you

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.410
how many signatures you have
to have in the contract.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.800
Having you read, flip through
the contract, and then dive

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.300
into the exact place
you have to sign.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.830
Now early results for
Dotloop have been phenomenal.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.180
They're seeing more users
start that experience.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.760
There's double digit uplift for
just starting that experience

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.500
because they're guiding
you immediately,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.999
and then they're seeing double
digit increase for the number

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:05.130
of signed contracts.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.370
HotPads is another
Instant App that's live,

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.460
and it's a real
estate browsing app.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.418
Now, my wife and I are
looking to move right now.

00:04:17.418 --> 00:04:18.959
Or at least I believe
so, because she

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.230
keeps on sending me links
every day about new properties.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.890
So, I don't have the
HotPads app on my phone,

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.930
but she does because
she's browsing properties

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.280
all the time.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.900
But now when she
sends me a link,

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.600
I dive into this high
fidelity experience,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.580
get to flip through
all the photos,

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.350
look at the dimensions
of that home,

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.840
look at a lot of rich
textual information,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.480
like what schools are nearby.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.900
And then I can flip through new
houses that I'm interested in,

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.460
and when I'm ready, I actually
can contact the broker

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.610
and set up times to
actually see the house.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.190
And that's exactly what HotPads
is trying to optimize for.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.260
They want you to reach
out to the broker

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.970
and actually see the house.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.210
And HotPads told us that they've
been optimizing their app

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.240
for over 12 years, and to
see the uplift they're seeing

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.001
right now is significant.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.620
Let's talk about my
new daily ritual,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.290
morning ritual, which is
New York Times crossword.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.260
I wake up in the morning,
I do a quick search

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.880
to find the New York
Times crossword,

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.990
I open it up in google.com and
it shows a little instant badge

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.980
right next to it.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.920
I dive into the
instant app experience,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.460
and I get to finish the
crossword immediately.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.990
And every day I send my
best time to my whole team,

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.110
this is the time to
beat for the day.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.380
Now, early data shows
that I'm not alone.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.060
That this has become
more habitual for users

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.330
in the Instant App.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.850
They are coming
back more and more,

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.760
and they're seeing significant
increases in reengagement

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.500
from early data.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.080
I'm very excited to
put this slide up.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.080
Today we have 50 partners live.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.030
So I want to thank
all the partners that

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.925
have worked so hard to get
these Instant Apps live today.

00:06:05.925 --> 00:06:07.550
So please give them
around of applause.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.840
We have 15 Instant Apps
from 14 different countries.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.555
And you can see, we cover a
bunch of different categories.

00:06:23.555 --> 00:06:25.180
And I'll just go
through a few of them,

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.880
I'm sorry I'm leaving
some of you out,

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.520
but you can see e-commerce
partners like Jet, Wish,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.870
and Ticketmaster.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.550
You can see entertainment, like
Vimeo, Red Bull, Viki, TabPro,

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.990
and New York Times crossword.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.780
TabPro is great if you
ever want to learn guitar.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.490
You have news and
publishing apps,

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.970
like CBC, One
Football, and Pocket.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.940
And you have travel apps,
like TripIt, Skyscanner,

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.920
and Citymapper.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.660
Over the last year,
these partners

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.670
have been extensions
of our product team.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.190
They're not only trying to
optimize their instant app,

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.380
but they're also giving
us tons of feedback

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.180
on the platform and the
tooling that we have in place.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.780
So a lot of the tooling
that you'll check out today

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.850
is due to all the hours of
feedback they provided for us.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:12.630
So, I really want to thank them
again, and today at 4:30 p.m.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.000
you'll see a panel where
you hear from the developers

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.067
themselves.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.640
Now let's take all these apps
and put them on our phone.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.440
Even the apps
today, that is a lot

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.000
of apps to fit on your phone.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.010
But thankfully,
these native apps

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.600
are now part of your phone.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.302
You can access them
anytime, anywhere,

00:07:33.302 --> 00:07:35.010
even if it's not
installed on your phone.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.190
Now yesterday, you heard that
anyone can now build an Instant

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.250
App, so we're really excited
to open up to all of you

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.910
and start seeing more and more
of you develop Instant Apps.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.550
You can now access
the documentation,

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.040
download the SDK, and
download the tooling.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.710
So what should you
expect when you start

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.450
developing an Instant App?

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.420
One code-base, one
project, and the tools

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.250
you are already familiar with.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.340
You will develop an Android 3.0.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.340
The first step you'll do is
begin to modularize your app,

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.460
and start taking the features
that you already have today

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.190
and breaking it up into
different feature modules.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.550
And we have the tooling to
help you do that and lead you

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.730
along the way, and we
stress the reuse of code

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.320
from the installable app.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.230
So you're again working in
one code-base, one project.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:29.460
When you're done you
upload to the Play console.

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.690
Now, you will not have to go
and hire an Android Instant Apps

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:34.440
engineer.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.220
This is the Android development
you are already familiar with.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.331
And when we talked
to our 50 partners,

00:08:41.331 --> 00:08:42.789
and asked them how
long did it take

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.770
them to develop an Instant App?

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.320
All apps vary, but they
said on average it's

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.520
about four to six weeks.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.420
So, let's talk about how
you prepare your use case.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.150
One thing I'll stress
throughout this presentation

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.310
is the importance of
focusing on the action you're

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.430
trying to get the users to do.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.380
So, I know that many of you
are focused on installations,

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.840
but really what you're trying
to do when you developed

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.790
your Android app
and your instant app

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.340
is get the user to read
an article, watch a video,

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.231
sign a contract, do a purchase
get highly engaged in your app.

00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:16.980
That is your goal.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.530
So what are some
of the motivations

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.260
that we have seen and heard
from our early partners

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.100
about why they developed
an instant app?

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.890
We'll break them into
three categories.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.600
The first one is about focusing
on your current user base

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.910
and optimizing their
experience, and that's

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.360
what we call conversion.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.820
The second one is
thinking about new users

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.290
that you can now reach.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.555
And the third one is
completely new use cases.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.967
So again, for conversion we
think about your current users

00:09:49.967 --> 00:09:51.716
and were thinking--
when we say conversion

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:54.000
we mean what metric are you
really trying to optimize?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.030
So for your current
users, many of you

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.820
have told me that your native
app is one of your best

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.469
properties and you want more
users going to your native app.

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:05.010
So, of your current
user base, you're

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.860
actually opening
up accessibility

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.610
of your current user
base to actually dive

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.780
into that native app.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.600
So we launched
recently with Jet,

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:17.610
and they're seeing great numbers
of the likelihood of a user now

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.590
purchasing when they
land on the Instant App

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.990
has increased significantly
by double digits.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.710
Reach is about
top of the funnel,

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:32.220
reaching more users that haven't
even seen your property before.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.232
This is true for a lot
of app first developers.

00:10:35.232 --> 00:10:36.690
So you can imagine
for a lot of app

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.870
first developers they're
thinking, "Most of my discovery

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.570
happens on the Play Store.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.270
I'm getting most of my
users from installed users."

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:49.260
And the question is, can we
expand that surface area?

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.950
Can we reach new users that you
haven't reached in the past?

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.530
And if you're thinking
about now you URLs as a way

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.570
to onboard into your
experience, you're

00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.160
basically increasing
that surface area

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.110
across the internet
for new users

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.622
to actually interface with
your native app experience.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:06.330
We've seen this
especially with Castbots.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.949
For a podcast,
oftentimes I listen to it

00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:14.740
actually every day.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.560
I listen to a podcast
and I love Castbots.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:22.010
And I don't always want to
share my podcasts with people,

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.010
because I'm not sure if
they listen to podcasts,

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.340
and I don't know what
their experience is

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.230
going to look like.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.291
But now when I
share a URL, I know

00:11:29.291 --> 00:11:31.540
that they're going to dive
right into that same native

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.250
experience that
I'm experiencing,

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.810
and I know that's
a great experience.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.300
So my propensity to
share has increased.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.460
Finally, there are new
use cases that we're

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.370
excited to see what
the people in this room

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.530
start to think about and
develop now that there's

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.330
no install friction,
and there's not

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.660
as much friction between the
physical and digital world.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:58.120
So you can imagine, when you go
to a baseball game, a museum,

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.100
and you want a map for
the day, you're not

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.140
likely to install an app.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.900
Or if you go to
the baseball game

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.399
and you have an option to
order food to your seat,

00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:08.440
but you're like, "I don't
want to install an app,

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.629
I'm just going to go to
the concession stand."

00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:13.170
We've removed a lot
of that friction,

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.240
so there are opportunities
to on-board users.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.790
And we're thinking here,
things like QR codes,

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.519
beacons, NFC, new ways to get
the user into your experience.

00:12:21.519 --> 00:12:23.310
Now we've been calling
this companion apps,

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.740
and we're really excited
to see what you guys all

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.997
develop in this room.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:29.580
If you go to our
sandbox today, you'll

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.310
actually see some of
our early partners

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.682
actually developing these
type of experiences.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.410
So at this point,
hopefully you're

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.030
now excited and
motivated to start

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.290
developing an Instant App.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:44.960
So what should you
start thinking about

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.161
alongside the development?

00:12:46.161 --> 00:12:47.660
What are the guiding
principles that

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.154
will help you develop
an Instant App?

00:12:51.154 --> 00:12:52.570
There are five
guiding principles.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.330
The first one is
the idea of one app.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.070
We like to think of Instant
Apps and installed apps

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:04.050
as one app that run in
two different modes.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.530
I often like to compare
Instant Apps to the streaming

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:08.880
version of music.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.250
You're breaking up
the albums into songs,

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.320
and then streaming each song.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.320
It's very similar to what
you'll do with Instant Apps.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.500
When you're on the plane, you
download music to your phone

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.050
so you have offline access.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.120
But when you're
sitting at home, you

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.270
don't think about what music
do I have in my phone today?

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.490
You're actually just
accessing all the music

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.180
that you have access to, and
you're not thinking, "Oh, I

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.930
have to download this or not."

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.690
So going back to
the one app concept,

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.030
we want to think of Instant
Apps as the same app,

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.667
only being used on demand.

00:13:42.667 --> 00:13:44.250
From an engineering
standpoint, that's

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.020
exactly what it will feel like.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.430
Again one code-base,
one project,

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.920
all the features you already
use your installed app

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.610
in your Instant App.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.600
And Android Studio 3.0,
we ensure just that,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.060
with high code reuse
between your installed app

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.810
and your Instant App.

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:07.340
Now again, we'll go in depth
into the actual development

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.350
of an Instant App at
our technical session

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.440
later at 3:30 p.m. which I
encourage you all to go to.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.570
And there will actually
develop an instant app

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:18.650
live in less than 40 minutes.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.260
But as you can see here,
just from this diagram,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.210
all the features from
your installed app

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.425
are now present in
your Instant App.

00:14:25.425 --> 00:14:27.050
And all that you've
done is broken them

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:31.370
up so that now the user can
access feature one module,

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.020
would not necessarily having
to download and install

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.420
a feature to module.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.460
But from an installed
app standpoint,

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.597
its the same app
at the same output.

00:14:39.597 --> 00:14:41.930
And so it's the same experience
from your installed app.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:42.679
Nothing's changed.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.310
From the user standpoint, you're
thinking about the same UI,

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:50.500
navigation, and flows.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.390
A lot of developers
ask me, "Should I just

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.160
develop a trial app?"

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.180
That is not the goal.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.540
You should not be thinking of
developing a trial Instant App.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.250
Trying back on
the music analogy,

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.320
ideally the user
doesn't know if there

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.060
in an Instant App
or installed app,

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.830
because the content is the same.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:08.140
All those rich experiences
and all those great

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.210
features that you have
in your installed app,

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.489
you want to pull over
to your Instant App.

00:15:12.489 --> 00:15:14.530
And it's really important,
because if a user ever

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:17.080
goes from your Instant
App to your installed app,

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.689
you want as little
relearning as possible.

00:15:19.689 --> 00:15:20.980
There's no on-boarding process.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:24.010
The user already knows
what this app does and they

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.580
understand all your features.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.890
And we've received a
lot of positive data

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:32.010
for Vimeo, which I think
has done a great job.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.310
They pulled all their features
into their Instant App,

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:39.190
and they're seeing that of users
coming to their experience,

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.890
they stay longer,
they go deeper,

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.360
and they get more engaged.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.677
And so they've also seen double
digit increase in engagement.

00:15:48.294 --> 00:15:49.710
The next three
sections, I'll talk

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:52.110
about what happens once
you're in an Instant App.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.090
So let's enter the app.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.880
Before you might have thought of
having one flow, because you're

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.960
downloading, let's
say, a monolithic app,

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.770
and there's only one flow
that the user can go through.

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:06.990
That's now changed
with Instant Apps.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:10.470
You've actually, now think
about side entry points

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.150
into your Instant App.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.760
So you have to think about
what that flow feels like.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.699
If someone just sends
me an URL, and I

00:16:16.699 --> 00:16:18.990
don't know exactly what the
Instant App is going to be,

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.210
and I click it, if I hit
a sign up flow, I'm like,

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:23.230
I might be surprised.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.930
I might not understand
what the actual value

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.360
proposition is for that app.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.420
So you want to think of
where across the internet

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:34.280
a user could actually
enter the app.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.170
Through text, social media, ads,
all these different mechanisms

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.170
that a user can come in.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.679
And what is the context when
they actually click that app?

00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:43.220
And you want to
account for that when

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.937
you're thinking about the flow.

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:47.520
If someone sends me a recipe, I
want to drop into that recipe.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.380
If someone sends
me a video, I want

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.610
to drop into the exact video.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.340
Search integration is also
present in Instant Apps,

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.030
so you want to think about
what happens when a user lands

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.210
into your page from a search.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.940
Here, I actually did a
search of my hometown

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.060
in Franklin, Michigan,
and you see Zillow come up

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.839
three times as an Instant App.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:14.060
So what has Zillow done?

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.280
They said, "You're
searching for this area,

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.200
you're probably
interested in a property.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.210
I'm going to make sure
my instant app dives you

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.550
into a specific property
on Sunset Drive."

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:26.660
And there are three
relevant properties for me.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.339
I click that link,
and I dive right

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:33.580
into the native app experience.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.260
Now, side entry is
important, but you're also

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.850
going to have to think
about home entry still.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.790
This was shown at the
developer keynote yesterday,

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:47.179
of actually getting to use
the Android O, integration

00:17:47.179 --> 00:17:48.970
with launcher, allows
you to launch Instant

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.630
Apps from the home screen.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:53.920
So here, you can
see I typed in NY,

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.870
it gives me a
recommendation of New York

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.950
Times crossword Instant App.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.880
I click that, or actually I
pull that onto my home screen,

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.680
and now when I click
it, it actually

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.880
dives me into the home screen
of the crossword puzzle.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.190
It doesn't dive me directly
into the crossword puzzle,

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.356
because it's thinking about
the context of the user,

00:18:11.356 --> 00:18:14.710
and I'm driving into the home
screen of that native app.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:22.540
So oftentimes, when we
think about Instant Apps,

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.437
we think about install friction.

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:26.020
But there's friction
that we're trying

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.360
to solve with Instant
Apps across the native app

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.780
experience.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.780
We want to remove all
friction points that we've

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.770
heard from developers.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:37.322
So sign in is one, where I
mentioned a few slides ago

00:18:37.322 --> 00:18:39.530
where sometimes you're asked
to sign in when you have

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:41.570
no idea what the app is about.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.970
Other times, with
purchasing, you

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.770
might not have a
credit card around,

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.590
and yet you still
want to purchase.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.080
How can we remove those
friction points from apps?

00:18:55.050 --> 00:19:00.630
So, as I mentioned
before sign in sometimes

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.780
happens upfront with monolithic,
or with installable apps,

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.474
because you've already gone
through a friction point,

00:19:06.474 --> 00:19:08.890
you know exactly the user flow
that user is going through,

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.100
so you decide to have
them sign in upfront.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.380
But when users are coming
through the side entry,

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.114
you might not want a sign
in to happen right then.

00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:18.030
So we've actually had a
number of our partners

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:23.220
who in their installed app
had mandatory sign in upfront,

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.095
had removed that, and
decided to put sign

00:19:25.095 --> 00:19:27.691
in at a point in the
flow where they felt

00:19:27.691 --> 00:19:29.940
that the user understood why
they would be signing in,

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.440
and the value of signing in.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.070
Instant Apps also
uses Smart Lock

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.630
for Android, which
allows you to continue

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:40.330
to be signed in between
Android, Chrome, and desktop.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.690
Sorry, Chrome and
Chromebooks, as well as being

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:47.115
continued to be signed in
between Instant App sessions.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.320
For purchasing, there's
digital purchasing

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.880
and physical purchasing.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.970
Digital purchasing is very
similar to what you experience,

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.970
or it's identical to what you
experience in installed app.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:01.830
There's in app billing
that you'll continue

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.697
to use with Instant Apps.

00:20:03.697 --> 00:20:05.280
For physical purchases,
we're actually

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.860
really excited to talk
about Google payment API.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.710
Some of you may have already
heard about it in the developer

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.050
keynote where
assistant mentioned it,

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.120
and there was also another
session specifically

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.520
talking about the
Google payment API.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.600
We're really excited to have
this as part of Instant Apps.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.600
So there are
hundreds of millions

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.020
of cards that Google
already has on file,

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:31.075
and when you're thinking about
a user now entering a Instant

00:20:31.075 --> 00:20:32.700
App, a lot of time
there are new users,

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.241
they might not have
a form of payment

00:20:34.241 --> 00:20:36.830
or a credit card on
file with you yet.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:40.610
But they potentially have a form
of payment on file with Google.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.570
Now they can access
that Google payment API

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.630
and access that credit card.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:50.690
Here you see that Jet is
using this Google payment API,

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:57.671
and I just click pay and
the Google Pay shows up.

00:20:57.671 --> 00:20:59.420
It already has my
credit card information,

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.044
it already has my
shipping information,

00:21:01.044 --> 00:21:04.580
and with just a few clicks I'm
already done with my purchase.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:08.027
So when I mentioned before
that Jet is seeing an increase

00:21:08.027 --> 00:21:10.610
propensity for users to purchase
when they land in the Instant

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:13.160
App, and they're seeing
these great numbers, what

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.460
I'm wondering is, how much that
is from the decreasing install

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.010
friction, and how much is it
from decreasing the payment

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.555
friction?

00:21:19.555 --> 00:21:20.930
And as we get more
and more data,

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:25.130
I'm really excited to parse that
out and really understand how

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:26.540
much value is coming from each.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.700
But right now, as
Jet has told us,

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.261
they're seeing significant
increase in purchases.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.040
I also wanted to
say, I mentioned

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.460
that we don't want you adding
additional friction points.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.460
And with our early partners,
we did a lot of testing,

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.900
we tried different stuff out.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.000
And we realized that the
thing we wanted to do

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.550
is get the user to that
action that they came

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.240
to do as quickly as possible.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.350
Some early partners
tried splash screens,

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.690
others tried a lot of
installation prompts,

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.690
and we just think getting rid
of all these friction points

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:00.861
allows for a very
smooth experience.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.060
So, the users had
this great experience

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:07.936
in their Instant App.

00:22:07.936 --> 00:22:09.560
They've really enjoyed
it, and now they

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.540
want to install for
a number of reasons,

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.450
maybe they want to
do offline usage.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:14.090
That is fine.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:16.994
We actually encourage
installation in that case.

00:22:16.994 --> 00:22:18.910
So let's talk about what
that experience looks

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.710
like when a user
chooses to install.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.060
First of all, we've actually
decreased the friction point

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.830
of installing in
the Instant App.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.470
There's this new API,
play install API,

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.810
that allows you to
install in line when

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.170
you're in an Instant App.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.440
So in this case, I'm
playing a Red Bull video,

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.960
watching some BMXer, and I
think this video is awesome,

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.590
and I really want to have
this for offline usage.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.450
So I install there,
and it allows

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:49.110
me to install online without
having to go to the Play Store.

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:50.910
What you also want to
take into account is,

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.732
copying that user information
from the Instant App

00:22:53.732 --> 00:22:56.190
to the installed app, so you
know what their, in this case,

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:58.290
their video history was,
and you can actually

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:00.840
put them right back into the
video they were watching when

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.490
they hit open installed app.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.490
Now, let's talk about the
ways that you can actually

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.110
prompt the user to install.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.960
There are two ways.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.209
The first one is
explicit installations.

00:23:12.209 --> 00:23:14.000
This means that the
user knows that they're

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.166
about to install if they
hit that button, because it

00:23:16.166 --> 00:23:17.210
says install.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:19.520
The second one is
implicit installations.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.040
These are when you click a
button in the Instant App,

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.650
and the feature might
not be available,

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:26.417
like offline viewing,
so you prompt

00:23:26.417 --> 00:23:29.000
the user, "If you'd like to use
this feature, please install."

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.860
So let's talk about
both tools that we

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.470
have for driving installation.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:36.950
The first one, as I mentioned,
is an explicit installation,

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:44.480
you include the install
string and the install icon

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.330
here, that you can see the Amber
Weather did a great job with.

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.990
And they embedded in their UI,
what is Amber Weather thinking?

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.690
Well, they want the user to get
the information that came for,

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:54.847
which is the weather.

00:23:54.847 --> 00:23:56.930
They want to show all these
great things that they

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.020
have within their app, but now
if the user wants to install,

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.270
the button is right
there, but it feels really

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.640
part of their UI.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.445
Wish does a great
job of including it

00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:08.030
in their navigation tour.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.790
It's not disruptive, and
it's very easy for the user

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:14.760
if they want to install,
to install right there.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.600
Implicit installations,
as I mentioned,

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.460
is when you click a
button in the Instant App,

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.650
and that feature is
not yet available.

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.070
Vimeo, for example,
has offline viewing,

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.792
and Yumly has some
personalized information,

00:24:27.792 --> 00:24:30.000
personalized things that
they do that they would only

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.530
like in the installed app.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:32.970
That's great, that's fine.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:36.300
So here, you see that it
prompts the user to install,

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.750
and it gives context to why
the user has to install.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.330
Again, early partners have
tried both explicit and implicit

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:43.320
installations.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.570
We just encourage you not
to make it disruptive,

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:47.910
and for the user to
really know, to be

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.680
able to do the action
they came to do.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.900
And if they choose to
continue and potentially want

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.030
to install, that you give
them an option to do so.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:01.250
So, you've built this amazing
app, this amazing Instant App,

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:03.154
that mirrors your installed app.

00:25:03.154 --> 00:25:05.070
You have thought about
all the different entry

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.660
points and the
different flows that

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.547
are important to account for.

00:25:08.547 --> 00:25:10.380
And you've thought about
decreasing friction

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.950
from identity, to
payments, to installation.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.089
So now you're ready
to track your success.

00:25:16.089 --> 00:25:17.130
What does that look like?

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.980
Well, first you need to
upload your Instant App

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.240
to the Play console.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.670
This is going to feel very
similar to your installed app.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.320
We have three different tracks.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.870
There's the development
track, the pre-release ,

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:32.344
track and the prod track.

00:25:32.344 --> 00:25:34.260
And this allows you to
do some testing upfront

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.710
and make sure that you're
ready for production.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.780
Also, the latest
update that you push

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.669
will go directly to your users.

00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:43.210
We'll serve it
directly to the users,

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.668
so if they click that URL, you
get the updated Instant App.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.352
We're also big proponents
of experimentation.

00:25:51.352 --> 00:25:53.560
So we included something
called the mobile hold-back.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.240
And we love this
idea, this allows

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.730
you to hold back a
percentage of your traffic

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.750
to go to the mobile web.

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.380
So if I put in to 0.2,
20% of your traffic

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.690
will go to the mobile web,
and 80% of your traffic

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:05.890
will go to Instant Apps.

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.620
This enables you to do
testing and experimentation.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.900
We know that you've optimized
for years and years,

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.400
your native app experience.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.290
You've optimized
your mobile website,

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:15.854
and you've optimized
your desktop.

00:26:15.854 --> 00:26:17.770
And we want to make sure
we give you the tools

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.440
to now optimize Instant Apps,
and try to make it the best

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.550
property that you can.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:27.820
So let's talk about now,
what type of metrics

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.737
you'll now be tracking
in the Instant App that

00:26:29.737 --> 00:26:31.611
might be different than
how you thought about

00:26:31.611 --> 00:26:32.710
with installed apps.

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:34.677
So I've chosen to flows up here.

00:26:34.677 --> 00:26:37.010
One is where you start in an
installed app with the Play

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.840
Store.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.050
You install your app,
you then sign up,

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:45.400
you then browse and engage with
the content of the native app,

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.140
and then potentially purchase.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.230
For Instant Apps, a few
things start to flip around.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:53.380
First you're entering the
Instant App from a URL.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.760
You're then immediately
engaged without signing up,

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.120
and you actually can
purchase without signing up

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:06.340
for the e-commerce category, and
you won't necessarily install.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.379
So you have to start
thinking about, what

00:27:08.379 --> 00:27:10.420
are different metrics that
you now track that are

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.800
important in Instant Apps.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.080
First, you probably want
a separate installed apps

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.310
and Instant Apps
when you're tracking,

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:16.700
just to see different behavior.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.580
Maybe a user who's a first
visitor for your installed app

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.714
acts differently for your first
visit for your Instant App,

00:27:22.714 --> 00:27:24.130
and that's because
you're actually

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:25.171
creating different flows.

00:27:25.171 --> 00:27:27.130
The user might be coming
through a side door,

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.370
so that user in that context
might act differently.

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:32.290
You also might now think
about signed in users

00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:34.280
versus non-signed in users.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.730
So some of our partners
only had signed in users

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.100
before, and now that they've
pulled that out or moved it

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.850
to a different point
in their Instant App,

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.150
they're going to have
non-signed in users.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:45.640
You also have to think about
URL traffic sources, which

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.870
you might not have
considered in the past.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:49.430
Now.

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:52.110
Google Analytics for
Firebase has you covered.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:56.420
We've worked for months with
Google Analytics for Firebase

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.670
to make sure that
all of these metrics

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:01.820
start to be tracked
for your Instant App.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:05.150
They are continuing to work with
us to put additional tracking

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.940
and think through different
additional complex metrics that

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.770
make sense in Instant Apps.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.330
For our early
partners, a lot of them

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.330
have actually used their
current analytics SDK.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.720
So now that we're opening
documentation today,

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.950
we were excited to talk to
more analytics providers

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:20.570
and start thinking
about more metrics

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:22.550
that we need to start
including in the SDK.

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:29.380
So, with all that these
partners have shared with me,

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.762
I've noticed actually a shift.

00:28:30.762 --> 00:28:32.470
When they first started
with Instant Apps

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:34.760
they often talked to
me about installation,

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.000
and there has been a
shift in our conversation

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.160
where we talk a lot
more about engagement.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.370
Because as I showed
in the flow before,

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.310
it used to be that in order
to see your success metrics,

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:47.140
you would have to install first.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.860
So an installation became
a proxy for success,

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.780
but we've kind of flipped that
around, and now developers are

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.300
saying, "How do I optimize
the tickets purchased?

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.700
How do I optimize
the flights found?

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:58.900
How about watch hours?

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.230
And how about time spent
reading football articles?"

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:03.900
So all of this
has changed a bit,

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.160
and we're excited to
see how you guys start

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.930
thinking about metrics
in a different way.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:14.190
So, let's recap.

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.620
First, I talked through
that anyone can now

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.000
build an Instant App.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.810
So you can go to
g.go/instantapps and download

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:23.980
the SDK and view
the documentation.

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.980
Secondly, I talked about
what the big motivation

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.290
is for partners
developing an Instant App.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.030
It's thinking about
your current users,

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.650
thinking about new
users, and thinking

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:34.097
about completely new use cases.

00:29:34.097 --> 00:29:36.180
The third thing I talked
about, is what should you

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.300
keep in mind as guiding
principles as you in parallel

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.470
do development?

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.900
Talked about one app,
different entry points,

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.180
decreasing friction
from identity,

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:49.492
to payments, to installation,
as well as new metrics.

00:29:49.492 --> 00:29:50.950
There are two talks
that I'd really

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.880
encourage you to go to today.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.620
The first one is at 3:30,
with Shobana and Anirudh

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.270
will be actually taking you
through a live Instant App

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.760
development in 40 minutes.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.250
So it's really
exciting, and I really

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.230
encourage you to learn
how they're actually

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.300
going to take an
installed app and turn it

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.010
into an Instant App.

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:12.730
Also, I've done my best to
channel the developer voice

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:14.750
from talking to all
our early partners,

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:18.100
but it's much better to hear
directly from our partners.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.810
So I encourage you to
go to Maru's talk, who's

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:24.280
the lead Developer Relations
Manager for Instant Apps,

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:29.200
and she'll have on the panel,
Castbots, Vimeo, Deliveroo,

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.790
Zillow, and
Periscope, and they'll

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.331
talk about their experience,
and you'll learn best practices.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:36.960
So, thank you everyone.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.250
I'm so glad you all came.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:42.740
I'm happy to take any questions
from you now, and also

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.752
please visit us
in sandbox Dome C,

00:30:45.752 --> 00:30:47.960
and I'll be there also to
answer additional questions

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:48.800
after the talk.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:49.550
Thank you.

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:54.050
