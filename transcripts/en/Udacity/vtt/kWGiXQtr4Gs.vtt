00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.220
The power of a protocol is bring able to
say this thing provides some features

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.040
because this thing
conforms to some protocol.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.020
Or in a verse,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.180
this thing conforms to some protocol
therefore it provides some features.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.350
This gives us the ability to
reason in a way we haven't before.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.680
Now we know if something
implements a protocol,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.470
then we can safely say it provides x,
y, and z features.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.270
And this can really simplify our
thinking for complex problems.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.080
See you in the next session.
