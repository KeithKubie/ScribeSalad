00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 The presence of God has been widely discussed for centuries 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.060
 But no matter what you feel or think it is right 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.640
 Can we use mathematics, universal language and unbiased 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.420
 Let us come to a conclusion? 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.400
 Can mathematics prove the existence of God? 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.740
 The most famous argument is the use of logic for the benefit of the universe that exists by God 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.300
 Is "the argument based on design" 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.440
 Simply put, given how amazing and wonderful it is 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.940
 Everything around us 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.900
 Can we really believe it 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.520
 That pure coincidence is the one who did it? 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.560
 Even from the perspective of the world 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.300
 Life is wonderful 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.540
 Incredibly rare 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.600
 It took a tremendous number of steps, 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.460
 Seashells, time until all this is done 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.880
 Therefore, a religious person can discuss 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.980
 Does not that seem more reasonable? 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.160
 There is a force behind all this 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.600
 This type of argument is called: 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.100
 Proof of the Back 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.840
 Which he simply tries 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.100
 Refute the argument by showing it 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.220
 It inevitably leads to something ridiculous 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.840
 Or impractical conclusions 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.460
 In this case 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.800
 It suggests: 1. If God does not exist, the evolution of mankind is unlikely 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.500
 2. Human evolved 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.840
 3. It is therefore unlikely that there is no God 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.360
 But let us look further at this logic 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.480
 And imagine the universe before there is anything 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.200
 Here, we have a basic fund 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.800
 Where we have two possibilities 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.220
 The presence of God, or lack thereof 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.520
 On the other hand we have these possibilities 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.840
 The presence or absence of human beings 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.440
 If the absence of a god is the truth 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.660
 Thus human existence depends on several factors 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.940
 So we will consider it a small possibility 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.220
 We say that there are a quarter billion billion opportunities 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.060
 For the existence of mankind 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.460
 In a world without a god 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.220
 If God is real 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.640
 Although we do not know if God will create humans 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.200
 But certainly he can 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.360
 So we will give this greater probability 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.160
 Of a quarter million 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.060
 Certainly if we test the evidence 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.880
 We can make sure we are there 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.640
 So we can get rid of the other line 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.960
 As many of you who have used the "design argument" 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.820
 In which he was human and made by God 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.640
 Seems more likely to be rational and statistical 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.060
 Although this is true in many ways 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.840
 They forget an important point 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.780
 It is our assumption that there are only two main theories 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.540
 But we know that this is not true 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.240
 Several communities believed in multiple gods 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.780
 Given that many aspects of life 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.000
 Not beautifully complicated 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.220
 Or intentionally intended 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.760
 Perhaps differences between the gods 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.680
 Find the universe 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.940
 The mathematician uses Gordon Elnberg 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.440
 The probability is 1 / 400,000 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.300
 That Kona with several gods can lead to the creation of humans 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.700
 But it is important to remember 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.260
 The exact numbers do not really matter 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.320
 What matters is that we can agree 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.240
 Logically, Kuna has several gods 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.520
 There is a greater possibility of human existence 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.080
 From being a single God 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.120
 Or no god at all 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.780
 It is also important to remember 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.300
 We do not compare prospects 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.340
 The presence or absence of a god 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.540
 We ask ourselves 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.320
 If the Deity option is true 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.820
 What is the probability of finding it for humans? 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.800
 Then we ask separately 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.840
 If the Gods option kit is correct 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.100
 What is the probability of finding them for humans? 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.680
 Now, let's take a look further 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.480
 For theories we suggest that we live in simulation 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.640
 As in "Sim" 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.320
 Which is believed by people like Elon Mask 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.900
 And Professor of Oxford Nick Bostrom 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.400
 With the advancement of technology 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.840
 The fact that humans in the future 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.680
 They will create a real simulation of humans 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.220
 Based on the world in which we live 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.460
 To study these humans as we study mice 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.320
 Scientists have used simulations 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.360
 To understand nature and human behavior 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.660
 But it is possible in the future 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.240
 That humans as subjects of experience 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.220
 They will be aware and believe they are real 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.060
 So we can give this scenario 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.740
 High probability 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.760
 Again, the exact figures do not really matter 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.020
 We agree that it is likely 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.980
 Creating such a simulation by humans in the future 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.700
 Compared to the possibility of the decision of God or gods 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.420
 To find humans randomly 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.780
 While they do not need this 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.780
 Or while they can find millions of other animals 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.540
 Or other areas of the universe 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.800
 In the end, humanity is obsessed with human beings 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.100
 So as you can see 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.780
 While mathematics can really show us 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.620
 That existence of life is evidence of the existence of God 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.920
 Compare after its existence 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.000
 The same mathematics can show us 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.400
 A guide coming from several sources that we are the product of a more sophisticated human simulation
