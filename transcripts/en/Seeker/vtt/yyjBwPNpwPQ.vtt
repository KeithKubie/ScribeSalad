00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.089
OW.

00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:07.510
Oh man, I hate it when I get a canker sore,
but its not a cold sore, is it?

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.480
Right?

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.440
Hmm.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.030
We got a question from I.S. Gomez on YouTube!

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.030
Hi!

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.840
They asked "What do we know about canker sores?"

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.540
The short answer?

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.540
Not much.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.990
I mean, doctors know what they ARE but not
why they happen.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.340
We talked about it around the DNewsroom, and
some people were confused about the difference

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.640
between cold and canker sores.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.640
They are both common, really common.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.800
In fact, most of you watching right now have
probably had one or the other!

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.149
Canker sores, or aphthous (AFF-thus) ulcers,
are grey or white sores surrounded by a red

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:46.130
inflamed area and occur ONLY INSIDE THE MOUTH
-- so on the tongue or the soft tissues on

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.440
the insides of the cheeks, lips, gums or throat.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.370
They affect about 20 percent of the population
and are not contagious; they'll usually go

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.740
away on their own in a week or two.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.230
Doctors aren't entirely sure what causes them.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.360
Cankers could come from stress, eating acidic
or spicy food, from viruses, or as a reaction

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.520
to environmental causes like... a mouth injury,
dental work, aggressive brushing, or just

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.630
biting yourself!

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.109
They've been known to appear after using certain
mouthwashes, from a lack of B12 vitamins,

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:18.619
because of smoking or menstruation, or because
of certain bacteria; there are even reports

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:26.590
that certain foods like chocolate, coffee,
nuts, cheese, or eggs can trigger cankers!

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.549
Canker sores are more common in teens or young-adults,
and more often appear in females for some

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.549
reason.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.439
They're also genetically correlated, as some
families get them more often than others.

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.030
So if you hate them, wait until you're older,
they should go away.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.990
Though people who are prone to them can sometimes
continue developing them in adulthood.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.039
So, while doctors haven't pinned down an exact
cause, they do know they have NOTHING to do

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.029
with herpes; unlike cold sores.

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:57.279
If you're getting a sore on your lips, it's
probably not a canker, but a cold sore.

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:02.100
Cold sores, or fever blisters, are a cluster
of tiny blisters caused by the herpes simplex

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.069
virus, which appear on around the lips and
then become cloudy before disappearing within

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:08.219
two weeks.

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:13.060
Cold sores usually appear because of stress;
be it emotional stress, fever, illness, injury,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.909
or exposure to sunlight.

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.030
Women can get them around the time of their
menstruation as well.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.129
Cold sores are caused by an infection of the
herpes simplex virus.

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.599
Yes, it is the same as the virus that causes
the genital varietyâ€¦ sort of.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:32.030
The cold sore one is HSV-1, and it usually
appears above the waist around the lips, while

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.819
the genital one is HSV-2 and generally appears
below the waist -- though they CAN swap.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.099
The herpes virus has been part a part of humanity
for millennia.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.370
In Ancient Rome, Emperor Tiberius banned kissing
in public to stem the spread of fever blisters

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.490
-- which didn't work obvi.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.730
According to the National Institute of Dental
and Craniofacial Research, 45 to 80 percent

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.780
of adults and children in the U.S. get cold
sores and most of them acquired the virus

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.200
before the age of 10.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.640
Two-thirds of all people infected will never
show symptoms, but, when tested, 90 percent

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.900
of adults worldwide test positive for HSV-1.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.349
Soooo, while herpes simplex CAN be spread
via sexual contact, cold sores can happen

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.870
even in a virgin; and That being said, bear
in mind that HSV-1 and HSV-2 can be spread

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.690
via intercourse or oral sex, even when there's
not an outbreak!

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.240
But you shouldn't have to be embarrassed!

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.459
There are topical and prescription drugs that
can lessen cold sore outbreaks, so you can

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:41.540
talk to your doctor if you feel you need to!
