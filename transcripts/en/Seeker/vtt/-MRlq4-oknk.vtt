00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.250
Have you heard of parents hosting MEASLES
PARTIES?

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.859
Seem pretty extreme right?

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.260
Well it turns out that’s pretty inaccurate.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.300
Hey everyone!

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.430
Julia here for Dnews.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.612
Lately there’s been so much buzz about “measles
parties.”

00:00:17.612 --> 00:00:22.610
The report seemed to originate out of Marin
County, California - near San Francisco.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.080
A mom told a local news station that another
parent approached her with an idea.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.470
Have a play date with another kid who has
the measles.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.570
This idea kicked off a media frenzy this month,
with outlets like Fox, PBS, and others reporting

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.570
on it.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.989
So why would someone deliberately infect their
kid?

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.339
The idea of a measles party is to boost a
kid’s immune system by intentionally exposing

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:43.890
them to a virus.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.749
Parents wanting to avoid vaccines, make their
healthy kids hang out with sick kids so that

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:48.840
they might catch it.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.039
The idea is that the disease is something
similar to chicken pox, mild but annoying.

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.139
Almost a rite of passage in childhood.

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:57.149
But the fact is, measles can be deadly.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.500
Thankfully, there doesn’t seem to be credible
evidence that measles parties are happening.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.100
The California Department of Public Health
(CDPH) said they do not have any information

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.229
about measles parties.

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.260
But they “strongly recommend against the
intentional exposure of children to measles,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.600
as it unnecessarily places the exposed children
at potentially grave risk and could contribute

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.200
to further spread of the outbreak.”

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.760
Pox parties on the other hand, were a real
thing.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.550
In the not too distant past, before the invention
of a vaccine, kids got chicken pox. a nasty

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.680
itchy illness which triggers painful itchy
blisters to appear on the skin.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.049
I remember how horrible it was.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.109
Taking oatmeal baths and rubbing embarrassing
cream on my arms.

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:35.500
The itching was torture.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.289
But it’s usually mild, and lasts only a
few days.

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.549
Before the days of the chickenpox vaccine,
pox parties became a thing.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.649
Get infected with the virus as a kid, deal
with it, and move on.

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.020
Getting the family sick at once might mean
less time missed at school and work.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.670
There were also rumors of a lollipop ring.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.590
Parents would get their sick kids to lick
a lollipop with the hopes that it would coat

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.320
it with the virus, then they would MAIL IT
to someone so they would give it to THEIR

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.320
kid.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.499
Now that some parents distrust vaccines, pox
parties are popular again.

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:06.999
We might remember chicken pox as just an annoying
blip in our childhood, yet before the chickenpox

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:12.300
vaccine became available there were 100 to
150 deaths from chickenpox among children

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.330
in the U.S. annually.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.170
According to a study in the journal Clinical
Infectious Diseases there’s even evidence

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.780
that kids who get chickenpox are four times
as likely to have a stroke during the six

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.540
months following infection.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.360
So the bottom line is if you want to boost
your kids immune system safely, vaccinate

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.360
them.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.580
Vaccines give a low dose or deactivated strain
of a virus to allow your body to create antibodies

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.580
against it.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.610
This way, when you come across an actual strain
of the virus, your body can fight it off,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.480
without any of the nasty side effects or complications.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.140
