00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.860
[Captions by Y Translator]
Today, we're going to
take a look at scaling up

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.240
our miniature grappling hook

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.020
using some PVC,
hanger wire, and rubber tubing.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.140
This thing can shoot up to 30 feet.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:15.260
[Music]

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.400
You may remember the tiny desktop
grappling hook that we built a while ago.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.760
Today, we're going to try and scale
that up into something a little larger.

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.329
We're going to have a hook
a little over a foot long,

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.780
and we're going to build the whole thing
out of PVC and some rubber tube,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.060
and build a grappling hook
that will launch way farther away.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.540
Here's what we've got in mind.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.840
We'll build a simple frame out of PVC,
and attach our rubber hose.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.560
Our grappling hook will be made
out of a dowel and some hanger wire,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.780
and we should be able to
launch that towing a string 30 feet away.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.680
To get started, we're going to
need some hanger wire, a dowel,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.110
couple different pieces of PVC,
and some rubber surgical tubing.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.340
First thing we want to do
is build the grappling hook itself,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.030
and that is going to be made out of
some hanger wire and a piece of dowel.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.800
We can cut our dowel off
at 1 foot long if it's too long to start,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.230
and we want to start with our
hanger wire as straight as we can.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.580
So let's cut it off near the neck,

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.780
and then just straighten
out all of the wire.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.480
[Music]

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.960
We now need to bend this wire
into our grappling hook shape,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.240
and we want three prongs that the top.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.340
It's really good at grabbing
stuff with three.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.660
So we're going to start by giving
ourself a little bit of extra wire

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.360
that will attach to the shaft of the stick,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.500
and then we'll start bending
in those hooks shapes.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:43.340
[Music]

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.560
Our wire comes up.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.720
It goes out for one spike,
out for a second spike,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.300
out for a third spike,
and then comes back down.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.120
It's got a little bit of extra wire
on here so we can trim that off.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.320
Now, of course, this isn't
holding itself together very well.

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.350
It doesn't look much
like a grappling hook.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.350
So let's modify it.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.640
We're going to use some thin bailing wire.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.700
Wrap that tightly around parts of it,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.920
and then bend the hooks
into the shape that we want.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.560
[Music]

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.360
If you really wanted extra strength
on your hook, you could double this up.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.500
Cut the same pieces
of wire out of a hanger,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.220
make it into the same shape,
attach it on top of this,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.599
and just go over all of it with
bailing wire to really reinforce it.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.400
I kind of like the single version.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.540
It's a little bit lighter weight.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.819
Still does a pretty good job.

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.500
Now, let's cut off that one
foot length from our dowel.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.840
[Music]

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.158
To attach our wire hook
onto the top of this dowel,

00:02:32.158 --> 00:02:36.160
we're now going to sand the sides down,
so it becomes a sort of tapered point.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.280
[Music]

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.500
The wedge will fit in between
the two wires, which will bend to fit

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.360
along the sides of the dowel,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.940
and then attach the whole thing using
more wire, and some tightly wound tape.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.960
When the wire is pulled tight, it really
starts to bite into the wood a little

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.900
bit, which gives it a pretty secure grip.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.520
[Music]

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.709
Now, to hold the wire in place,
and just to make it a little nicer

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.980
to hold onto, I've had times where
I've picked stuff up with this wire

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.160
on it, and ended up stabbing my finger.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.739
We're going to use some
electrical tape to cover that all.

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.380
Electrical tape is also really nice
because as it stretches,

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.840
it does a very good job
of conforming perfectly

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.540
to what you're wrapping it around.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.360
With that, the grappling hook
itself is now assembled,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.040
and it's time to start building the launcher.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.820
We've got some 1/2 inch PVC
and some 3/4 inch PVC.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.780
Most of this is going to be 3/4 inch PVC
with just a little piece of the 1/2 inch.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.660
To start off, let's cut a piece of our
1/2 inch PVC, about 3 inches long.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.940
[Music]

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.660
Next, we want to cut a piece from our
3/4 inch PVC that's about 18 inches long.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.920
[Music]

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.090
Our smaller 1/2 inch piece of PVC is
going to be attached near the end

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.400
of our 18 inch piece of 3/4 inch PVC.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.440
This piece here is going to be a guide.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.860
The grappling hook will thread down
through there, and it will keep it aimed

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.820
the direction we want as it launches out.

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.620
To attach it, there's a few different
things we're going to do,

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.379
and we're going to try
and make it pretty sturdy.

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.860
But it is important to remember
that this smaller piece is actually

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.120
not going to have any pressure put on it.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.500
The elastic band will be attached
to the bigger piece of pipe,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.859
as will the trigger,
as will pretty much everything.

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.030
So while the grappling hook is
going to be guided by this small rod,

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.780
if it's not super well attached,
it shouldn't make much difference

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.860
because nothing's going to push it off.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.700
Even though it's not super important
that it's attached really well,

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.340
I do want to make a nice connection.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.600
So first, I'm going to sand
down both sides a little bit,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.480
so we have a nice flat joining

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.540
rather than the two curved
surfaces that we have right now.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.600
Not bad.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.080
Now, we're going to use just
a little bit of some PVC glue

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.640
attach those pieces together.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.580
And then, in what is probably overkill,
we're also going to use some duct tape.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.520
[Music]

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.780
Now, that is on there, probably much
more securely than we need it to be,

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.600
but better too much than too little.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.320
Our surgical tubing is going to take
the place of what we used a rubber band

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.460
for with our miniature
grappling hook build.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.240
It's a lot the same thing.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.210
It's rubber and it's very stretchy,
and it's pretty strong stuff.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.280
So we're going to attach that on
to here, and that's going to act

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.640
as the propulsion for our grappling hook.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.660
Let's cut off a piece of our
tubing about 1 foot long.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.160
We want that to loop behind
our support piece here,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.220
and we want it to be attached to the top,

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.500
and we're just going to use
a zip tie to hold it in place there.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.380
[Music]

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.300
Take our hook.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.660
put it onto our rubber.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.740
[Music]

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.880
Launching.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.660
With the miniature grappling hook
launcher, we used a clothes pin

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.880
to hold the hook and the rubber
band back in place before we fired.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.840
A single clothespin would not have
nearly the power to hold this back.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.319
This rubber is far too stiff,
and has a lot more spring to it

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.590
than a single rubber band.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.770
So it a clothespin's not going to do it.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.520
So we're going to have
to build our own mechanism,

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.319
and we are going to make it similar
to a clothes pin, but modified slightly.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.540
This is going to be our
substitute clothespin piece.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.540
We'll cut a notch into the
bottom of the grappling hook

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:16.060
that can be gripped onto by this
portion of the wood down here,

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.340
and then we'll drill a hole into it
to act as a hinge point right about there.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.780
Let's cut this out.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:44.380
[Music]

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.460
Here's how our trigger
mechanism will work.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.660
The band will be behind the
grappling hook, pushing it forward.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.860
When we push down on the back
of this lever here,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.160
it should get shot out.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.300
We're going to use some
more hanger wire to attach

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.240
our clothespin piece to the PVC.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:22.780
[Music]

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.370
Alright.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.800
Let's see how our
trigger mechanism is working.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.919
It's now attached
with a piece of hanger wire.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.780
Let's test this outside.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.380
[Music]

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.320
Whoo.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.140
[Music]

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.040
That's a good launch.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.699
Of course, it won't launch quite as
far once there's a cord attached to it,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.120
because it will have extra weight,
and friction that it has to overcome.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.800
We're going to be using this nylon
string as the cord that attaches

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.040
to our grappling hook,

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.840
and we need a way to make
that spool off really nicely.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:56.560
So, what we're going to do is take
this plastic cone inside this thread,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.440
and use that as a spool
to wrap our cord around.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.800
[Music]

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.380
We're going to want the spool
for our thread to rest kind of below

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.360
where it's launching out of,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.780
and so, we need to build more frame,

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.520
and while we're doing that,

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.960
we're also going to build
sort of a shoulder rest for this thing

00:08:10.979 --> 00:08:15.040
so we can hold on to it, have it pressed
up against our shoulder as we fire,

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.140
make it look a little bit more professional.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.000
[Music]

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.840
Let's start with a T connection,

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.100
and then we'll go down
just enough to have a handle.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:31.240
[Music]

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.820
Turn the corner there.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.160
Let's see.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.400
Let's get a piece, maybe, 10 inches long?

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.380
[Music]

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.760
That'll be a good spot.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.040
And then we need a piece to back
this up enough that it's

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.540
pressed up against our shoulder.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.040
[Music]

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:55.040
Another small piece, and just one more
elbow to give it a sort of rounded edge.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.920
Attaching our spool to our piece of PVC.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.560
I don't I want this to
be permanently attached.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.900
I want this to be removable.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.600
So what we're going to do is drill
a hole through the cone-shaped piece,

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.106
and the PVC pipe that's just
wide enough to fit this nail in,

00:09:09.106 --> 00:09:12.280
and that nail will work as a linchpin
that keep the cone in place

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.820
when we want it there,
but we can easily remove it.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.140
[Music]

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.040
Let's take down the point of our
nail just a little bit with a file,

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.260
because we don't need it so sharp.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.020
That's better.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.700
Much less likely to stab ourselves.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.620
Now, let's take our nylon string,
measure out about 30 or 35 feet of it.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.640
Attach one end to our grappling hook,
and the other end onto our cone.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.460
[Music]

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.320
Drill another small hole into our cone.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.820
This hole is just wide enough
that we can fit the string through.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.820
[Music]

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.020
Fit that through, and add a knot.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.620
And then, in addition to the knot,

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.810
we'll use a piece of tape just to hold
it flat down in place on the inside.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.700
Really, the knot is what's
going to hold it in place,

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.680
but tape will just keep
the string where we want it.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.500
If we want, we can just carefully
wrap the cord around the cone,

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.740
trying to keep it as close together,
and neat as possible, and that will work.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.360
But there is a faster way.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:14.600
Power.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.380
I'm going to take this forstner bit,
set that down inside the cone,

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:24.800
fit the drill over that
until it's flush with the cone.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.779
Tighten it on.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.780
And the forstner bit will help provide
a little bit of grip down inside the cone.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.080
And now...

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:49.320
[Music]

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.300
We've got a cord on our grappling hook,

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.280
so I think we need to test this out again.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.420
Let's take it outside.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.340
[Music]

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.700
Not bad.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.160
One little thing you may notice
is that I had to hold this down.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.580
The pressure from it trying to escape
was enough that as soon as I let go,

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.480
it fired, and that's not what we want.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.560
So what we're going to do is take
a little bit more of this rubber tubing,

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.600
and we're going to attach
that around the trigger piece.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.339
So it holds itself pressed down.

00:11:15.339 --> 00:11:18.190
However, we didn't add that yet
because we now want to glue

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.840
all this together more permanently,
and paint it,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.940
and I didn't want to have to cut
that rubber off, and then reattach it.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.840
Time for some paint.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.560
[Music]

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.660
Random fact: Grappling hooks are
a tool used by combat engineers.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.860
After launching the hook
forward, they set off the trip

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.500
wires by pulling the hook back.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:12:03.880
[Music]

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.620
I think we are in business.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:07.520
Let's give this thing a few more tests,

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.820
including seeing what
we can grab with it.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:24.880
[Music]

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.399
Three. Two. One.

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:28.640
[Music]

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.160
It's basically a perfect shot.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:42.040
[Music]

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.680
It's so much easier than just walking
over and grabbing the bucket.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.440
The grappling hook gun
souped up to a larger size,

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.680
and don't worry, we're not done yet.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.020
We are planing the scale this up even
more to the point where we can shoot

00:12:54.029 --> 00:12:56.480
a functional grappling hook
that can hold our weight,

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.600
and climb the rope after it.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.260
Guys, that's not all.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.560
There's always more to see
here at The King of Random.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.160
The box up at the top will
transport you directly to our last video.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:03.960
You should check that out.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.520
The other box will show you what YouTube
thinks you should be watching next,

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.260
and if you aren't subscribed
to the channel yet,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.260
hit this bomb in the middle,

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.240
and that way,
you'll never miss on any videos.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.180
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.040
Talk to you then.
