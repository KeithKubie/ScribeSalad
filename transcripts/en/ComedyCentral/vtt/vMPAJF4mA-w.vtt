00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:02.535
One of my friends got gonorrhea
in his throat.

00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:04.337
What?
Yeah, got it in his throat.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.372
What, was he eating pussy
like sucking bone marrow out?

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:08.274 line:92%
Probably. Or he's sucking cock.

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:09.442 line:92%
Yeah, I was going to say.

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:10.643 line:92%
It was all over his throat.

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:12.045 line:92%
If you have it in your throat,

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.646
you got to really
convince people,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.648
"Yeah, part of my thing
is I do a lot of ...

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.083
I really do a lot
of clit sucking,

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:18.384
so I probably pulled
some stuff out."

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:19.652
He goes, "You guys don't know
how to suck?

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:21.187
You got to suck
pussies too bro."

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.556
He goes, "Yeah? Was that
before of after some guy

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.159
was knocking your tonsils
with his fucking herp dick?"

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.427 line:92%
I didn't know you were

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.329
super head
on the underground scene.

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:31.798
By the way, the fact you got it
in your throat,

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.300
I'm already impressed.
I'm not even a gay man,

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.602
but I almost want
to give you a whirl, sister.

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:38.571 line:92%
Listen, best friend.

00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:41.140
It was gross.
It looked even worse than that.

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:42.675
It was like thrush.
His tongue was all white-

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.077 line:92%
Oh, shit.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.411
He was like,
"Do you think is bad?"

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:47.247
I was like,
"Buddy, it's not good."

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.219
You were raised by a single mom.
I was.

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:54.353 line:92%
The reason we played Bee Gees,

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:59.459
is because Jay had a topic
that he thought we all ...

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:04.230
I watched the music video
for Bertie Higgins' Key Largo.

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:05.431 line:92%
Bring it out.

00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:06.566 line:92%
Do you remember that song?

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.201 line:92%
No.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:11.170
I just saw the guy
and if you asked me

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:15.341
to draw the guys
who my mom wanted to

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:20.480
and the guys that could have
fucked my mom in the '70s/'80s,

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:21.647 line:92%
this guy epitomizes that.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.815 line:92%
This is the guy?

00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:24.183 line:92%
When did your mom meet Joe?

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:25.819
What year does
your mom have until?

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:28.754
Trish is off the market
for a couple years.

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:32.225 line:92%
I was 10, so like '87, '88.

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:34.727
'87, '88. End of the Reagan
administration.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.129 line:92%
Look at this guy.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.296 line:92%
He's fantastic.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.099 line:92%
Oh, my God.

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:42.268
He's ripping a butt
in the music video?

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:43.769
Dude, I like that they filmed
this all outside

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:46.739
of a nice fucking oyster
restaurant in Florida.

00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:48.741 line:92%
It looks like the Lamp Post.

00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:52.178
Oh yeah this guy ...
He just really does.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.580 line:92%
That's a perfect mom guy.

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:56.282 line:92%
Yeah, he looks like...

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:58.451
Particularly even
a guy named Kevin

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:00.720
I think that was nailing
my mom at one point.

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:03.156
He looked like my mom's
boyfriend, Dennis.

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.458
Yeah. There is
such a nondescript-

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:06.859
I almost just gave
his last name.

00:02:06.892 --> 00:02:08.794
Did your mom have a lot
of boyfriends?

00:02:08.827 --> 00:02:10.263 line:92%
Not a lot of boyfriends,

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.497
but dated a bunch
when I was younger.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.299
That's the same.
My parents got divorced

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:16.269
when I was one
and my mom had boyfriends.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.637
She would date a guy
for few months,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.605
it wouldn't work out,
and as I got older

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:22.542
I realized anytime my mom
dumped somebody

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:24.210
or she would get dumped,
she would get upset,

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:27.446
she would want to lose weight.
I would be nine years old eating

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.715
Lean Cuisines.
It would just be

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:32.385
Lean Cuisines and Skinny Cow
ice cream bars.

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:33.553 line:92%
I was just going to say-

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:34.720 line:92%
You ate her diets?

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:36.856
Yeah. I was like,
"She's gotten dumped."

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.492
That's so funny because
I didn't realize that.

00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:41.694 line:92%
We would switch our desserts

00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:43.930
to Weight Watchers
fucking Fudgsicles,

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:48.367
and it would always switch and
it would be between boyfriends.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.902
When Nick, my stepdad
was there,

00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:52.471
fucking Ben and Jerry's
every night, baby.

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:53.572 line:92%
When I got older, as a teenager,

00:02:53.605 --> 00:02:55.608
if I was coming home
late from basketball practice

00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:57.543
and I saw two polished
off bottles

00:02:57.576 --> 00:02:59.245
of Sutter Home
white zinfandel,

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:00.613
I knew it was going
to be a problem.

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:02.915
I knew she was drinking,
talking to my aunt Eileen

00:03:02.948 --> 00:03:04.884
and it was fuck...
somebody fucked up.

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:07.587
My mom went through a super
dark period

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.725
from when I was like, fuck,
12 to 16 where it was ...

00:03:13.492 --> 00:03:14.827
My friends would go
in our garage

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.061 line:92%
and we had a recycle bin.

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:18.731
It was just one bin that you
just throw all of the plastic in

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:22.001
and there would be just
fucking handles of 175.

00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:26.505
175s of Southern Comfort,
and my friends would be like,

00:03:26.538 --> 00:03:27.873
"Damn.
Trish's getting after it."

00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:30.943
It was just her and I,
so there wasn't other people,

00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:33.312
so they were like,
"Dude, how many fucking 175s

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:36.449
does your mom go through?"
"Why do you want to run at her?"

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.384
You're looking in the bin going,
"Two, four, six, twelve."

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:40.419
Dude, swear to God one time
I did that.

00:03:40.452 --> 00:03:42.455
And that one time
I was like, "Five?"

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.724
Dude this is ...
Yeah.

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:45.958 line:92%
Three.

00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:47.326 line:92%
Single mom shit.

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:48.928 line:92%
Whose phone is that?

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.797 line:92%
It's mine. It's my dad.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.300 line:92%
Is it really? What a Gary move.

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:56.302 line:92%
Nice.

00:03:56.335 --> 00:03:57.803 line:92%
Hey dad.

00:03:57.836 --> 00:03:58.871 line:92%
Hey, what's up?

00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:03.643
'Sup? You called.
I'm on my radio show right now.

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.444 line:92%
You're on the radio.

00:04:05.477 --> 00:04:06.679 line:92%
Oh, I am?

00:04:06.712 --> 00:04:08.314 line:92%
Mm-hmm.

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:12.619
All right. Never been
on the radio before.

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:14.921 line:92%
This is a big moment.

00:04:15.587 --> 00:04:17.423
I'll give you a call
after the show.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.327
Okay, yeah.
I'm driving home from Florida.

00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:23.596 line:92%
His big Philly accent.

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.398 line:92%
Hey, what's my middle name?

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:27.700 line:92%
James.

00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:30.903
Dad, literally my middle name
is Michael.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.810
I'm going to call you
back after the show.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:42.682
That's unreal.
That's unreal, dude.

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:47.654
What the fuck ...
That's the most Gary shit.

00:04:48.387 --> 00:04:49.955
Dude the fact that we're
not called Sons of Gary.

00:04:49.988 --> 00:04:51.390 line:92%
That was wonderful.

00:04:51.423 --> 00:04:53.059 line:92%
He said it confidently.

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:57.930 line:92%
Dude. Jason James Oakerson.

00:04:57.963 --> 00:05:00.066
What are you?
A fucking gun slinger?

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.901 line:71%
Why would I not be JJ Oakerson?

00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:03.903 line:76%
I would have loved
to be JJ Oakerson.

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:06.072
Why does he not know
your middle name?

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:07.440 line:92%
That's Gary, man.

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:08.808
He hopped on
the band wagon late.

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:10.376 line:92%
That's Gary.

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:11.544 line:92%
James.

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:12.945 line:92%
That was fantastic.

00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:14.980 line:92%
That was as real as could be.

00:05:15.013 --> 00:05:16.415
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah.

00:05:16.448 --> 00:05:17.783
I didn't even know
my phone was going.

00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:18.851
I mean, I felt
the phone going off.

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:21.587
Pull a Ouija board out.
I want to contact my Gary.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.824
We should take our second break
here and when we come back,

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:28.928
let's put it out to the callers.
Think of musicians of the time,

00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:30.863
because Chris, you said you have
a few you could think of.

00:05:30.896 --> 00:05:33.666
I have a few and I have a couple
of non-musicians too.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.535
Dude, I know
an original Colorado

00:05:36.568 --> 00:05:39.638
Rockies outfielder
that my mom would talk

00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:41.140
about how bad
she wanted to do him.

00:05:41.173 --> 00:05:42.274
I know an old
Phoenix Sun's coach.

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:45.444
To the point where we would be
watching baseball games

00:05:45.477 --> 00:05:47.380
and I'd be like,
"Hey, leave it alone lady."

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:48.748
Why do you want to blow
Dante Bichette?

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:49.949 line:92%
Dude, that's it!

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:51.117
Are you serious?
Yeah.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.518
Yo, our moms
did the same people.

00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:53.719
My mom too.
Did she really?

00:05:53.752 --> 00:05:54.553 line:92%
Holy shit.

00:05:54.586 --> 00:05:55.187
My mom was super
into Dante Bichette.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.856 line:92%
We had the same childhood.

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.025
Oh man, my mom was like,
"I like his butt."

00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:01.594 line:92%
That's our age difference.

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:03.696
My mom wanted to bang Chico
from Sha Na Na.

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.065
Well, we'll figure out
more dudes for our ladies,

00:06:06.098 --> 00:06:07.867 line:92%
because our dads ain't here

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.535
and they don't know
our middle names.

00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:13.005 line:92%
That was James and he said it-

00:06:13.038 --> 00:06:15.474
I would have bet
a bazillion dollars-

00:06:15.507 --> 00:06:16.776
I thought he knew
your middle name.

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:17.910 line:92%
Me, too.

00:06:17.943 --> 00:06:19.512 line:92%
He did call Isabella Elizabeth.

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:22.047
And he said it so confident
and he enunciated it.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.450
James.
It's so wrong.

00:06:24.483 --> 00:06:26.485
By the way, what's hilarious
is that

00:06:26.518 --> 00:06:28.587 line:92%
is my brother's middle name.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.822 line:92%
Middle name.

00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:31.023 line:92%
Yeah. But that's funny as hell.

00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:32.858
It's just funny.
It's just, come on.

00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:34.093 line:92%
As a son of a Gary-

00:06:34.126 --> 00:06:35.494 line:92%
What's my middle name, fast?

00:06:35.527 --> 00:06:37.463 line:92%
He goes ... That's so funny.

00:06:37.496 --> 00:06:39.064 line:92%
James?

00:06:39.097 --> 00:06:41.167
Because I guarantee you,
if my dad was still alive,

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.568
and I'd press him
for my birthday,

00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:43.736 line:92%
he would have fucked that up.

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:44.737
If I'd go, "Dad,
when's my birthday?"

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.473
He'd be like, "J-J-June 20th."
It's June 24th.

00:06:49.141 --> 00:06:50.643
Because he did that,
my dad did that

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:52.578
when he missed
a birthday one year.

00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:54.947
It was mid-July
and I was like,

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.782
"Dad, I never got
a birthday card."

00:06:56.815 --> 00:06:58.517 line:78%
He goes, "What?

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.986
I sent one on your birthday,
back on your birthday."

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:02.655
I was like, "On my birthday?
What day?"

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:04.523 line:92%
And he was like, "June 20th."

00:07:04.556 --> 00:07:05.724 line:92%
Day of. Yeah.

00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:08.093
I was like, "My birthday's
June 24th." He's like, "I know."

00:07:08.126 --> 00:07:09.795
I sent it on the 24th.
I sent it on the 20th.

00:07:09.828 --> 00:07:10.996
That's what
he was saying.

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:12.164 line:92%
Stupid.

00:07:12.197 --> 00:07:13.132 line:92%
He tried to do that, but I mean,

00:07:13.165 --> 00:07:15.000
we got your dad dead
to rights on that one.

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:16.202 line:92%
Dude that was-

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:17.570 line:92%
That was classic-

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:19.705
That's a trip to the toy store
for sure,

00:07:19.738 --> 00:07:21.073
if you're holding this
over your dad.

00:07:21.106 --> 00:07:22.107 line:92%
Then we got to tell your mom.

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:23.776
I don't even know.
Do I have to go to therapy?

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:25.144 line:92%
Do you want me to hug you?

00:07:25.177 --> 00:07:27.646
Let's do it. Let's take a break,
and then what?

00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:30.816
844-COMEDY9 is the number
if you want to call

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:34.620
and tell us who you think what,
I guess celebrity, musician,

00:07:34.653 --> 00:07:36.722
whatever you think,
would bang your mom.

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:38.057 line:92%
Who could bang your mom?

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.592
That's a fun, new game
on the Bonfire.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.694
We're hanging out
with Chris DiStefano.

00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:43.128
I mean we're rolling Bee
Gees music all day.

00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:45.130
I mean all three of those
could have fucking dorked

00:07:45.163 --> 00:07:46.999 line:92%
my mom down for sure.

00:07:47.032 --> 00:07:49.268
Let's see if we can get
a trifecta, because right now

00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:53.138
Dante Bichette goes two ways,
but doesn't reach old Tar-bear.

00:07:53.171 --> 00:07:55.741
No. She doesn't know
who Dante Bichette is.

00:07:55.774 --> 00:07:57.576
He's a good looking guy
with this long hair-

00:07:57.609 --> 00:07:59.078
Thick butt, too.
Big, thick butt.

00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:00.546
You got a size 38 waist,
the special.

00:08:00.579 --> 00:08:01.714 line:92%
You got a thick butt, right?

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:02.882 line:92%
Yep, so did my dad.

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:04.750
That's what my mom's into,
thick butts.

00:08:04.783 --> 00:08:05.985 line:92%
Jay and I have no butts.

00:08:06.018 --> 00:08:09.121
We'll talk about it
when we get back.
