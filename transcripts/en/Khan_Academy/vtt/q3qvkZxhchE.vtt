00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.232
- [Voiceover] We've already
taken definite integrals

00:00:02.232 --> 00:00:05.354
and we've seen how they
represent or denote

00:00:05.354 --> 00:00:08.825
the area under a function
between two points

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:11.143
and above the X axis.

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:13.065
But let's do something interesting.

00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:18.065
Let's think about a definite
integral of F of X DX,

00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:21.032
It's the area under the curve,
F of X, but instead of it

00:00:21.032 --> 00:00:23.768
being mean between two different X values,

00:00:23.768 --> 00:00:26.330
say A and B like we see in multiple times,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.185
let's say it's between the same one.

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:30.841
Let's say it's between C and C.

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.938
Let's say C is right over here.

00:00:32.938 --> 00:00:35.241
What do you think this
thing right over here

00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:36.922
is going to be equal to?

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:37.977
What does this represent?

00:00:37.977 --> 00:00:39.096
What is this equal to?

00:00:39.096 --> 00:00:39.841
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:42.370
and try to think about it.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.836
Well if you try to visualize
it, you're thinking,

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:48.339
well the area under the curve F of X,

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.339
above the X axis, from X
equals C to X equals C.

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.972
So this region, I guess we could call it,

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:57.874
that we think about
it, does have a height.

00:00:57.874 --> 00:01:00.962
The height here is F of C.

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:03.363
What's the width?

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:06.611
Well there is no width,
we're just at a single point.

00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:10.419
We're not going from C
to C plus some delta X

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:14.881
or C plus some even very small change in X

00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:18.752
or C plus some other very small a value.

00:01:18.752 --> 00:01:20.688
We're just, saying at the point C.

00:01:20.688 --> 00:01:25.688
When we're thinking
about area we're thinking

00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:29.356
about how much two-dimensional
space you're taking up.

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:33.364
But this idea, this is
just a one-dimensional,

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:35.453
I think you could think
of it as a line segment.

00:01:35.453 --> 00:01:37.694
What's the area of a line segment?

00:01:37.694 --> 00:01:39.900
Well a line segment has no area.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.503
So this thing right over here

00:01:41.565 --> 00:01:45.122
is going to be equal to zero.

00:01:45.122 --> 00:01:47.360
Now you might say, I get that.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.705
I see why that could make sense,

00:01:48.705 --> 00:01:50.680
why that makes intuitive sense.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.720
I'm trying to find the area of a rectangle

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.825
where I know it's height,
but it's width is zero.

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:58.777
So that areas going to be zero

00:01:58.777 --> 00:02:00.585
is one way to think about it.

00:02:00.585 --> 00:02:04.281
But Sal, why are you even
pointing this out to me?

00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:06.537
As well see, especially
when we do more complex

00:02:06.537 --> 00:02:10.264
definite integration
problems and solving things

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.113
sometimes recognizing this will help you

00:02:15.113 --> 00:02:20.113
simplify an integration
problem dramatically.

00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:22.888
Or you could work to be able
to get to a point like this

00:02:22.888 --> 00:02:24.392
so that you can cancel things out.

00:02:24.392 --> 00:02:26.409
Or you can say, hey that
thing right over there

00:02:26.535 --> 00:02:30.349
is just going to be equal to zero.
