six<00:18:51.320><c> by</c><00:18:51.470><c> six</c><00:18:51.770><c> squares</c><00:18:52.130><c> was</c><00:18:52.460><c> what</c><00:18:52.610><c> we</c><00:18:52.730><c> use</c><00:18:52.910><c> for</c>

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:52.940 align:start position:0%
six by six squares was what we use for
 

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
six by six squares was what we use for
the<00:18:53.179><c> bigger</c><00:18:53.360><c> flowers</c><00:18:53.780><c> five</c><00:18:54.110><c> by</c><00:18:54.290><c> five</c><00:18:54.500><c> or</c><00:18:54.770><c> four</c>

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:55.010 align:start position:0%
the bigger flowers five by five or four
 

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.370 align:start position:0%
the bigger flowers five by five or four
by<00:18:55.160><c> four</c><00:18:55.429><c> for</c><00:18:55.669><c> some</c><00:18:55.820><c> of</c><00:18:55.880><c> the</c><00:18:55.970><c> smaller</c><00:18:56.210><c> ones</c><00:18:56.380><c> so</c>

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:57.380 align:start position:0%
by four for some of the smaller ones so
 

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.169 align:start position:0%
by four for some of the smaller ones so
just<00:18:57.890><c> cut</c><00:18:58.040><c> them</c><00:18:58.130><c> into</c><00:18:58.250><c> squares</c><00:18:58.400><c> like</c><00:18:58.730><c> this</c><00:18:58.940><c> and</c>

00:18:59.169 --> 00:18:59.179 align:start position:0%
just cut them into squares like this and
 

00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:00.940 align:start position:0%
just cut them into squares like this and
then<00:18:59.570><c> you</c><00:18:59.660><c> got</c><00:18:59.780><c> to</c><00:18:59.870><c> fold</c><00:19:00.080><c> the</c><00:19:00.230><c> square</c><00:19:00.410><c> three</c>

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:00.950 align:start position:0%
then you got to fold the square three
 

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:05.830 align:start position:0%
then you got to fold the square three
times<00:19:01.870><c> so</c><00:19:02.870><c> if</c><00:19:03.290><c> this</c><00:19:03.650><c> was</c><00:19:03.890><c> my</c><00:19:04.040><c> square</c><00:19:04.370><c> I</c><00:19:05.179><c> could</c>

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
times so if this was my square I could
 

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:10.270 align:start position:0%
times so if this was my square I could
go<00:19:05.990><c> one</c><00:19:07.510><c> two</c><00:19:08.510><c> and</c><00:19:08.960><c> then</c><00:19:09.320><c> three</c><00:19:09.380><c> so</c><00:19:10.010><c> you</c><00:19:10.070><c> get</c><00:19:10.250><c> a</c>

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
go one two and then three so you get a
 

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.039 align:start position:0%
go one two and then three so you get a
little<00:19:10.400><c> triangle</c><00:19:10.850><c> like</c><00:19:11.059><c> this</c><00:19:11.090><c> keep</c><00:19:11.840><c> the</c>

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:12.049 align:start position:0%
little triangle like this keep the
 

00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:14.530 align:start position:0%
little triangle like this keep the

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:14.540 align:start position:0%
folded point at the bottom then you have
 

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.900 align:start position:0%
folded point at the bottom then you have
to<00:19:14.660><c> cut</c><00:19:14.870><c> it</c><00:19:15.020><c> into</c><00:19:15.260><c> a</c><00:19:15.410><c> petal</c><00:19:15.650><c> form</c><00:19:16.040><c> since</c><00:19:16.610><c> we</c><00:19:16.760><c> had</c>

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:16.910 align:start position:0%
to cut it into a petal form since we had
 

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.780 align:start position:0%
to cut it into a petal form since we had
to<00:19:17.000><c> make</c><00:19:17.150><c> a</c><00:19:17.299><c> ton</c><00:19:17.660><c> of</c><00:19:17.690><c> them</c><00:19:18.049><c> we</c><00:19:18.260><c> actually</c><00:19:18.679><c> had</c><00:19:19.400><c> a</c>

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:19.790 align:start position:0%
to make a ton of them we actually had a
 

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.690 align:start position:0%
to make a ton of them we actually had a

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:22.700 align:start position:0%
little mold here to use you're gonna
 

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.310 align:start position:0%
little mold here to use you're gonna
have<00:19:22.850><c> to</c><00:19:22.940><c> cut</c><00:19:23.150><c> off</c><00:19:23.270><c> a</c><00:19:23.480><c> little</c><00:19:23.540><c> bit</c><00:19:23.900><c> of</c><00:19:24.020><c> the</c><00:19:24.110><c> tip</c>

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
have to cut off a little bit of the tip
 

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.310 align:start position:0%
have to cut off a little bit of the tip
there<00:19:24.790><c> no</c><00:19:25.790><c> problem</c><00:19:26.330><c> because</c><00:19:26.870><c> it</c><00:19:27.110><c> is</c><00:19:27.140><c> gonna</c>

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.320 align:start position:0%
there no problem because it is gonna
 

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.530 align:start position:0%
there no problem because it is gonna
have<00:19:27.530><c> to</c><00:19:27.559><c> nestle</c><00:19:28.010><c> inside</c><00:19:28.370><c> itself</c><00:19:28.700><c> and</c><00:19:29.000><c> then</c>

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:29.540 align:start position:0%
have to nestle inside itself and then
 

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
have to nestle inside itself and then
just<00:19:29.809><c> kind</c><00:19:29.990><c> of</c><00:19:30.080><c> get</c><00:19:30.260><c> yourself</c><00:19:30.350><c> a</c><00:19:30.710><c> petal</c><00:19:31.130><c> shape</c>

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:32.470 align:start position:0%
just kind of get yourself a petal shape
 

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.650 align:start position:0%
just kind of get yourself a petal shape
it<00:19:33.470><c> helps</c><00:19:34.280><c> to</c><00:19:34.760><c> give</c><00:19:34.940><c> yourself</c><00:19:35.330><c> a</c><00:19:35.390><c> little</c><00:19:35.419><c> bit</c>

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:35.660 align:start position:0%
it helps to give yourself a little bit
 

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
it helps to give yourself a little bit
of<00:19:35.780><c> leeway</c><00:19:36.370><c> because</c><00:19:37.370><c> you're</c><00:19:37.520><c> gonna</c><00:19:37.669><c> fold</c><00:19:37.880><c> them</c>

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:38.090 align:start position:0%
of leeway because you're gonna fold them
 

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.870 align:start position:0%
of leeway because you're gonna fold them
over<00:19:38.419><c> because</c><00:19:38.809><c> petals</c><00:19:39.470><c> are</c><00:19:39.830><c> not</c><00:19:40.250><c> straight</c><00:19:40.669><c> in</c>

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
one right here it'll look like that to
 

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.930 align:start position:0%
one right here it'll look like that to
make<00:19:50.360><c> one</c><00:19:50.690><c> flower</c><00:19:50.960><c> you</c><00:19:51.350><c> need</c><00:19:51.530><c> three</c><00:19:52.190><c> of</c><00:19:52.460><c> these</c>

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:52.940 align:start position:0%
make one flower you need three of these
 

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
make one flower you need three of these
so<00:19:53.510><c> at</c><00:19:53.870><c> the</c><00:19:54.020><c> end</c><00:19:54.169><c> when</c><00:19:54.860><c> you</c><00:19:54.919><c> open</c><00:19:55.190><c> it</c><00:19:55.309><c> up</c><00:19:55.429><c> it'll</c>

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:55.850 align:start position:0%
so at the end when you open it up it'll
 

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:58.930 align:start position:0%
so at the end when you open it up it'll

00:19:58.930 --> 00:19:58.940 align:start position:0%
look like this basic flower template
 

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.900 align:start position:0%
look like this basic flower template
there<00:19:59.120><c> you</c><00:19:59.809><c> need</c><00:19:59.960><c> three</c><00:20:00.320><c> of</c><00:20:00.440><c> them</c><00:20:00.620><c> so</c><00:20:01.250><c> on</c><00:20:01.490><c> one</c>

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:01.910 align:start position:0%
there you need three of them so on one
 

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
there you need three of them so on one
of<00:20:01.940><c> them</c><00:20:02.510><c> you</c><00:20:02.809><c> cut</c><00:20:03.200><c> out</c><00:20:03.350><c> one</c><00:20:03.950><c> petal</c><00:20:04.429><c> so</c><00:20:04.940><c> now</c>

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:05.090 align:start position:0%
of them you cut out one petal so now
 

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.850 align:start position:0%
of them you cut out one petal so now
I've<00:20:05.210><c> got</c><00:20:05.390><c> one</c><00:20:05.600><c> petal</c><00:20:05.960><c> cut</c><00:20:06.169><c> out</c><00:20:06.290><c> of</c><00:20:06.470><c> that</c><00:20:06.620><c> one</c>

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:06.860 align:start position:0%
I've got one petal cut out of that one
 

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.060 align:start position:0%
I've got one petal cut out of that one
there<00:20:07.700><c> on</c><00:20:08.240><c> another</c><00:20:08.720><c> one</c><00:20:09.110><c> which</c><00:20:09.770><c> I've</c><00:20:09.950><c> already</c>

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:10.070 align:start position:0%
there on another one which I've already
 

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.090 align:start position:0%
there on another one which I've already
done<00:20:10.190><c> you'll</c><00:20:10.760><c> cut</c><00:20:11.000><c> out</c><00:20:11.150><c> two</c><00:20:11.960><c> petals</c><00:20:12.320><c> and</c><00:20:12.890><c> then</c>

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:13.100 align:start position:0%
done you'll cut out two petals and then
 

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.070 align:start position:0%
done you'll cut out two petals and then
guess<00:20:13.340><c> what</c><00:20:13.429><c> on</c><00:20:13.820><c> the</c><00:20:14.240><c> third</c><00:20:14.450><c> one</c><00:20:14.630><c> you'll</c><00:20:14.870><c> cut</c>

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
guess what on the third one you'll cut
 

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.100 align:start position:0%
guess what on the third one you'll cut
out<00:20:15.490><c> three</c><00:20:16.490><c> petals</c><00:20:17.090><c> so</c><00:20:17.360><c> it's</c><00:20:17.540><c> not</c><00:20:17.720><c> that</c><00:20:17.780><c> hard</c>

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:18.110 align:start position:0%
out three petals so it's not that hard
 

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:22.150 align:start position:0%
out three petals so it's not that hard
okay<00:20:19.240><c> with</c><00:20:20.240><c> the</c><00:20:20.390><c> bigger</c><00:20:20.630><c> ones</c><00:20:20.990><c> you</c><00:20:21.590><c> have</c><00:20:21.830><c> to</c>

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
okay with the bigger ones you have to
 

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.820 align:start position:0%
okay with the bigger ones you have to
take<00:20:22.640><c> the</c><00:20:22.790><c> hot</c><00:20:22.970><c> glue</c><00:20:23.330><c> and</c><00:20:23.660><c> just</c><00:20:24.290><c> make</c><00:20:24.470><c> it</c><00:20:24.500><c> into</c>

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:24.830 align:start position:0%
take the hot glue and just make it into
 

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.590 align:start position:0%
take the hot glue and just make it into
a<00:20:24.860><c> circle</c><00:20:25.250><c> basically</c>

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
a circle basically

00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:58.850 align:start position:0%
together almost like a puzzle so if I
 

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.730 align:start position:0%
together almost like a puzzle so if I
put<00:20:59.090><c> it</c><00:20:59.179><c> like</c><00:20:59.330><c> that</c><00:20:59.510><c> and</c><00:20:59.870><c> that</c><00:20:59.929><c> and</c><00:21:00.530><c> I'm</c><00:21:00.590><c> gonna</c>

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:00.740 align:start position:0%
put it like that and that and I'm gonna
 

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:05.470 align:start position:0%
put it like that and that and I'm gonna
glue<00:21:00.980><c> it</c><00:21:01.070><c> like</c><00:21:01.190><c> that</c><00:21:01.960><c> so</c><00:21:02.960><c> it's</c><00:21:03.140><c> still</c><00:21:04.480><c> similar</c>

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
glue it like that so it's still similar
 

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.850 align:start position:0%
glue it like that so it's still similar
to<00:21:05.929><c> what</c><00:21:06.049><c> you've</c><00:21:06.169><c> been</c><00:21:06.200><c> doing</c><00:21:06.620><c> with</c><00:21:06.710><c> the</c>

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
bigger ones but not quite so it almost
 

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.020 align:start position:0%
bigger ones but not quite so it almost
looks<00:21:09.289><c> like</c><00:21:09.470><c> the</c><00:21:09.710><c> folded</c><00:21:10.039><c> up</c><00:21:10.130><c> pedal</c><00:21:10.429><c> when</c><00:21:10.940><c> you</c>

looks like the folded up pedal when you
 

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.870 align:start position:0%
looks like the folded up pedal when you

00:21:28.779 --> 00:21:28.789 align:start position:0%
gonna kind of roll it up tight cuz this
 

00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:30.490 align:start position:0%
gonna kind of roll it up tight cuz this
is<00:21:28.940><c> your</c><00:21:29.090><c> Center</c><00:21:29.450><c> this</c><00:21:29.809><c> is</c><00:21:29.900><c> your</c><00:21:29.990><c> center</c><00:21:30.320><c> piece</c>

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:30.500 align:start position:0%
is your Center this is your center piece
 

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.190 align:start position:0%
is your Center this is your center piece
so<00:21:31.340><c> if</c><00:21:31.460><c> I</c><00:21:31.520><c> roll</c><00:21:31.730><c> it</c><00:21:31.880><c> up</c><00:21:31.970><c> tight</c><00:21:32.240><c> kind</c><00:21:32.990><c> of</c><00:21:33.080><c> like</c>

so if I roll it up tight kind of like
 

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
so if I roll it up tight kind of like
rolling<00:21:33.380><c> a</c><00:21:33.559><c> cigarette</c><00:21:33.740><c> not</c><00:21:34.700><c> that</c><00:21:34.850><c> I</c><00:21:34.880><c> know</c>

easier<00:21:40.549><c> to</c><00:21:40.850><c> put</c><00:21:41.059><c> the</c><00:21:41.179><c> glue</c><00:21:41.480><c> just</c><00:21:41.929><c> on</c><00:21:42.169><c> the</c><00:21:42.350><c> edge</c>

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:42.500 align:start position:0%
easier to put the glue just on the edge
 

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.940 align:start position:0%
easier to put the glue just on the edge
it's<00:21:43.429><c> also</c><00:21:43.760><c> easier</c><00:21:44.360><c> to</c><00:21:44.539><c> use</c><00:21:44.750><c> a</c><00:21:44.780><c> low</c><00:21:45.230><c> temp</c><00:21:45.679><c> if</c>

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:45.950 align:start position:0%
it's also easier to use a low temp if
 

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
it's also easier to use a low temp if
you<00:21:46.370><c> have</c><00:21:46.549><c> that</c><00:21:46.730><c> option</c><00:21:47.059><c> a</c><00:21:47.480><c> low</c><00:21:47.840><c> temp</c><00:21:48.200><c> hot</c><00:21:48.409><c> glue</c>

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:48.650 align:start position:0%
you have that option a low temp hot glue
 

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.770 align:start position:0%
you have that option a low temp hot glue
