00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.490
We are less than 20 years away from putting
the power of the sun on the back of a truck.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:19.540
Just, keep Dr. Octo away from it this time,
mmkay?

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.310
What we call, "nuclear power" today is really
nuclear fission.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.250
Fission involves splitting heavy isotopes
of uranium or plutonium resulting in radioactive,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.250
unstable elements.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.500
It's the same as a nuclear bomb, except we're
harnessing the energy.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.870
We can do better!

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.010
Fusion power, takes isotopes of hydrogen and
fuses them to create helium.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.739
Fusion power is the promise of the future!

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.159
It's what our sun uses to keep alight and
humans have been working to create fusion

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:45.409
for 60 years.

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:50.100
Now, this week, a secret project at Lockheed's
Advanced Development Program called Skunk

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.489
Works believes they may have solved the riddle…
and could have a working model in FIVE YEARS.

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.739
Most fusion plans involve a Tokamak toroidal
plasma confinement system, I talked about

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.489
one such reactor plan a year ago, check it
out.

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.770
The standard model is a torus chamber lined
with powerful electromagnets.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.010
Torus is a shape… like a… doughnut.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.230
Only the traditional designs are in excess
of 5000 TONS and as huge as a building.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.470
A coalition of countries is working on one
in Europe now, slated to open in 2019.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.930
But Lockheed's little beauty is supposedly
only 10 meters by seven meters.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.330
That's big-rig sized!

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.940
Fusion reactions work by turning isotopes
of hydrogen into s superheated plasma of ions

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.991
and electrons inside of a torus chamber lined
with SUPER powerful electromagnets.

00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:43.630
The electromagnets are there to keep the hot
plasma from touching the walls, because if

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.840
they do, the heat will flow from the plasma
into the walls of the torus and it won't work.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.840
Once the reactor gets the plasma hot enough
-- hundreds of millions of degrees -- the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.030
ions will overcome their electrically charged
repulsion and smash into each other, fusing

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.800
and releasing MASSIVE amounts of energy with
little radioactive waste.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.310
The U.S. Department of Energy says if we can
figure this out, the energy in 6 liters of

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.290
water will be equal to one TON of coal.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.510
Lockheed says their compact reactor will be
ready for military use in 10 years, and personal

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.650
use in 20, with no worries about nuclear proliferation
(because fusion doesn't need bomb style materials)

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.150
and will be compact enough to ship anywhere
and everywhere… but critics are… well

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.300
critical, or skeptical… both.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.050
They say they've done 200 firings of the reactor,
and the lead researcher at Skunk Works said

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.270
that "it looks like it's doing what it's supposed
to do," but no one else, as of yet, has been

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.370
shown any data.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.650
Needless to say, without proof, things smell
a little off.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.970
If this DOES work and Lockheed Martin can
finally created a stable fusion reaction,

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.770
then the world will be forever changed.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.180
In the next 50 years, we could see virtually
unlimited energy for everyone who needed it

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.990
and if it's compact enough, airplanes, ships,
cars and spacecraft that could fly with zero

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.380
emissions for months or years at a time.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.020
It could mean the end of fossil fuel pollution
and mining.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.210
And if the energy is as abundant as some fusion
models predict, wireless power could be realized…

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.740
Which makes me think of the Protoss… you
must construct additional pylons.[a]

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.410
If you want to jump on the energy revolution
then you're going to need a website for your

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.410
energy business.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.060
