1
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.010
All right,

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.850
so this was the definition we saw at the end last time after I'd read it a bit

3
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:09.480
larger,
I just repeats the second of those definitions.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.540
This is the definition that can mix the notion of evolutionary stability for now

5
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:17.660
in pure strategies with Nash equilibrium.

6
00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:21.840
And basically it says this to check whether this strategy is evolutionary stable

7
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:22.950
in pure strategies.

8
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.780
First check weather s hat s hat is a symmetric Nash equilibrium.

9
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.490
And if it is,
if it's a strict Nash equilibrium,
we're done.

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.030
And if it's not straight,
it's,

11
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.560
that means there's at least another strategy that would tie with asthat against

12
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:40.394
us hat.

13
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.470
Then compare how s hat does against this mutation with how the mutation does

14
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:47.190
against itself.

15
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.330
And if s hat does better than limitation than limitation does against itself,

16
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.340
then we're okay.
All right.

17
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.430
And one virtue of this definition is it's very easy to check.

18
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.300
All right,
so let's,
let's try an example to see that

19
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.940
and also to get us back into gear and reminding ourselves what we're doing a
bit.

20
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.200
All right.
So in this zone,
Paul,
just sort of trivial game,

21
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.620
but still game looks like this.

22
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.020
<v 1>All right.</v>

23
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.060
<v 0>And what asked,
those were asked the question,
what is evolution?</v>

24
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:25.920
Realist stable in this game?

25
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.450
So no prizes for finding the symmetric Nash Equilibrium in this game.

26
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.040
Shouted out what?
The symmetric Nash Equilibrium in this game.
Hey.
Okay.

27
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:39.780
So Aa ae is estimate trick,

28
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:44.440
Nash Equilibrium.
It's easy to check.

29
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.500
So really the only candidates for an evolutionary stable strategy here is a,

30
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.070
alright,
so the second thing,
that's second thing you would check is,

31
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.970
is a strict nash equilibrium.

32
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.930
So what does strict Nash equilibrium means?
It means that if you,

33
00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:06.280
if you deviate,
you do strictly worse.

34
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.180
All right.
