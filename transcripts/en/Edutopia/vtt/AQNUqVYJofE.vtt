00:00:08.906 --> 00:00:11.086
&gt;&gt;In the United States
now, we're talking a lot

00:00:11.086 --> 00:00:13.236
about international competition,

00:00:13.236 --> 00:00:15.946
internationally benchmarked
standards and so on.

00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:20.906
And I wanted to see what is actually
happening in terms of teaching

00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:22.766
and learning in other countries.

00:00:23.076 --> 00:00:25.766
So I've looked at a lot of
high-achieving countries,

00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:28.356
and it became very
clear to me right away

00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:32.076
that the issue is not just the
standards that are written on paper.

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:36.566
It's the entire teaching and
learning system that is created

00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:40.766
in high-achieving countries like
Finland and Singapore, Australia,

00:00:40.796 --> 00:00:44.166
Canada, Hong Kong and
others, that is very different

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.526
from what we have in
the United States.

00:00:46.886 --> 00:00:49.106
So we have a number of
international assessments,

00:00:49.176 --> 00:00:53.466
and the one that is most
referenced is the Program

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.506
and International Student Assessment,
which goes by the name PISA.

00:00:57.256 --> 00:01:01.526
And on PISA, the United States
scores or ranks thirty-fifth

00:01:01.526 --> 00:01:03.406
out of the top forty
countries in math.

00:01:04.236 --> 00:01:07.756
We rank twenty-ninth out of the
top forty countries in science.

00:01:08.306 --> 00:01:10.386
But we typically do a little
bit better in reading.

00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:14.026
However, we've gone down on
the international assessments

00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:16.436
in reading each year
that it's been given.

00:01:16.956 --> 00:01:20.426
And we've gone down on the math
and science assessments as well.

00:01:21.076 --> 00:01:22.516
So we're losing ground.

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:28.476
And while we're pushing scores upward
on the state tests that we use here,

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:31.876
I think the reason we're
falling down on PISA is

00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:35.006
that PISA actually addresses
higher-order thinking

00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:35.916
and performance skills.

00:01:36.746 --> 00:01:40.636
In high-achieving countries, they
have school-based assessments,

00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:44.076
as well as external assessments
that are brought together

00:01:44.076 --> 00:01:49.276
in the accountability system,
that include things like research

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:52.736
and inquiry, scientific
investigations, extensive writing.

00:01:53.156 --> 00:01:56.076
Most of these countries do not
use multiple-choice testing

00:01:56.496 --> 00:01:59.116
to any great degree;
some don't use it at all.

00:01:59.506 --> 00:02:04.086
Kids are always having to write,
analyze, explain their views,

00:02:04.346 --> 00:02:10.086
produce data, analyze data, both in
the classroom and on the assessments.

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:15.836
And so we need to point our system
at these higher-order thinking

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:18.056
and performance skills,
if we're really going

00:02:18.056 --> 00:02:19.406
to be internationally competitive.

00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:25.146
So what you see in high-achieving
countries is typically a very lean

00:02:25.146 --> 00:02:26.056
set of standards.

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:31.136
In Finland, or Japan, for example,
all of the math standards can fit

00:02:31.136 --> 00:02:34.486
in about ten pages from K-12.

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:38.836
They are very clear about what
needs to be taught, and when

00:02:38.836 --> 00:02:42.486
and how it builds over time, but
they're not overly prescriptive.

00:02:43.046 --> 00:02:45.246
By comparison, in the United States,

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:47.536
many states have created
good standards.

00:02:48.236 --> 00:02:51.496
In some states the standards are
sort of a mile wide and an inch deep.

00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:56.266
There are 300 things to cover in
each grade level, not a small number

00:02:56.266 --> 00:02:58.166
of things to do well and deeply.

00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:04.006
And the content coverage of large
numbers of objectives superficially,

00:03:04.446 --> 00:03:07.666
means that we end up
reteaching the same thing over

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:11.646
and over again year-after-year,
because we didn't stop and do it well

00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:13.956
and deeply at a moment in time.

00:03:14.466 --> 00:03:17.406
So I kids study fractions in
third grade, and then again

00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:19.076
in fourth grade and fifth grade.

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:20.806
Many of them don't get it.

00:03:20.846 --> 00:03:22.696
They're back at it
in sixth and seventh,

00:03:22.696 --> 00:03:26.806
and there are high school students
who still haven't mastered fractions.

00:03:27.286 --> 00:03:32.586
Whereas, if we spent, as many
countries do, a quarter of a year

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:35.506
on a single topic,
working on it deeply,

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:39.516
you could then understand it
deeply enough to move forward.

00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:44.456
And I think this accounts for the
low achievement that we see, in part,

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:47.206
in this country relative
to other countries.

00:03:48.476 --> 00:03:52.786
Take a country like Finland, which
ranks first among all the OECD,

00:03:52.786 --> 00:03:57.176
or European nations, in reading, math
and science on the PISA assessments.

00:03:57.656 --> 00:03:58.566
What goes on there?

00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:02.446
One thing they do is they train
their teachers extraordinarily well.

00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:04.896
So they are getting three years

00:04:04.896 --> 00:04:07.356
of graduate-level teacher
education before they even get

00:04:07.356 --> 00:04:10.676
in the classroom, and they know
how to teach all kids well.

00:04:10.676 --> 00:04:17.876
And they focus on assessments and
the teaching of deep understanding.

00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:23.456
&gt;&gt; In the classrooms, the
teachers then do a lot of work

00:04:23.456 --> 00:04:25.906
around project-based learning.

00:04:25.906 --> 00:04:28.726
You would often, in a classroom,
see students working on a lot

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:32.056
of self-initiated work,
individually and in small groups.

00:04:32.576 --> 00:04:35.286
They may be creating a
student newspaper and working

00:04:35.286 --> 00:04:36.626
on their journalism project.

00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:40.516
They may be designing and
conducting scientific investigations.

00:04:40.976 --> 00:04:43.926
When they're studying what a fish
looks like, they actually will go out

00:04:43.926 --> 00:04:47.946
and get 30 fish, and one on
each desk and dissect the fish,

00:04:47.946 --> 00:04:51.516
and figure out how it
operates and so on.

00:04:52.006 --> 00:04:56.736
You'll see a lot of investigation,
and inquiry in every field.

00:04:56.736 --> 00:05:02.036
That's really their hallmark is to
create a nation of inquiring minds.

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:05.646
And they also believe that it's very
important for students to reflect

00:05:05.886 --> 00:05:08.326
on what they've done, what
they've learned and be able

00:05:08.446 --> 00:05:09.956
to improve on it themselves.

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:13.796
Another vivid example
would be Singapore.

00:05:14.006 --> 00:05:16.096
There were a group of
students I saw who were trying

00:05:16.096 --> 00:05:20.496
to development a natural skin
treatment to keep mosquitoes away

00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:22.596
without using artificial products.

00:05:22.596 --> 00:05:25.336
And they had developed
five different products

00:05:25.336 --> 00:05:26.826
and evaluated them, and so on.

00:05:26.976 --> 00:05:28.826
They know how to design
an experiment,

00:05:28.826 --> 00:05:31.356
they know how to conduct it
to evaluate their results

00:05:31.486 --> 00:05:34.626
to then improve on what they've done.

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.066
This is widespread.

00:05:36.316 --> 00:05:39.936
By contrast, science is disappearing
from our American classrooms.

00:05:40.556 --> 00:05:42.886
Under "No Child Left
Behind," with reading

00:05:42.886 --> 00:05:45.586
and math scores driving
the accountability system,

00:05:46.046 --> 00:05:50.236
in low-income schools, science
is barely taught at all.

00:05:50.326 --> 00:05:53.806
And in many schools, when it's
taught, it's taught as a list

00:05:53.806 --> 00:05:58.506
of facts to be memorized from a
textbook, and then regurgitated

00:05:58.506 --> 00:05:59.586
on a multiple-choice test.

00:06:00.226 --> 00:06:04.086
Not as a process of
inquiry and investigation.

00:06:04.516 --> 00:06:07.796
Not as a way of understanding
and evaluating and learning

00:06:07.796 --> 00:06:11.446
about the world that you
could actually take and apply

00:06:11.446 --> 00:06:12.946
in the world outside of school.

00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:17.256
I have been surprised in the
countries that I've studied

00:06:17.396 --> 00:06:21.336
about the extent to which teachers
are supported with 25 hours a week

00:06:21.336 --> 00:06:23.086
of time for planning and learning.

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:27.356
So that when they get in the
classroom, what they do is very,

00:06:27.356 --> 00:06:28.656
very well thought through.

00:06:29.076 --> 00:06:33.266
And informed by what a lot
of other teachers are doing.

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:37.356
&gt;&gt; Interestingly, most
high-achieving countries pay teachers

00:06:37.636 --> 00:06:39.586
about equivalently to engineers.

00:06:39.696 --> 00:06:42.456
So they're a bit better
paid than US teachers.

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:45.966
But it is not the pay
that draws people

00:06:45.966 --> 00:06:49.166
into those professions
and to stay there.

00:06:49.756 --> 00:06:52.056
When teachers are treated
professionally,

00:06:52.056 --> 00:06:56.616
when they feel they have a lot of
opportunity to shape the curriculum,

00:06:56.616 --> 00:06:59.736
work with their colleagues,
develop high-quality practice,

00:07:00.276 --> 00:07:02.736
the morale is very, very high.

00:07:04.016 --> 00:07:06.016
The US is not a single entity.

00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:08.736
It is a very diverse group of states.

00:07:09.386 --> 00:07:12.646
So our highest-achieving
states do as well

00:07:12.646 --> 00:07:14.656
as the highest-achieving
nations in the world.

00:07:15.216 --> 00:07:22.056
Our lowest-performing states do
as poorly as nations like Jordan

00:07:22.056 --> 00:07:26.316
and Nigeria, which are very
low-performing nations.

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:31.906
So we can't adapt or adopt
what any nation is doing

00:07:32.276 --> 00:07:35.326
into our different
system whole cloth.

00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:39.076
But we can learn from the
experience of different systems,

00:07:39.266 --> 00:07:41.856
particularly if we
think about what should

00:07:41.856 --> 00:07:43.826
or could be done at the state level.

00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:46.396
We're at an interesting moment here.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:49.966
The states have come together
to create Common Core standards.

00:07:50.026 --> 00:07:56.976
More than forty states have been part
of this initiative to show in reading

00:07:56.976 --> 00:08:00.956
and math and language arts what
should be done across the grade span.

00:08:01.776 --> 00:08:06.336
The federal government is organizing
itself to fund new assessments

00:08:06.946 --> 00:08:09.046
that would be tied to the
Common Core standards.

00:08:09.506 --> 00:08:12.476
And will be reauthorizing
the Elementary

00:08:12.476 --> 00:08:15.426
and Secondary Education
Act, which has been called

00:08:15.426 --> 00:08:17.446
"No Child Left Behind"
over recent years.

00:08:17.446 --> 00:08:21.556
So the federal role will
be to design an assessment

00:08:21.556 --> 00:08:26.646
and accountability approach that
is more internationally comparable.

00:08:26.646 --> 00:08:32.046
Allows states to undertake the kinds
of curriculum and assessment work

00:08:32.606 --> 00:08:35.896
that will allow students
to be engaged in this kind

00:08:35.896 --> 00:08:38.876
of higher order thinking
and performance skills.

00:08:39.176 --> 00:08:40.586
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Here's our
data for our '08.

00:08:41.576 --> 00:08:42.976
This would be the first round.

00:08:43.076 --> 00:08:45.796
