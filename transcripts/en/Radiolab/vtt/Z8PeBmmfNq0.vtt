00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.900
Ready. [inaudible] this is radio lab. I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:06.660
And on this show we've been talking about a memory,

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.050
remembering and forgetting him. Yes.

4
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.290
And this next story is about the most drastic version of this particular back

5
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:19.680
and forth that I can think of is it just can't get any worse than this.

6
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:22.560
This is a story of a man named Clive wearing.

7
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:26.520
It was told to me by the famous neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks.

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.240
Okay. First of all, who was Clive wearing when he was? Well,

9
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.990
<v 1>um, he was a, um,</v>

10
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.050
a gifted musician and musicologist who was really a pioneer in renaissance

11
00:00:40.691 --> 00:00:44.170
music, especially the music of, of Orlando's losses.

12
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.150
<v 2>Oh,</v>

13
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.100
<v 3>he had a group called the London Nassis Ensemble. This is Deborah claims wife.</v>

14
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.190
And in every concert his signature tune was music,

15
00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:58.470
had Daytona music, the Gift of God,

16
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.750
<v 0>Boy Music, the gift of God. That's sort of interesting. And then what happened?</v>

17
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.693
<v 1>Then?</v>

18
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.350
Vada suddenly in March of 85,

19
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.910
he became ill.

20
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.700
<v 0>It began, she was just a headache</v>

21
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.350
<v 3>and he often had headaches because he often overworked.</v>

22
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.920
So it was nothing out of the ordinary. But it didn't go away.

23
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.990
We called the doctor and the local doctors pronounced that it was a very bad

24
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:32.070
flu. Bark and nature of the illness was not clear. Uh, no.

25
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:33.900
It's gravity. Yes.

26
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.760
On the full fifth day of the headache,

27
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.480
he was suddenly out of it.

28
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.170
He couldn't remember things. He didn't know my name,

29
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.450
didn't know his home address.

30
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.020
<v 0>The diagnosis was made of a herpes and cephalitis.</v>

31
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.750
The damage had been done. It was left as Oliver,

32
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.600
but the most severe amnesia ever document.

33
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.140
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

34
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.290
<v 0>This is a man who at least when things were very severe,</v>

35
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.990
would forget something in the blink of an eyelid.

36
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.190
It's very hard to imagine what this must have been like.

37
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.870
His wife Debra wrote about it though it a book for her own and she says his

38
00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:20.080
ability to perceive what he saw and heard was unimpaired,

39
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.370
but he didn't seem to be able to retain any impression of anything from more

40
00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:28.930
than the blink. The view before the blink, utterly forgotten. Each blink,

41
00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:32.080
each glance away and back brought him an entirely new view.

42
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.780
<v 3>Well, every moment is his first waking moment.</v>

43
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.460
<v 4>[inaudible] today was the first time.</v>

44
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.290
<v 3>There is no other moment for Clive except this.</v>

45
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.350
<v 4>In fact, I can't remember now what was going on this morning or I was here.</v>

46
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.053
I've never seen thing.

47
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.170
This is Clive from a documentary filmed a year after he got sick.

48
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.780
That doesn't have any financial, anything at all.

49
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.180
I don't know what the hell's going on. What's wrong with you?

50
00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:01.240
You can hear his wife Debra trolling for the umpteenth time to explain to him

51
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:02.800
what happened. I didn't want to talk.

52
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.510
This is one of the things that's wrong with you. These are not there.

53
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.010
I noticed he recognized that he away. He didn't know where.

54
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.140
I've been blind whole time. I've been dead for all time.

55
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.970
Notion to touch on that.

56
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.810
Then the brain hasn't been able to put the right time concerning the conscious

57
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.820
actually to the person involved with

58
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.110
not being able to store everything that you've experienced.

59
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.340
It's been not feeding. Wait [inaudible] not registering. That's right.

60
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.470
It's not making any impact and leaving a trace or an imprint on the frame so it

61
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:38.050
happens and then it fate.

62
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.530
<v 5>Proust has a wonderful description of waking up from deep sleep in a hotel,</v>

63
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.570
in a strange room and perhaps feeling confused and not knowing where you are,

64
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.110
what's around you or not even knowing who you are.

65
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.920
He says that memory comes like a rope,

66
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.980
let down from heaven to dwell one out of the abyss of and being

67
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.093
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

68
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.110
<v 5>No such rope is available for Clive.</v>

69
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.710
That the staff at the hospital tried to help.

70
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.400
<v 3>We put a divey by his bed and weird initially wrote in it,</v>

71
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.690
you are in Saint Mary's hospital, Paddington. It is, et Cetera, et cetera.

72
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.120
Um, and then we encouraged Clive to, to write things down.

73
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.090
So he starts to keep a journal. Uh,

74
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.480
he is extremely intent on trying to document his state.

75
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.350
He is very, very precise.

76
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.380
He would look at his watch to see what time was this momentous event occurring

77
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.340
of first consciousness.

78
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.330
And so he would write down 10 oh six a week, first time,

79
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.770
and then have the same sensation but 10 oh seven awake,

80
00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.940
first-time, truly awake. First Time. Ignore the last entry.

81
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.720
Now I'm awake. This is the first real awakeness. And so the,

82
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.680
the diaries are line by line,

83
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.000
a succession of astonished awakenings.

84
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.710
People's interest in the diarrhea. Rubbish. What does that mean?

85
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.770
[inaudible] did you write that up? No. Conscious to the

86
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.230
[inaudible] [inaudible] for the first time. Is it, is it your handwriting?

87
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.210
I know nothing about it at all. So how do you think it got there?

88
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.540
I did to do the doctor didn't know, but you must know.

89
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.380
I haven't seen the book of total now. No, I'm all I'm saying that's me.

90
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.250
That means I haven't seen it yet. I have no knowledge over the door. That's all.

91
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.470
There's no knowledge of that book. The world is entirely new to me.

92
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.720
But you put who would put that? I didn't know that. No, no, no, no. Oh,

93
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.940
I have to say usually judges

94
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.510
[inaudible] it seems as about as horrible as anything I could imagine. Yes.

95
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.910
Clarify gets a sense of, of deep Hala. Many, many times a day. Shame is death.

96
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.620
<v 4>New Difference Between Day and night. No thoughts at all.</v>

97
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.510
<v 5>No one quite knows what to do with someone with Amnesia.</v>

98
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.410
<v 4>I've never seen any human beings since I've been here.</v>

99
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.640
I don't remember sitting down on this chair. If they're not mad,

100
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.160
they're not retarded. [inaudible] death.

101
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.260
Clive has now suffered with this total Amnesia for more than 20 years.

102
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.220
Pretty much, right? Have One night, 20 years long with no dream.

103
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.820
That's what been life just like this

104
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.630
is that since we in totally painless

105
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.410
<v 0>and yet some,</v>

106
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.860
some things have sustained the love he has for his wife,

107
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.540
Deborah remained part of him even though he doesn't remember, for example,

108
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.340
his children's names,

109
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.240
he doesn't remember anything about his immediate past or even his relatively

110
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:54.800
distant past. When Deborah walks into the hospital room and he sees her,

111
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.160
what happens? He gasps

112
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.130
<v 5>with relief and excitement</v>

113
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.380
and they hug and he kisses her with with enormous passion.

114
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.710
He is suddenly being rescued from the abyss.

115
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.160
There's suddenly something and someone familiar

116
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.360
<v 2>and I don't see you in Toronto. Anyone at told told them</v>

117
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.163
[inaudible]

118
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.250
<v 0>when she goes home and the phone is ringing,</v>

119
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.670
she's just visiting [inaudible] and she,

120
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:34.480
<v 5>you may find too, she might find 20 calls on on on the message machine</v>

121
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.280
<v 0>from a man who doesn't know she's,</v>

122
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.760
<v 6>I told him, go ahead. Don't let anybody in this way.</v>

123
00:07:42.761 --> 00:07:45.840
I know nothing about this. Always wants me to basically Kinda

124
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:51.010
[inaudible] post recap a hundred Kevin, everybody else and we'll talk to you.

125
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.650
Please, please come 14 minutes later.

126
00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:00.190
That's his quiet head. I don't want to speak to, I'll say my CTU darling. Okay.

127
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.220
CVPs senior yet. I want to please come down here. Bye Bye.

128
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.630
You live in minutes later. This is Scott. Yeah, I've not,

129
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.810
it wasn't a gap anyway. You can get to me. It's not the place to come.

130
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.040
I don't see you doubting it. Five here.

131
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.930
I don't care about anyone else. Alright. Yeah. No. In case you don't recognize,

132
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.140
<v 5>he does not remember her in every way.</v>

133
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:31.240
He may fail to recognize her if she just passes. He cannot describe her.

134
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.580
He may forget her name, but he does not forget her. Embrace her warmth,

135
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.550
her love, her kisses, her caring for him.

136
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.860
<v 0>Sure. The question is what happened here?</v>

137
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.010
Did he could forget everything it seems, but not her.

138
00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.700
<v 3>When I asked Oliver, he referred to an experiment in particular,</v>

139
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:05.280
<v 5>well this was a famous or infamous experiment done by collaborate,</v>

140
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.190
who was a French neurologist at the beginning.

141
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.180
And this was done at the beginning of the 20th century. And there's this famous,

142
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.930
<v 7>a patient who basically had a version of the, uh,</v>

143
00:09:14.931 --> 00:09:17.940
of a memory problem that was in the film. Momento that's science writer,

144
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:18.741
Steven Johnson.

145
00:09:18.741 --> 00:09:21.560
Basically she couldn't remember anything longer than kind of five or 10 minutes.

146
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:25.390
It would just disappear and everyday should we go see your doctor and he would

147
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.060
greet her and she would say hello and introduce herself. And he would say,

148
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.910
well we see each other every day. But she would, she wouldn't remember.

149
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:31.901
And then one day,

150
00:09:31.901 --> 00:09:35.050
this is kind of a funny story cause it's not exactly what you want your doctor

151
00:09:35.051 --> 00:09:38.020
doing. One day what he did was he concealed as he was shaking your hand,

152
00:09:38.021 --> 00:09:42.640
he concealed a little thumbtack in his palm and reached and shook her hand and

153
00:09:42.641 --> 00:09:46.360
pricked her hand and she recoiled and said, well, you're a terrible doctor.

154
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.840
And then the next day when she came back again and didn't know who he was,

155
00:09:49.841 --> 00:09:53.380
didn't recognize him at all as usual and said hello and introduced herself.

156
00:09:53.381 --> 00:09:57.520
And then he reached out to shake her hand and she paused and she had this

157
00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.040
instinctive kind of feeling like there's some kind of threat here.

158
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.070
If she had no memory, if she could remember who this guy was,

159
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.630
how could she somehow remember this, this threat,

160
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.650
the threat posed by the pinprick in the palm? Well, this sounded for his notion

161
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.150
<v 5>and then I think memories of,</v>

162
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:18.730
of pain and joy I think are sort of primordial

163
00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.570
<v 3>down in the oldest parts of our brains. Oliver things,</v>

164
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.930
it may be a place for the memories that matter the most.

165
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.910
<v 5>I liked the idea of a sort of sub-cortical safe vault</v>

166
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.863
<v 3>for Clive,</v>

167
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:36.110
protected in the vault out of reach from his Amnesia was love for his wife and

168
00:10:37.021 --> 00:10:38.700
one thing more. Yeah.

169
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.230
I taken him off the ward to get some peace because he was hyper sensitive to

170
00:10:43.231 --> 00:10:48.150
noise and uh, the most peaceful place I happened to be the chapel.

171
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.340
Um, we picked up an old hymn book and for launch event,

172
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:58.410
anything better to do and because Clive talked jumble most of the time,

173
00:10:58.411 --> 00:10:59.490
at that stage,

174
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:04.170
I began to sing and all of a sudden like it was the most natural thing in the

175
00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:06.840
world. He joined in

176
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.330
[inaudible]. He could sing

177
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:18.690
<v 8>[inaudible].</v>

178
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.300
<v 3>I was amazed that he could still beat music and sing.</v>

179
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.190
It wasn't a tentative sort of stumbling, falling off a log, full voice,

180
00:11:26.191 --> 00:11:27.240
strong everything. Yep.

181
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.150
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

182
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:35.250
<v 3>well, I will say, well, I want to sing another. Oh, you bet. Yeah, absolutely.</v>

183
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:38.500
If he could do that, she wanted double. What else could he do?

184
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.520
We even brought his quiet in the,

185
00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.510
when he used to conduct in London's to the hospital chapel.

186
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:48.930
I had a hunch that if we stood Clyde in front of them with a piece of music,

187
00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.640
he would be able to conduct,

188
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.410
and it happened just as I taped.

189
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.410
His singers were flabbergasted.

190
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:04.500
There was that old conductor bringing them in completely and utterly himself

191
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.380
<v 0>and almost the instant it was over, it was over.</v>

192
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.740
He had no memory what he'd just done. In fact,

193
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.830
later on she showed him a tape of that very performance.

194
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.170
<v 6>What would you say if I told you you conducted the last ensemble, please</v>

195
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:28.123
cue me to prove it.

196
00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:42.930
<v 8>[inaudible] [inaudible] the space right in front of them are on the pedestal</v>

197
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.180
and he's conducting, he is fully in the new music,

198
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:50.303
SUNY himself.

199
00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:54.900
So music Hattaway becomes this Houstonian remote from heaven,

200
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.360
which will the him to himself and no one really knows.

201
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:01.223
I remember that. Now

202
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:05.960
<v 0>music does that makes this possible, not just in club and many others.</v>

203
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:11.350
Maybe it's something about music itself that it's so richly organized and every

204
00:13:11.451 --> 00:13:15.770
time you eat a song you can feel what has been and what's about to be

205
00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:21.830
bebe. I was just carried along in the architecture of music,

206
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.960
<v 3>but when the music stops,</v>

207
00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.050
he fooled out of time.

208
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.340
Music gives him a piece of time in which to be accessed

209
00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.340
<v 0>out of time, out of memory, out of himself.</v>

210
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:45.410
There's two things left. There's love and there's the joy of music.

211
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.220
Everything else is gone, but for some reason,

212
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:56.040
those day, thanks to Deborah wearing,
