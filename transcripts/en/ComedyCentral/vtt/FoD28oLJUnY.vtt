00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.900
LONGTIME VIEWERS-- FOLKS,
LONGTIME VIEWERS OF MY WRIST

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.340
WILL KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN WEARING
THIS RED BRACELET FOR

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.641
SEVEN YEARS.

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:11.312
IT'S PART OF MY WRISTSTRONG
CAMPAIGN IN WHICH I SINGLE

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.197
WRISTEDLY RAISED HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR THE

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.036
YELLOW RIBBON FUND, WHICH
ASSISTS INJURED SERVICE MEMBERS

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.108
AND THEIR FAMILIES.

00:00:19.108 --> 00:00:21.959
IT'S A PERFECT FIT.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.487
( APPLAUSE )
BECAUSE I BELIEVE NOTHING SAYS

00:00:24.487 --> 00:00:27.496
YELLOW RIBBON LIKE RED
BRACELETS.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.544
WHEN THE IRAQ WAR ENDED IN 2010,
I TOOK ONE WRISTSTRONG BRACELET

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.698
OFF, AND NOW I CAN TAKE THE LAST
ONE OFF.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.409
&gt;&gt; THIS MORNING A MILESTONE IN
THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.556
THE UNITED STATES AND NATO
OFFICIALLY ENDED THEIR COMBAT

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.731
MISSION.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.762
&gt;&gt; IN AFGHANISTAN, THE U.S. AND
NATO OFFICIALLY CLOSED THEIR

00:00:42.762 --> 00:00:45.930
COMBAT MISSION AFTER MORE THAN
13 YEARS.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.163
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ALL RIGHT, ALL

00:00:48.163 --> 00:00:49.128
RIGHT, THERE WE GO.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.040
HERE WE GO.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.213
BOOM!

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.530
NOW, I AM-- I AM SORRY THAT OUR
TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN ARE NOT

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.365
GETTING A PARADE LIKE THE ONE
THE IRAQ VETERANS DIDN'T GET.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.534
I DON'T KNOW THE PROBLEM.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.196
THERE MUST BE A WORLDWIDE
CONFETTI SHORTAGE.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.023
SO BEFORE I GO OFF THE AIR, I'M
GOING TO RAISE A LITTLE MORE

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.743
GREEN ONE LAST TIME FOR THE
YELLOW RIBBON FUND.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.815
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ).

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.960

OF MY SET.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.420

WIN.

THIS TIMELESS CLASSIC IS SHAPED

MISSHAPEN "U."

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.502
