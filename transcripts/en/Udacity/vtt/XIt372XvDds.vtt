00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.300
Any mutation that results in changing the overall

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.930
reading frame is called a frame shift mutation.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.750
It just means a mutation that alters the

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.480
reading frame of translation which is exactly what happened

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.350
here. Cytosine got inserted, and then everything got

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.030
pushed down a notch. And it's not just that

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.120
it got pushed down, all the later codons

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.810
changed because of this shift. Often times frameshift mutations

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.850
result in premature stop codons which is exactly

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.360
what happened here. And this is exactly what

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.040
happens in Crohn's Disease. This particular mutation is

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.210
associated with Crohn's disease because the NOD2 gene,

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.900
when a C gets inserted, The reading frame

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.790
gets shifted. A premature stop codon shows up,

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.840
a nonsense mutation now and the overall protein

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.880
is shortened or truncated. Losing it's original function

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.420
thus causing this particular disorder. Take

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.680
this particular sequence here. I've even numbered

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.940
the positions for you for all 15 letters in the sequence. I want you

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.880
tell me which of the following five options would result in a frameshift to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.450
the sequence. Go ahead and check any and all boxes that you think apply.
