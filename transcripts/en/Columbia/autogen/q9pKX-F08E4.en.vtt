00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:35.550
a pressure cooker blowing off I this
 

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.179
a pressure cooker blowing off I this
happened to me actually in fact I was

00:13:38.179 --> 00:13:38.189
happened to me actually in fact I was
 

00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:41.389
happened to me actually in fact I was
cooking and the I was not looking at the

00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399
cooking and the I was not looking at the
 

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:44.179
cooking and the I was not looking at the
pressure cooker very carefully so do we

00:13:44.179 --> 00:13:44.189

not really I don't know what kind of

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:48.660
not really I don't know what kind of
 

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.119
not really I don't know what kind of
developments they have been over the

00:13:50.119 --> 00:13:50.129
developments they have been over the
 

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:52.939
developments they have been over the
last couple of decades I can't keep up

00:13:52.939 --> 00:13:52.949
last couple of decades I can't keep up
 

00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:56.410
last couple of decades I can't keep up
with every one of them and anyway the

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:56.420
with every one of them and anyway the
 

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:59.419
with every one of them and anyway the
pressure cooker exploded because I

00:13:59.419 --> 00:13:59.429
pressure cooker exploded because I
 

00:13:59.429 --> 00:14:00.919
pressure cooker exploded because I
wasn't watching it carefully and

00:14:00.919 --> 00:14:00.929
wasn't watching it carefully and
 

00:14:00.929 --> 00:14:03.129
wasn't watching it carefully and
everything went all over the room and

00:14:03.129 --> 00:14:03.139
everything went all over the room and
 

00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:07.189
everything went all over the room and
for a second I felt panic and then I

00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199
for a second I felt panic and then I
 

00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:09.350
for a second I felt panic and then I
thought no let's see what we do next

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360
thought no let's see what we do next
 

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.579
thought no let's see what we do next
okay we turn off the gas and then we

00:14:13.579 --> 00:14:13.589
okay we turn off the gas and then we
 

00:14:13.589 --> 00:14:15.650
okay we turn off the gas and then we
have to take a sponge and then we mop up

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:15.660
have to take a sponge and then we mop up
 

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.600
have to take a sponge and then we mop up
the mess and so on and so on so I took

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:17.610
the mess and so on and so on so I took
 

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.869
the mess and so on and so on so I took
it one step at a time and that calmed me

00:14:20.869 --> 00:14:20.879
it one step at a time and that calmed me
 

00:14:20.879 --> 00:14:24.319
it one step at a time and that calmed me
down and that is a lesson I decided that

00:14:24.319 --> 00:14:24.329
down and that is a lesson I decided that
 

00:14:24.329 --> 00:14:27.199
down and that is a lesson I decided that
whenever there's a crisis to be met then

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:27.209
whenever there's a crisis to be met then
 

00:14:27.209 --> 00:14:28.759
whenever there's a crisis to be met then
you just do what you can

00:14:28.759 --> 00:14:28.769
you just do what you can
 

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:31.879
you just do what you can
one step at a time and you'd think

00:14:31.879 --> 00:14:31.889
one step at a time and you'd think
 

00:14:31.889 --> 00:14:33.769
one step at a time and you'd think
yourself through it this is what I'm

00:14:33.769 --> 00:14:33.779
yourself through it this is what I'm
 

00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:35.239
yourself through it this is what I'm
going to do first

00:14:35.239 --> 00:14:35.249
going to do first
 

00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:38.299
going to do first
then this comes next and after that the

00:14:38.299 --> 00:14:38.309
then this comes next and after that the
 

00:14:38.309 --> 00:14:41.179
then this comes next and after that the
third step is this and so on and then it

00:14:41.179 --> 00:14:41.189
third step is this and so on and then it
 

00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:44.799
third step is this and so on and then it
becomes very easy and you calm down and

00:14:44.799 --> 00:14:44.809
becomes very easy and you calm down and
 

00:14:44.809 --> 00:14:48.799
becomes very easy and you calm down and
this is how I approached all the crises

00:14:48.799 --> 00:14:48.809
this is how I approached all the crises
 

00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:53.179
this is how I approached all the crises
of my life during under house arrest I

00:14:53.179 --> 00:14:53.189
of my life during under house arrest I
 

00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:54.829
of my life during under house arrest I
can't really see that there were too

00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839
can't really see that there were too
 

00:14:54.839 --> 00:14:57.799
can't really see that there were too
many crises because there's not much you

00:14:57.799 --> 00:14:57.809
many crises because there's not much you
 

00:14:57.809 --> 00:14:59.540
many crises because there's not much you
can get up to if you're under house

00:14:59.540 --> 00:14:59.550
can get up to if you're under house
 

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:04.100
can get up to if you're under house
arrest but I did take everything very

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:04.110
arrest but I did take everything very
 

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.730
arrest but I did take everything very
calmly in a very practical way step by

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740
calmly in a very practical way step by
 

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.900
calmly in a very practical way step by
step I stuck to a very strict timetable

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:10.910
step I stuck to a very strict timetable
 

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.519
step I stuck to a very strict timetable
because that also kept me disciplined

00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:13.529
because that also kept me disciplined
 

00:15:13.529 --> 00:15:17.299
because that also kept me disciplined
and prevented me from wasting my time at

00:15:17.299 --> 00:15:17.309
and prevented me from wasting my time at
 

00:15:17.309 --> 00:15:19.309
and prevented me from wasting my time at
a house arrest one of the things I did

00:15:19.309 --> 00:15:19.319
a house arrest one of the things I did
 

00:15:19.319 --> 00:15:22.009
a house arrest one of the things I did
feel very strongly was all right they've

00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:22.019
feel very strongly was all right they've
 

00:15:22.019 --> 00:15:24.230
feel very strongly was all right they've
placed me under under house arrest I'm

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240
placed me under under house arrest I'm
 

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.269
placed me under under house arrest I'm
not going to give them the satisfaction

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279
not going to give them the satisfaction
 

00:15:26.279 --> 00:15:30.470
not going to give them the satisfaction
of knowing that I've become less

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480
of knowing that I've become less
 

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:35.119
of knowing that I've become less
disciplined and that I've dissipated

00:15:35.119 --> 00:15:35.129
disciplined and that I've dissipated
 

00:15:35.129 --> 00:15:38.269
disciplined and that I've dissipated
those years under detention so I tried

00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279
those years under detention so I tried
 

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:40.309
those years under detention so I tried
to get as much out of those years as I

00:15:40.309 --> 00:15:40.319
to get as much out of those years as I
 

00:15:40.319 --> 00:15:42.600
to get as much out of those years as I
could get I meditated I read

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:42.610
could get I meditated I read
 

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.780
could get I meditated I read
I listen to the radio exercise I think I

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:45.790
I listen to the radio exercise I think I
 

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.460
I listen to the radio exercise I think I

00:15:57.449 --> 00:15:57.459
prisoners of conscience even so often
 

00:15:57.459 --> 00:16:02.130
prisoners of conscience even so often
are influenced by those they whose works

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:02.140
are influenced by those they whose works
 

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:06.720
are influenced by those they whose works
