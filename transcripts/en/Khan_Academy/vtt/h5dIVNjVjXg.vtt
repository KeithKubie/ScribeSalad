00:00:00.098 --> 00:00:01.619
- [Voiceover] We're asked
which ellipse is represented

00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:05.104
by the equation x minus
four squared over 16

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:08.527
plus y minus one squared
over 49 is equal to one.

00:00:08.527 --> 00:00:10.486
And we're given a bunch of choices here.

00:00:10.486 --> 00:00:11.846
We're given four choices here.

00:00:11.846 --> 00:00:13.879
So let's just think about
what's going on here.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.879
So the center of the ellipse
is going to be four comma one.

00:00:18.965 --> 00:00:19.870
How do I know that?

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.310
Well the equation of the
ellipse is going to be

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.465
x minus the x-coordinate for
the center squared over here,

00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:29.903
over the horizontal axis is
horizontal radius squared

00:00:29.903 --> 00:00:33.941
plus y minus the y-coordinate
of the center squared

00:00:33.941 --> 00:00:36.379
over the vertical radius squared.

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.015
So the center is going
to be four comma one.

00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:41.755
So the center here is not four comma one.

00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:46.318
The center over here
is not four comma one.

00:00:46.318 --> 00:00:48.547
Not four comma one.

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:52.213
The only choice that has
a center at four comma one

00:00:52.213 --> 00:00:54.189
is this one over here.

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:55.873
So we already know this is the choice

00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:58.137
without even looking at the horizontal

00:00:58.137 --> 00:00:59.820
and the vertical radius.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.503
But we can verify that this works out

00:01:01.503 --> 00:01:03.651
'cause a horizontal
radius right over here,

00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:05.950
notice it goes this orange line,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.864
which can represent the horizontal radius.

00:01:08.864 --> 00:01:13.864
It has a length of four and so
the horizontal radius is four

00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:18.524
and so we see indeed that 16

00:01:18.524 --> 00:01:21.856
is the horizontal radius
squared, this is four squared.

00:01:21.856 --> 00:01:25.559
And if we look at the
vertical radius here,

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:26.674
we see it has a length of seven.

00:01:26.674 --> 00:01:29.100
We're going from y equals
one to y equals eight,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.494
has a length of seven.

00:01:30.494 --> 00:01:32.142
And we see in that equation

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:35.230
that this indeed is seven squared.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.795
So that was pretty straight forward.
