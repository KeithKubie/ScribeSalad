00:00:00.493 --> 00:00:01.681
Voiceover: What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:03.903
is look at the data from the last video

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:05.160
and make sure we understand it

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.458
in maybe a more visual way.

00:00:07.458 --> 00:00:10.746
What I've done is, in
this graph over here,

00:00:10.746 --> 00:00:13.182
I used the lines of code per month,

00:00:13.182 --> 00:00:14.658
so this right over here.

00:00:14.658 --> 00:00:18.743
I used this, or this was what I used

00:00:18.743 --> 00:00:21.185
on my horizontal axis,

00:00:21.185 --> 00:00:21.684
so I kind of,

00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:24.075
if you view it in terms of independent

00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:25.074
and dependent variables,

00:00:25.074 --> 00:00:27.918
I kind of made this the
independent variable now.

00:00:27.918 --> 00:00:30.081
Given a certain number of lines of code

00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:31.517
you want to produce per month,

00:00:31.517 --> 00:00:34.060
what is the fixed cost, the variable cost,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.555
and the total cost,

00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:38.258
so this is on this axis right over here.

00:00:38.258 --> 00:00:40.253
This is lines of code,

00:00:40.253 --> 00:00:42.713
lines of code per month

00:00:42.713 --> 00:00:43.918
per month,

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:44.649
right over there,

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.320
and then you see it
goes up to about 12,000,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.741
and we see that covers
the entire range of data

00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:53.459
that we would have to worry
about right over here.

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:54.610
On the vertical axis,

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.106
as I just alluded to,

00:00:56.106 --> 00:00:58.258
we are plotting the cost,

00:00:58.258 --> 00:00:59.517
so we're going to plot the fixed cost,

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:02.186
the variable cost, and the total cost.

00:01:02.186 --> 00:01:04.760
We see that there in our little legend.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.575
The fixed cost,

00:01:05.575 --> 00:01:08.141
no matter how many lines
of code we've produced,

00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:09.381
this is a little bit different

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:11.129
than the way we thought
about it in the last video.

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:12.415
In the last video, we said,

00:01:12.415 --> 00:01:14.256
"How many programmers do we have,

00:01:14.256 --> 00:01:15.666
"and what is going to be our fixed cost,

00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.328
"our variable cost, our total cost?"

00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:18.260
Now we're thinking about it

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.003
in terms of lines of code per month,

00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:21.581
but no matter how many lines of code

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.914
per month we produce within reason,

00:01:23.914 --> 00:01:26.117
our fixed costs are the same,

00:01:26.117 --> 00:01:29.010
$15,000 per month for the office space,

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.369
the food in the office, the water cooler,

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.860
the project manager, things like that.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.009
We see it right over here.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.632
This pale green line,
that is our fixed cost.

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:39.816
That is our fixed cost.

00:01:39.816 --> 00:01:42.084
No matter how many lines
of code we produce,

00:01:42.084 --> 00:01:46.060
we are using exactly $15,000 per month.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.100
This is $15,000 right over there.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.896
Then you have your variable costs

00:01:50.896 --> 00:01:52.868
in this orange color,

00:01:52.868 --> 00:01:55.751
so the variable costs in the orange color,

00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:58.455
and we can see how the points are plotted.

00:01:58.455 --> 00:02:01.182
When you have no lines of code per month,

00:02:01.182 --> 00:02:03.006
your variable costs are 0.

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:04.923
That's this point right over there.

00:02:04.923 --> 00:02:06.912
When you have 4,000 lines of code,

00:02:06.912 --> 00:02:09.327
your variable costs are 10,000.

00:02:09.327 --> 00:02:11.602
That's that point right over there.

00:02:11.602 --> 00:02:12.838
When you have,

00:02:12.838 --> 00:02:14.711
let me pick up a random point over here,

00:02:14.711 --> 00:02:18.559
when you have 11,400
lines of code per month,

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:20.582
your variable costs are 70,000.

00:02:20.582 --> 00:02:23.164
11,400, let's see.

00:02:23.164 --> 00:02:26.381
This is about 11,000, 11,400,

00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:30.673
and your costs are $70,000.

00:02:30.673 --> 00:02:32.722
That's that point right over there.

00:02:32.722 --> 00:02:34.435
Then, finally, your total costs,

00:02:34.435 --> 00:02:36.878
or the sum of the fixed
plus the variable costs,

00:02:36.878 --> 00:02:39.712
and we've plotted this in this blue color,

00:02:39.712 --> 00:02:41.856
so the total costs,

00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:43.855
which is in blue right over here,

00:02:43.855 --> 00:02:46.863
it's really just the sum of
this green horizontal line

00:02:46.863 --> 00:02:48.251
and this orange line.

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:49.203
Another way of thinking about it,

00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:50.666
take this orange line at any given point.

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:52.581
That's the variable cost.

00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:53.717
Add the fixed cost,

00:02:53.717 --> 00:02:54.675
which is 15,000.

00:02:54.675 --> 00:02:56.854
It shifts you up to that blue line.

00:02:56.854 --> 00:02:58.850
So at any point, that
blue line is exactly,

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.120
is exactly $15,000 higher.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.458
$15,000 higher than the orange line.

00:03:05.458 --> 00:03:07.343
You see it even over here,

00:03:07.343 --> 00:03:09.596
where it kind of bends back on itself.

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:10.919
Then you're probably saying,

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.116
"Well, why is it bending
back on itself like that?"

00:03:14.116 --> 00:03:16.076
And this goes straight
to what we talked about

00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:17.447
in the last video.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:19.883
That as we add more and more programmers,

00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:22.210
the average productivity
per programmer goes down

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.826
because they have to
start meeting each other

00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:25.184
and coordinate with each other,

00:03:25.184 --> 00:03:26.601
and maybe they undo each other's work,

00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:28.451
and then there's some point at which,

00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:30.260
even when you add more resources,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.052
it actually decreases productivity.

00:03:32.052 --> 00:03:34.189
So we're adding more and more resources,

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:35.511
and I don't have them plotted here,

00:03:35.511 --> 00:03:37.890
but we keep adding more
and more developers,

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.725
and we get to this point

00:03:38.725 --> 00:03:40.514
where we're able to generate

00:03:40.514 --> 00:03:42.605
11,400 lines of code per month,

00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:43.916
but then all of a sudden,

00:03:43.916 --> 00:03:45.207
as we add more developers,

00:03:45.207 --> 00:03:47.100
it still adds cost,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.335
because obviously they're
going to cost something.

00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:49.262
We have to pay their salaries

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:50.725
and their insurance and all of that,

00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:51.926
but then our total productivity

00:03:51.926 --> 00:03:53.766
starts going down again.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:54.855
That's what we're seeing here

00:03:54.855 --> 00:03:58.262
when both the variable cost curve

00:03:58.262 --> 00:04:03.331
and our total cost curve
start curving back on itself.

00:04:03.331 --> 00:04:04.559
Now, with this plotted,

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:06.124
what I want to think about visually,

00:04:06.124 --> 00:04:07.396
and especially in terms of slope,

00:04:07.396 --> 00:04:08.441
I encourage you to,

00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:12.166
if the term slope seems a
little bit foreign to you,

00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:15.106
there's tons of videos
on the idea of slope

00:04:15.106 --> 00:04:16.876
in the algebra playlist,

00:04:16.876 --> 00:04:20.367
but the slope is really
just how inclined a line is.

00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:23.789
For example, this line has a higher slope

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.248
than this line right over there.

00:04:26.248 --> 00:04:27.423
That the way we measure it

00:04:27.423 --> 00:04:29.860
is our change in our vertical axis,

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.854
so our change in our vertical axis,

00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:33.729
often given by a change in y,

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.070
the triangles, that's the delta,

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.209
Greek letter Δ, means change in Y

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:40.548
divided by our change in,

00:04:40.548 --> 00:04:43.492
divided by our change
in our horizontal axis,

00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:45.344
that is change in X.

00:04:45.344 --> 00:04:50.862
So, slope is equal to Δy over Δx,

00:04:50.862 --> 00:04:52.971
and when you measure it this way,

00:04:52.971 --> 00:04:53.813
this line over here,

00:04:53.813 --> 00:04:56.258
it looks like it has about
the same change in x,

00:04:56.258 --> 00:04:58.857
but has a much lower change in y,

00:04:58.857 --> 00:05:01.517
lower change in y.

00:05:01.517 --> 00:05:03.010
So when you take this lower change in y

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.718
divided by the same change in x,

00:05:04.718 --> 00:05:07.402
you're going to get a lower slope.

00:05:07.402 --> 00:05:09.812
If you had a line that
looked something like,

00:05:09.812 --> 00:05:10.823
if you had a line that looked

00:05:10.823 --> 00:05:12.331
something like this,

00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:15.228
then you have a much higher change in y,

00:05:15.228 --> 00:05:17.528
so your numerator is higher,

00:05:17.528 --> 00:05:18.730
a higher change in y,

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.779
and you have a lower change in x.

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.056
Your denominator's lower.

00:05:22.056 --> 00:05:24.494
That'll increase the
value of the quantity,

00:05:24.494 --> 00:05:25.588
so your change in x.

00:05:25.588 --> 00:05:27.962
This right over here is
going to be a high slope,

00:05:27.962 --> 00:05:29.066
a high slope.

00:05:29.066 --> 00:05:31.186
With that little primer out of the way

00:05:31.186 --> 00:05:32.331
on what a slope is,

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:34.109
what I want to do is think about

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.895
these average fixed costs,

00:05:35.895 --> 00:05:36.890
average variable costs,

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.040
average total costs,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.004
and marginal costs

00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:42.239
in terms of slopes of these lines

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:43.368
right over here.

00:05:43.368 --> 00:05:45.041
When you're looking at average,

00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:47.419
if we look at this point right over here,

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.535
average fixed cost, $3.75.

00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:51.859
What that means is

00:05:51.859 --> 00:05:54.458
when we're producing 4,000 lines of code,

00:05:54.458 --> 00:05:55.671
4,000 lines of code,

00:05:55.671 --> 00:05:58.352
our average fixed cost is $3.75,

00:05:58.352 --> 00:05:59.569
so I'm on the green line, actually.

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:01.111
Let me use a green color right here.

00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:03.564
I'm on this green line right over here.

00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:04.773
To find that average,

00:06:04.773 --> 00:06:05.653
so that's our,

00:06:05.653 --> 00:06:06.528
that is our,

00:06:06.528 --> 00:06:08.763
that is our fixed cost.

00:06:08.763 --> 00:06:10.520
To find our average fixed cost,

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.551
we want to divide our fixed cost,

00:06:12.551 --> 00:06:15.133
which is that height right over there.

00:06:15.133 --> 00:06:17.977
You want to divide it by
the total lines of code,

00:06:17.977 --> 00:06:20.058
and that gives us our fixed cost,

00:06:20.058 --> 00:06:22.378
our average fixed cost per line of code.

00:06:22.378 --> 00:06:25.148
We're taking a change in the vertical axis

00:06:25.148 --> 00:06:28.268
divided by our change in a
horizontal axis right there,

00:06:28.268 --> 00:06:31.376
so it's essentially giving
the slope of this line,

00:06:31.376 --> 00:06:32.739
just like that.

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:34.280
It's giving the slope of that line,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.465
and that's this point right over here.

00:06:36.465 --> 00:06:38.749
When you go to this point right over here,

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:40.033
you're saying, "Okay.

00:06:40.033 --> 00:06:42.081
"I'm producing 7,000 lines of code,

00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:47.129
"and it still costs me $15,000."

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:48.536
That's $15,000.

00:06:48.536 --> 00:06:53.076
I divide my total change in fixed costs,

00:06:53.076 --> 00:06:55.132
divided by my

00:06:55.132 --> 00:06:57.081
or my total fixed cost

00:06:57.081 --> 00:07:00.477
divided by my total lines of code,

00:07:00.477 --> 00:07:02.245
divided by my total lines of code.

00:07:02.245 --> 00:07:03.845
I'm essentially getting the slope of,

00:07:04.552 --> 00:07:05.611
I know it's getting hard to see,

00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:06.591
the way I'm doing it.

00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:07.946
I'm essentially giving you the slope of,

00:07:07.946 --> 00:07:09.363
let me draw a little bit neater,

00:07:09.778 --> 00:07:10.982
this line right over here.

00:07:10.982 --> 00:07:13.217
You could see this line has a lower slope

00:07:13.217 --> 00:07:14.355
than the previous one,

00:07:14.355 --> 00:07:15.914
and that makes sense

00:07:15.914 --> 00:07:18.133
because the average fixed
cost per line of code

00:07:18.133 --> 00:07:19.419
should be going down.

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:20.786
We have the same fixed cost

00:07:20.786 --> 00:07:22.331
and we're dividing it amongst more

00:07:22.331 --> 00:07:23.618
and more and more code.

00:07:23.618 --> 00:07:24.979
You can see if you go out here,

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:26.535
and you do the slope from this point

00:07:26.535 --> 00:07:27.580
all the way over here,

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.561
it's going to have even a little,

00:07:28.561 --> 00:07:30.121
even a lower slope,

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:31.776
so let me clear this out of the way,

00:07:31.776 --> 00:07:32.884
so hopefully that makes sense.

00:07:32.884 --> 00:07:34.590
The fixed cost, at least for me,

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.220
is maybe the easiest to understand.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.501
You're taking the same quantity,

00:07:37.501 --> 00:07:39.033
dividing it by more and more code,

00:07:39.033 --> 00:07:40.334
or by more and more developers.

00:07:40.887 --> 00:07:43.090
Now, the variable cost,
average variable cost,

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.467
at any given point over here,

00:07:45.143 --> 00:07:46.277
we're taking the variable cost,

00:07:46.277 --> 00:07:48.583
and we're dividing it by
the total amount of code.

00:07:48.859 --> 00:07:50.045
So variable costs,

00:07:51.552 --> 00:07:54.176
over there it is $10,000,

00:07:54.176 --> 00:07:56.581
and we're dividing it
by 4,000 lines of code,

00:07:56.581 --> 00:07:59.345
so it is the slope of
this line right over here.

00:07:59.868 --> 00:08:01.789
When you go to 7,000 lines of code,

00:08:01.789 --> 00:08:05.859
you say, "Well, my total
variable cost is $20,000,

00:08:05.859 --> 00:08:09.243
"and I'm going to divide
it by 7,000 lines of code."

00:08:09.243 --> 00:08:14.055
So it is the slope of this
entire line right over here.

00:08:14.238 --> 00:08:16.120
I'm having trouble drawing these lines.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.788
It is the slope of this
line right over here.

00:08:20.788 --> 00:08:21.544
This is a curve,

00:08:21.544 --> 00:08:23.771
so the slope is different
here than it is over there.

00:08:24.109 --> 00:08:24.824
This line,

00:08:24.824 --> 00:08:27.423
when we're measuring the
average variable costs,

00:08:27.423 --> 00:08:27.917
we're measuring,

00:08:27.917 --> 00:08:30.110
you can imagine the average slope across

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.344
from the beginning all
the way to this point

00:08:32.344 --> 00:08:33.381
right over here.

00:08:34.119 --> 00:08:35.678
Now, when you're doing
the average total cost,

00:08:35.678 --> 00:08:36.749
you're doing the same thing.

00:08:36.749 --> 00:08:38.202
The average total cost at that point

00:08:38.694 --> 00:08:40.141
is our total, total cost,

00:08:40.464 --> 00:08:42.733
so it's that, divided by,

00:08:43.163 --> 00:08:47.005
divided by the total code,

00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:48.832
so the total code.

00:08:48.832 --> 00:08:52.596
So it is the slope of this
line right over there.

00:08:52.596 --> 00:08:55.936
We see that, that slope,
when you start over here,

00:08:55.936 --> 00:08:58.840
when you start from this
point to that point,

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.776
the slope goes down,

00:08:59.776 --> 00:09:02.041
but then we see the slope start going,

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.538
it starts to go up again

00:09:03.538 --> 00:09:06.332
because we saw that the variables cost

00:09:06.332 --> 00:09:07.589
start increasing

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.090
because we get less and less efficiency

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.514
as we add more and more developers

00:09:10.514 --> 00:09:12.958
and attempt, at least, to write more code.

00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.023
Now, the marginal cost
is an interesting one.

00:09:15.023 --> 00:09:16.631
All of these other ones,

00:09:16.631 --> 00:09:17.710
we're taking our total cost,

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:18.779
our total variable cost,

00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:19.945
our total total cost,

00:09:19.945 --> 00:09:20.912
our total fixed cost,

00:09:20.912 --> 00:09:22.985
and dividing by the total amount of code,

00:09:22.985 --> 00:09:24.785
so we're essentially
finding the slope of a line

00:09:24.785 --> 00:09:27.846
between these points and our origin.

00:09:28.076 --> 00:09:29.578
When you're doing the marginal cost,

00:09:29.578 --> 00:09:30.841
you're doing something different.

00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:32.022
Let me clear all of this out

00:09:32.022 --> 00:09:33.427
so that we can clear things up.

00:09:33.965 --> 00:09:36.646
Your marginal cost is you're measuring

00:09:36.646 --> 00:09:39.823
your change in total cost divided by,

00:09:39.823 --> 00:09:41.183
not your total total cost,

00:09:41.183 --> 00:09:43.018
you're doing your change in total cost

00:09:43.018 --> 00:09:47.341
divided by your change
in the lines of code.

00:09:47.817 --> 00:09:49.647
So, for example, that right over,

00:09:49.647 --> 00:09:51.160
let me do that in a more vibrant color.

00:09:51.544 --> 00:09:52.852
That marginal cost,

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.418
that's at this point right over here,

00:09:55.418 --> 00:09:56.650
so let's say we're going to,

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.986
we can do it with the variable cost curve

00:09:58.986 --> 00:10:00.633
or we could do it with
the total cost curve.

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:01.644
i'll do it with the total cost curve,

00:10:01.644 --> 00:10:03.546
so it's this point right over here.

00:10:03.546 --> 00:10:04.962
What we're doing is,

00:10:05.454 --> 00:10:08.107
we're taking the change in total cost

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:09.675
between the previous point.

00:10:09.675 --> 00:10:11.128
The previous point was there,

00:10:11.128 --> 00:10:12.684
so our change in total cost

00:10:12.684 --> 00:10:14.596
is just this part right over here,

00:10:14.596 --> 00:10:17.206
so this is our change in total cost,

00:10:17.206 --> 00:10:19.209
and we're dividing it by our change

00:10:19.209 --> 00:10:21.138
in the amount of code we produce.

00:10:21.707 --> 00:10:23.911
So we're dividing it by the change in,

00:10:23.911 --> 00:10:26.668
change in lines of code.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:29.209
So essentially, it's giving
us the slope of the line

00:10:29.578 --> 00:10:32.244
between the previous point
and the current point

00:10:32.244 --> 00:10:34.913
on the total cost curve.

00:10:34.913 --> 00:10:35.788
We could do it,

00:10:35.788 --> 00:10:36.965
so if we go right over here.

00:10:36.965 --> 00:10:38.832
Let me go to another arbitrary point

00:10:39.247 --> 00:10:40.678
that doesn't start from the beginning.

00:10:41.185 --> 00:10:43.777
Let's say we're looking
at this marginal cost.

00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:45.815
This was when we're talking about

00:10:45.815 --> 00:10:47.985
10,600 lines of code,

00:10:47.985 --> 00:10:51.131
and our total cost was $65,000.

00:10:51.561 --> 00:10:53.475
So our total cost is $65,000,

00:10:53.475 --> 00:10:55.372
10,600 lines of code.

00:10:55.372 --> 00:10:56.955
That's that point right over there.

00:10:57.508 --> 00:10:58.628
What this is measuring,

00:10:59.074 --> 00:11:01.189
it's our change in total cost

00:11:01.189 --> 00:11:03.049
since the last increment,

00:11:03.495 --> 00:11:04.546
so since the last increment,

00:11:04.546 --> 00:11:05.684
since the last point.

00:11:06.037 --> 00:11:07.869
It's our change in total cost.

00:11:08.238 --> 00:11:10.863
it's our change in total cost

00:11:10.863 --> 00:11:13.489
divided by the change in lines of code

00:11:13.489 --> 00:11:14.884
since the last point,

00:11:15.453 --> 00:11:18.070
so the change of lines
of code is just that,

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.230
change in lines of code.

00:11:20.706 --> 00:11:23.291
Our marginal cost is this quantity

00:11:23.291 --> 00:11:24.048
divided by this quantity.

00:11:24.048 --> 00:11:27.080
It's the slope between these
two consecutive points.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.282
What the marginal cost is giving us,

00:11:29.282 --> 00:11:31.262
so I just want to make sure
we get everything clear,

00:11:31.262 --> 00:11:33.133
these average fixed, average variable,

00:11:33.133 --> 00:11:34.287
average total cost,

00:11:34.287 --> 00:11:35.698
that gives us a slope of the line

00:11:35.698 --> 00:11:37.701
between any of the points and the origin.

00:11:37.701 --> 00:11:39.727
The marginal cost is essentially giving us

00:11:39.727 --> 00:11:41.334
the slope of the curve

00:11:41.334 --> 00:11:43.989
between any two consecutive points

00:11:43.989 --> 00:11:45.481
on the total cost curve,

00:11:45.481 --> 00:11:46.771
or you could also view,

00:11:46.771 --> 00:11:48.414
because it's really just a shifted version

00:11:48.414 --> 00:11:49.623
of the variable cost curve,

00:11:49.623 --> 00:11:51.334
or you could do this as the same

00:11:51.334 --> 00:11:52.519
as the slope of the line

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:55.638
between any two points on
the variable cost curve.

00:11:55.638 --> 00:11:58.048
This is an approximation

00:11:58.663 --> 00:11:59.833
you could do this as the average,

00:11:59.833 --> 00:12:01.281
and that's why I wrote average over here.

00:12:01.281 --> 00:12:03.086
This is the average slope of the curve

00:12:03.086 --> 00:12:05.333
between these two points.
