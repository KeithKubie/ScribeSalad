00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
(Music)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Sometimes when I'm on a long plane flight,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I gaze out at all those mountains and deserts

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and try to get my head around how vast our Earth is.

00:00:26.585 --> 00:00:29.000
And then I remember that there's an object we see every day

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.692
that would literally fit one million Earths inside it.

00:00:32.815 --> 00:00:35.000
The sun seems impossibly big,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.077
but in the great scheme of things, it's a pinprick,

00:00:39.077 --> 00:00:43.000
one of about 400 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.123
which you can see on a clear night

00:00:45.123 --> 00:00:48.123
as a pale, white mist 
stretched across the sky.

00:00:48.123 --> 00:00:49.023
And it gets worse.

00:00:49.023 --> 00:00:52.985
There are maybe 100 billion galaxies detectable by our telescopes,

00:00:53.723 --> 00:00:58.000
so if each star was the size of a single grain of sand,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
just the Milky Way has enough stars to fill

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
a 30 foot by 30 foot stretch of beach three feet deep with sand.

00:01:05.877 --> 00:01:08.615
And the entire Earth doesn't have enough beaches

00:01:08.615 --> 00:01:11.000
to represent the stars in the overall universe.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Such a beach would continue for literally hundreds of millions of miles.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.000
Holy Stephen Hawking, that is a lot of stars.

00:01:19.862 --> 00:01:22.000
But he and other physicists now believe in

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
a reality that is unimaginably bigger still.

00:01:26.138 --> 00:01:29.000
I mean, first of all, the 100 billion galaxies within range of our telescopes

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
are probably a minuscule fraction of the total.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Space itself is expanding

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
at an accelerating pace. The vast majority of the galaxies

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
are separating from us so fast

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that light from them may never reach us.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Still, our physical reality here on Earth

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.400
is intimately connected to those distant, invisible galaxies.

00:01:49.908 --> 00:01:52.000
We can think of them as part of our universe.

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:55.000
They make up a single, giant edifice,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
obeying the same physical laws and all made from the same types of atoms, electrons,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
protons, quarks, neutrinos that make up you and me.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
However, recent theories in physics,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
including one called string theory,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
are now telling us there could be countless other universes,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
built on different types of particles,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
with different properties, obeying different laws.

00:02:14.831 --> 00:02:17.000
Most of these universes could never support life,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and might flash in and out of existence in a nanosecond,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.446
but nonetheless, combined

00:02:22.446 --> 00:02:26.000
they make up a vast multiverse of possible universes.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
in up to 11 dimensions, featuring wonders beyond our wildest imagination.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And the leading version of string theory

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
predicts a multiverse made of up to 10 to the 500 universes.

00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:40.000
That's a one followed by 500 zeroes,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
a number so vast that if every atom in our observable universe

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
had its own universe

00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:49.000
and all of the atoms in all of those universes

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
each had their own universe,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and you repeated that for two more cycles,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
you'd still be at a tiny fraction of the total --

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.985
namely, one trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillionth.

00:03:07.585 --> 00:03:10.000
But even that number is minuscule compared to

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
another number: infinity.

00:03:14.415 --> 00:03:16.000
Some physicists think the space-time continuum

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
is literally infinite, and that it contains an infinite number

00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:22.000
of so-called pocket universes with varying properties.

00:03:22.231 --> 00:03:24.000
How's your brain doing?

00:03:24.862 --> 00:03:27.000
But quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I mean, the theory's been proven true beyond all doubt,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
but interpreting it is baffling.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And some physicists think you can only un-baffle it

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
if you imagine that huge numbers of parallel universes

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
are being spawned every moment,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and many of these universes would actually be very like the world we're in,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
would include multiple copies of you.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
In one such universe, you'd graduate with honors and marry the person of your dreams.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
In another, not so much.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
There are still some scientists who would say, hogwash.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
The only meaningful answer to the question of how many universes there are is one,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
only one universe.

00:04:02.538 --> 00:04:05.000
And a few philosophers and mystics

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
might argue that even our own universe is an illusion.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So, as you can see,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
right now there is no agreement on this question,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
not even close.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
All we know is, the answer is somewhere between zero and infinity.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.000
Well, I guess we know one other thing:

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
This is a pretty cool time to be studying physics.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.000
We just might be undergoing

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge that humanity has ever seen.
