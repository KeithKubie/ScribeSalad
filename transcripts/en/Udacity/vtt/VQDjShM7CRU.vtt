00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.467
We know that we can solve a system of equations graphically. Let's consider some

00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:08.647
rental car companies again. This time, we're going to look at a new one called

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:12.825
Lucky Cars. Lucky Cars is going to charge $12 for a registration fee and $7 per

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:17.219
hour. Car-nival, the one we seen before, charges $10 for a registration fee and

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:21.428
$10 per hour. Let's look at these graphs. Here are the two equations for the

00:00:21.428 --> 00:00:25.587
cost of the rental car. And here are the two lines. So, when looking at this

00:00:25.587 --> 00:00:29.897
graph, we can see that the intersection lies somewhere in this region. Based on

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:33.862
our graph, which of these points represents the intersection or when the

00:00:33.862 --> 00:00:35.270
companies cost the same?
