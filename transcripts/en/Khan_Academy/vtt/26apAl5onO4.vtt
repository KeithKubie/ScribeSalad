00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.240
Welcome back.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.620
We're on problem number
six, on page 670.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:16.980
If the average of 6, 6, 12,
16, and x-- the average is

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.220
equal to x, what is
the value of x?

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.420
So if I were to average all
these numbers, I get x.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.280
How do I average?

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.070
I add them up, I add up the
numbers, and I divide by the

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.200
number of numbers there are.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.960
So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
numbers, so I divide by that.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.220
And they're saying that this
average is going to equal x.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.140
So let's multiply
both sides by 5.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:47.400
And I get 6 plus 6 plus 12 plus
16 plus x is equal to

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.570
20-- my brain is malfunctioning,
the average is

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.550
equal to x, right?

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.095
So I have to multiply
both sides by 5.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.610
So I multiply both sides
by 5, I get 5x.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.110
Right?

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.660
This is the average, and they
say the average is equal to x.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.050
Multiply both sides by 5, you
get rid of the 5 in the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.970
denominator here, you get 5x
on the right-hand side.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.990
And what's the sum?

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.852
6 plus 6 is 12, 12 plus 12
is 24, 24 plus 16 is 40.

00:01:18.852 --> 00:01:23.300
So we get 40 plus x
is equal to 5x.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.530
Subtract x from both sides,
40 is equal to 4x.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.730
Divide both sides by 4, you
get x is equal to 10.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.200
And that is choice D.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.450
Next problem.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.020
Let me draw this triangle.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.640
Let me try my best to
draw the triangle.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.200
Looks something like that.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.372
And then there's an altitude
right here, just

00:01:54.372 --> 00:01:56.760
drop straight down.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.090
And then they tell us that
this is a 90-- or

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.550
do they tell us?

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.070
My cousin who used my book drew
over it, so I'm not sure.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.720
But I'm pretty sure they
tell us that this

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.770
is a 90 degree angle.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.660
For the figure above, what
is the value of z?

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:21.470
So they say this is z, this
is y, this is 2y,

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.690
and this is 40 degrees.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.110
So what is z?

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.280
So we know this is a 90 degree
angle, and we know that z plus

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.620
y plus 90 is equal to 180.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.490
So if we know what y is,
we could figure out z.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.520
And how can we figure out y?

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.760
Well we know that 2y-- if we
look at this right-hand

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.600
triangle-- we know that
2y plus 40 plus

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:59.130
90 is equal to 180.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.960
Right?

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.480
So 2y plus 130 is
equal to 180.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.780
2y is equal to 50 degrees.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.020
y is equal to 25 degrees.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.970
So this is 25 degrees.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.170
I really wish I could read this
problem, I'm pretty sure

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.730
they drew in a little
perpindicular-- but anyway, we

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.480
might have been able
to address it

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.550
even if they didn't.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:31.980
But if y is 25, then we know
that z plus 25 plus 90 is

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.800
equal to 180.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.970
z plus 115 is equal to 180.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.310
z is equal to-- subtract
115 from both sides,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.980
what's 80 minus 15?

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.140
65.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.200
The choice is C.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.750
Next problem, problem
number eight.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.400
A computer program randomly
selects a

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.000
positive 2 digit integer.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.720
If the integer selected
is odd, twice

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.830
that integer is printed.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.690
So odd, it prints
2 times integer.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.079
If the integer is even, the
integer itself is printed.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:26.350
So if it's even, it just
prints the integer.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.780
So if it's an odd and you
multiply it by 2, it's

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.600
actually going to print an even
integer no matter what.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.670
If the integer printed is 26,
which of the following could

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.040
have been the integer
selected?

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.170
So all we see is 26.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.460
We just see 26.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.590
So 26 could've been generated
one of two ways.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.780
It could have been generated
by an even number that was

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.420
just kept the same.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.290
Well, if it was an even number
that was kept the same and you

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.960
got 26, then we know that
the number is 26.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.480
The number that generated
was 26.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.010
The other possibility is it
could've been an odd number

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.770
that was doubled, right?

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.180
If it was an odd number that
was doubled, that means 2

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.620
times the odd number
is equal to 26.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.860
So that means that the number
would have to be 13, right?

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.560
13 times odd-- sorry-- 2 times
odd-- these are the two

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.130
situations-- 2 times odd is
going to be equal to 26, in

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.350
which case odd is equal to 13.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.730
Or 1 times even is going to be
equal to 26, it which case

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.870
even equals 26.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.330
So the number generated could've
been 26 or it could

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.760
have been 13.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.900
And those are choices 1
and 2, and that's C.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.180
Next problem, problem
number nine.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.110
They give you choice 52 in
that last problem just to

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.730
confuse you, to actually end
up doubling the 26, but we

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.500
know that the odd number was
doubled to get 26, so the

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.520
number generated would
have been 13.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.710
Problem number nine.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.575
How many seconds are there in
m minutes and s seconds?

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.590
Well, how many seconds
are there per minute?

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.500
Let's write this expression
as m minutes

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.140
plus s seconds, right?

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.840
Well, what does m equal
in terms of seconds?

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.060
Or how many seconds are
there per minute?

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.680
Well, we know that there are
60 seconds per m, right?

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:54.260
Or we could say that 60 seconds
is equal to 1m, right?

00:06:54.260 --> 00:07:02.110
So if there's 60 seconds in 1m,
how many-- actually, I'm

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.490
confusing the issue, let
me write it this way.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.090
m minutes, right?

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.290
There's m minutes.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.350
How many seconds are
there per minute?

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.787
Let me start over, because
I think I confused

00:07:12.787 --> 00:07:14.040
you a little bit.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.620
So I'm going to write--
actually, let me write it

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.080
without m and s, that's what
confusing me as well.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:29.490
Let's say I have x minutes plus
y seconds, and I want to

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.350
convert it all into seconds.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:38.090
Well, we know that there are 60
seconds per minute, right?

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.490
So if we want to convert a
minute to seconds, we write x

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:54.530
minutes times 60 seconds per
minute plus y seconds.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.880
And so the minutes will cancel
out, and so you're left with

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.030
60 times x-- and this is
something that you'll learn in

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.110
physics class, that you can
treat units just like you

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.710
would treat variables, and
they'll cancel out similarly.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.850
So you'd get 60x-- right, the
minutes have canceled out--

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.720
let me switch colors--
you'll get 60 times x

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.911
seconds, plus y seconds.

00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:22.870
So your total number of
seconds is 60x plus y.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.500
And in the problem though, in
minutes they didn't say x,

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.610
they said m, so x is
m, and then y is s.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:39.030
So 60m plus s, so
that's choice A.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.600
And this might have been a
little confusing, let me do it

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.480
a simpler way, or maybe a more
intuitive way for you.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.320
There's m minutes, how many
seconds are in m minutes?

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.420
Think about it.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.600
If there is-- if I'm talking
about 2 minutes, there's 60

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.160
seconds per minute, so if I
said 2 minutes, I would

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.260
multiply 2 times 60, and I
would get to 120 seconds.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.960
If it was 5 minutes, I would
multiply 5 times 60, and get

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.760
to 300 seconds.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.620
So if I have m minutes,
I'll multiply 60 times

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:21.070
m to get 60m seconds.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:26.120
And of course, they said m
minutes plus s seconds.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.390
So now I have 60m seconds,
plus these s seconds.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:36.080
So my total number of seconds
is 60m plus s.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.680
This is a more intuitive
way, maybe.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.560
You should always try out
numbers, and hopefully it'll

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.750
make a little bit more sense.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.570
The way I did it previously is
how you would do it in physics

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.230
class, where you would actually
cancel out the units

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.990
and make sure you're doing
it the right way.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.780
See you in the next video.
