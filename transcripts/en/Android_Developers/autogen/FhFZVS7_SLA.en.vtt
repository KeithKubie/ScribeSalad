moderator question I was wondering about

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.070
moderator question I was wondering about
 

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.680
moderator question I was wondering about
the two native apps the phone app and

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:08.690
the two native apps the phone app and
 

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:12.290
the two native apps the phone app and
the People app mm-hmm so with the phone

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:12.300
the People app mm-hmm so with the phone
 

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.310
the People app mm-hmm so with the phone
app and the people have to list views

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:16.320
app and the people have to list views
 

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.290
app and the people have to list views
that load lists of contacts yeah it

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:21.300
that load lists of contacts yeah it
 

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.600
that load lists of contacts yeah it
looks like the People app does something

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:23.610
looks like the People app does something
 

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.029
looks like the People app does something
similar to there's an Android training

00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039
similar to there's an Android training
 

00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:29.330
similar to there's an Android training
that does a bit loading bitmaps

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:29.340
that does a bit loading bitmaps
 

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.690
that does a bit loading bitmaps
efficiently and if you think you guys

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:32.700
efficiently and if you think you guys
 

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.380
efficiently and if you think you guys
actually give a a demo I think it's

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:36.390
actually give a a demo I think it's
 

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:40.940
actually give a a demo I think it's
called bitmap fun yeah and it handles

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:40.950
called bitmap fun yeah and it handles
 

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:45.290
called bitmap fun yeah and it handles
loading bitmaps efficiently and it looks

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.300
loading bitmaps efficiently and it looks
 

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.540
loading bitmaps efficiently and it looks
like the People app does something along

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:47.550
like the People app does something along
 

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.570
like the People app does something along
those lines but the phone app

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:51.580
those lines but the phone app
 

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.800
those lines but the phone app
if you look at the list of contacts

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:55.810
if you look at the list of contacts
 

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.220
if you look at the list of contacts
there's like some list that the bitmaps

00:08:59.220 --> 00:08:59.230
there's like some list that the bitmaps
 

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.949
there's like some list that the bitmaps
seem to be cast or they're already

00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959
seem to be cast or they're already
 

00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:05.250
seem to be cast or they're already
they've already been stored in cache and

they've already been stored in cache and
 

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.500
they've already been stored in cache and
at any time you leave the phone app and

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:07.510
at any time you leave the phone app and
 

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:11.880
at any time you leave the phone app and
go back in it's not like it retries to

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:11.890
go back in it's not like it retries to
 

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:17.970
go back in it's not like it retries to
grab those maps yeah though is it yep is

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:17.980
grab those maps yeah though is it yep is
 

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.920
grab those maps yeah though is it yep is
it doing something different huh yeah it

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:22.930
it doing something different huh yeah it
 

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.620
it doing something different huh yeah it
probably is the phone app is a high

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:25.630
probably is the phone app is a high
 

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.730
probably is the phone app is a high
priority I'm guessing it's always

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:26.740

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.380

running to actually answer the phone

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:28.390

calls so maybe it's just keeping this

00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:31.089
calls so maybe it's just keeping this
 

00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:35.190

list in memory okay yeah I mean the

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.720

source is available so you can always

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:36.730
source is available so you can always
 

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:41.910
source is available so you can always
have a look through if you yeah it's

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920
have a look through if you yeah it's
 

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.870
have a look through if you yeah it's
probably catching them anyway even if

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880
probably catching them anyway even if
 

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.190
probably catching them anyway even if
you reboot your phone and have a look

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:44.200
you reboot your phone and have a look
 

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.720
you reboot your phone and have a look

yeah I imagine that's the case I mean

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:02.529
yeah I imagine that's the case I mean
 

00:10:02.529 --> 00:10:03.840
yeah I imagine that's the case I mean
I've never seen that the phone app would

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:03.850
I've never seen that the phone app would
 

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.220
I've never seen that the phone app would
not be running

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:05.230
not be running
 

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.569
not be running
I'll see if you can see it inside the

00:10:08.569 --> 00:10:08.579
I'll see if you can see it inside the
 

00:10:08.579 --> 00:10:12.449
I'll see if you can see it inside the
all the running apps because something

00:10:12.449 --> 00:10:12.459
all the running apps because something
 

00:10:12.459 --> 00:10:17.730
all the running apps because something
like it grabs all the names and the

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:17.740
like it grabs all the names and the
 

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.880
like it grabs all the names and the
numbers without basically without any

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:20.890
numbers without basically without any
 

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:24.780
numbers without basically without any
hiccups I'm scrolling yeah

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:24.790
hiccups I'm scrolling yeah
 

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.979
hiccups I'm scrolling yeah
like everything's completely cached

00:10:28.979 --> 00:10:28.989
 

00:10:28.989 --> 00:10:31.869
I doubt the name and number is that

00:10:31.869 --> 00:10:31.879
I doubt the name and number is that
 

00:10:31.879 --> 00:10:34.900
I doubt the name and number is that
that's just doing am content Friday

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:34.910
that's just doing am content Friday
 

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:35.889
that's just doing am content Friday
query

00:10:35.889 --> 00:10:35.899
query
 

00:10:35.899 --> 00:10:42.999
query
yeah but probably it startup I mean I

00:10:42.999 --> 00:10:43.009
yeah but probably it startup I mean I
 

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:44.590
yeah but probably it startup I mean I
know the learning the bitmap is the

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:44.600
know the learning the bitmap is the
 

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.470
know the learning the bitmap is the
expensive operation

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:49.480
 

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.340
well yeah be it depends where you

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:51.350
well yeah be it depends where you
 

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.689
well yeah be it depends where you
learned it from me all the images on the

00:10:54.689 --> 00:10:54.699
learned it from me all the images on the
 

00:10:54.699 --> 00:10:57.519
learned it from me all the images on the
contacts will be on local storage

00:10:57.519 --> 00:10:57.529
contacts will be on local storage
 

00:10:57.529 --> 00:10:59.169
contacts will be on local storage
somewhere so yeah local storage it's not

00:10:59.169 --> 00:10:59.179
somewhere so yeah local storage it's not
 

00:10:59.179 --> 00:11:00.160
somewhere so yeah local storage it's not
like from the network

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:00.170
like from the network
 

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.530
like from the network
exactly so it'll be quicker anyway all

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:02.540
exactly so it'll be quicker anyway all
 

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.780
exactly so it'll be quicker anyway all
load in milliseconds rather than seconds

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:04.790
load in milliseconds rather than seconds
 

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:09.009
load in milliseconds rather than seconds
and so most of them are but there could

00:11:09.009 --> 00:11:09.019
and so most of them are but there could
 

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:14.609
and so most of them are but there could
be some linked with your social accounts

00:11:14.609 --> 00:11:14.619
 

00:11:14.619 --> 00:11:17.289
but even well even the social accounts

00:11:17.289 --> 00:11:17.299
but even well even the social accounts
 

00:11:17.299 --> 00:11:18.340
but even well even the social accounts
they still have to put it into the

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:18.350
they still have to put it into the
 

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.660
they still have to put it into the
content provider and the cobbler avoid

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:19.670
content provider and the cobbler avoid
 

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.759

the contacts content rather saves the

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:21.769
the contacts content rather saves the
 

00:11:21.769 --> 00:11:23.949
the contacts content rather saves the
files oh yeah okay

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:23.959
files oh yeah okay
 

00:11:23.959 --> 00:11:26.369
files oh yeah okay
and so if they've always local mmhmm

00:11:26.369 --> 00:11:26.379
and so if they've always local mmhmm
 

00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:28.900
and so if they've always local mmhmm
yeah actually I've got them to load so

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:28.910
yeah actually I've got them to load so
 

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.150
yeah actually I've got them to load so
it is starting on startup if you go into

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:31.160
it is starting on startup if you go into
 

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.799
it is starting on startup if you go into
settings you can find one called

00:11:32.799 --> 00:11:32.809
settings you can find one called
 

00:11:32.809 --> 00:11:35.109
settings you can find one called
phone slash messaging storage and you

00:11:35.109 --> 00:11:35.119
phone slash messaging storage and you
 

00:11:35.119 --> 00:11:37.419
phone slash messaging storage and you
can force close it and if you do that

00:11:37.419 --> 00:11:37.429
can force close it and if you do that
 

00:11:37.429 --> 00:11:38.769
can force close it and if you do that
when you're next if you force closed

00:11:38.769 --> 00:11:38.779
when you're next if you force closed
 

00:11:38.779 --> 00:11:40.809
when you're next if you force closed
phone and phone messaging storage and

00:11:40.809 --> 00:11:40.819
phone and phone messaging storage and
 

00:11:40.819 --> 00:11:41.679
phone and phone messaging storage and
then go back and load the application

00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:41.689
then go back and load the application
 

00:11:41.689 --> 00:11:43.960
then go back and load the application
you can see all the icons start to load

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:43.970
you can see all the icons start to load
 

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.960
you can see all the icons start to load
again okay so it's the launching on

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:46.970
again okay so it's the launching on
 

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.350
again okay so it's the launching on
startup it does request the boot on the

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360
startup it does request the boot on the
 

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.939
startup it does request the boot on the
boot off startup permission launch so

00:11:54.939 --> 00:11:54.949
boot off startup permission launch so
 

00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:56.079
boot off startup permission launch so
yeah it looks like it's just starting on

00:11:56.079 --> 00:11:56.089
yeah it looks like it's just starting on
 

00:11:56.089 --> 00:11:57.309
yeah it looks like it's just starting on
startup and doing the exactly the same

00:11:57.309 --> 00:11:57.319
startup and doing the exactly the same
 

00:11:57.319 --> 00:11:59.679
startup and doing the exactly the same
thing to cache the data at that point

00:11:59.679 --> 00:11:59.689
thing to cache the data at that point
 

00:11:59.689 --> 00:12:05.850
thing to cache the data at that point
than staying yeah you know trying to

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:05.860
than staying yeah you know trying to
 

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:10.359
than staying yeah you know trying to
display some list similar to that do you

00:12:10.359 --> 00:12:10.369
display some list similar to that do you
 

00:12:10.369 --> 00:12:14.439
display some list similar to that do you
think it from a design perspective do

00:12:14.439 --> 00:12:14.449
think it from a design perspective do
 

00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:17.470
think it from a design perspective do
you think it's a big hindrance to have

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.480
you think it's a big hindrance to have
 

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:23.710
you think it's a big hindrance to have
to every time load those images each

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720
to every time load those images each
 

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:29.889
to every time load those images each
time without saving it to cash to

00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:29.899
time without saving it to cash to
 

00:12:29.899 --> 00:12:33.489
time without saving it to cash to
something on hard cash every time to

00:12:33.489 --> 00:12:33.499
something on hard cash every time to
 

00:12:33.499 --> 00:12:35.679
something on hard cash every time to
actually cool them out of the yeah

00:12:35.679 --> 00:12:35.689
actually cool them out of the yeah
 

00:12:35.689 --> 00:12:37.840
actually cool them out of the yeah
context completely what I'm doing is

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:37.850
context completely what I'm doing is
 

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:41.019
context completely what I'm doing is
clearing the cache each time the app is

00:12:41.019 --> 00:12:41.029
clearing the cache each time the app is
 

00:12:41.029 --> 00:12:42.380
clearing the cache each time the app is
killed

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:42.390
killed
 

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.270
killed
yeah the problem is if you don't do that

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:44.280
yeah the problem is if you don't do that
 

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.800
yeah the problem is if you don't do that
when someone changes the contact photo

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:45.810
when someone changes the contact photo
 

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:46.910
when someone changes the contact photo
you're not going to pick it up are you

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920
you're not going to pick it up are you
 

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.890
you're not going to pick it up are you
so it's a good idea to do what you're

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:48.900
so it's a good idea to do what you're
 

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.300
so it's a good idea to do what you're
doing and then reload them from the

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:50.310
doing and then reload them from the
 

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.140
doing and then reload them from the
content provider okay

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:53.150
content provider okay
 

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.360
content provider okay
so just because it's not loading at the

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:56.370
so just because it's not loading at the
 

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.770
so just because it's not loading at the
same speed of the phone app doesn't mean

00:12:59.770 --> 00:12:59.780
same speed of the phone app doesn't mean
 

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.420
same speed of the phone app doesn't mean
it's not doing it efficiently because

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:02.430
it's not doing it efficiently because
 

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.740
it's not doing it efficiently because
I'm I'm doing it this similar way the

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:05.750
I'm I'm doing it this similar way the
 

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:10.280
I'm I'm doing it this similar way the
bitmap fun demonstration yeah I would

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:10.290
bitmap fun demonstration yeah I would
 

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.510
bitmap fun demonstration yeah I would
say that's fine they are cached on the

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:11.520
say that's fine they are cached on the
 

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.890
say that's fine they are cached on the
disk and you're just loading them

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:12.900
disk and you're just loading them
 

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.630
disk and you're just loading them
through the content provider anyway so

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:14.640
through the content provider anyway so
 

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.010
through the content provider anyway so
re cashing them a second time on the

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:16.020
re cashing them a second time on the
 

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.990
re cashing them a second time on the
disk isn't going to help too much yeah

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000
disk isn't going to help too much yeah
 

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.270
disk isn't going to help too much yeah
it's the same storage so making

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:20.280
it's the same storage so making
 

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.410
it's the same storage so making
difference if I know because you'll be

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420
difference if I know because you'll be
 

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.330
difference if I know because you'll be
probably saving two SD card or external

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:23.340
probably saving two SD card or external
 

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.380
probably saving two SD card or external
storage whereas the contacts provider

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:27.390
storage whereas the contacts provider
 

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:32.300
storage whereas the contacts provider
that's saved on your data storage and

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:32.310
that's saved on your data storage and
 

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:34.850
that's saved on your data storage and
which depend on the phone might the same

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:34.860
which depend on the phone might the same
 

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.760
which depend on the phone might the same
storage or might be slightly slower so

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:36.770
storage or might be slightly slower so
 

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:38.900
storage or might be slightly slower so
sounds like you make doing it perfectly

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:38.910
sounds like you make doing it perfectly
 

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:39.830
sounds like you make doing it perfectly
on your way I would stick with what

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:39.840
on your way I would stick with what
 

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.760
on your way I would stick with what
you're doing okay sounds good what are

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:43.770
you're doing okay sounds good what are
 

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.620
you're doing okay sounds good what are
your guys who's the speed maybe you

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:45.630
your guys who's the speed maybe you
 

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.200

could catch the first couple closer but

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:48.210
could catch the first couple closer but
 

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.730
could catch the first couple closer but
I said he wouldn't catch the whole list

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:49.740
I said he wouldn't catch the whole list
 

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:54.230
I said he wouldn't catch the whole list
yeah okay all right

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240

you can specify and the best thing to do
 

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:46.509
you can specify and the best thing to do
is definitely to specify an executor and

the location where the expansion file
 

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.399
the location where the expansion file
should be there is no expansion file at

00:18:17.399 --> 00:18:17.409
should be there is no expansion file at

all have you got any tips on that do you

all have you got any tips on that do you
do you know where I should look at now

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:23.740
do you know where I should look at now

we definitely re-upload the expansion

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080
we definitely re-upload the expansion
 

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.710
we definitely re-upload the expansion
files when you change the apk always it

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720
files when you change the apk always it
 

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.019

always a reload yeah I can check with

00:18:31.019 --> 00:18:31.029
always a reload yeah I can check with
 

00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:32.850
always a reload yeah I can check with
the publisher site team here but I've

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:32.860
the publisher site team here but I've
 

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.769
the publisher site team here but I've
heard some inconsistencies before and

00:18:34.769 --> 00:18:34.779
heard some inconsistencies before and
 

00:18:34.779 --> 00:18:37.529
heard some inconsistencies before and
it's just a good idea to upload the

00:18:37.529 --> 00:18:37.539
it's just a good idea to upload the
 

00:18:37.539 --> 00:18:39.510
it's just a good idea to upload the
expansion files we've had it before that

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520
expansion files we've had it before that
 

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.100

apks have been uploaded and then the

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:41.110
apks have been uploaded and then the
 

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.480
apks have been uploaded and then the

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:42.490
expansion files weren't being downloaded
 

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:43.680

things because they weren't associated

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:43.690
things because they weren't associated
 

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.669
things because they weren't associated
with that apk okay so I should just try

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679
with that apk okay so I should just try
 

00:18:47.679 --> 00:18:49.350
with that apk okay so I should just try
and upload it again and see if that

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360
and upload it again and see if that
 

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.630
and upload it again and see if that
works yeah yeah you may be downloading

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:51.640
works yeah yeah you may be downloading
 

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.980
works yeah yeah you may be downloading
an empty expansion file if there's

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:52.990
an empty expansion file if there's
 

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:54.269
an empty expansion file if there's
nothing that science about apk and then

00:18:54.269 --> 00:18:54.279
nothing that science about apk and then
 

00:18:54.279 --> 00:18:55.860
nothing that science about apk and then
that's why you're just seeing a blank

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:55.870
that's why you're just seeing a blank
 

00:18:55.870 --> 00:19:01.830
that's why you're just seeing a blank

and then college here needed we studied

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:39.370
and then college here needed we studied
 

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:44.510

this he short but I really kind of like

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520
this he short but I really kind of like
 

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:51.300
this he short but I really kind of like
preparing Java for Android and give me

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:51.310
preparing Java for Android and give me
 

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:57.530
preparing Java for Android and give me
some advice I could build very good

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:57.540
some advice I could build very good
 

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.020
some advice I could build very good
Android apps

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:00.030
Android apps
 

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.400
Android apps
sorry we missed one I missed one word

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:02.410
sorry we missed one I missed one word
 

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.680

another do I have to get something to
 

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:09.320
another do I have to get something to
build very good Android apps I have to

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:09.330
build very good Android apps I have to
 

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:13.050
build very good Android apps I have to
do I have to be a Java program - yeah

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:13.060
do I have to be a Java program - yeah
 

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.060
do I have to be a Java program - yeah
guilt definitely helps if you know your

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:15.070
guilt definitely helps if you know your
 

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.810
guilt definitely helps if you know your
Java design patterns and you know how

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:17.820
Java design patterns and you know how
 

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.160
Java design patterns and you know how
the Java models work it can help make

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:20.170
the Java models work it can help make
 

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.470
the Java models work it can help make
better Android applications but you can

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480
better Android applications but you can
 

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.700
better Android applications but you can
definitely start off with simple Android

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:23.710
definitely start off with simple Android
 

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:26.100
definitely start off with simple Android
applications without too much knowledge

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.110
applications without too much knowledge
 

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.810
applications without too much knowledge

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:27.820
of Java I mean all the UI layer of
 

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.290
of Java I mean all the UI layer of
androids done without any standard Java

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:31.300
androids done without any standard Java
 

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:36.840
androids done without any standard Java

in it really yeah more the websites the
 

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:39.090
in it really yeah more the websites the
videos and then they can give me a good

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:39.100
videos and then they can give me a good
 

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.800

at some point and switched over to Java

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:50.170
at some point and switched over to Java
 

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:51.870
at some point and switched over to Java

to help with a migration for you yeah
 

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.980
to help with a migration for you yeah
definitely I would just get stuck into

00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:58.990
definitely I would just get stuck into
 

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.540
definitely I would just get stuck into
things I would just start coding Android

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:00.550
things I would just start coding Android
 

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.070
things I would just start coding Android
and get used to it and then as you come

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:02.080
and get used to it and then as you come
 

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.390
and get used to it and then as you come
across probably assume that they've

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:03.400
across probably assume that they've
 

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.710
across probably assume that they've
already been sold by someone else and

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720
already been sold by someone else and
 

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.420

look them up on the internet if you want

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:06.430
look them up on the internet if you want
 

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:07.680
look them up on the internet if you want
to figure out how to do a certain design

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:07.690
to figure out how to do a certain design
 

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:08.820
to figure out how to do a certain design
pattern in Java just look it up

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:08.830
pattern in Java just look it up
 

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.170
pattern in Java just look it up
sometimes are slightly different for

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:10.180
sometimes are slightly different for
 

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.340
sometimes are slightly different for
Android anyway because the way

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:11.350
Android anyway because the way
 

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:16.710
Android anyway because the way
activities work so yeah two integer into

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720
activities work so yeah two integer into
 

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.940
activities work so yeah two integer into
Android as we know thanks for me right

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:20.950
Android as we know thanks for me right
 

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.440
Android as we know thanks for me right
no problem thanks for joining us in

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:22.450
no problem thanks for joining us in
 

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:23.389
no problem thanks for joining us in

yeah I'm drew Kelly has put a question

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080
yeah I'm drew Kelly has put a question
 

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.889
yeah I'm drew Kelly has put a question
in the chat window right if I have an

00:21:30.889 --> 00:21:30.899
in the chat window right if I have an
 

00:21:30.899 --> 00:21:32.959
in the chat window right if I have an
intern service as the interface to a

00:21:32.959 --> 00:21:32.969
intern service as the interface to a
 

00:21:32.969 --> 00:21:34.879
intern service as the interface to a
rest service what is the best way to

00:21:34.879 --> 00:21:34.889
rest service what is the best way to
 

00:21:34.889 --> 00:21:38.769
rest service what is the best way to
have the intent service pop up and to me

00:21:38.769 --> 00:21:38.779
have the intent service pop up and to me
 

00:21:38.779 --> 00:21:41.119
have the intent service pop up and to me
progress dialog on the UI while the rest

00:21:41.119 --> 00:21:41.129
progress dialog on the UI while the rest
 

00:21:41.129 --> 00:21:43.729
progress dialog on the UI while the rest
call is asking do I need to use a

00:21:43.729 --> 00:21:43.739
call is asking do I need to use a
 

00:21:43.739 --> 00:21:47.499
call is asking do I need to use a
broadcast receiver oh I don't like

00:21:47.499 --> 00:21:47.509
broadcast receiver oh I don't like
 

00:21:47.509 --> 00:21:53.029
broadcast receiver oh I don't like
getting feedback from intensive and I

00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039
getting feedback from intensive and I
 

00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:54.409
getting feedback from intensive and I
always think of intense M is a one-shot

00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:54.419
always think of intense M is a one-shot
 

00:21:54.419 --> 00:21:56.029
always think of intense M is a one-shot
deal it's sewing for you and yeah

00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039
deal it's sewing for you and yeah
 

00:21:56.039 --> 00:21:57.680
deal it's sewing for you and yeah
exactly it's not something you want

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:57.690
exactly it's not something you want
 

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.149
exactly it's not something you want
feedback off or a callback or anything

00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159
feedback off or a callback or anything
 

00:21:59.159 --> 00:22:01.369
feedback off or a callback or anything
like that and so the way I'd personally

00:22:01.369 --> 00:22:01.379
like that and so the way I'd personally
 

00:22:01.379 --> 00:22:05.209
like that and so the way I'd personally
do that is do it normal service and then

00:22:05.209 --> 00:22:05.219
do that is do it normal service and then
 

00:22:05.219 --> 00:22:06.739
do that is do it normal service and then
run your background query on a

00:22:06.739 --> 00:22:06.749
run your background query on a
 

00:22:06.749 --> 00:22:09.379
run your background query on a
background for an executor and use a

00:22:09.379 --> 00:22:09.389
background for an executor and use a
 

00:22:09.389 --> 00:22:12.169
background for an executor and use a
handler to make sure a dialog which

00:22:12.169 --> 00:22:12.179
handler to make sure a dialog which
 

00:22:12.179 --> 00:22:14.649
handler to make sure a dialog which
feels kind of hacky from a service but

00:22:14.649 --> 00:22:14.659
feels kind of hacky from a service but
 

00:22:14.659 --> 00:22:17.379
feels kind of hacky from a service but
you want to do form activity really and

00:22:17.379 --> 00:22:17.389
you want to do form activity really and
 

00:22:17.389 --> 00:22:21.079
you want to do form activity really and
so yeah if you have an activity that's

00:22:21.079 --> 00:22:21.089
so yeah if you have an activity that's
 

00:22:21.089 --> 00:22:22.969
so yeah if you have an activity that's
banned to the service yeah exactly you

00:22:22.969 --> 00:22:22.979
banned to the service yeah exactly you
 

00:22:22.979 --> 00:22:26.989
banned to the service yeah exactly you
can request the progress Google i/o 2010

00:22:26.989 --> 00:22:26.999
can request the progress Google i/o 2010
 

00:22:26.999 --> 00:22:30.249
can request the progress Google i/o 2010
gave a talk on using intern service as

00:22:30.249 --> 00:22:30.259
gave a talk on using intern service as
 

00:22:30.259 --> 00:22:33.619
gave a talk on using intern service as
something for rest but as clients for

00:22:33.619 --> 00:22:33.629
something for rest but as clients for
 

00:22:33.629 --> 00:22:37.789
something for rest but as clients for
rest yeah that's fine but then showing

00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799
rest yeah that's fine but then showing
 

00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:40.969
rest yeah that's fine but then showing
the activity on the screen did it cover

00:22:40.969 --> 00:22:40.979
the activity on the screen did it cover
 

00:22:40.979 --> 00:22:44.599
the activity on the screen did it cover
that during the presentation and I think

00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:44.609
that during the presentation and I think
 

00:22:44.609 --> 00:22:47.149
that during the presentation and I think
any way I can think of that work nicely

00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159
any way I can think of that work nicely
 

00:22:47.159 --> 00:22:49.700
any way I can think of that work nicely
he is if that intern service is updating

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:49.710
he is if that intern service is updating
 

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:50.719
he is if that intern service is updating

no I didn't yeah and your and your

activities or Stasi getting read queried
 

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.779
activities or Stasi getting read queried
and the contract pod changes I send you

00:22:59.779 --> 00:22:59.789
and the contract pod changes I send you
 

00:22:59.789 --> 00:23:01.369

nice well I can think of using inter so

00:23:01.369 --> 00:23:01.379
nice well I can think of using inter so
 

00:23:01.379 --> 00:23:03.049
nice well I can think of using inter so
it's that kind of stuff this is another

00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:03.059
it's that kind of stuff this is another
 

00:23:03.059 --> 00:23:05.479
it's that kind of stuff this is another
good case for that async task talk that

each app has the permission set so only
 

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.950
each app has the permission set so only
the application can access them so I

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960
the application can access them so I
 

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.070

the access to the to the SD card and
 

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.180
the access to the to the SD card and
basically get a virtual mapping for the

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:42.190
basically get a virtual mapping for the
 

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:45.659
basically get a virtual mapping for the
SD card for each user so I don't think

with it and so I'm trying to rebuild

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:16.260
with it and so I'm trying to rebuild
 

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.890
with it and so I'm trying to rebuild
box2d just on my own and I'm having some

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:18.900
box2d just on my own and I'm having some
 

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.110
box2d just on my own and I'm having some
problems getting it to build with the

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120
problems getting it to build with the
 

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.770
problems getting it to build with the

currently is that details but you create

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:30.090
currently is that details but you create
 

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:31.910
currently is that details but you create
a special make file and you can then

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:31.920
a special make file and you can then
 

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.410
a special make file and you can then
include other make files from it so you

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:33.420
include other make files from it so you
 

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.300
include other make files from it so you
may need to do some that like includes

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:35.310
may need to do some that like includes
 

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.390
may need to do some that like includes
your the custom make file and I don't

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:38.400
your the custom make file and I don't
 

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.670
your the custom make file and I don't
really know that it's pulling the depth

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:40.680

array have a look at the source now it

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:56.860
array have a look at the source now it
 

00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:01.950

depends on if you basically added the
 

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.230
depends on if you basically added the
widget and then removed it or so you try

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240
widget and then removed it or so you try
 

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.170

yes basically what I do on our widget is

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:20.020
yes basically what I do on our widget is
 

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.200
yes basically what I do on our widget is
go through all the array all

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:22.210
go through all the array all
 

00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:24.630
go through all the array all
the time yeah matter how many instances

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640
the time yeah matter how many instances
 

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:29.180
the time yeah matter how many instances
in check and update them all or you can

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:29.190
in check and update them all or you can
 

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:32.370
in check and update them all or you can
lock the feature for more than one

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:32.380
lock the feature for more than one
 

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.450
lock the feature for more than one
widget on screen and see if you have

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:35.460
widget on screen and see if you have
 

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.609
widget on screen and see if you have
another instance running of the up

00:42:38.609 --> 00:42:38.619
another instance running of the up
 

00:42:38.619 --> 00:42:41.609
another instance running of the up
widget and then just pop up the dialogue

00:42:41.609 --> 00:42:41.619
widget and then just pop up the dialogue
 

00:42:41.619 --> 00:42:43.770

than when we just were running on the
 

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:46.800
than when we just were running on the
screen yeah yeah it's just the question

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:46.810
screen yeah yeah it's just the question
 

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:48.870

is implying that the documentation says
 

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.300
is implying that the documentation says
it may not bring up all the widget IDs

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:51.310
it may not bring up all the widget IDs
 

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:52.740
it may not bring up all the widget IDs
of all the current active widgets it may

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:52.750
of all the current active widgets it may
 

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:55.349
of all the current active widgets it may
just be a subset and maybe that would

00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359
just be a subset and maybe that would
 

00:42:55.359 --> 00:42:57.870
just be a subset and maybe that would
happen it's worth checking sauce maybe

00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:57.880
happen it's worth checking sauce maybe
 

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.060
happen it's worth checking sauce maybe
there's there is rate-limiting about how

there's there is rate-limiting about how
often widgets can update so if you've

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:01.930
often widgets can update so if you've
 

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:04.320
often widgets can update so if you've
updated one recently force an update to

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:04.330
updated one recently force an update to
 

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:05.849
updated one recently force an update to
it then maybe it won't request the on

00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:05.859
it then maybe it won't request the on
 

00:43:05.859 --> 00:43:09.420
it then maybe it won't request the on

and so yeah that's the STM solution I
 

00:48:06.039 --> 00:48:06.929
and so yeah that's the STM solution I
can think of I haven't looked at the

00:48:06.929 --> 00:48:06.939
can think of I haven't looked at the
 

00:48:06.939 --> 00:48:09.120
can think of I haven't looked at the
source yet I never look after this of

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:09.130
source yet I never look after this of
 

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:11.459
source yet I never look after this of
the reasons why my guess is that the

00:48:11.459 --> 00:48:11.469
the reasons why my guess is that the
 

00:48:11.469 --> 00:48:15.060
the reasons why my guess is that the
view group which is a DV XML these

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:15.070
view group which is a DV XML these
 

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:18.730
view group which is a DV XML these
needed so it can be replaced moving the

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:18.740
needed so it can be replaced moving the
 

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:20.920
needed so it can be replaced moving the
activity but that's my guessing with

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:20.930
