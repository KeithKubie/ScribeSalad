00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.830
Hunger's a huge problem in the greater Boston
area, there are estimates and studies that

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.599
indicate that about one in 10 people are food
insecure in the area, and then of course in

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.950
different populations, that number can be
quite a bit higher.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.290
There are hungry people all over, so it's
a huge problem, and we're trying to do a little

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.000
bit to help it with this program.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.410
We have 14 different dining facilities and
our students are under a mandatory meal plan,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.470
we have to be prepared to feed the numbers
that come in.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.850
In this business, we're bound to have food
leftover so we're just looking for a good

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.180
way to be able to take that food and put it
to good use.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.300
Food for Free is a food, rescue, and hunger
relief organization, we bridge the gap between

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.390
waste and want.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.350
One one side of the equation, there's a lot
of extra food out there, and on the other

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.789
side there's a lot of hungry people, and we
help connect the two.

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.550
Two nights a week, a team of student volunteers,
they're taking the leftover food from service

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.949
for the day and playing it up into meals.

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.150
They use a serving of grains, a serving of
protein, and a serving of vegetables, seal

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.560
them up, label them, put them in their freezer,
and then, our trucks come and pick them up

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.010
a couple times a week, and we get them out
to the families that need them.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.570
So Harvard students come in a group with a
bunch of other students and I think from their

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.140
perspective, it's a great way for them to
interact with the D-hall staff then also sort

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.780
of talk to each other and interact while they're
sort of creating this food, so it's a way

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.710
for students to get to know their local D-hall
staff, it's a way for students to create a

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.310
tangible result, and it's also a way for students
to reach out to the local community, in like

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.619
a very convenient way.

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.270
I think most students have really enjoyed
the experience that they've had with the family

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.890
meals program, there's a lot of people coming
away smiling, and sort of, happily taking

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.799
a picture, so I think a lot of people get
a lot out of it, and I've had a lot of people

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:01.560
ask if they can come again.
