hi I'm Rachel and I'm a student at

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500
hi I'm Rachel and I'm a student at

hi I'm Rachel and I'm a student at
Columbia but we see if theoretically a

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920
Columbia but we see if theoretically a
 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.619

human were able to travel at the speed

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629
human were able to travel at the speed
 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.580
human were able to travel at the speed
of light um my teacher told me somewhat

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590
of light um my teacher told me somewhat
 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.700
of light um my teacher told me somewhat
confusingly that we might see the the

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710
confusingly that we might see the the
 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.470
confusingly that we might see the the
past in the present or may have been the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480
past in the present or may have been the
 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.849
past in the present or may have been the
past in the future I can't really

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859
past in the future I can't really
 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.060
past in the future I can't really
remember simultaneously but whatever his

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070
remember simultaneously but whatever his
 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.320
remember simultaneously but whatever his
response was it didn't really make a lot

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
response was it didn't really make a lot
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.790
response was it didn't really make a lot
of sense to me so I was wondering if you

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800
of sense to me so I was wondering if you
 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.060
of sense to me so I was wondering if you
could give me a better clarification

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070
could give me a better clarification
 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.980
could give me a better clarification
Rachel this is a great question so about

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990
Rachel this is a great question so about
 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.660
Rachel this is a great question so about
what happens when you go to the speed of

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670
what happens when you go to the speed of
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.519
what happens when you go to the speed of
light I mean this is a great we love to

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529
light I mean this is a great we love to
 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.350
light I mean this is a great we love to
ask this question in physics class it's

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360
ask this question in physics class it's
 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.819
ask this question in physics class it's
big fun here on big thing but if you

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829
big fun here on big thing but if you
 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.130
big fun here on big thing but if you
have mass which we all do

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140
have mass which we all do
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.930
have mass which we all do
we are not pure energy we are not beams

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940
we are not pure energy we are not beams

that you cannot go the speed of light

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
that you cannot go the speed of light
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.299
that you cannot go the speed of light
you can go arbitrarily fast approaching

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309
you can go arbitrarily fast approaching
 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.709
you can go arbitrarily fast approaching
the speed of light but you can't quite

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
the speed of light but you can't quite
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.840
the speed of light but you can't quite
go the speed of light all the energy you

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850
go the speed of light all the energy you
 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.770
go the speed of light all the energy you
pump in just adds to your mass and this

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
pump in just adds to your mass and this
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.050
pump in just adds to your mass and this
seems incredible it adds to your mass

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
seems incredible it adds to your mass
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.730
seems incredible it adds to your mass
relative to something you're going to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740
relative to something you're going to
 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.660
relative to something you're going to
run into in a particle accelerator where

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670
run into in a particle accelerator where
 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.399
run into in a particle accelerator where
an atom smasher like at CERN in

Switzerland we call it a target that you

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
Switzerland we call it a target that you
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.280
Switzerland we call it a target that you
run into that said you can't help but

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290
run into that said you can't help but
 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.539
run into that said you can't help but
wonder what would happen if you go the

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
wonder what would happen if you go the
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.460
wonder what would happen if you go the
speed of light you got to figure the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470
speed of light you got to figure the
 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.960
speed of light you got to figure the
only light you'd see is the light come

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970
only light you'd see is the light come
 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.179
only light you'd see is the light come
that you'd run into either light that

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189
that you'd run into either light that
 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.730
that you'd run into either light that
you happen to cross paths with or light

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740
you happen to cross paths with or light
 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.200
you happen to cross paths with or light
that was beamed straight at you you

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
that was beamed straight at you you
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.539
that was beamed straight at you you
wouldn't see anything else about the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549
wouldn't see anything else about the
 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.749
wouldn't see anything else about the
change in time there's been a lot of

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759
change in time there's been a lot of
 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.830
change in time there's been a lot of
talk about that can time have a speed

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840
talk about that can time have a speed
 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.749
talk about that can time have a speed
effectively the can you go backwards in

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
effectively the can you go backwards in
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.260
effectively the can you go backwards in
time apparently not people live to

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
time apparently not people live to
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.420
time apparently not people live to
speculate but they can't get enough what

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430
speculate but they can't get enough what
 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.520
speculate but they can't get enough what
about this what happens if you fall into

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530
about this what happens if you fall into
 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.230
about this what happens if you fall into
a wormhole and then you like end up at

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240
a wormhole and then you like end up at
 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.670
a wormhole and then you like end up at
another part of the universe like at

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
another part of the universe like at
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.270
another part of the universe like at
another time maybe but if you try to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
another time maybe but if you try to
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.749
another time maybe but if you try to
fall into a gravitational thing of that

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759
fall into a gravitational thing of that
 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.249
fall into a gravitational thing of that
strength a black hole for example which

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259
strength a black hole for example which
 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.929
strength a black hole for example which
is a star with so much gravity light

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
is a star with so much gravity light
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.139

doesn't escape it would kill you you'd

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
doesn't escape it would kill you you'd
 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.719
doesn't escape it would kill you you'd
be sin gravity between your feet and

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729
be sin gravity between your feet and
 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.279
be sin gravity between your feet and
your head would be so that just the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
your head would be so that just the
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.199
your head would be so that just the
difference in gravity would be so high

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209
difference in gravity would be so high
 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.550
difference in gravity would be so high
it would stretch you

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
it would stretch you
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.740
it would stretch you
into a piece of spaghetti which would

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750
into a piece of spaghetti which would
 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.380
into a piece of spaghetti which would
also make you dead but you can't help

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390
also make you dead but you can't help
 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.390
also make you dead but you can't help
but wonder that's a great question my

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400
but wonder that's a great question my
 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.840
but wonder that's a great question my
second question is um are there any

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850
second question is um are there any
 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.449
second question is um are there any
reasons besides ethical dilemmas that we

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459
reasons besides ethical dilemmas that we
 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.420
reasons besides ethical dilemmas that we
haven't shot some of our trash from

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430
haven't shot some of our trash from
 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.210
haven't shot some of our trash from
earth into space and I know it might

earth into space and I know it might
 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.160
earth into space and I know it might
contribute to space junk but if we shot

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170
contribute to space junk but if we shot
 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.880
contribute to space junk but if we shot
it far enough away um besides maybe then

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890
it far enough away um besides maybe then
 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.660

the downsides to doing that and why
 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.310
the downsides to doing that and why
haven't we if it might then clear up um

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320
haven't we if it might then clear up um
 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.540
haven't we if it might then clear up um
