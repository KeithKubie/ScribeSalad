CLAIM: "If you eat candy before bed you're
gonna have nightmares!" - true fact or strategic

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.220
parenting?

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.420
Hey everyone, Laci Green here.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.070
You know, for the longest time I believed
that sugar gave me nightmares.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.090
I think it started when I was really little
and my parents were trying to deter me from

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.170
eating too much candy.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.350
Come to find out, it's not just sugar...there
is a relationship between eating in general

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.460
and having nightmares.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.210
So basically just...stop eating guys.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.580
Small price to pay right?

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.870
When you eat, you rev up your metabolism to
process the food you've just consumed, boosting

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.370
your body's temperature.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.180
Which is interesting because at least for
me, nightmares are always a really hot, sweaty

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.180
affair.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.780
And not in a sexy way.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.410
These metabolic processes and digestion increase
brain activity while you sleep, and all that

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.300
interference can cause some disturbance.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.600
If your body is working hard enough, the effects
may bleed into REM, which occurs about 90

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.770
minutes into your sleep.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.570
REM, or Rapid Eye Movement, is the phase of
the sleep cycle where all the action happens.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.940
Your eyes are fluttering behind your eyelids,
your muscles relax, and your brain is really

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.940
active.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.670
REM is the phase where the majority of your
dreams and nightmares happen.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.049
Because nightmares are the type of dreams
that have the power to freak us out and wake

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.469
us up, people are more likely to remember
a nightmare than a dream.

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.700
And FYI everyone dreams, every night - some
people don't think they dream, but they just

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.399
don't remember them.

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.119
We tend to remember dreams that are happening
in the morning when we're about to wake up.

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.469
Some crazy stuff, huh?

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.450
So, going back to the full stomach thing -- it's
not just being full that could interfere with

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.450
your sleep.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.880
Spicy foods can also trigger bad dreams because
they're a little harder for your body to digest.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.950
One study in the International Journal of
Psychophysiology found that spicy foods disturbed

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.780
ALL their participants' sleep -- but it was
a really small study.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.399
The scientists think this could be related
to the fact that spicy foods elevate our body

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.399
temperature.

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.399
And what of the candy and junk food?

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.119
Ice cream and brownies, cakes and pies?

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.140
Sugar sugar sugar?

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.390
Most studies find no definitive conclusion
that "more sugar=more nightmares", but one

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.770
study published in the Journal of the Mind
and Body found that ice cream and candy bars

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.929
may increase brain wave activity while you're
digesting.

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.399
About 70% of the participants that were fed
junk food a half hour before bed had nightmares.

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.730
But there's no evidence yet that it's the
sugar ITSELF and not just eating right before

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.349
bed that's causing problems.

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.989
The takeaway here: if you don't want nightmares,
let your body do most its digesting BEFORE

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.030
you go to sleep.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.019
Do you notice any difference when you go to
bed on a full stomach?

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.050
Let me know down below.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:40.110
Sweet dreams, everyone!
