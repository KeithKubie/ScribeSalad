00:00:00.394 --> 00:00:04.248
- So what I have here
are 12 pieces of candy.

00:00:04.248 --> 00:00:07.754
The ones that are colored
in brown have chocolate

00:00:07.754 --> 00:00:10.435
on the outside and the ones that have a C

00:00:10.435 --> 00:00:11.809
on them means that they have coconut

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:12.645
on the inside.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.802
So for example, this one
over here in the top left,

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:17.206
it's made out of chocolate on the outside,

00:00:17.206 --> 00:00:19.088
but it doesn't have coconut on the inside.

00:00:19.088 --> 00:00:21.394
While this one right over
here is chocolate on the

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:24.517
outside and it has coconut on the inside.

00:00:24.517 --> 00:00:27.338
While this one, whoops,
I didn't want to do that,

00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:31.447
while this one right
over here does not have

00:00:31.447 --> 00:00:33.065
chocolate on the outside, but it does have

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:34.306
coconut on the inside.

00:00:34.306 --> 00:00:36.466
This one right over here has neither

00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.427
chocolate nor coconut.

00:00:38.427 --> 00:00:40.538
What I want to think
about is ways to represent

00:00:40.538 --> 00:00:43.326
this information that we are looking at.

00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:46.849
One way to do it is using a Venn diagram.

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:49.465
So let me draw a Venn diagram.

00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:54.465
So Venn diagram is one
way to represent it.

00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:57.277
The way it's typically
done, the convention,

00:00:57.277 --> 00:00:59.123
is that you would make
a rectangle to represent

00:00:59.123 --> 00:01:00.879
the universe that you
care about, in this case

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:01.973
it would be all the chocolates.

00:01:01.973 --> 00:01:04.550
All the numbers inside
of this should add up

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.014
to the number of chocolates I have.

00:01:06.014 --> 00:01:07.929
So it should add up to 12.

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:09.856
So that's our universe right over here.

00:01:09.856 --> 00:01:12.294
Then I'll draw circles
to represent the sets

00:01:12.294 --> 00:01:13.954
that I care about.

00:01:13.954 --> 00:01:15.835
So say for this one I care about the set

00:01:15.835 --> 00:01:18.169
of the things that have chocolate.

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:20.083
So I'll draw that with a circle.

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:22.064
You could draw them to scale, but I'm not

00:01:22.064 --> 00:01:23.027
going to draw them to scale.

00:01:23.027 --> 00:01:27.323
So that is my chocolate set, chocolate.

00:01:27.323 --> 00:01:29.646
That is my chocolate set.

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:32.128
Then I want to have a coconut set.

00:01:32.128 --> 00:01:35.986
So coconut.

00:01:35.986 --> 00:01:37.565
Once again, not drawn to scale.

00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:38.901
I drew them roughly the same size,

00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:41.573
but you can see the
chocolate set is bigger

00:01:41.573 --> 00:01:43.466
than the coconut set in reality.

00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:45.486
Coconut set.

00:01:45.486 --> 00:01:48.156
Now we can fill in the different sections.

00:01:48.156 --> 00:01:51.859
So how many of these things have chocolate

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:53.542
but no coconut?

00:01:53.542 --> 00:01:58.542
Let's see, we have one,
two, three, four, five,

00:01:59.463 --> 00:02:03.352
six have chocolate but no coconut.

00:02:04.788 --> 00:02:05.969
Let me do that in a different color

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.309
because I think the colors are important.

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:09.062
So let me do it in green.

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:14.062
So one, two, three, four, five, and six.

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.757
So this section right over here is six.

00:02:17.757 --> 00:02:18.929
Once again, I'm not
talking about the whole

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.611
brown thing, I'm talking about just this

00:02:21.611 --> 00:02:23.735
area that I've shaded in green.

00:02:23.735 --> 00:02:26.487
Now how many have chocolate and coconut?

00:02:26.487 --> 00:02:29.006
Chocolate and coconut.

00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:33.127
Well that's going to be one, two, three.

00:02:33.127 --> 00:02:35.646
So three of them have
chocolate and coconut.

00:02:35.646 --> 00:02:37.828
Notice that's this section here that's

00:02:37.828 --> 00:02:39.094
in the overlap between.

00:02:39.094 --> 00:02:42.172
Three of them go into both
sets, both categories.

00:02:42.172 --> 00:02:45.224
These three have coconut
and they have chocolate.

00:02:45.224 --> 00:02:46.454
How many total have chocolate?

00:02:46.454 --> 00:02:48.125
Well six plus three, nine.

00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:49.508
How many total have coconut?

00:02:49.508 --> 00:02:50.378
Well we're going to have to figure that

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:51.708
out in a second.

00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:54.286
So how many have coconut but no chocolate?

00:02:54.286 --> 00:02:58.187
Well there's only one with
coconut and no chocolate.

00:02:58.187 --> 00:02:59.556
So that's that one right over there,

00:02:59.556 --> 00:03:01.493
and that represents this are that I'm

00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:02.727
shading in in white.

00:03:02.727 --> 00:03:04.321
So how many total coconut are there?

00:03:04.321 --> 00:03:06.496
Well one plus three, or
four, and you see that.

00:03:06.496 --> 00:03:08.377
One, two, three, four.

00:03:08.377 --> 00:03:09.805
The last thing we'd want to fill in,

00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:11.477
because notice, six plus three plus one

00:03:11.477 --> 00:03:12.417
only adds up to 10.

00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:13.450
What about the other two?

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.981
Well the other two are
neither chocolate nor coconut.

00:03:16.981 --> 00:03:18.559
Actually, let me color this.

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:20.382
So that's one, two, these are neither

00:03:20.382 --> 00:03:21.647
chocolate nor coconut.

00:03:21.647 --> 00:03:23.458
I could write these two right over here.

00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:26.082
These are neither chocolate nor coconut.

00:03:26.082 --> 00:03:30.099
So that's one way to
represent the information

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.537
of how many chocolates, how many coconuts,

00:03:32.537 --> 00:03:34.045
and how many chocolate and coconuts,

00:03:34.045 --> 00:03:35.404
and how many neither.

00:03:35.404 --> 00:03:37.018
But there's other ways
that we could do it.

00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:40.199
Another way to do it would
be with a two way table.

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:45.199
Two way table.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.546
On one axis, say the vertical axis,

00:03:48.546 --> 00:03:51.136
we could say, let me write this,

00:03:51.136 --> 00:03:56.136
so has chocolate, I'll
write choc for short,

00:03:57.068 --> 00:04:02.068
and then I'll write no
chocolate, choc for short.

00:04:02.187 --> 00:04:05.426
Then over here I could write coconut.

00:04:05.426 --> 00:04:07.214
I want to do that in white.

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:08.932
I got new tools and sometimes

00:04:08.932 --> 00:04:10.511
the color changing isn't so easy.

00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:13.971
So this is coconut and then over here

00:04:13.971 --> 00:04:16.172
I'll write no coconut.

00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:24.049
Then let me make a little table.

00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:27.615
Make it clear what I'm doing here.

00:04:27.615 --> 00:04:30.970
So a line there and a line there

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.872
and why not add a line over here as well.

00:04:33.872 --> 00:04:36.608
Then I can just fill in
the different things.

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:39.492
This cell, this square,
this is going to represent

00:04:39.492 --> 00:04:43.182
the number that has coconut and chocolate.

00:04:43.858 --> 00:04:44.846
Well we are already looked into that,

00:04:44.846 --> 00:04:47.574
that's one, two, three, that's these three

00:04:47.574 --> 00:04:48.375
right over here.

00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:50.814
So that's those three right over there.

00:04:50.814 --> 00:04:54.088
This one right over
here, it has chocolate,

00:04:54.088 --> 00:04:55.946
but it doesn't have coconut.

00:04:55.946 --> 00:04:57.282
Well that's this six right over here.

00:04:57.282 --> 00:05:00.405
It has chocolate, but
it doesn't have coconut.

00:05:00.405 --> 00:05:04.723
So let me write this is
that six right over there.

00:05:04.723 --> 00:05:09.067
Then this box would be it has coconut,

00:05:09.067 --> 00:05:10.622
but no chocolate.

00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:11.701
Well how many is that?

00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:14.940
Well coconut no chocolate
that's that one there.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.019
Then this one is going to be no coconut

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:18.294
and no chocolate.

00:05:18.294 --> 00:05:19.897
We know what that's going to be.

00:05:19.897 --> 00:05:24.897
No coconut and no chocolate
is going to be two.

00:05:25.493 --> 00:05:26.979
If we wanted to, we could even throw

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.697
in totals over here.

00:05:28.697 --> 00:05:30.707
We could write, actually
let me just do that

00:05:30.707 --> 00:05:31.820
just for fun.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.487
I could write total, I could write total,

00:05:36.487 --> 00:05:41.119
and if I total it
vertically, so three plus

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:43.464
one this is four, six plus two is eight.

00:05:43.464 --> 00:05:45.263
So this four is the total number

00:05:45.263 --> 00:05:47.457
that have coconut that has chocolate

00:05:47.457 --> 00:05:48.376
and doesn't have chocolate.

00:05:48.376 --> 00:05:50.210
That's three plus one.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.210
This eight is the total
that does not have coconut.

00:05:55.643 --> 00:05:56.466
No coconut.

00:05:56.466 --> 00:05:58.733
So the total of no
coconut, and that of course

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:01.694
is going to be the six plus this two.

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:03.655
We could total horizontally.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:05.757
Three plus six is nine.

00:06:05.757 --> 00:06:07.278
One plus two is three.

00:06:07.278 --> 00:06:08.055
What's this nine?

00:06:08.055 --> 00:06:10.970
That's the total amount of
chocolate, six plus three.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.631
What's this three?

00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:13.372
This is the total amount no chocolate.

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:15.497
That's this one plus two.

00:06:15.497 --> 00:06:17.052
Anyway, hopefully you
found that interesting.

00:06:17.052 --> 00:06:19.259
This is just different
ways of representing

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.627
the same information.
