Let's have another quiz. [LAUGH] I know it's rare to

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.530
start a lecture with two quizzes, but this lecture, this lecture's

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.820
actually light on quizzes, so you know, let's get them

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.230
all out of the way. Okay. What things do we scale?

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.982
This is similar to the, the, the last quiz you

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:18.910
just did. Check all that apply. Do we scale bandwidth? Do

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.520
we scale computers? You know, their memory or CPU? Do we

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.090
scale power? Or do we scale storage? Check all that apply.
