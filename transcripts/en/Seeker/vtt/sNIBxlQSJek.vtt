00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.740
Our current power grid is basically a giant
firehose of electricity going from power plants

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.740
to your house.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.600
But what if it were efficient, two-way, and
let you use your neighbor's solar panels?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.940
That's the SMART GRID!

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.310
Sup guys, Trace here.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.490
In 2003, a tree limb touched a high-voltage
power line in Ohio causing a cascading blackout

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.060
that stretched across the northeast from New
York to Chicago and as far north as Ottawa,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.060
Canada.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.650
50 million people were without power for as
long as two days.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.600
The estimated cost: six billion dollars and
11 lives.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.649
You could blame the tree branch, the people
in Ohio who should have trimmed it, or even

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.390
the faulty alarm system, but really we should
blame ourselves.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.989
The North American power grid is… well it's
a mess.

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.810
In 1882, Thomas Edison built the first commercial
power grid in New York City, introducing the

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.769
idea of electricity distribution.

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:58.489
Now, almost 140 years later, it's been built
ad-hoc... jury-rigged into two major grids:

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.729
the Eastern and Western Interconnection, and
three minor grids: Texas, Alaska, and Quebec

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:04.729
Interconnections.

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.390
Together they comprise 1 TRILLION dollars
of hard work for public and private groups,

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.619
all to provide power to the U.S. and Canada.

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.590
And it's dumb.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.039
Right now, our power grid provides 830 gigawatts
of electricity to more than 330 million people,

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.159
and yet, there's no storage system.

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.159
Dumb.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.090
If you flip on your lightswitch, the local
power plant has to ramp up production, just

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.920
a bit, to power that light.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.329
Also, all the power flows one way, from generators,
to stations, to your house, like an electricity

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:35.329
firehose.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:36.329
Dumb.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.570
If something breaks, they can't just run power
around the problem, they have to drive out,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.039
find it, and fix it.

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.369
Things like this are immensely frustrating
for utilities, regulators, governments, and

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.369
you and me.

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.609
Which is why we need a smart grid.

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:54.360
A smart grid is to the current dumb grid as
the newest smartphone is to Zach Morris' massive

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.400
beige brick-thing.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.400
Actually, no.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.880
Zack's phone was still sweet.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.630
Our grid is not.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.020
The smart grid basically adds internet-connected
computers to the mix.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.650
The utility company sends power AND information
to the houses, and then the houses send info

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.960
back to tell it how it's doing, how much it's
using and also where the power is coming from.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.910
On top of that, if you have solar power on
your roof, or wind power or whatever… and

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.000
the power goes out, the grid will know you're
okay, and even ask you to help power homes

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.170
and facilities nearby -- like traffic lights
or emergency services!

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.810
Computers at every point on the grid would
know where they are in relation to privately-owned

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.870
home batteries or solar panels, and they'd
be able to communicate with them too!

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.490
This internet-connected grid could revolutionize
how power is generated and distributed and

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.910
make the whole trillion-dollar mess more efficient.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.820
Right now, 6.1 percent of all power is lost
as the electricity physically runs through

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.380
the lines, heating them up and generating
noise.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.870
That's about 19-and-a-half BILLION dollars
disappearing just from lines themselves.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.800
With computers talking back and forth to the
utilities everyone would know second-by-second

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.820
to only route power as needed… perhaps from
local storage or solar: rather than burning

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.510
coal far away because one guy is watching
TV.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.730
It might seem obvious, but this means good
things for companies, people, even the environment.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.240
For example, if the grid knew there were batteries
available, the power plants wouldn't need

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.520
to burn as much coal.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.750
Or, if the grid knew it was windy or sunny,
it could pull from the local renewable farms!

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.730
You could even, as a consumer, CHOOSE to only
use power from local storage or charge your

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.460
car when the cost was lower.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.540
Honestly, it sounds like a crazy nerdy dream.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.460
Which is sort of where we are now…

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.300
Countries all over the world are trying to
get their citizens excited about this new

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.060
smart infrastructure, but it's hard, and expensive.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.190
Ultimately, the smart grid will save money,
but it will also help us use distributed power

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.950
generation, and help the environment by eliminating
waste and encouraging people to understand

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.390
more about how they're using their own electricity.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.390
Go Planet!

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.390
Sponsor?

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.070
If you're coming out of this thinking, wait,
but if the grid is so crazy NOW, how does

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.070
it even work?

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.070
You're in luck, my friend!

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.590
Remember that blackout during the Superbowl?

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.760
We looked into how the power grid worked after
that!

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.570
Check it out!

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:17.780
Do you want to put solar panels on your roof?

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.170
Get a battery for your house?

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.950
Only use renewables?

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.110
Really into coal?
