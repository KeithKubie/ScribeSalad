1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,300
[inaudible].

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,690
You're listening to radiolab
from New York public radio,

3
00:00:08,691 --> 00:00:10,950
public radio,W Y,

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,940
y c

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,430
[inaudible]

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,110
testing, testing. This is radio lab.
I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich.

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,800
And since this hour we'll be talking
about brains and bodies and how they

8
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:27,461
communicate.

9
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:32,020
We thought we'd begin the program with a
guy with that we'd go to quite often he

10
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:36,880
knows about this sort of thing.
Oliver Sacks. Oliver is a neurologist.

11
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,860
Should I get closer to
very famous author? Yeah.

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,350
Took us to his study to show us
something that just fascinates him.

13
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,300
Um, I've become fascinated. I'm instantly,

14
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:49,140
I hope you have to be careful
with your watch or your computers.

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,100
[inaudible]

16
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,800
um, he showed us a silver ball.

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,940
I should just describe here I am looking
at a silver bowl about the size of a

18
00:00:56,941 --> 00:01:00,560
small, small ping pong ball, which
he handed to you, right? Yep.

19
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,240
Would you care to lift that, that
little steel ball this little,

20
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,620
and as soon as he did, I am

21
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:09,943
interesting.

22
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,480
The ball went flying through the
air, taking your hand with it,

23
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:16,720
smack into the nearest bit of metal
in the vicinity, which was a plate.

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,960
Little tear left very
fast and it hurt. Wow.

25
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,560
That'd be cool. I've got a cat. Okay.
I don't put it too near your watch.

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,840
And also you have to
put it down very gently.

27
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,470
Otherwise it may fly with great
violence onto this nickel slam.

28
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:33,430
What is that and what are we
talking about it? Okay. Um,

29
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,610
well this is a little rare earth
metal magnet of great strength.

30
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,030
[inaudible]

31
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:46,030
these magnets orient themselves almost
violently to the earth's magnetic field.

32
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,680
If you have a couple of these things,

33
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:53,330
say in your pockets and you go
for a walk, as you turn a corner,

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,530
you will feel them really at
themselves in your pockets.

35
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,330
I like like little animals.

36
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,650
So your, your pockets would tell you
whether you were going north, south,

37
00:02:04,651 --> 00:02:05,640
east or west.

38
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,010
Good. So whenever you have
the way with magnets and

39
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,820
how you hear very weird man, how
would you propose to use this?

40
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:19,690
In what situation that you have imagined?
Would it be a happy advantage? Well.

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,440
Um, I, I myself, I'm always
getting lost. I have,

42
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,310
I have no sense of direction.

43
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,020
I would function [inaudible]
come downtown to meet me.

44
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,980
You would know because of the pressure
on your thighs from these little balls

45
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:39,580
that you were carrying out, whether you
were going downtown or not downtown.

46
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,030
You see, and I may need things
like this. I am very bad at all.

47
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,330
Anting myself in space. He's

48
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,380
trying to do with the birds too, right?

49
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,850
Bird because birds have magnets in their
brains are or something like magnets

50
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:53,850
which lets them fly south
so they know where it is.

51
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,650
They fly it when they're
migrating, right? Yeah.

52
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,230
He's trying to start a
conversation like a bird,

53
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:00,010
but because he's choosing his thighs,

54
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,660
he wants his thighs to talk to his
brain. I've often wondered as an aside,

55
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,560
uh, the extent to which one, um,
one could develop a new sense.

56
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,110
That's what this hour of radio lab is
about. Human beings, not just Oliver,

57
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,110
all kinds of folks who are attempting
to add census and mostly to subtract.

58
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,590
Since we'll have stories about both
adding and losing sentences in more

59
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:26,620
generally, you look at how
brains and bodies communicate,

60
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,360
often fail to communicate
because believe it or not,

61
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,510
it's not an easy relationship
between your brain and your body.

62
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:39,430
There's a lot of confusion, deception,
even. That's what new research shows.

63
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,590
And we'll get into all of that. So
let's get into it. Alright. Okay.

64
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:49,030
Ready? Yeah, we're first, well,
let's begin with on urology.

65
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,400
Um, well listen, my cell phone is
ringing, so let me pause until it stops.

66
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,940
So that's Robert Sapolsky. He's a
professor of biology at Stanford.

67
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,250
I've never figured out how to do voice
messaging or whatever it is even has done

68
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:07,050
in this century. Prisoners of I machine.
Yes. Oh, okay. We're in business here.

69
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,940
Okay, so to begin now,

70
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,860
I said to Robert Sapolsky just to get
my head around this. Let's imagine it.

71
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:15,890
I decided to visit my best friend

72
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,840
in the world, Tommy, Tommy. I walk
over to his house. I have a key.

73
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:23,230
So I opened the front door, Tommy,

74
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:27,410
I walk into his apartment
and then I see him

75
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,220
sprawled on the floor, dead

76
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:34,700
[inaudible]

77
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,460
and in a horrible,
tragic, instant like that,

78
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:40,220
I wonder what would be
going on in my brain.

79
00:04:40,221 --> 00:04:44,800
And I asked this because his answer is
supposed to the answer. It was so weird.

80
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,430
According to some Polsky, what happens
happens in the following order.

81
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,960
First Light bounces off Tommy's
corpse and Andrew's my eye. Okay?

82
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:57,560
It goes up some nerve from your
eyes and into one part of the brain,

83
00:04:57,561 --> 00:05:01,130
which turfs it onto the next part. And
then the inflammation keeps moving.

84
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:04,760
A couple of steps down. It gets into
what's called your visual Cortex,

85
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:08,420
which turns the dots into
lines and lines into shapes.

86
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,820
And that's just like a local train.

87
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:15,821
You're taking eventually that local
train carrying the image of timing kg and

88
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:20,180
chug deeper into my brain, to my
cortex. And after a few more stops,

89
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:24,380
I will finally know, I will
consciously know the Tommy is dead.

90
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,040
But now here's the surprise.

91
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,900
Information can move through the brain
in different ways at the same time.

92
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,980
And there is a second route, it turns,
there's a second pathway into my body,

93
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:41,480
into my nervous system, which bypasses
all of that visual cortex stuff

94
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,610
like a bullet train and goes straight
to this area called the Amygdala.

95
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,320
And what the Amygdala does is instantly
it tells the heart to pound your heart

96
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:54,860
speeds up the stomach to clinch
stomach muscles, clench tears to flow,

97
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:58,250
and you're still a couple of seconds
away from like even consciously making

98
00:05:58,251 --> 00:05:59,420
sense of what you're seeing.

99
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,070
And by then already your
stomach is heading towards
your throat or your throat's

100
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:05,930
in your mouth or whatever the cliche is.

101
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,370
So as I'm standing there in Tommy's
apartment looking at this figure on the

102
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:13,610
ground before I even know
what I'm looking at before,

103
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:16,370
I am consciously aware that Tommy is dead.

104
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,560
My body already knows that's
exactly the punchline.

105
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,010
Your body knows that before
you consciously know it. Right?

106
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,700
Which is an astonishing idea. It is
astonishing, but it's not a new idea.

107
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:36,090
Yeah.

108
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,740
This goes back to what was originally
viewed as this totally asinine theory in

109
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:43,680
psychology back around
1,901 of the, you know,

110
00:06:43,681 --> 00:06:47,820
grand old poop laws of psychology,
William James, Dean James,

111
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,990
and he's trying to answer the
question where feelings came from.

112
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,230
That's Jonah Leora science writer.
He really likes William James.

113
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:56,570
He's written a lot about him and
he says, a hundred years ago,

114
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:59,780
William James poses a thought experiment.
He gives the example of a bear.

115
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,960
He says, imagine you're
walking through the woods.

116
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,180
All of a sudden I'm behind a tree.

117
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:07,320
Yeah,

118
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,680
the bear attacks. Any wonder William
James did. Okay, so the bear attacks,

119
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:11,670
you're going to feel scared.

120
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,230
But what exactly is that
feeling of fear made of?

121
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,410
Which seems like a strange
question to ask. Yeah, but, but he,

122
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:22,470
he was trying to be empirical about it.
He was trying to be a good psychologist.

123
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,880
And his answer was that the feeling
is the perception of your body,

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,350
meaning step one, you see the bear, you
see a bear with his teeth and his claws.

125
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,140
Step two, your body
response, a fast heartbeat,

126
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,420
the adrenaline cursing in your
bloodstream. And it's only in step three.

127
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:44,310
When the brain sees the body respond,
does it, then it trigger the feeling,

128
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,210
a fear,

129
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,440
and the feeling of fear comes from the
perception of those changes in your body.

130
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,960
If you took away the heartbeat,
if you took away the body,

131
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,190
there'd be nothing left
to feel. Needless to say,

132
00:07:57,191 --> 00:08:01,420
when William James proposed this idea,
people absolutely crazy, he was nuts,

133
00:08:01,421 --> 00:08:03,700
completely nuts. They said,
you know, if you're right,

134
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:07,540
then someone who's paralyzed from the
neck down and who doesn't get signals from

135
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,290
their body,

136
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,980
well that person would see the bear in
the woods and they wouldn't get scared,

137
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:15,310
which is ridiculous. Completely
ridiculous. So the critics said,

138
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,080
William James is wrong, dead wrong,
and that's the end of it. Yeah, the

139
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,510
end of it. Hello.

140
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:27,450
We happened to bump into a
neurologist, Antonio Damasio,

141
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,230
director of the brain and creativity
institute at the University of Southern

142
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:35,840
California. Wow. What a nice place.
So we're sitting near with demasio.

143
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,290
We happened to be talking about
William James and his critics,

144
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,390
which we always do always
do on, you know, lunch.

145
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,750
We don't go into a luncheonette for
lunch and before we order a tuna fish

146
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:45,850
sandwich, we always mentioned
William James in his critics.

147
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,030
This is something we do. So I
said to the, I said, Demasio,

148
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,110
you know the critics call James Wrong
because he said people who were paralyzed

149
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:56,190
couldn't feel anything and he
says you, it's funny you should

150
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,180
mention this because there's been a
series of studies thinking about James One

151
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:04,440
more time and it's very interesting
because the first study that was made in

152
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:04,910
this area,

153
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,910
it was made by a paraplegic psychologist
who thought that he felt less emotional

154
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:17,421
than he was before and he talked to
others and others reported the same.

155
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,950
The studies reported that people who had
once been able bodied and then became

156
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:27,540
paralyzed, felt less, less
happy than able bodied people,

157
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,150
less sad, been able body people just less.

158
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,850
Our B is rooted in a body state.

159
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:41,420
If I would be able to remove from your
brain the representation of your body,

160
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,580
you would not know that you are you
and would I not be sorry at my friend's

161
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,250
death? You definitely would
not be started at anything.

162
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,910
What is in fact the essence
of being joyful or sad.

163
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,340
If you don't hook those
notions on a changed body,

164
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,190
he's right. You know? I mean, if you
think about the last time you were sad,

165
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,320
like really sad, how would you describe
that feeling to yourself? Right.

166
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,520
In fairness when I guess I would,

167
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,440
I would say I felt dragged
out and heavy. Yeah.

168
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,010
That feeling is completely
rooted in your flesh. Well,

169
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,880
brain has nothing to do with that
thought. Made me say it and then my body,

170
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,320
hold on. Hello?

171
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,230
Oh, hi. Yeah. Hold on one second.

172
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,300
Is Your wife here?

173
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:49,070
Hello? Robert? Yeah. I can't believe you
still there. What are you doing there?

174
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,980
What do you mean? Am I doing here?
You're supposed to be home an hour ago

175
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,880
in the studio. We were
on the, I don't care.

176
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,820
What do you mean you're
supposed to be home an hour ago.

177
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,530
I reminded you this morning. I
reminded you last night. I was pissed.

178
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:06,140
Not Important to you. This is not
such a big deal. I'll be back in.

179
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,610
Actually this just an example
we've been talking about. No.

180
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,430
Robert's having a fight
with his wife, Tamar,

181
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:16,910
and while he's fighting inside his body,
his stomach is clenching his hardest.

182
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:18,530
Palpitating. Hers is doing the same,

183
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,680
but their brains are picking up
these signals. I'm thinking anger.

184
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,713
They feel angry.

185
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,700
As important as your WIC screwed
it up. How did I screw it up?

186
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:31,430
How did I screw up your job
though? At a certain point,

187
00:11:31,431 --> 00:11:35,390
Robert will probably realize he
has screwed up and just get home.

188
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,750
He'll apologize if I get home
in 20 minutes. I'm really sorry.

189
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,700
I know this is horrible. I said,
yeah, yeah, it's just a second.

190
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,920
I'm really sorry. Okay. He'd be like, no.

191
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:47,780
When it comes to brains and
bodies and men and women.

192
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:52,040
The interesting thing is that when a man
and woman fight these systems in their

193
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,190
body, the heart, the stomach clenching,

194
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,970
while these systems do turn on at the
same speed and it takes like two seconds

195
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:02,230
according to Robert Spolsky where there's
an interesting gender difference is

196
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,140
how long it takes to turn off
the system and ladies, sorry,

197
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:09,460
in advance and in general it turns
off more slowly in women than in men,

198
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,420
which may explain something that
happens to couples all the time.

199
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:18,280
Okay, good. I'm really sorry this isn't
right. I know. Oh, I'm really sorry.

200
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,160
Like here we are.

201
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,710
Maybe like maybe later we'll go
do something or I'm really sorry.

202
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,920
Robert Stomach is relaxing.
This is really stupid. I know.

203
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,670
His heart is slowly very stupid.
He thinks the fight might be over.

204
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,533
Okay.

205
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,680
You know, this is something
you do all the time.

206
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,650
When we were having a dinner right
after we got engaged and we went to the

207
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:45,280
restaurant and I was waiting for
you and I've made the reservation

208
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,220
for like 45 minutes. You didn't
even call it just you didn't.

209
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,440
Did you hear what just happened there?

210
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:58,090
It's this way of even James stuff
coming back to haunt us a century later.

211
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,570
Topolski says sometimes the
body actually tricks. The brain.

212
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,230
Tame knows the fight is over
mentally, but her body's still tense.

213
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,690
Her heart is still racing and
her brain thinks, Whoa, wait,

214
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,960
if my heart is still racing and I
consciously know that this issue has been

215
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:11,794
resolved,

216
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,140
it must be because I'm still pissed off
about that thing that happened in the

217
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:16,210
Carter Administration.

218
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,040
Minimize every day. Maybe it goes for you.

219
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,930
Brain fills a vacuum. We have
a list. You have a list there?

220
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,230
I do. I have a long list. I didn't know
how often you do this sort of thing.

221
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,060
I do it like one. I can tell them
this year the babies are calls.

222
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,360
I'm going to be out of town and says,
should I make dinner for Robert?

223
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:36,270
Because quickly you can't make
dinner for yourself and the kids. No,

224
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,960
I do make dinner. I haven't made much
of anything. Potatoes. Last week,

225
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:43,020
Wednesday I made the big potatoes.
That's just applying heat.

226
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,510
I want to thank my wife,

227
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:57,470
Tamer Lewin for what I think was a pretty
startling lead that really, I mean,

228
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,750
performance switch.

229
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:03,140
I don't know how she did that because
it's so unlike the rest of our marriage.

230
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,880
You know this story by the way,

231
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:09,410
came from Robert Sapolsky and
he tells it about his wife too,

232
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:12,380
but they're not reporters. They're
scientists, so they do it differently.

233
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,240
My wife's in the same business as me,

234
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,080
so the very words we will
say to each other is, honey,

235
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,470
don't forget what the half life is
on the autonomic nervous system.

236
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,290
Then suddenly it's all over with.

237
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,410
That's such a rare exchange
between two people. You know? I

238
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:31,360
know. We're just sentiment. By the way.

239
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,960
Robert Spolski's latest book is called
Monkey Love, which is where that

240
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,420
anecdote came from. Ed.

241
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,380
Speaking of brains and bodies [inaudible]
let's put the science on pause for a

242
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:49,381
moment and take a brief detour because
often what gets you into these ideas,

243
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,650
like take this kid, for example,

244
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,740
Christopher seals go to the Blake
high school isn't the science.

245
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:56,150
It's more basic than that.

246
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,130
It seems something disgusting
and not being able to look away.

247
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,770
You really just can't believe
that if something feels like this,

248
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,290
it actually came out of a real person.
You just don't get the feeling.

249
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,940
When we bumped into Christopher, he was
gingerly holding a pair of human lungs,

250
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,860
but it is a real person,

251
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,580
but you just can't really associate
with a real person because it's there in

252
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:20,150
front of you and it doesn't look like
real person in case. That sense of, whoa.

253
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,440
That's why we originally went to the
Walter Reed Army Medical Center in

254
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:27,980
Washington d c but here's
what happened. Our tour guide.

255
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:32,330
Okay, Steven S. T. E. V. E.
N. Solomon, s. O. L. O. M. O.

256
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,990
He showed us the particular
photo that got us thinking

257
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,430
a famous photo in our archives.
It's called field day.

258
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,260
It's a civil war photo
hanging in a sign gallery.

259
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,480
It's a picture of legs.

260
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,990
Kyle have amputated legs, a
huge heap of severed legs,

261
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,270
some feet thrown sort of
haphazardly into a pile.

262
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,530
Wow. It's oddly beautiful in
a way, gruesome, gruesome,

263
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,130
but the next thought immediately after
was what was happening at that moment.

264
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,320
Right to one side of the picture frame
must've been an operating table and on

265
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:10,070
the table,

266
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:15,070
soldier inhaling chloroform and at the
foot of the table must've been a doctor

267
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,283
signing away,

268
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:20,870
a circular amputation involved cutting
straight through the skin to the bone.

269
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:26,150
A flap amputation required the tissue
to be cut in two flaps of skin that were

270
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:31,151
used to create a stump and in fact
your typical army surgeon was basically

271
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:36,140
graded on how quickly they could do an
amputation. That was one of the first,

272
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,060
they really had doctors being
aggressive in terms of taking off limbs.

273
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,680
Like I said, that photo got us thinking,

274
00:16:41,681 --> 00:16:45,970
so we went back to Jonah Lehrer who has
written how about a very ghostly side

275
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:50,170
effect that pops up during the civil
war as a direct result of all of that,

276
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,720
taking off of limbs, this,

277
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:56,721
this one astonishing syndrome that these
men who have had their limbs taken off,

278
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,740
they describe very,

279
00:16:59,741 --> 00:17:03,970
very often this a very common thing that
they still feel their phantom limbs.

280
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:09,490
They say they feel it. Yeah. They
say, doctor, I, I still feel it. Move.

281
00:17:09,491 --> 00:17:13,180
They can feel it hurt. Get through that.
Sometimes get hot sometimes very cold.

282
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,440
Imagine you're a civil war
doctor and you hear this. He,

283
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:19,820
you don't even know what germs
are yet. But one guy, Dr Silas,

284
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:22,160
where Mitchell decides he's
going to get to the bottom of it,

285
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,900
the first thing he did was he wrote
some clinical reports only. Yeah.

286
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,190
About 5% of the men who have suffered
amputation never have any feeling of the

287
00:17:29,191 --> 00:17:30,850
part as being still present, um,

288
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,780
and circulated them or in the hospital
while the remainders seemed to retain a

289
00:17:33,781 --> 00:17:34,860
sense of its existence.

290
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:39,540
So vivid as to be more definite and
intrusive than it is of the truly living

291
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,374
fellow member.

292
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,780
The stump is liable to the most horrible
[inaudible] and to a certain curious

293
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,430
spasmodic paralysis.

294
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:49,990
[inaudible]

295
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,110
no one could make sense of this.
Even our Guy William James,

296
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,160
even he looks into it,

297
00:17:54,161 --> 00:17:57,460
he did a very authoritative study where
he sent out questionnaires to all these

298
00:17:57,461 --> 00:18:00,130
amputee victims and wanting to
know about their lost limbs.

299
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,130
He has all of these civil war
amputees, all these questions,

300
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,090
does your phantom limb hurt? Can you
move it? If you really concentrate?

301
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,700
And what he found was that
there were no patterns,

302
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,690
no stereotypical loss limb every,
every experience was different.

303
00:18:13,691 --> 00:18:17,530
In other words, phantom
limbs are like real limbs.

304
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,940
They're yours.

305
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,310
Well, on this topic of Phantom limbs,

306
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:26,480
there is a guy who has figured at least
something out about this phenomenon.

307
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,410
Dr v S Ramachandra. I am a v S
Ramachandra. Remember him? I remember him.

308
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,940
He's a well known neurologist.

309
00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:36,850
He works in California at the
University of California, San Diego.

310
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,850
And one day he says,

311
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:41,380
a patient showed up in his office and
it seems that the guy had had his arm

312
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:43,480
amputated. It was his left arm.

313
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:48,780
And then ever since this man had an
uncanny feeling that he still had an arm

314
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,090
where his real arm used to be. Yes,

315
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,950
it's important to emphasize
this is not a delusion.

316
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,420
He doesn't think he has an arm. He
knows he doesn't. He's not crazy,

317
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,520
but he vividly feels it's presence.

318
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,760
And the rough part was
that this arm eat hurt.

319
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,860
This sometimes happens to
people with phantom limbs.

320
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,840
He would have days where his phantom
arm would seize up in pain. Doctor,

321
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:15,280
it hurts really badly. Goes into
this painful clenching spasm.

322
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,550
The nails dig into my palm.

323
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,180
So he has a phantom hand at the
end of his phantom limb. Yes,

324
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,340
and he will say things like,

325
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:27,120
it's going into a cramp with the nails
digging into the phantom palm and it's

326
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:30,900
excruciatingly painful, but there
are no nails. There is no no problem.

327
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,900
And weirdest of all, the patient
couldn't do anything about it.

328
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:38,901
He try to unclench his phantom nails
from his phantom palm to make the pain

329
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:42,450
stop, but he couldn't. He said,
I cannot move the fountain.

330
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,750
The fandom I'm wouldn't obey.
I cannot volitionally move it.

331
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,400
And I started thinking to myself,

332
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,410
what does he mean when he says he cannot
move his phantom limb like an oxymoron?

333
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,613
There is no arm there.

334
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,340
Drew Ramachandran was
confused what's going on. He,

335
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,850
he checked with the patient and
discovered that 11 years earlier,

336
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:03,290
before the amputation,

337
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:08,291
he'd had an injury to his spine and after
that his real left arm was paralyzed.

338
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:13,100
He could not move it. He tried his
brain would issue the commands.

339
00:20:13,101 --> 00:20:14,570
His brain will say move the arm.

340
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,260
But he was getting visual feedback and
indeed feedback from his muscles saying,

341
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:23,210
nope, move the arm. No move.
No. And this went on for months,

342
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,320
move. No,

343
00:20:24,321 --> 00:20:29,321
so maybe the doctor Rameshchandra maybe
this patient got so frustrated trying to

344
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:33,650
move his real arm that at some
point, after a few months or a year,

345
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,870
the paralysis [inaudible]
learnt by the brain

346
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,360
snapping into the circuitry of the
brain. Well, I call it learned,

347
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,570
learned paralysis. So even
when they cut the patients,

348
00:20:44,571 --> 00:20:46,730
I'm off a year after the accident,

349
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,560
he still didn't get any relief
because the problem wasn't in his arm.

350
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:53,140
It was learned paralysis.
It was in his head. Now,

351
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,730
and that is when
Ramachandra thought, well,

352
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:02,820
maybe the solution here is to trick this
man's brain to unparalyzed to get his

353
00:21:03,641 --> 00:21:06,970
cells to think, well
actually we can move on,

354
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:10,990
but how do you trick a brain? How would
you do that? How would you do that?

355
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,110
How would you do that? How would you
do that? Indeed, he thought for a bit.

356
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,600
Then I hit on this way of using a
mirror prompt inside a cardboard box.

357
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,310
What a mirror mirror prompt
inside a cardboard box.

358
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,420
A mirror pro parked inside
a box popped up. Oh,

359
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,770
it was kind of a home
depot solution. Really.

360
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,230
Ramachandran took a
long and skinny mirror.

361
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:35,150
The kind you'd hang on
a closet door, right?

362
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,770
Any propped it up using a cardboard
box and then turned it sideways.

363
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,590
Place the side right in front of the
patient like right on his nose because he

364
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:45,670
couldn't see himself. No,

365
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,220
couldn't see anything in the mirror
yet unless he hooked his neck around.

366
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:51,530
Took a p. Oh, otherwise he's just
looking at the side. Ramesh Arjun says,

367
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,710
I want you to imagine
this with me. Jeff says,

368
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:56,050
I want you to take your
good on your real arm. Okay?

369
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:58,990
And stick it out in front of
the mirror. So do that. Okay,

370
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:04,150
now make it do what the phantom arm
does. Pick your good arm. Make it stiff.

371
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,920
Curl your hand into a fist. Dig Your
fingernails into your palm deeply.

372
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,210
Make it hurt. You're doing that. It's
kind of hurting. Now when I tell you,

373
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,390
Cook your head so that you can look
into the mirror and on your left,

374
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:18,010
just where your the fandom ought to be.

375
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,220
Let's pretend that that's your
phantom arm. It's cramped.

376
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:25,270
It's curled exactly as you'd imagine
it. So now look in the mirror, okay?

377
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,940
And there's your arm. You see it there
and nearer your phantom arm. Got It.

378
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,460
Now very slowly keeping
your eye on the mirror.

379
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:37,630
Now I want you to
[inaudible] curl your hand.

380
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:42,020
Patient says, okay, he
opens his real hand, my God,

381
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,350
and of course it looks like his phantom
is opening. That's not surprising.

382
00:22:45,351 --> 00:22:47,650
He's got do the mirror there,
but he says, my God, doctor,

383
00:22:47,651 --> 00:22:50,770
you're not going to believe this.
The movements of all comeback,

384
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,590
all these movements in
my fingers, in my elbow,

385
00:22:54,591 --> 00:22:59,180
in my wrist from 11 years ago,
come flooding into my mind.

386
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,250
So it was his pretend nails

387
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,940
are now ungripping from his pretend
palm in the whole problem of the pretend

388
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:10,020
pain goes away, goes away. That's what
he said. For how long? By the way, total.

389
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,860
The middle was in place. But when Dr
Rameshchandra took away the mirrors,

390
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,270
the pain came back.

391
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,920
I said, fine, say, let me, you
know, and then I said, look,

392
00:23:22,921 --> 00:23:27,660
why don't you practice with a mirror for
the few weeks, every day for an hour.

393
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,790
Then maybe if you do it repeatedly,
you can unlearn the learn to pain.

394
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,470
So this guy goes home, I told him, you
give him a mirror to take home. Correct.

395
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,660
And if it was $22 take it with you. So
he texted with him, he was delighted.

396
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,580
And then after about another week,

397
00:23:44,581 --> 00:23:48,320
he phones and he sounds all agitated on
the phone. And I said, what's going on?

398
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,190
So doctor, you're not going to believe
this. It's gone. I said, what's going on?

399
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:55,310
I thought maybe the mirror was gone.
He said, no, no, not the mirror.

400
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,040
The Phantom has gone, gone. Go on.
God. That's what I said. Gone. Gone.

401
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,550
What do you mean fandom
was going? He it? Well,

402
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:06,630
this phantom arm I been having for the
last 11 years, it's disappeared. Well,

403
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,290
my, my, my initial reaction was alarm.
I said, my God, does this bother you?

404
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,490
That it cause it, no. You know,

405
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,310
this has happened three days ago and
in the last three days you remember the

406
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:18,900
excruciating elbow pain and wrist
pain. I've got several times a day,

407
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,690
but I don't have them anymore
because I don't have an arm.

408
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,100
But my fingers

409
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:31,170
they have not disappeared and they're
still up here dangling near my shoulder.

410
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,280
They're still painful. You mean just
disconnected? Disembodied fingerless yeah.

411
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,790
Finger looks dangling from the
shoulder. What? W what does that mean?

412
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,660
This guy's saying that he seems to have
fingertips hanging on his shoulder.

413
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,780
He said you a mirror doesn't work anymore,

414
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:58,020
so can you redesign it and
push it properly near my
nose so I can look at that

415
00:24:58,981 --> 00:25:01,540
reflection and maybe get,
get rid of the fingers.

416
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,120
So he now wants to get Dr
Ramachandra to prop up the mirror,

417
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,780
point them at these phantom fingertips
and have the mirror erase the fingertip.

418
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,040
You thought I was a magician
and I got, you know,

419
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,280
eliminate his different
body parts and sequence.

420
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,940
And this is amputation by mirror? Yeah.

421
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,650
As I tell my medical
colleagues jokingly, I say,

422
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:22,030
this is the first example in the history
of medicine of a successful amputation

423
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:24,670
of a phantom limb. Yeah, so
don't leave me hanging here.

424
00:25:24,671 --> 00:25:29,380
Did the phantom fingers eventually
dissolve? No. Vv we still haven't.

425
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:33,160
Have they been able to devise a technique
to get them and it turns out that the

426
00:25:33,161 --> 00:25:37,660
pain there subsided a bit, so he's not
that worried about us getting rid of him.

427
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:42,100
So somewhere in California there's
still a guy walking around with a sense,

428
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:46,300
fingers on his shoulder. Yeah. Are still
dangling. Another shoulder, which is,

429
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,470
well, not only weird,

430
00:25:47,471 --> 00:25:51,580
it suggests that there's an awful lot
to know about how brains and bodies

431
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:53,800
interact. Many things to learn,

432
00:25:53,801 --> 00:25:57,070
but for a work at day doc who has to deal
with whatever comes through the door.

We're going to go from lost limbs
to a guy who's lost everything.

the right decision ends up being one you

464
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:54,560
regret and really great expectations
for how it's like basketball.

465
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:59,120
I was going to pee. Hi Radiolab
listeners. I'm Anna sale, host of death,

466

471
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,290
This is Radiolab. I'm Jad
Abumrad red, I'm Robert Krulwich.

472
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,640
And in this hour on radio lab, we're
talking about the relationship,

473
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:32,300
sometimes the uneasy relationship
between the brain and the body.

474
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,800
I think most people will who have
brains and that would include,

475
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,750
I think most of the listeners here, uh,

476
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,260
think the relationship between brain and
body is more like the relationship of a

477
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:43,290
commander to a command D, right?

478
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,690
The brain makes the orders
and the body response.

479
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,830
But I think the more accurate way is
to think of this as a conversation

480
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:56,010
between the brain and the body. How do
you mean? Well because any movement,

481
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,840
even a very basic one, let's
just say a wagging my tongue.

482
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,310
Okay? Very simple really, but it
still involves three steps. First,

483
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,070
the brain has to issue the command

484
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,020
tongue, face and tongue station. This
is mission control, commence wagon.

485
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,980
Second, the command must be
executed [inaudible] third.

486
00:29:13,981 --> 00:29:16,830
Now this is the crucial step.
The tongue. In this case,

487
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:18,680
we ports back to the brain.

488
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,710
All we have a wagging. I
repeat, we have wagons.

489
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,210
Yeah. By completing the loop,

490
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,940
you control the foot. Come in full
mission control. This is here,

491
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,870
me here coordinates over
to Roger that Michigan,

492
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,460
yeah, this happens, this conversation
you're hanging right now.

493
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,540
[inaudible] or Alpha. It happens
constantly all over your body.

494
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:37,360
Your brain is issuing
commands. Come in, let me,

495
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:42,280
parts of your body are
receiving the command and
reporting right leg standing by

496
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,510
and this conversation adds up to
something really quite important.

497
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,390
It ends up to his sense of yourself.

498
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,520
It's an unconscious sense which
really allows you to move normally.

499
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,810
That's Oliver sacks again,

500
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:57,850
the neurologist we talked to
at the start of the program,

501
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:01,660
you have of course a sense of
smell and of touch and of taste.

502
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:06,750
He says this sixth sense also has a
name sometimes called proprioception.

503
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,110
Proprioception.

504
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:13,111
Proprioception is the unconscious sense
by which the position of one's limbs,

505
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:17,890
the posture of one's body
is automatically monitored.

506
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,910
Now imagine he says what would happen
if all of a sudden this sixth sense,

507
00:30:24,911 --> 00:30:27,490
this conversation that you are
always having with your body,

508
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,710
suppose it went away when we
all have this in a slight way.

509
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:33,281
For example,

510
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:38,050
if you go to the dentist and sometimes
half of your mouth or your tongue is

511
00:30:38,051 --> 00:30:40,990
numbed, the tongue may feel very large.

512
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:46,110
You may grab the Dental Mirror to reassure
yourself that all is okay and there's

513
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,100
does and it doesn't reassure you.
You can still wag your tongue.

514
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,040
Your brain is still sending
messages to the tone control.

515
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,980
The tongue isn't sending
messages back anymore

516
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:06,250
so you can you anything.
You know that feeling?

517
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:11,250
Yeah, of course. Now. Could you imagine
that instead of just losing your tongue,

518
00:31:11,251 --> 00:31:16,110
your tongue not responding, suppose
your whole body doesn't respond.

519
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,160
Okay.

520
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,670
What would that be like? I mean,
we have words like deaf or blind.

521
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,410
We don't have a word for
being ineffective, deaf and
blind to one's own body.

522
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,090
And yet there are people who have a
condition that rare and that horrible.

523
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,410
No proprioception. We
talked to such a person,

524
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,880
Ian Waterman and convinced him and his
doctor and very good friend Jonathan Cole

525
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,800
to crowd themselves into a very little
recording studio and fully of the other,

526
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:52,290
the BBC. Fantastic. Southampton
in England. Hello America.

527
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,990
And we ask them to talk to us.
Hello? Oh, you got a sexy voice.

528
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:03,010
Ah, and you hear us? Can you
hear me? Your other? Hi, we can.

529
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:07,190
I can thank you guys for coming
and doing this with us. Yeah.

530
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:11,480
Will you just ask us some questions and
we'll answer them as best we can far

531
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:16,160
away. All right, well let me just
start it then. Now can you remember,

532
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,233
I'm sure you can.

533
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,680
What happened that led to this
total change in your life?

534
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,090
So it began with what
I thought was, um, uh,

535
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:32,080
a batch of the flu or a very
heavy, heavy cold. And uh,

536
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:36,850
I was at the shop, probably worked
and felt tired and lethargic.

537
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:41,540
The guy that owned the, the shop look,
you know, you look on, well go home,

538
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:43,220
take it easy. I took the day off,

539
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:47,660
went home and I've always been pretty
energetic and I hate being stuck in doors

540
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:50,180
and whatever. And I thought, well,
the fresh year will do me some good.

541
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,480
It's got to the shed and pulled the motor
mower out, pulled the what out with,

542
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,140
what's the, what do you call it? The
mower. The lawnmower out of the shed.

543
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,510
I thought it's going to be one of those
cultural moments where you guys call it

544
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:03,450
something else. No, not
quite. And pulled the uh,

545
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,310
lawnmower out of the shed and primed
it up and started it and it started

546
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:09,710
chugging away and as I engage the gear

547
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,730
off it went and I
couldn't keep up with it.

548
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:18,130
It was a fairly slowly and punters sort
of lonely and I just stood there bemused

549
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:23,360
thinking, how come I just can't keep
up with the money and didn't really,

550
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,940
uh, attend too much more than, you know,

551
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,210
I'm just tired and
sluggish and lethargic and,

552
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,080
and went back to my bedroom and laid
down and did some seriously thing.

553
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,250
And the following morning I went to get
up and out of bed and collapsed against

554
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,980
the radio twice. Fell, slid, fell,

555
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,620
tumbled out of the bed and
fell against the radiator.

556
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,250
[inaudible]

557
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,440
it's very difficult to do, to describe

558
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:50,720
[inaudible]

559
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,580
as I lay there and I was laying flat.

560
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,110
I had a rippling sensation in
my tummy around the ankles,

561
00:33:56,111 --> 00:33:59,360
a a tingling sensation for
once we've had a chairman,

562
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,490
I felt disembodied

563
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,583
[inaudible]

564
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:09,790
I remember waking up with a hand on my
face and not realizing that it was mine.

565
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,720
Simple movement, simple movements.
The simplest of movements.

566
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,590
Pick up a cup to eat, to eat.

567
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:23,060
The biscuits are suddenly very
hard by couldn't control anything.

568
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,340
Totally. I mean, from the neck down.

569
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:30,550
I had no control over over my limbs
and for the next 12 years he went from

570
00:34:32,991 --> 00:34:34,430
hospital to hospital.

571
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:37,760
Doctors couldn't help him because he'd
never seen anything quite this drastic

572
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:40,940
until they finally did meet
a doctor, Jonathan Cole,

573
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:45,170
who began to help him figure
out what might be going on.

574
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,880
So let me ask Jonathan for a second.

575
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:50,550
What is wrong with the
n he had at the Italian,

576
00:34:50,551 --> 00:34:55,551
he had his eldest last class of peripheral
nerve cells to do with sensation.

577
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:01,220
It lost touch, but also his
movements and position sense had got,

578
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:05,450
is this unusual? I mean in your
experience? I mean depends who we talk to,

579
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:10,100
but I normally say that we know of about
six in the world really who are like

580
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:10,934
this.

581
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:16,110
No one really in the world knew what
proprioception did and what the effects of

582
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:20,000
the loss of proprioception
would be until it

583
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,520
and when they first met, Dr.
Cole said to him, he said,

584
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:31,470
how do you manage? How do you
cope with this? Unbelievably,

585
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,160
he was the first doctor to ask that
question in told him that on own over

586
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:43,070
the 12 years he had figured out how to
walk again and how to grasp a cup again

587
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,120
and explained that he did
this by carefully breaking
down and then reassembling

588
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:52,590
every single move he made started.

589
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:53,910
Um, this way. Um,

590
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:58,910
I was laying in bed one day in hospital
and I wanted to sit up and it just

591
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,730
wouldn't happen. And then
laying there in frustration,

592
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:07,500
I just thought the whole process through
and I broke it down into quite simple

593
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:09,390
small movements and I lay flat.

594
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:13,140
I checked where absolutely
everything was before I started.

595
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,060
And I then started with the head and
folded and tucked my chin onto my chest as

596
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:22,410
if to start the first part of the Co that
I moved my arms slightly forward and I

597
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:25,920
started to tighten some muscles
in my tummy and around my back.

598
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,180
And then I started to curl myself
to sit in an upright position.

599
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,820
And when I got there, I was damn
down, euphoric and we fell out.

600
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:37,821
The bed has studied movement in a weight
that will in history has ever studied

601
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:40,970
before though ballet Dodes said,

602
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,770
do professor of neurology
has ever had to study,

603
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,600
move with the way he had as every day

604
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:49,970
because every day, every
move that Ian makes,

605
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,990
he has to consciously direct it
as though Ian, we're two people,

606
00:36:53,991 --> 00:36:55,490
a puppeteer and a puppet.

607
00:36:55,491 --> 00:37:00,491
His mind is directing and his body is
obeying and the strings of Ian's puppet

608
00:37:00,711 --> 00:37:05,660
instantly or his eyes are control.
All my movement with my sight at,

609
00:37:05,661 --> 00:37:09,320
because he doesn't have this feedback
information coming from his limbs back to

610
00:37:09,321 --> 00:37:12,320
his brain pro for septic
feedback cause that's missing.

611
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:16,580
Unless he looks directly at the limb,
he wants to move, he can't move it.

612
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,650
If I look away from from my hand,
I lose all connection with it.

613
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,370
Or what happens if, if it's dark or
if the lights are out, we know it's,

614
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,780
he can't afford darkness.

615
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:31,310
If the lights go out accidentally us
call caught a dangerous place to be our

616
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:36,230
shoal over. He has not turned out the
lights in the night in the last decades.

617
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:41,660
Wow. To stay in the world.
In motion. He must focus,

618
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,780
always focus. He's like, he spent a
long time just training with paper clip.

619
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:50,600
Yeah. I use them now occasionally. And I
still don't like the little devils. Um,

620
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:54,590
you know, I mean, well wait, when you,
when you're manipulating the paper clip,

621
00:37:54,591 --> 00:37:58,290
what are you actually trying to figure
out how to put it on the way these and,

622
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:03,000
but he's, uh, I lost my fellow
say if you could repeat that. Oh,

623
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:07,160
okay. We should do Jess
cause the headphones back
on yet. Hang on. I'll do it.

624
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:11,870
Great job. By the way, is he, is
he able to put on, I mean, is this,

625
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,950
you can tell me what's going on,

626
00:38:12,951 --> 00:38:17,030
but is he able to grab the headphones
you're fucking on so he can grab the

627
00:38:17,031 --> 00:38:17,900
headphones and put them on?

628
00:38:17,901 --> 00:38:21,560
But because I'm putting the
headphones over the top of my head,

629
00:38:21,561 --> 00:38:26,350
I can't see exactly where the headphones
are in relation to the rest of me. Um,

630
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,930
otherwise I would finally get this a
lot quicker. Jonathan just puts them on.

631
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,270
Right. And, uh, he likes to feel,

632
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:35,610
so what I was asking was what were you
doing with the paper clip? All tone.

633
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,800
I was given paper clips as
a, as an exercise to, to,

634
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,290
to get my fingers to
move again and to, to,

635
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:44,800
to throttle them together and
then to unclip them. Uh, very,

636
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:49,060
very frustrating therapy but
one has to admit that it is,

637
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:54,061
it is a good one and it takes an awful
lot of find extras movement to get paper

638
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,500
clips together and apart again,

639
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,480
put the idea of breaking down every
move you make into sub moves and sub sub

640
00:39:03,481 --> 00:39:06,240
moves and then relearning
everything. It's exhausting. Very,

641
00:39:06,241 --> 00:39:10,830
very mentally tiring because it
takes such total concentration.

642
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,330
What if you were walking down

643
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,470
the street and suddenly a
thought like a daydream pops up?

644
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,360
John Jonathan has a very good
memory of that and maybe a,

645
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,920
that'd be good to compliment. Jonathan.

646
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:29,840
Ian and I were walking through Oxford
having done some groundbreaking

647
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:34,370
experiments or whatever and he had
suddenly stumbled and I'd never seen him,

648
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,020
stubble ever before.

649
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,360
And he was looking at pretty girl and
he's thoughts had drifted from walking and

650
00:39:41,361 --> 00:39:45,620
from the concrete ahead of him to what
he'd like to do to this girl while she,

651
00:39:45,621 --> 00:39:49,070
she was, uh, about 18,
she had nut brown hair,

652
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:53,930
lovely legs and miniskirt and it was a
navy blue dress with white polka dots as

653
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:54,890
a family program.

654
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:01,660
But walks anyway to think
about walking the floor,

655
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:06,300
some merely the around the erotic
sort of charge cost you beer.

656
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:11,390
That sort of charged, but any distraction
really took me away from my focus,

657
00:40:11,391 --> 00:40:12,110
which is,

658
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,890
where is my left foot in relation to my
right for and where am I balanced at the

659
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:18,590
moment and how am I actually
going through this process?

660
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,180
At what stage am I in this movement?

661
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,720
And to suddenly be attracted
by that by a waft of perfume.

662
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,020
And a pretty girl took all
that concentration away.

663
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:30,740
It can be taken away by
the song of a bird or,

664
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:35,060
or the sound of music drifting from
somewhere. Uh, just on that day,

665
00:40:35,061 --> 00:40:35,990
it was a pretty girl

666
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:39,130
today. If you saw Ian on the street,

667
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:41,530
you wouldn't be able to tell
that he has this handicap.

668
00:40:41,531 --> 00:40:46,120
He has figured out how to live a very
deliberate and in a way kind of a normal

669
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:48,400
life. He drives a car, he works,

670
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,140
he drives that car. Yeah. My latest car,

671
00:40:52,141 --> 00:40:54,090
which is a very nice Mercedes. Um,

672
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,380
I do drive the same speed
as everybody else in all.

673
00:40:57,030 --> 00:41:00,720
[inaudible] I can react as
quickly as anybody else.

674
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,090
It's an automatic car
and it has hand controls.

675
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,830
That's the only favor to my
disability really. But, um,

676
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:11,250
I tend to do with my drive and what I do
with in the way that I manage my life,

677
00:41:11,251 --> 00:41:12,990
which is I plan ahead.

678
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,370
I just want to [inaudible]
my last question. Really.
It's free and I guess is,

679
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,560
is a, have you solved this
problem as best you can? I mean,

680
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,600
do you feel like you're
one person or do you feel,

681
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,760
uh, cut in half like a
mind directing a body?

682
00:41:30,761 --> 00:41:34,550
Like like maybe two people
or don't think about

683
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:39,130
it in the way that you've just just
related that, um, I just think about,

684
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:39,861
I want to get up,

685
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:44,230
I want a cup of tea and this is the
process I have to apply to do that. Yup.

686
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,850
That's what, that's what we all do.

687
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:50,060
I don't think stories
like this involve heroes.

688
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:55,061
They involve people who try their best
under certain circumstances and have

689
00:41:56,051 --> 00:42:00,560
tested in a way that many of us
are not. We can learn from that

690
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:05,660
Delta hand and you play
it as you as best you can.

691
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:14,883
[inaudible]

692
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:16,043
Scott speaking,

693
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,020
thanks to Ian Waterman and
to neurologist Jonathan Cole.

694
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,731
Dr. Cole wrote a very nice,

695
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:26,210
lovely book about Ian Called
Pride and daily marathon.

696
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,730
He spoke to us together from the
BBC studios in South Hampton.

697
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:32,703
That was from,

698
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:37,070
Gosh, I really should read the book.
You know. Hey, look, look at the chair.

699
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:38,270
The chair is fine. Lunch

700
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,430
cultish room doesn't get
[inaudible]. It's a dog.

701
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,500

aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

709
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:24,240
this is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad.

710
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:27,050
I'm Robert Krulwich and today on
our program we're looking at uh,

711
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:32,190
brains and bodies and how sometimes
brains and bodies can get wildly out of

712
00:43:32,281 --> 00:43:35,570
sync. And let me offer one
more flavor on this theme,

713
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:39,650
which has to do with something that
neuropsychologist Paul brox calls body

714
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:40,484
Schema.

715
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:45,500
Body schemer is the brains sort of
working model of the body in order for the

716
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:49,890
brain to keep track of where
you are, where everything is,

717
00:43:49,891 --> 00:43:52,560
it creates an inner representation of you.

718
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,450
This is what he thinks a model very much
in the virtual reality sense of where

719
00:43:57,451 --> 00:44:01,660
it thinks you are in space
and where it thinks you are.

720
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,850
The point is that we,

721
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:08,060
although we think as a very
solid distinction between
where our bodies and and

722
00:44:08,161 --> 00:44:09,570
the world begins, in fact,

723
00:44:09,571 --> 00:44:13,560
the brain has to work quite hard to
produce this kind of consistency of

724
00:44:13,561 --> 00:44:17,490
experience. And clearly it can go wrong.

725
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:22,780
This brings us to pilots.
Okay. My name is Dan Folger.

726
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,360
I spent 32 years in the Air Force,

727
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:30,361
25 that an active flying
and this incidence occurred
in July of 1952 at Luke air

728
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,040
force base in Arizona.

729
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:39,770
Our story begins on a normal
training day. It was really hot

730
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,240
in the cockpit flying down at
low level, below 3000 feet.

731
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,290
It was over a hundred degrees.

732
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:48,510
And Colonel Dan Full Jim was on
his fifth run, flying in formation,

733
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,090
doing a trading maneuver. He'd
done it a million times before,

734
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:55,590
but this time something
happened. He pulled the plane up.

735
00:44:55,591 --> 00:44:56,580
Hard rolled out. Yeah.

736
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,460
The next thing I knew I was,

737
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,850
eh,

738
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:06,820
seem to be sitting up on the back of the
airplane looking down into the cockpit.

739
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:12,890
Suddenly he was outside
the plane, not inside

740
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:16,540
to see what was going on.
I could see the ground.

741
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:18,940
I could see it with
another airplane. And um,

742
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:23,830
and when he looked in the cockpit
where he was supposed to be,

743
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:28,600
he could see a pilot. I was watching
myself not knowing it was me.

744
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,760
What's going on here?

745
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:32,780
[inaudible]

746
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,520
I'm just going to watch
this for a little while.

747
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:40,360
So he just sat there on the wing of his
own plane watching himself fly the plane

748
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:45,020
and just all of a sudden
that curtain snap.

749
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,613
So

750
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:49,220
it's not a dream. I'm actually,

751
00:45:49,221 --> 00:45:53,960
that's me in a cockpit and I'm flying
the airplane again. But we began to,

752
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,560
to realize it, Luke, that uh,

753
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:01,070
in the eight weeks of training
period that I was there,

754
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,850
we lost nine pilots. Hey died. Yeah. Wow.

755
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:09,380
And most of them for running into the
ground are running into each other in the

756
00:46:09,381 --> 00:46:10,610
air and that sort of thing.

757
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:14,180
And that's an awful lot of polished
solutions just in training.

758
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:18,310
Okay. Fast forward many
years army engineers are
studying this problem and they

759
00:46:18,311 --> 00:46:21,330
figured out some stuff about it, not much.

760
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,650
And then along comes this Guy Jim winter
or Jim Winter, he is his name ma'am.

761
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:28,300
At the Federal Aviation Administration.

762
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:30,910
Your medical research program
and he had a radical notion,

763
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:32,230
if we're going to really understand this,

764
00:46:32,231 --> 00:46:33,670
I mean really get to the bottom of this.

765
00:46:33,671 --> 00:46:37,870
We have to induce this
experience on purpose,

766
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,730
make them go blank.

767
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:44,050
Make them create the conditions that
exist in a fighter jet on the ground,

768
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,390
in a controlled environment
so they can study this.

769
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:51,520
His idea was let's put
pilots in a centrifuge,

770
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,870
this big a centrifuge and go to
these things at the astronauts use.

771
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,320
Got a 50 foot arm that

772
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,860
round and round and around and
on the end of that 50 foot arm,

773
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:02,450
this cockpit,

774
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:07,450
a cockpit pretend cockpit mocked up to
be exactly like what a fighter aircraft

775
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:13,940
might be like with all the uh,
controls. They screens the throttle.

776
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,600
That's where the pilot sits and
gets spun around real fast. I see.

777
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:23,340
So when we put out a call for volunteers,
I'm Tim says Deck Commander Says Tech.

778
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,680
I met Dr Winter. He was one of the ones
that, uh, got involved in his research,

779
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:30,040
heroically volunteered to the centrifuge

780
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,390
and to deliberately knock
himself out. Scared pilots.

781
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,233
Don't do scared.

782
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,850
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] [inaudible].

783
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:42,710
This is a recording from the experiment.

784
00:47:42,711 --> 00:47:45,050
The task was to chase
this little airplane.

785
00:47:45,051 --> 00:47:48,710
So I'd sit there and you'd follow it.
And first couple maneuvers would be,

786
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:53,690
you know, three gs g forces as the
is when you're on a rollercoaster,

787
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:58,520
five gs that force that pins
you back in your seat. Seven gs,

788
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,820
except really on a rollercoaster,

789
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:03,320
you're only ever going to experience
about two gs. And then nine gs.

790
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:05,840
Nothing like these guys
at the high g forces

791
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,360
the skin on your face sags,

792
00:48:08,361 --> 00:48:11,540
your eyelids sag so low that you
can't see out from under them.

793
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:14,900
You end up tilt your head back to look
out from under your own eyelids that are

794
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:17,680
shaking down in front of
your face. Meanwhile, yours,

795
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,670
you're tensing all your leg
muscles in your abdominal muscles,

796
00:48:20,671 --> 00:48:22,110
in your arm muscles as hard as you

797
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:24,180
can. You learn to use
your body to fight it.

798
00:48:24,181 --> 00:48:27,530
And what you do is you tend to every
muscle from your toes here, calves

799
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:31,510
side out, push it all the way
up, all the way up. Okay. And uh,

800
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:33,380
do you take a breath? Right?

801
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,310
And you start to say the word Hook
and you hold it for three seconds

802
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:44,530
and then you finish it off by finishing
the k of the hook. So these pilots,

803
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:48,310
they sound like they're wrestling
or fighting or shuffle hook.

804
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,340
They're grunting and groaning and hook.

805
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:56,833
Hello,

806
00:48:57,690 --> 00:48:59,040
making all these hook noises.

807
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:04,703
Select that

808
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:08,110
the most you have ever pulled was 12.4 gs.

809
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,630
Just to give you a sense of what
that might feel like for a pilot,

810
00:49:11,631 --> 00:49:16,580
like Tim says, doc who weighs about 200
pounds. Once he makes a 12.4 g turn,

811
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:21,581
his body goes from 200 pounds
to two almost 2,500 pounds.

812
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,660
That's like over the weight
of a car because of the
pressure pushing down on it.

813
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:29,030
Yeah, exactly. More
crucially says when Ray,

814
00:49:29,031 --> 00:49:34,031
those g forces pull blood blood violently
from the brain is pushed from the head

815
00:49:34,311 --> 00:49:39,311
down toward the feet and it pools and
the abdomen and the lower extremities and

816
00:49:40,131 --> 00:49:41,330
when it pools down there,

817
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,310
it can't get back up to the brain
and that's when the problem starts.

818
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,860
This doesn't sound very
good. No, he Dr Winter,

819
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:52,070
he documented a particular sequence that
happens when blood is pulled from the

820
00:49:52,071 --> 00:49:55,910
brain. The first thing you
lose his vision. Usually
the first thing to go there,

821
00:49:55,911 --> 00:50:00,911
your eyes and you have what's called
gray out or loss of peripheral vision and

822
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,620
you start getting tunnel vision and then
you go through blackout where you can

823
00:50:05,621 --> 00:50:06,340
see nothing.

824
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,790
You lose your sight and then if you
take the acceleration forces a little

825
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,624
higher,

826
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,930
you're lose consciousness.

827
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:15,733
When I woke up,

828
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:20,060
I remember just sitting there and
I'm in this little white space.

829
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:25,930
I actually had no idea who I was, who
am I, where I was or what I was doing?

830
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,950
Why am I doing?

831
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:31,100
I'm sitting in this little white ball
and I'm looking around and what is this

832
00:50:31,101 --> 00:50:32,690
all about? I hear this beeping.

833
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:37,080
There's this white light
beeping and then at that moment

834
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:43,390
I realize that I'm in a little room and
that I'm supposed to do something in

835
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:45,740
that. One of the things I'm
supposed to do is press that button.

836
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,600
Should I press the button and
at that moment I realized,

837
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,620
holy macro on a pilot, I'm in an
airplane and I'm not flying it,

838
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,130
but I grabbed the controls
and then just giant.

839
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:05,460
I'm Tim Sestak, Holly macro. I'm
Tim Sestak. I'm Tim Stash Jack.

840
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:06,840
I'm a pilot. I'm flying in.

841
00:51:06,841 --> 00:51:10,470
The centrifuge all came back
to me at once and I was okay.

842
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:15,650
Okay. Commando says tech, Dr.
Bennett, how are you feeling again?

843
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:16,890
I'm like, okay, go home time.

844
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:23,650
Over the course of 15 years when he tested
about 500 pilots in the center view,

845
00:51:23,661 --> 00:51:27,170
she recorded their experiences,
measured everything he could think of,

846
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,210
and he found a few things.

847
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:33,080
First at the average blackout lasted
somewhere between 12 and 24 seconds,

848
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:37,010
24 second. Yeah, and wild blacked
out. This is the interesting thing.

849
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:40,640
Pilots experienced these
strange little visions.

850
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:44,780
Visions are given an example
of the individual that,

851
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:49,340
that lost consciousness had convulsive
movements where he was moving his arms

852
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:52,160
forward and back for about
two or three seconds.

853
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,900
When he came to we ask him what
had happened. He said, uh, yeah,

854
00:51:56,901 --> 00:51:59,420
it was a nice warm day and I
was out at the lake fishing.

855
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:01,053
Okay.

856
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:05,730
All of a sudden I could feel like a,

857
00:52:05,731 --> 00:52:10,170
I had a about a five pound bass on my
line and he was tugging and each time he

858
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:10,521
tugged,

859
00:52:10,521 --> 00:52:13,780
I haven't pulled back and then all of
a sudden I was back in the centrifuge.

860
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,850
I don't know what happened.
These little dream, let's winter.

861
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:20,580
He thinks this is the brain
confused. It's cut off.

862
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,830
Meaning think it from
the brain's perspective.

863
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:27,690
It's lost the body and yet the body is
convulsing trying to get blood back up to

864
00:52:27,691 --> 00:52:30,240
the brain. The brain has no
idea why it's convulsing.

865
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:33,450
It just sees arms flailing
about. It thinks, well,

866
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:36,600
my arms are jerking back and
forth. I must be best fishing.

867
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:40,590
The things that are happening around you
frequently get incorporated into those

868
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:42,600
short streamlets. Here's one of his own.

869
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,030
Turns out he has tested himself
in the centrifuge many times.

870
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:51,390
A little dream up that I had. I was
going down the aisle of a grocery store

871
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:56,980
floating, if you will. I don't
know that I was on a magic carpet,

872
00:52:56,981 --> 00:53:01,981
but I sure wasn't having to walk and I
was just really motivated to try to pick

873
00:53:04,151 --> 00:53:08,110
up some ice cream. As I was going down
the aisle and I was moving down through,

874
00:53:08,111 --> 00:53:09,970
then I could see the freezer.

875
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,240
I knew the ice cream was over there and
I just could not move my hand over to

876
00:53:15,281 --> 00:53:16,114
get it.

877
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:21,010
The next thing I realized was I was
trying to turn off the buzzer in the

878
00:53:21,011 --> 00:53:23,620
centrifuge with my hand
and I could hear it.

879
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:28,980
I could not move it and just momentarily
I got the ability to have motor control

880
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:31,980
return and I could turn it off.

881
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:39,320
I don't know where I am. God
don't know where the hell I am.

882
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:44,060
I thought I was at the
grocery store by the way.

883
00:53:44,061 --> 00:53:44,894
The other thing is I,

884
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:48,830
I couldn't control my arm to get
the get the found off either.

885
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:50,743
That's interesting.

886
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:51,820
This recording,

887
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:55,530
you're listening to this from a day when
Dr wintery blacked out five times in a

888
00:53:55,531 --> 00:53:55,890
row.

889
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,000
I don't remember anything
on that one. Okay.

890
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:02,110
And after that fifth run, which you're
about to hear, something weird happened.

891
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:05,610
Let you take a break. Just a
few seconds. Can't you breath?

892
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,320
I don't know about that one. I
don't remember starting Allen

893
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:17,750
last ride coming up. God, I don't
know if you can take one more.

894
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:24,420
I have thing cause I not ready yet.

895
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:27,890
Sarah at the I'm hesitating cause
I'm not quite ready yet. Okay.

896
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,730
Just let me know whenever you get ready.

897
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,653
[inaudible]

898
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:36,990
well I didn't realize like you love
flow through you Brian, my brother.

899
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,440
Okay, I'm ready for that one. I did

900
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:47,110
good Bob checklist that a
station gas station is ready.

901
00:54:47,111 --> 00:54:51,450
Operator operator is ready. Medical
medical is ready. Following,

902
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,120
have you please. Hey, sort of
final already has been activated.

903
00:54:55,121 --> 00:54:59,000
Are you ready guy? Yeah, I'm
going up this time. Right? You,

904
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,420
I remember going up on this one. Yes.

905
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,940
Ron. Greg

906
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,023
[inaudible]. [inaudible]

907
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,580
yeah, I think that was enough.

908
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,140
At the end of that last
run, doctor winner,

909
00:55:41,141 --> 00:55:45,430
he got off the centrifuge woozy
and stumbled down the hall.

910
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,050
I was really confused when, uh,

911
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:50,410
when I got off the centrifuge and I
was walking down the hall back to my

912
00:55:50,411 --> 00:55:54,420
laboratory and all of a sudden
I began to realize that, uh,

913
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,740
I was above and behind myself and I
could see somebody who was myself walking

914
00:55:59,741 --> 00:56:04,300
down the hall and I said,
Oh man, that's unusual.

915
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,410
Pilots are generally not
new age kind of guys,

916
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:16,411
but at least 40 of them in wintery
study did report what he just described

917
00:56:17,081 --> 00:56:19,330
having an out of body experience.

918
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,110
We are still an even smaller
sub sub group reported

919
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,980
the classic tunnel with
light, light type thing.

920
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:31,090
All Dr Whinnery can say is
it that last sub sub group,

921
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:33,250
they were the ones who
were out the longest.

922
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,720
They had the most intense blackouts.
He's not ready to draw any conclusions,

923
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:43,620
but he does suspect that the dream lists
divisions of seeing yourself from above

924
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,730
even the tunnel and white lights,
it's all part of the same situation.

925
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:53,230
The brain is just confused
at having lost the body.

926
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:06,470
[inaudible] [inaudible] uh,

927
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:14,020
