I hope you've enjoyed our lesson.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.976
As you've seen, it's easy to extend
your existing mobile game to also work

00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:08.805
on Android TV in the same APK.

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:12.873
And if you're porting a title from the
console space, you have an opportunity

00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:16.375
to develop mobile and
a TV version at the same time.

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:19.305
If you really want to knock it out of
the park, you can take advantage of

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:22.995
unique features like nearby
connections for second screen input.

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:24.685
I can't wait to see your
game on the big screen.
