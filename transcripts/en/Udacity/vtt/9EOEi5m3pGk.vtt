00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.850
And now for the moment you've been waiting for, let's hit this green Run button.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.800
It will prompt us to choose a device, without a physical device we

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.700
can test the app, using the emulator that comes with the Android SDK.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.640
An Android virtual device, should have already been created for

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.290
you automatically when you set up Android Studio.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.010
So you can go ahead and click Ok.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.100
While the emulator's booting up, I want to point out that if you ever want

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.940
to modify your emulator devices, you can click on this purple button, in

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.420
the Android and open up the AVD manager, to manage your Android virtual devices.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.110
It lists out your existing devices, and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.720
you can always create another virtual device.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.400
You can select the category of device.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.560
And then, a specific device.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.650
Then you choose which platform version it should be running on, and

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.540
this is the only one that's available on this computer now.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.010
So Lollipop is good, and we choose the Google's API target, because it

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.560
will include some Google services already pre-installed on the emulator.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.790
You can choose Next.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.998
There's a couple more options and settings that you can, modify.

00:00:58.998 --> 00:01:01.449
For example, if you want an SD card or

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.610
a camera, and then you can go ahead and click Finish.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.370
And it will create a new AVD for you.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.300
When it loads up, we see our Sunshine app with the words, hello world.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.100
Keep in mind that the emulator is not just a simulator.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.820
It's actually running the Android virtual machine, so you can test and

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.620
debug your app, on different hardware and software configurations.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.810
You can interact with the app on the emulator using the screen or

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.290
with the navigation controls here.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.140
You can also invoke other apps, do network calls, play audio or

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.060
video and much more.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.590
It also includes debug capabilities, including log output.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.420
And the ability to simulate app interrupts or network it in C.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.240
You can also head home and browse around the device to see other apps.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.180
For example, you can check out API demos.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.080
Feel free to play around with the emulator some more.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.410
If you open up Android device monitor, you can go into the emulator control tab.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.970
There you'll see different options for

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.310
simulating behavior, on your AVD, such as for telephony and location.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.230
Now that the Hello World app runs on the emulator,

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.030
let's see what goes on behind the scenes to make the app run.
