00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:02.102
And she'd be in there
watching, like, novellas

00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:04.538
with a scale,
a bag of coke, a gun,

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:06.540
and a motherfucking Chihuahua.

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:08.175
You understand?

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:11.345
Who fucking has
a Chihuahua for protection?

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:14.348
[dramatic music]

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:22.322
â™ª

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.108
[cheers and applause]

00:00:41.141 --> 00:00:42.876
Thank you.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.478
On this show,
here's what happens.

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.079
It's just a bunch of comics
telling true stories,

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:47.147
and that's all it is.

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:48.482
The man, the myth, the legend,

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:49.816
Mr. Joey Diaz.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.419
[cheers and applause]

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.254
You know, when I was a kid,
my mom had a bar,

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.023
and she was popular, so she had
a lot of, like, girlfriends

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.091
that hung out with her,
like, hot girls.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:00.260
But there was this one chick
that she used to

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:04.331
be kind of tight with, but
I couldn't fucking understand

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:07.601
what the friendship--like, they
would be on the phone all day.

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:09.436
They would talk
five times a day.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.972
If my mother was in the city,
she would stop by her house.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.241
And then as I got older,
I got the back story,

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:17.411
that they knew each other
in Cuba, and then...

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.112
This lady's name was Z.

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:22.316
That's what we're gonna call her
for this fucking story.

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:24.551
'Cause the names have changed
to protect the innocent,

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:27.087
all that shit.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:31.692
So, uh, they came from Cuba,
and Z married some dude

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:32.960
and went to Chicago.

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:34.895
My mom opted--
went to New York.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.330
And like six months
into the marriage,

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:38.265
the guy was beating
the hell out of Z,

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:41.168
and my mom and my dad
drove down there and saved her

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.936
in the middle of the night
and took her to New York.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.204
And she was indebted to them.

00:01:44.238 --> 00:01:46.139
And this is, like,
19-fucking-60.

00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:48.275
Then, you know,
as long as I can remember,

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:49.943
my mom used to go over there.
And I liked going over

00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:52.145
to where she lived
because she went on

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.548
to become a huge drug dealer
in New York.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:57.885
Right?
On 113th and Fifth Avenue

00:01:57.918 --> 00:02:01.255
in the mouth of Spanish
motherfucking Harlem, right?

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:03.857
And it was scary.
It was like <i>The Walking Dead.</i>

00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:07.160
You see, like,
Puerto Ricans walking around.

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:10.130
People fucking nodding
on the sidewalks.

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.933
It was just amazing as
a little kid to see this.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.903
Fuck the circus and the zoo.

00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:17.304
These are real
fucking animals.

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:18.705
Like, hanging there.

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.741
Laying in their own puke
and shit.

00:02:20.774 --> 00:02:22.543
It's fucking tremendous.

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:24.645
So, I liked going there, too,
'cause she'd always give me,

00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:26.079
like, a 20 or a 50.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.881
As young as I was,
she always dropped--

00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:30.484
and she always did
a blast of coke,

00:02:30.517 --> 00:02:32.352
no matter
where the fuck she was.

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:33.987
You understand me?

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:35.956
So I would go over there,
she'd pick me up, kiss me,

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.457
and then go in her bra.
[sniffs]

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:40.194
Do a line and ask me
how school was, and...

00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:42.796
She went to my first communion.
She did a bump kneeling down

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.732
in the fucking thing.
She don't give a fuck!

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:47.601
That's a real crazy lady.

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:50.838
Not one of these ladies with a
tattoo and a hat with a feather.

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:54.208
"I'm so crazy."
No you're not, all right?

00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:56.944
No you're not.
You go to yoga at Studio City.

00:02:56.977 --> 00:02:59.513
You ain't that fucking crazy,
all right?

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:01.081
Fucking crazy.

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:05.519
Go to yoga in Compton, bitch,
and then we'll talk.

00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:08.455
So going to her house, guys,

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.757
she lived on the second floor
over a bodega.

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:12.659
This is, like, the mid-'70s.

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:13.961
You know, you knocked
on Z's door,

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:15.329
and a black guy
opened the door,

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:16.730
and he'd point you
to the back.

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:18.165
And I would run to the back,

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:20.067
and she lived, like, in a--
like in--

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.902
she had, like, maybe
three rooms,

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:23.303
you know,
like a living room.

00:03:23.337 --> 00:03:25.105
But where she sold
coke out of and heroin

00:03:25.138 --> 00:03:27.174
was this little room that
had, like, beads in the front.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.276
Like, you know,
you opened it up and shit.

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.079
And she'd be in there
watching, like, novellas

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:34.948
with a scale,
a bag of coke, a gun,

00:03:34.982 --> 00:03:37.217
and a motherfucking Chihuahua.

00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:38.385
You understand?

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:42.823
Who fucking has
a Chihuahua for protection?

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:45.993
And she was dark Cuban,
so she had big tits and an ass.

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:48.362
Like, she was good-looking,
but she had blonde hair

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.430
that was tight,
30 years before Lil' Kim.

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:52.666
I mean, she was way ahead of
her fucking time.

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:55.235
Finally, like, in the eighth or
ninth grade, I figured out,

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.703
you know,
they were just good friends.

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:58.138
They spoke all the time.

00:03:58.172 --> 00:04:00.374
But then my dad--my mom died.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:02.809
And she was
the first phone call I made.

00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:04.678
And she was the first one there,
you know?

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:06.413
She made all
the funeral arrangements.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:09.049
You motherfuckers been to
regular viewings with gentiles,

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.851
where they sit around and cry,
and it's like,

00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:12.486
"Oh, he was such a great man."

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.254
That's great.

00:04:14.288 --> 00:04:15.856
That--that's great.

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.191
Then there's
Irish fucking wakes,

00:04:17.224 --> 00:04:18.959
where people are
drinking and cursing and--

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:20.661
But then there's Cuban wakes.

00:04:20.694 --> 00:04:24.698
That makes an Irish wake look
like a fucking daycare, okay?

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:27.568
They drink 24--
and it's open 24 hours.

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:29.736
24 hours,
funeral parlor.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.338
And anything goes.
People are doing lines,

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:33.974
people are arguing,
people playing dominoes.

00:04:34.074 --> 00:04:35.809
People are playing
fucking dominoes

00:04:35.843 --> 00:04:38.846
at my mother's fucking wake,
okay?

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.848
And the first night
I hear this commotion.

00:04:40.881 --> 00:04:42.216
And I go in the hallway.

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:44.885
Z had the funeral director
by the throat

00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:47.955
because she put the wrong dress
on my mother.

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:51.325
That is a fucking friend,
motherfuckers, right?

00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:53.293
Like...'cause anybody can be
your fucking friend

00:04:53.327 --> 00:04:56.096
when you're alive, but to
fucking be at your funeral

00:04:56.096 --> 00:04:58.765
smacking motherfuckers,
right?

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:00.167
That's a friend, right?

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.768
[applause]

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:04.771
That's a fucking friend,
you know?

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:06.473
And she was checking people.

00:05:06.507 --> 00:05:08.876
Like, "Hey, fuck you.
You didn't like her,

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.678
and she didn't fucking like you.
Get out."

00:05:11.712 --> 00:05:13.881
She was checking people,
you know?

00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:16.216
And all these people were
in there, "Oh, we loved Denore,"

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.351
and all this shit.

00:05:17.384 --> 00:05:19.253
You didn't hear shit
from this lady.

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:20.554
You didn't hear a word.

00:05:20.587 --> 00:05:21.855
There was no fakeness
out of her.

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.323
Right there,
I learned what fake was

00:05:23.357 --> 00:05:24.758
and what real was.

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:26.493
At that early age,
I learned that, I saw it.

00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:27.728
Like people come up to me,

00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:29.229
"Oh, my God,
if you need anything..."

00:05:29.263 --> 00:05:30.764
And after my mom died,
I'd call 'em,

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:32.165
and they changed
their fucking phone number.

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.334
But just little things
that I saw right then.

00:05:34.368 --> 00:05:36.670
I decided, oh, my God,
that's what a fake person is.

00:05:36.703 --> 00:05:39.206
"I loved your mother.
Oh, God, take me."

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:40.541
All that shit.

00:05:40.574 --> 00:05:43.377
You know, the whole fucking
four days of the wake,

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.978
Z didn't say shit.

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:47.381
She would every once
in a while just sit in the back

00:05:47.414 --> 00:05:50.083
and just take a little bump
out of her bra.

00:05:50.117 --> 00:05:51.585
[sniffs]

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:55.656
And look at me and go, "Shh."

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.958
And she would just watch
what was going on.

00:05:57.991 --> 00:05:59.326
Even--and she was
such a woman.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.161
Like, men would be
having conversation.

00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:03.030
I'm not talking
about regular fucking guys.

00:06:03.063 --> 00:06:05.199
I'm talking about Latin,
old-school,

00:06:05.232 --> 00:06:06.700
machismo motherfuckers.

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:09.203
And she would go tell 'em shit
like, "Shut the fuck up."

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:11.371
Like, even they were
scared of her.

00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:12.739
And I observed all this,

00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:15.142
like how she had taken over
for my mother.

00:06:15.175 --> 00:06:18.312
And then the last night,
my mom got buried on a Monday,

00:06:18.345 --> 00:06:21.081
and that Sunday
I went outside to smoke a joint

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:23.116
or whatever the fuck
you go outside of a wake for.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.484
To get air.

00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:27.454
And when I came back,
she was alone with my mother.

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:29.957
It was the first time
they were alone together.

00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:33.493
And she was kneeling down,
and that's where I got it.

00:06:33.527 --> 00:06:35.929
She was...petting her hair.

00:06:35.963 --> 00:06:38.398
And she was telling her
how beautiful she was,

00:06:38.432 --> 00:06:41.168
and how the world wasn't
gonna be the same without her,

00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:44.171
and how she was gonna miss her,
and she was her sister.

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:47.174
And it was just
fucking mind-boggling.

00:06:47.207 --> 00:06:48.342
And then she said--

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:50.143
and she turned,
like she knew I was there,

00:06:50.177 --> 00:06:52.412
and she goes, "I'm gonna
take care of this motherfucker.

00:06:52.446 --> 00:06:54.414
"I'm gonna take care of him,
I'm gonna watch over him,

00:06:54.448 --> 00:06:57.084
I'm gonna make sure he
grows up to be a fucking man."

00:06:57.084 --> 00:07:00.087
And I saw the meaning
of friendship right there,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.056
when Z was petting her fucking
hair and doing bumps.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.792
She did a fucking bump
right there, right?

00:07:05.826 --> 00:07:07.561
She did a bump
looking at the casket.

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.029
She's like, "I'd give you one,

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:14.468
but what's the difference
at this point?"

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:17.037
But then it was after that
she stuck to her fucking word.

00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:19.106
Every Sunday, she'd come over
from Long Island

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:21.108
and meet me
at Weehawken Cemetery,

00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:23.410
and she'd bring
a bottle of Dewar's, flowers,

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.379
and she'd pour
the bottle of Dewar's out

00:07:25.412 --> 00:07:28.048
and tell my mother how much she
loved her and she missed her,

00:07:28.048 --> 00:07:30.050
and she'd do some bumps.
And by that time,

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.319
I was doing coke.
And she would, like, do bumps

00:07:32.352 --> 00:07:34.655
into the spirit, like,
"Here's a couple for you."

00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:36.456
And I'd be like,
"No! Let me...

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.758
Give them fucking things
to me!"

00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.259
[laughter]

00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:40.894
You're gonna fucking
throw 'em on the grass.

00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:44.565
That's $20
of fucking blast there.

00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:46.600
$20, $20, $20.

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:49.736
Stop it already!
Give it to me!

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:53.407
So...this went on.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.376
She took care of me, guys,
from '79 till '83,

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.778
till I got out of high school.

00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:00.214
Every fucking Sunday,
200 fucking beans.

00:08:00.247 --> 00:08:01.515
And she'd bring me weed,

00:08:01.548 --> 00:08:04.284
a little $5 nickel bag
from the city.

00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:06.420
And then in '83
I moved to Colorado,

00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:08.689
and, you know, I got into
craziness and shit.

00:08:08.722 --> 00:08:10.891
But I always called her
twice a week.

00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:13.093
I would send her pictures,
you know?

00:08:13.126 --> 00:08:15.095
And then I moved
back to Jersey,

00:08:15.128 --> 00:08:17.464
and by that time
I was a fucking lunatic.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.033
You know, and the cocaine
had absorbed me and stuff.

00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:21.301
And I kept in touch with her,

00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:22.903
and I would go into the city
once a week

00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:24.404
and take her
for a Cuban sandwich.

00:08:24.438 --> 00:08:26.607
There was a place
on 118th Street, we'd walk.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.176
And I went--

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:32.045
And I went to Miami,
and I found some friend of hers,

00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:33.814
and I beat 'em for,
like, a half a kilo.

00:08:33.847 --> 00:08:35.415
And I just felt fucking bad.

00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:38.218
You know how it is, dog.
One bump leads into another.

00:08:38.252 --> 00:08:39.887
Next thing you know,
you're having a party.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.655
Next thing you know,
you did six ounces of blow.

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.057
It's a fucking nightmare,
you know what I'm saying?

00:08:44.057 --> 00:08:46.527
And there's no rehabs.
There's no hugs.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.362
You know?

00:08:48.395 --> 00:08:50.130
'Cause they don't give a fuck,
you know?

00:08:50.163 --> 00:08:52.099
That's it.
So I felt embarrassed.

00:08:52.132 --> 00:08:54.401
And I came back from Miami and
I'd fucked these people over.

00:08:54.434 --> 00:08:56.069
And I felt embarrassed,
so I didn't call her.

00:08:56.103 --> 00:08:57.905
I didn't call her for,
like, five months.

00:08:57.938 --> 00:09:00.307
And in January of '85,
I finally got a little sober

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.709
and I called her one day
and I go, "Z, what's going on?"

00:09:02.743 --> 00:09:04.545
And she's like,
"Where the fuck have you been?"

00:09:04.578 --> 00:09:06.380
She goes, "You haven't called me
in, like, five months."

00:09:06.413 --> 00:09:08.549
She goes, "The cops raided me.
They took everything."

00:09:08.582 --> 00:09:12.319
She goes, "My leg broke, and
there was nobody here for me."

00:09:12.352 --> 00:09:14.021
And I felt fucking terrible.

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:16.890
I let my mother down,
I let myself down,

00:09:16.924 --> 00:09:19.026
I let Z down.
And I was at a pay phone.

00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:20.894
I just dropped
the fucking pay phone.

00:09:20.928 --> 00:09:22.663
It was like
a kick in my stomach,

00:09:22.696 --> 00:09:24.031
like she had just said,
you know,

00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:25.632
"Where the fuck
were you for me?

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:27.134
"For all those years,
I was there for you,

00:09:27.167 --> 00:09:28.836
and you just
disappeared on me."

00:09:28.869 --> 00:09:30.804
And I was--I just felt terrible,
and I--

00:09:30.838 --> 00:09:32.372
I walked away
from the pay phone.

00:09:32.406 --> 00:09:34.174
I didn't call her
for about a week or two,

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:36.844
and then I finally called
and her phone was disconnected.

00:09:36.877 --> 00:09:38.779
And I went over to the bodega
a few times,

00:09:38.812 --> 00:09:40.447
and they told me
that she got busted

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.850
and they closed the apartment,
and I never talked to her again.

00:09:42.883 --> 00:09:45.419
And I felt like shit.
And I live with that today.

00:09:45.452 --> 00:09:48.755
And that 1985, you know?

00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:51.124
And I thought about it,
and I digested it,

00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:53.927
and I swore to God that if
I ever had a chance

00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:55.696
to be a friend to somebody--

00:09:55.729 --> 00:09:57.097
'Cause you don't need
20 friends.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.632
You just need
three motherfuckers,

00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:00.534
and you can
take over a country.

00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:03.003
Okay, that's where we're
confused as Americans.

00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:04.671
We think we need
all these motherfuckers.

00:10:04.705 --> 00:10:06.773
You give me
three bad motherfuckers

00:10:06.807 --> 00:10:08.242
and you're finished.

00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:09.576
You understand me?

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.011
You're fucking finished...
[cheers and applause]

00:10:11.044 --> 00:10:13.347
because we got each other.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:18.318
And, you know, listen, man,
like Ari.

00:10:18.352 --> 00:10:20.220
Ari's my fucking goombah
till the end.

00:10:20.254 --> 00:10:22.022
He might be
a Jew or whatever,

00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:25.058
and I'm Cuban,
but that's my fucking goombah.

00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:26.860
And he knows
that's what I'm here.

00:10:26.894 --> 00:10:28.996
Not because whatever,
but, you know,

00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:31.265
I promised that I would be
a friend to people,

00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:32.900
and I would
live and die for them.

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:35.035
And, you know,
when I look at people now,

00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:37.004
I always look at people
sometimes and I go,

00:10:37.037 --> 00:10:39.239
"How's that motherfucker
gonna feel when I die?"

00:10:39.273 --> 00:10:41.308
Is he gonna be talking shit
at my funeral

00:10:41.341 --> 00:10:43.143
or is he gonna
squeeze my daughter

00:10:43.177 --> 00:10:45.279
and come see her every week
and give her a toy?

00:10:45.312 --> 00:10:47.381
You know, and that's how
I have to look at people.

00:10:47.414 --> 00:10:49.216
That's how I was raised,
you know?

00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:51.051
And I always lived
with that guilt

00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:54.087
of not doing something
for my friend.

00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:56.857
And then in 2007
I got off the blow.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:58.659
I quit doing cocaine.
Don't ask.

00:10:58.692 --> 00:11:00.127
You know?
Don't clap.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.095
Nobody's supposed to do it
anyway, you know?

00:11:02.129 --> 00:11:03.864
People are like,
"I'm off drugs."

00:11:03.897 --> 00:11:05.365
You're an asshole.
You're not supposed to do drugs

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:07.835
anyway, okay?
Don't fucking break your arm

00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:10.404
tapping yourself on the back,
asshole.

00:11:10.437 --> 00:11:12.673
So...

00:11:12.706 --> 00:11:14.107
Right or wrong?

00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:15.843
These motherfuckers walk around
with their water,

00:11:15.876 --> 00:11:17.077
"I'm sober now."

00:11:17.077 --> 00:11:19.079
Who gives a fuck?
You know?

00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:21.748
You know, two months ago
you were sucking dick for rock

00:11:21.782 --> 00:11:23.083
at The Roxy.

00:11:23.116 --> 00:11:25.185
Now I gotta fucking
shake your hand.

00:11:25.219 --> 00:11:28.121
Fuck you.

00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:31.325
You motherfuckers don't know,
you know what I'm saying?

00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:35.662
So I got off coke.

00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:37.397
I had been off coke,
like, four days.

00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:40.701
[laughter]

00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:41.869
And that was tough for me.

00:11:41.902 --> 00:11:43.537
I used to go, like,
18 hours,

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.874
and I'm like, "Ooh!"

00:11:46.907 --> 00:11:49.176
That's a long fucking time,
you know?

00:11:49.209 --> 00:11:52.112
I was clean for four days,
and a dear friend of mine dies.

00:11:52.112 --> 00:11:54.815
It was a comedian.
She died of cancer.

00:11:54.848 --> 00:11:56.650
And there was
this one producer

00:11:56.683 --> 00:11:58.819
that used to mess with us
all the time here in L.A.

00:11:58.852 --> 00:12:00.754
He would have these festivals
and tell us

00:12:00.787 --> 00:12:02.890
that he was gonna book us,
and then decide,

00:12:02.923 --> 00:12:04.892
"Oh, no, no, I'm not hiring
dirty comics this year.

00:12:04.925 --> 00:12:06.460
Why would you have to
work so dirty?"

00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:08.462
He'd make us feel bad
about being dirty comics,

00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:10.731
when we were just expressing
who the fuck we were.

00:12:10.764 --> 00:12:13.367
You know what I'm saying?
So...

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.835
I saw him then.

00:12:14.868 --> 00:12:16.670
He had messed with
me and Marilyn a couple times,

00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:18.138
and I saw him at the church.

00:12:18.172 --> 00:12:19.740
Right?
I saw him at the church,

00:12:19.773 --> 00:12:21.074
but it was 10:00.

00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:22.676
I was a little
on the stoned side.

00:12:22.709 --> 00:12:24.178
I said I might as well
not say nothing.

00:12:24.211 --> 00:12:26.346
You know, sometimes
you do a bong hit before church

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.081
just to calm your nerves.

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:30.784
You know, sometimes
just 1 1/2 just to, you know,

00:12:30.817 --> 00:12:33.754
just to loosen you up
before church.

00:12:33.787 --> 00:12:35.389
And, uh...

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:37.090
'Cause church sucks
without a bong hit.

00:12:37.124 --> 00:12:39.359
Trust me, that's why
it sucked as a kid.

00:12:39.393 --> 00:12:42.362
Once you start doing bong hits,
church ain't that bad.

00:12:42.396 --> 00:12:44.464
It's a fucking hour,
people shake hands,

00:12:44.498 --> 00:12:46.967
they give you a cookie,
you know, everybody--

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.204
"Peace be with you,"
you know what I'm saying?

00:12:50.237 --> 00:12:52.339
[laughs]

00:12:52.372 --> 00:12:53.807
Right or wrong?

00:12:53.841 --> 00:12:55.742
"Peace be with you, brother.
Peace be with you.

00:12:55.776 --> 00:12:58.846
Peace be with you."

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:01.748
So that night they had
a memorial at a comedy club.

00:13:01.782 --> 00:13:03.050
When I walk
into the memorial,

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.952
well, they had free food
at the memorial.

00:13:05.052 --> 00:13:06.053
Like, this--
Like, they had--

00:13:06.053 --> 00:13:07.554
They buried her that day,

00:13:07.588 --> 00:13:09.223
but they had, like,
a microphone.

00:13:09.256 --> 00:13:11.191
They had a picture where you're
gonna go up and say words.

00:13:11.225 --> 00:13:13.193
Then they had free food.
When I walk in,

00:13:13.227 --> 00:13:17.564
guess who's eating the fucking
free motherfucking food?

00:13:17.598 --> 00:13:20.501
That motherfucking producer.

00:13:20.534 --> 00:13:23.203
Now, by that time, I'm bre--
it's after 8:00.

00:13:23.237 --> 00:13:25.305
The cocaine addiction
is growing.

00:13:25.339 --> 00:13:27.074
I'm getting madder
by the minute.

00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:29.543
I'm Cuban.
It's fucking just...

00:13:29.576 --> 00:13:31.245
it's just developing, right?

00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:33.080
And they come over to me,
they go, "Listen,

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.516
when we do the memorial,
can you go up on stage first?"

00:13:35.549 --> 00:13:38.185
And I'm like, "Absolutely."
And I'll get my words over,

00:13:38.218 --> 00:13:39.553
and I'll get
the fuck out of here

00:13:39.586 --> 00:13:40.988
so I can go home
and go to sleep

00:13:41.088 --> 00:13:43.357
before I choke
this motherfucker, too, right?

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.259
So they say, "Coming to
the stage, Joey Diaz."

00:13:45.292 --> 00:13:47.094
I go on stage.
People, you know me.

00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:49.096
I talk for like a minute,
and I can't--

00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:51.498
this motherfucker's over there
with that smile on his face.

00:13:51.532 --> 00:13:53.367
You know when somebody's
got, like, that smile

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.835
on their fucking face?

00:13:54.868 --> 00:13:57.771
And in the middle of
my memorial, I just stopped.

00:13:57.804 --> 00:14:00.407
And I go, "I don't know what
the fuck you're smiling about,

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.043
motherfucker," you know?
"But I tell you what,

00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:05.045
"I'm gonna go get a drink,
and when I get back,

00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:06.947
"you, your wife,
and that fucking attorney

00:14:07.047 --> 00:14:08.482
"better get the fuck out here

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:10.417
'cause I'm gonna
fuck you motherfuckers up."

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.885
And I was serious, Jack.

00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:14.888
I was fucking serious.
Like, I was done.

00:14:14.922 --> 00:14:17.224
Like, seven days
without a line of coke.

00:14:17.257 --> 00:14:19.159
This motherfucker--
this is my out.

00:14:19.193 --> 00:14:21.061
I'll beat him up,
and then fuck it,

00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:22.863
they'll throw me in county jail
for 30 days.

00:14:22.896 --> 00:14:24.464
By the time I get out,
I'll be clean and sober.

00:14:24.498 --> 00:14:26.400
I mean, that was my fucking...

00:14:26.433 --> 00:14:28.702
That's how you gotta think
when you're fucking addicted,

00:14:28.735 --> 00:14:30.437
how I was, you know?

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.106
But I was really pissed about
what this motherfucker had done

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.609
to me and to Marilyn,
and how he had the balls

00:14:35.642 --> 00:14:36.977
to show up at this fucking wake

00:14:37.077 --> 00:14:39.112
with that smile
on his fucking face.

00:14:39.146 --> 00:14:41.248
And as I went to the drink,
and I came back in,

00:14:41.281 --> 00:14:43.150
and him and his fucking family
were gone.

00:14:43.183 --> 00:14:45.919
When I walked to my car,
I thought about one thing.

00:14:45.953 --> 00:14:48.889
That I'm through.
I-I-I did what I had to do.

00:14:48.922 --> 00:14:50.424
Without even knowing,

00:14:50.457 --> 00:14:53.093
I stuck up for one of my friends
who had died.

00:14:53.093 --> 00:14:55.495
And that night
I became that much better

00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:56.964
as a human fucking being.

00:14:56.997 --> 00:14:58.532
I made my peace with Z,

00:14:58.565 --> 00:15:00.133
I made my peace
with my mother,

00:15:00.167 --> 00:15:02.269
and most importantly
I made my peace with myself.

00:15:02.302 --> 00:15:03.937
And that's my story
about friendship.

00:15:04.037 --> 00:15:06.240
[cheers and applause]
