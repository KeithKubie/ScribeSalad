00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So let's say that this is part of the Web page we receive.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's our HTML input and we're going to run our Lexer over it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's just make sure we understand how this embedded JavaScript

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is passed down the line,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
by having you tell me what token.value--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the string eventually associated with the token--will be?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I've listed 4 possible options, but only 1 of them can be right.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Check the one that you think

00:00:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
corresponds to token.value for this HTML input.
