Well, judgi- oh, time.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.310
&gt;&gt; Yes. So, we shouldn't be approving any bookings if there isn't

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.640
an actual time for them to be booked at. because then it's incomplete.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.280
&gt;&gt; So, use this approval process if set time

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.725
is equals blank and just kind of just leave it blank?

00:00:15.725 --> 00:00:17.750
&gt;&gt; Is not equal to blank. Because if.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.160
&gt;&gt; All right, Sorry. Not equal to blank.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.090
&gt;&gt; So this means if, if a time is

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.130
set, then we need to see an approval process.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah. In order to set an approval

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.150
process, you have to push the Submit for

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.320
Approval button, but if they push that button and

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.680
there is no time set, it shouldn't fire this

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.750
approval process, because it's not ready to be approved.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.540
&gt;&gt; Gotcha.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.130
&gt;&gt; So you can leave that blank.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.340
&gt;&gt; Blank.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.610
&gt;&gt; Makes sense.
