00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.000
PROFESSOR: Hello.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.980
Welcome.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.690
Welcome back from
spring break.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.120
Today what I want to do
is talk about op-amps.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.070
And in particular what I want to
do is talk about modularity

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.030
in circuit design.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.510
How do you make circuits
that are modular?

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.640
We'll see that there's special
problems when you think about

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.060
modularity applied
to circuits.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.840
And op-amps are one solution
for helping us think about

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.550
those problems.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.890
Before launching straight into
something new though, I'd like

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.340
to recap where we are under the
assumption that you may

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.310
not have been thinking about
this exactly currently.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.290
So last time we took our
first look at circuits.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.280
Circuits are very different from
the kinds of things we've

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.160
thought about before.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.880
Before, in programming, in
linear systems theory, we

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.380
thought about blocks that had
well-defined inputs and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.320
well-defined outputs.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.310
Circuits are different.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.510
Circuits are all connected
together.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.530
And circuit theory is thinking
about how do you organize your

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.560
thoughts about complicated
interactions among things.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.630
The parts interact because they
touch each other and they

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.810
share voltages.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.830
Because they touch each other,
they share currents.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.950
And you have to somehow
think about that

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.520
whole complicated system.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.930
We figured out that the way you
think about that, you can

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.140
think about it as three
separate enterprises.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.290
How do you think
about voltages.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.260
How do you think
about currents.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.360
And how do you think
about the elements.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.530
How do you think
about voltages?

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.610
Well, the sum of the
voltages around any

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.120
closed loop is zero.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.070
Done.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.720
KVL --

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.290
Kirchoff's Voltage Law.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.520
How do you think
about currents?

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.900
Draw any surface.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.670
The net current that leaves
the surface is zero.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.350
KCL --

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.460
Kirchoff's Current Law.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.430
How do you think about
the elements?

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.130
Well it depends on
the element.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.700
If you're thinking about a
linear resistor, it's Ohm's

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.440
Law, V equals IR.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.560
If you're thinking about a
source, it could be a voltage

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.640
source, then V equals v0,
some fixed number.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.850
If you're thinking about a
current source, then current

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.840
is fixed at some fixed number.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.390
So it depends.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.840
When you're thinking about the
element laws, it depends on

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.720
what element you are
thinking about.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.820
And then you just combine all
of those, and you can solve

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.150
the circuit.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.320
The only problem that arises
is that those equations are

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.750
highly redundant.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.200
There's a lot more KVL equations
than you need.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.770
There's a lot more KCL equations
than you need.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.430
And so in fact, the trick in
analyzing a circuit is to

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.650
figure out the smallest number
of equations that are

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.960
adequate, the number of
equations that are necessary

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.860
and sufficient to
find a solution.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.440
Last time we went through three

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.000
different ways to do that.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.690
We thought about what I will
think of as primitive or

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.390
element voltages and currents.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.450
The idea in that technique is
you think about every element

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.710
and assign to that element
its voltage and its

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.960
corresponding current.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.590
Then that gives you, as in this
example if you've got six

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.020
elements, that gives you six
unknowns, one voltage across

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.290
every element, one current
through every element.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.820
So then you've got to dig up
six other relationships.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.440
Sorry, start again.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.650
Six elements, six voltages, six
currents, 12 unknowns, you

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.065
need to come up with
12 equations.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.790
Six of them are element
equations.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.560
So six are easy.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.170
Then you have to come
up with six more.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.150
And for this particular circuit,
it turns out that

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.920
there is three independent

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.100
Kirchoff's Voltage Law equations.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.560
And there are three independent
KCL, Kirchoff's

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.270
Current Law equations.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.080
12 equations, 12 unknowns
to solve, done.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.480
That's actually more work
than you need to do.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.020
So we looked at two other
techniques for solving the

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.700
same kind of circuits.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.265
One's called node voltages
and another

00:04:51.265 --> 00:04:53.970
is called loop currents.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.760
They are duals of each other.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.560
In the node voltage method you
figure out exactly the minimum

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.720
number of voltages that I would
have to tell you in

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.120
order to specify all of
the element voltages.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.790
So for example, if I told you
this voltage here, and that

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.660
voltage there, and this voltage
there, and that

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.480
voltage there, four of them,
that would let you calculate

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.510
all of the element voltages.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.920
But now I only have four
instead of six.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.280
Four nodes instead of six
element voltages.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.750
So it's smaller.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.720
And we talked about last time
how you could find the correct

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.390
equations that go with
those node voltages.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.870
In the loop current method, you
specify the minimum number

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.020
of currents that would be
sufficient to account for all

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.920
of the element currents.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.970
And here in this circuit
it required three.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.600
Three is smaller than six.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.010
There were six element
currents.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.240
So again we've got a reduction
in the number of unknowns --

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.965
12 4, 3.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.150
So that's kind of the idea.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.780
And just to make sure that
you're all with it, think

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.720
about this problem.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.700
How many of the following
expressions are correct?

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.150
Feel free to talk to
your neighbor.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.930
At the end of about 45 seconds,
I'll ask you to raise

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.020
your hand with a number of
fingers, (1) through (5) --

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.640
indicating which is the
correct answer.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.820
Dead silence.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.070
You're allowed to talk.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.100
OK, so how many of the
relations are true?

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.340
Everybody raise your hand.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.740
Indicate a number fingers that
tells me how many of the

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.020
answers are correct.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:50.900
Come on.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.790
Blame it on your neighbor.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.330
You can say anything, right?

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.660
It's always your neighbor's
fault.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.200
That's very good.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.950
It's about 95% correct,
almost all correct.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.260
This first equation,
what is this?

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.780
Give that a name.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.840
KVL.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.020
Is it correct?

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:10.580
Sure.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.010
You need to figure out which
path it corresponds to.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.180
It goes through--

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.640
The only v's are over here.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.860
So therefore it must be
something that has to do with

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.170
this circuit.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:23.850
So this says that there's
1, 2, 6, and 5.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.140
That's path 1, 2, 6, and 5.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.835
So all you really need to do
is check the polarities.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.720
So if we took all of the
variables to the same side,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.100
then we'd have minus v1 plus
v2 plus v6 plus v5.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.180
If we think about going a loop
that goes through the minus

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.140
v1, that would be this way.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.170
Plus v2 plus v6 plus v5.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.770
So that's right.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:49.720
Easy.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.180
What's the point of
this equation?

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.630
v6 equals e1 minus e2,
what's that say?

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.860
Why'd I ask that?

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.300
Yeah.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.550
AUDIENCE: It's saying
that the--

00:10:05.692 --> 00:10:08.340
PROFESSOR: Exactly, it's
intended to make you think

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.510
through the relationship
between the primitive

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.920
variables, the element
voltages,

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.520
and the node voltages.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.660
If I told you the node voltages
e1 and e2, you could

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.570
trivially compute v6.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.540
You could also compute
any of the other v's.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.250
If I told you to find v--

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.650
what is that?

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:29.650
My eyes are not very good.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.800
v4, if I told you to find v4,
that would be e1 minus ground.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.850
We assign the number 0 to
ground, so that would be e1.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.030
So the idea, the reason I ask
number (2), is to make you

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.750
think about how you relate
the node voltages

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.280
to the element voltages.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.620
How about number (3),
what's that?

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.600
Well it's highly related
to number (2).

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.660
But it's different from
number (2), because?

00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.600
AUDIENCE: Ohm's Law?

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.080
PROFESSOR: Ohm's Law.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.820
So equation (3) is the way Ohm's
Law looks when you use

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:06.070
node equations.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.980
Ohm's Law is a little bit
uglier when you use node

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:14.930
equations than when you use
primitive variables.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.090
When you use primitive
variables, the same

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:23.970
relationship would've simply
said that v6 is R6 times i6.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.970
Because I'm using node voltages
instead, the voltage

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:36.400
across resistor six shows
up as a difference.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.220
How about this one?

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.470
What's that?

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.726
True or false, this is KCL?

00:11:47.726 --> 00:11:48.702
AUDIENCE: False.

00:11:48.702 --> 00:11:49.678
AUDIENCE: False.

00:11:49.678 --> 00:11:52.606
AUDIENCE: --KCL.

00:11:52.606 --> 00:11:53.582
PROFESSOR: True.

00:11:53.582 --> 00:11:56.510
This is KCL, true.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:57.990
OK.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.005
This is KCL, false.

00:12:01.005 --> 00:12:02.280
Well, obviously we're
numerous.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.900
And it's not, sort of, 100%
participation, but--

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.830
This is not KCL.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.920
What is that?

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.170
KCL says that the sum
of current out

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.710
of some closed path.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.410
This is mixed thing.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.210
i6 is one of these things.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.520
And IB and IC is one
of these things.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.210
So what is the equation for?

00:12:26.406 --> 00:12:27.850
AUDIENCE: Incorrect.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.350
PROFESSOR: Incorrect, yes.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.428
What would be the correct way
of saying equation (4)?

00:12:33.428 --> 00:12:34.678
AUDIENCE: i6 equals--

00:12:38.308 --> 00:12:39.772
i6 is--

00:12:39.772 --> 00:12:41.724
PROFESSOR: The answer to set
questions according to the

00:12:41.724 --> 00:12:45.671
theory of lectures is go
to the next slide.

00:12:45.671 --> 00:12:47.042
Here's the correct expression.

00:12:47.042 --> 00:12:48.710
Why is this correct, and why
is that not correct?

00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:59.796
Equation (4) is intended to be
how do you relate the loop

00:12:59.796 --> 00:13:01.885
current to the element
currents?

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.560
So i6 is an element current.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.900
It's the current that
goes through R6.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.750
When we do loop currents, we
have two currents going

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.000
through R6.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.190
So in the loop current view,
the total current that goes

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.940
through R6 is a sum or
difference of the two loop

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.500
currents that go through R6.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.950
So the element current through
R6, which is i6, is a sum or

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.520
difference of loop currents.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.340
There are two loop currents
we have to worry about.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.700
Which one goes through in
the correct direction?

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.530
i6 goes from left to right.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.960
So when we do the loop currents,
we need to take

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.650
positive as the direction
from left to right.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:52.150
Well that's the direction of
IC and is the opposite

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.300
direction of IB.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.220
So if I want to use loop
currents to specify i6, it

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.960
would be IC minus IB.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.220
Everybody clear on that?

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.970
So equation (4) is the relation
between element

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:13.170
currents and loop currents.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.420
So what's equation (5)?

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.830
Equation (5) is Ohm's Law
for loop currents.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.750
Again, if I were thinking about
Ohm's Law for R6, I

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:31.020
would have v6 equals i6 R6.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:35.340
That's the way you say it in
element voltages and currents.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:41.590
Over here, the current through
R6 is IC minus IB.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.940
So Ohm's Law looks a little
bit more complicated.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:50.530
So the point is these three
methods represent ways of

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:56.310
figuring out a linearly
independent set of unknowns

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:59.110
and equations.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.960
They differ.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.870
The left hand one is probably
the easiest to think about,

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:05.110
especially when you're
thinking about

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.770
things like Ohm's Law.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.520
It's the natural way to
specify the element

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.020
relationships.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.920
It's the relation between
the voltage and current

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.180
through that part.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:19.350
That generally gives me
a large number of

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.600
equations and unknowns.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.550
You can reduce the number of
unknowns by using something

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.710
like node voltages
or loop currents.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:33.980
And that gives you fewer
equations to solve.

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.010
They are completely
equivalent.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.170
They look a little different.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:41.490
And the reason for talking about
them is that when we

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.220
think about writing a program
to solve circuits

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.350
automatically, which by the way
will be the exercise in

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:48.670
software lab this week.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.970
When we think about writing a
program, writing a program is

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:56.620
yet a different kind
of challenge.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:01.040
What's the easiest system
to automate?

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:06.040
So the system that is easiest
for you may or may not be the

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.750
easiest system to automate.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.580
So that's the point of this
week's software lab.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.120
We'll do a method that's closely
related to the node

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.320
voltage method.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.590
It's not quite node voltages.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:22.340
It's a little simpler than node
voltages for a computer.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.300
It's a little simpler
to automate.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.410
So we use a method that's called
node voltages with

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:29.660
component currents.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.680
OK, now I'm going to
start new stuff.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.930
That was review.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.450
What I want to think about
today is what is it about

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.080
circuit design that
makes it hard.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:52.040
What are the issues that make
it difficult to be modular

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.870
when we're thinking
about the analysis

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.540
and design of circuits.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:59.720
And one of the hardest things to
deal with is the idea that

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:04.819
in a circuit, unlike in a linear
time invariant system

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:08.680
of the type we talked about in
the previous module, in a

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.420
circuit the presence of every
element affects the currents

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.780
and voltages through, in

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.450
principle, every other element.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:25.280
So if you change one thing,
you change everything.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.700
So first off, I want to just
give an example of that.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:34.190
Think about what would happen
if I were trying to make a

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:39.540
circuit to control the
brightness of a light bulb.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.130
So I imagine that I've
got this circuit

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:44.490
and I close the switch.

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:45.560
Closing the switch is

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.280
equivalent to adding a component.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.910
So before I close the switch,
when the switch was open, I

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.760
have three elements, a voltage
source and two resistors.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.520
After I close the switch, I
have four elements, the

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.380
original three plus the bulb.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.480
So the question is how would
closing the switch

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.730
affect V0 and I0.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:06.970
Take a minute.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:07.870
Talk to your neighbor.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.655
Figure out how V0
and I0 change.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.600
So what's the answer?

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.920
Everybody raise your hand, show
a number of fingers equal

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.420
to the answer.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.060
That's very good.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:34.540
It's 95% correct at
least, maybe 100.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.070
OK, so the answer is (2).

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.690
Why is the answer (2)?

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.775
How do I figure that out?

00:20:39.775 --> 00:20:43.170
AUDIENCE: So the total
resistance of the circuit is

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.570
going to decrease because you're
adding it in parallel.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:53.790
And then V0 is going to decrease
because it's going to

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.225
have a lower equivalent
resistance.

00:20:56.225 --> 00:21:00.610
And because that decreases,
you have I0 to--

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.600
PROFESSOR: Yes, I think that's
exactly correct.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.970
So the idea was that when
you add a component--

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:11.020
Let's think about the light
bulb being a resistor.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.660
That's kind of pulled out of
thin air, but I sort of

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.120
suggested that you might
do that here.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.810
Think about representing the
light bulb as a resistor.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.205
Then when you close the switch,
these two resistors go

00:21:21.205 --> 00:21:22.720
in parallel.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.490
When you combine two things in
parallel, the result is the

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:31.520
same as a resistance that
has a smaller value.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.060
And then think about how that
smaller value would interact

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.600
with this resistor
and that source.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:41.570
And you can sort of figure out
that the presence of this bulb

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:45.780
would reduce this voltage and
increase that current.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:51.880
That's kind of a high level of
reasoning given where we are.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.780
If you wanted to think through
this a little more step by

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:58.150
step, it's easy.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.940
You could think about figuring
out what are the voltages and

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.145
currents before and after
you close the switch.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.830
Before you close the switch, you
can just ignore this, and

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.480
you can calculate V0 just
from a voltage divider

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.440
relationship.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.060
Right, that's clear?

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:20.890
So you can see that when the
switch is open, the voltage,

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:22.155
V0, is going to be 8 Volts.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.550
And when the switch is open,
you can figure out I0 by

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:31.370
lumping these two resistors
together to

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:32.690
make a 3 Ohm resistor.

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:34.250
And you see that I0 is 4 Amps.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.230
Then to figure out what happens
when you close the

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.480
switch, just repeat.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:47.140
And the algebra is a little
more tedious.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.130
I won't try to go through it.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.800
By the way, the answers, the
slides that I show in lecture

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.430
are always posted on the web.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.300
So these slides that have the
answers, they are there.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.820
On the web there are two
handouts per lecture.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.290
There's an electronic
version of the thing

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:04.170
that we handed out.

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.240
There's also an electronic
version of my slides.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.880
So everything that I
showed is there.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.580
I'm not going to go through
the tedious algebra.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.820
It's just tedious algebra.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.630
But if you go through the
tedious algebra, you find that

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:20.240
if you represent this bulb by
resistor R, V0 becomes an

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.555
expression that looks
like this.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.770
If you think about resistors,
physical resistors, if you

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.340
think about light bulbs being
represented by a physical

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.470
resistor, then the physical
resistor has to have a

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.340
resistance between
0 and infinity.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.730
And if you think about that
expression, what could the

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.020
value be if R varied between
0 and infinity?

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:44.460
That expression is always less
than or equal to 8 Volts,

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:49.350
showing that V0 went down when
you closed the switch.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:52.620
Similar tedious algebra leads to
an expression like this in

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:56.640
R. And if you think about how
this would change as R goes

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.930
from 0 to infinity, you
see that that's always

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:00.180
bigger than 4 Amps.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.020
So that means I0 goes up.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.480
So the point is you can think
through this in a more

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.580
sophisticated way.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.580
And we hope by the end of
the course you'll all

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.840
be able to do that.

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:13.140
Or you can think through
it in terms of

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.450
just solving the circuit.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.516
Solve it in two cases when the
bulb is there and when the

00:24:17.516 --> 00:24:18.690
bulb is not.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.710
Either way, the answer is (2).

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.430
The V0 went down,
and I0 went up.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:31.050
The point is that when I added
the element, currents that

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:35.150
were far away from the element
still changed.

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:38.460
And that's a general way
circuits interact.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.530
They're all connected.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:43.180
So the idea, the point of
doing this is that the

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.460
addition of a new element
changed the voltages and

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.320
currents through the
other element.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.290
That's a drag if what I was
trying to do, for example, was

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:58.720
design a brightness controller
for the flashlight bulb.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.680
Imagine that what I really
wanted to do was use a voltage

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.180
divider to make 8 Volts.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.160
And what was in my head was I'd
like that 8 Volts to be

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.170
across the light bulb.

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.160
That's a good idea.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.940
It just won't work.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.410
At least It won't work the
way this circuit worked.

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:19.600
If I just build it like so,
there's an interaction between

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.080
the bulb and the voltage divider
circuits, so the

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.760
voltage divider circuit is no
longer a voltage divider.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:30.610
After, in this circuit, when
I close the switch, current

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.870
flows in this wire.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.650
The rule in a voltage divider
is the same current has to

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:39.050
flow through both resistors.

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.350
If the same current flows
through two resistors, then

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:43.380
you can use the voltage divider
relationship to see

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.260
how voltage partitions between
the two resistors.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.950
If current gets siphoned off
the node between the two

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:50.370
resistors, you can't
use the voltage

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:52.020
divider relation anymore.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:56.720
That violates the premise of the
voltage divider relation.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.350
So when I close the switch, this
is no longer a voltage

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:03.840
divider, and it no longer works
like a voltage divider.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.860
Is that clear?

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.980
So what I'd really like is some
magic circuit that I can

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:12.200
put here that isolates the
effect of the bulb on the

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.790
effect of the rest
of the circuit.

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.080
And that's exactly what
an op-amp does.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.850
That's what we're going
to talk about next.

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:20.370
So this magic circuit
is something that

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.750
we'll call a buffer.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.300
A buffer is a thing
that isolates the

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.360
left from the right.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.200
So the buffer is going to be
something that measures the

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.240
voltage on this side and
magically generates that

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:38.200
voltage over here without
changing this side.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.490
So what we want to do now is
develop some thought tools for

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:43.600
how you think about op-amps.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.910
Op-amps are different.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.120
And if you just look at the
picture, op-amp has to be

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.410
different because there's
too many terminals.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:54.170
It's not like a resistor
that has two legs.

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:55.890
It's not like a V source
which has two legs.

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:57.590
It's not like an I source
which has two legs.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.890
It has three legs.

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:02.230
In fact, I haven't drawn
all the legs.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.670
There's more than three.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.750
There's at least five.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.570
So they're different.

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.490
And the way we think about
them are different.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:13.520
The key to thinking about the
way an op-amp works is to

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.390
think about a new class
of elements

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.830
called controlled elements.

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.340
So a controlled element is an
element whose voltage current

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:27.380
relationship depends somehow
on a voltage and current

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.140
measured someplace else
in the circuit.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:32.470
As an example, think
about a current

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:35.280
controlled current source.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.210
That's depicted here.

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.330
I would normally
write a current

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:41.510
source that was a circle.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.140
That means it's an independent
current source.

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:47.030
That means that the
current is fixed.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:50.680
The little diamond thing is my
way of representing the idea

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:54.980
that the amount of current that
comes out of this current

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:59.360
source depends on
something else.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.970
In this case it depends on IB.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:05.060
And IB happens to be a current
that flows in that circuit.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.420
So the idea is that the current
in the current source

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.320
depends on some other current.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.360
It's a current controlled
current source.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.010
It's a current source whose
current is controlled by

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:18.271
another current.

00:28:18.271 --> 00:28:19.521
Got it?

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.070
So we'll see.

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:27.240
Figure out, for this current
controlled current source

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.200
circuit, what's the ratio
of Vout over Vin?

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:41.680
So what's the answer?

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.223
What's the ratio of
Vout over Vin?

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:50.125
100%, wonderful.

00:30:50.125 --> 00:30:52.590
The answer is (4).

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:54.562
Easy to get.

00:30:54.562 --> 00:30:56.560
It's easy to get because
I rigged this

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.730
question to be easy.

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:00.370
I rigged it to be easy because
you can sort of figure out

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:01.760
everything that's going
on on the left.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.050
And then you can figure
out everything that's

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:03.860
going on on the right.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:05.860
And so there's no sort
of complicated

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:07.670
coupling between the two.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:09.350
So what's going on on
the left, well, you

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.160
can solve for IB.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:16.110
IB is just Vi over 1,000 Ohms.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:19.090
Then you can take that value
of IB and use that to solve

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:22.700
for what's going on over here.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:27.380
Over here the out is this
current, 100 IB times this

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.910
resistance, 5 Ohms.

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:32.790
But we just found out that
IB is VI over 1,000 Ohms.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:36.120
Substitute it in,
you get half Vi.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.290
So the answer is number (4).

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:43.450
The ratio of Vout to
Vin is a half.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:47.280
So the point is these are a
different kind of element,

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.520
controlled sources,
dependent sources.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.790
But they're not too
hard to work with.

00:31:55.790 --> 00:32:00.350
They sort of look different
structurally.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.370
So think about what's
going on here.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:06.040
The controlled current source,
the current controlled current

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.130
source, I have to think of that
as a box, because the

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:12.250
current source has to know
the value of IB.

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:15.770
So somehow this box, this
thing that's doing this

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:20.180
current controlled current
source, it knows about IB, and

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.830
it knows about the
current source.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:24.020
So they're somehow linked.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:27.060
So that's why I put
a box around it.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.530
And then think about the
equations that characterize

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:31.420
that component.

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.340
So now we've got a component
that's got four wires

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:36.690
coming out of it.

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:39.000
The components we had before
had two wires coming out of

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.590
them, resistors, current
sources, voltage sources.

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:46.440
This kind of a component has
four wires coming out of them.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.040
We call this kind of a component
a two-port because

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:54.110
we think of the left port
and the right port.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:55.535
That's compared to resistor,
which we

00:32:55.535 --> 00:32:56.785
would call a one-port.

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:02.870
We think about this
being a two-port.

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:07.060
And there's now two equations.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.400
Now I've got, for that two-port,
I've got two

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.550
voltages and two currents.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:13.280
There's the voltage across
the left part.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.840
And there's the voltage
across the right part.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.790
And there's current through
the left part.

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.890
And there's the current through
the right part.

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:21.960
So with the elements we've
thought about before, I had

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.390
one voltage across it and
one current through it.

00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:26.990
Now I've got two voltages across
it and two currents.

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:30.050
It's kind of twice as big.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.300
Not surprisingly, it takes
twice as many equations.

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:36.700
Ohm's Law was a single
equation for

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.130
one resistor, a one-port.

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:42.440
V equals V0 was one
equation for one

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.600
component, a voltage source.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.320
Here, I've got one component
that has

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.590
four wires, four unknowns.

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:54.170
And I get two equations.

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:57.420
So for this particular dependent
source, I know that

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.340
the voltage across this pair
of terminals is 0, because

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.385
it's essentially a short circuit
between the two.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.429
Short circuit just means
connected with a wire.

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:13.780
And I know that the current I2
is related to the current over

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.380
there this way.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:19.250
The idea then is that this
current controlled current

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:24.130
source can be represented by a
two-port, two voltages, two

00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:28.320
currents related by
two equations.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.860
It's kind of structurally twice
as difficult to think

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:36.290
about as a one-port.

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:41.230
Functionally, it's different
from having two one-ports,

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:44.030
because the two one-ports
are coupled.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:46.350
And that's the important part
is the coupling between the

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:50.980
two that you can't model with a
simple resistor and a simple

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:54.449
constant source.

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:58.570
So when we think about an
op-amp, a good first model for

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:01.130
an op-amp is to think about
it as a voltage controlled

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:02.380
voltage source.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:05.940
And so that's depicted here.

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.550
I want to think about the
op-amp, which I'll

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:10.000
symbolically write this way.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.840
This means something that has
two inputs, a plus input and

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:17.220
then a minus input, and
a single output, Vout.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.670
I can think about
it as a voltage

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:20.460
controlled voltage source.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:23.380
This I mean to be the element
representation.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.380
This is how I'll draw it
when I make a schematic

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.530
diagram of a circuit.

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:29.140
This is the functional form.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.370
This is the way I'll
think about it when

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:32.250
I'm analyzing it.

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:35.750
I'll think about the op-amp as
being a voltage controlled

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.100
voltage source.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:42.130
This voltage source adopts a
voltage that is some number K

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:44.220
times the difference voltage
Vplus minus Vminus.

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:49.920
And the trick in op-amps is that
K is typically a very big

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.120
number, typically bigger
than 10 to the 5th.

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.970
We'll see in a minute
why that's a

00:35:55.970 --> 00:36:02.480
frightfully useful component.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.950
Let's just walk through an
example to see how you would

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:08.180
solve a circuit that has this
kind of a voltage controlled

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:10.680
voltage source in it.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.850
So think about this circuit
where I'm applying a voltage

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:19.440
to the plus lead of an op-amp,
and I'm wrapping the output

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:24.850
back through the minus lead,
through two resistors.

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:26.920
And what I want to do is
analyze that circuit by

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.600
thinking about the op-amp
as a voltage

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.045
controlled voltage source.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.580
So I can see just by the way
it's wired up that the voltage

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:38.670
at the plus lead--

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.170
So I'm going to be thinking
node voltages.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.630
Node voltages tend to be easy.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.070
I'm thinking node voltages.

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:47.690
So I'm going to define
all my voltages

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:48.940
referenced to a ground.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:53.520
So I'll call this node ground.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.120
That's what the funny
symbol means.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.790
Then this node voltage, the
voltage at the plus terminal,

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:02.340
is just the same as
the input voltage.

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:09.950
This voltage at the minus
terminal looks like a voltage

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:11.000
divider relationship.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.790
If you look at my model, it's
very clear that I1 is 0,

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:19.290
because there's no connection
here between the

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.980
Vplus and the Vminus.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:22.160
So I1 is 0.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.620
That means the total current
that flows into the plus lead

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.870
of the op-amp is 0.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:30.660
The total current that flows
into the minus lead of the

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.130
op-amp is 0.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:36.290
So because there's no current
flowing in the plus and minus

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:40.560
leads, I can calculate the
voltage at this minus terminal

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.440
as a voltage divider.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:46.427
And it's just R1 over the sum
of R1 and R2 times V0.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.250
Then according to the voltage
control voltage source model,

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:58.240
Vout should be K times
the difference

00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.960
between Vplus and Vminus.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:09.420
So I just substitute in for
Vplus -- this guy, Vi, and for

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.450
Vminus -- this guy.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:12.700
Do some algebra.

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:19.510
I get this expression
after some algebra.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:22.450
And then I say, yeah but I
know that K's really big.

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:28.800
So if K's really big, KR1
is big compared to R1.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.000
So I can ignore that.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.450
In fact, K is so big that for
any reasonable choice of R1

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:36.770
and R2, KR1 is even
bigger than R2.

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:40.030
So that means this reduces to
this kind of a fraction.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:45.030
So the response of this circuit,
this op-amp circuit--

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.640
So what did I do?

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.080
I just took the op-amp circuit,
and I modelled it as

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.160
a voltage controlled voltage
source, plugged through the

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.210
equations, and found out that
the ratio of the output

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:57.190
voltage to the input voltage
is R1 over R1 plus

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:58.440
R2 divided by R1.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:05.150
So the idea then is that
this simple circuit

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:08.830
works like an amplifier.

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:11.740
It's an amplifier in the sense
that I can make the output

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.480
voltage bigger than
the input voltage.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.690
That's a very useful thing.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:20.430
In fact you'll find useful ways
to use that when you do

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:21.790
the design lab this week.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.030
So this as an amplifier.

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.820
So here's a question.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.490
Make sure you follow
what I just did.

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:35.420
How could I choose the
components R1 and R2 so that I

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.827
make Vout equal to Vi?

00:40:58.832 --> 00:41:01.870
AUDIENCE: Why is this 0?

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:03.120
PROFESSOR: There's no
wire connecting.

00:41:05.565 --> 00:41:06.010
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:08.210
PROFESSOR: So there's nowhere
for current to go.

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:28.340
OK so how would I choose the
components R1 and R2 in order

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.200
to make the output voltage equal
to the input voltage?

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:38.970
Wonderful.

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:42.290
So the idea is that all of these
manipulations have the

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:43.200
same effect.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.520
All you need to do
is look at the

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.520
expression that we developed.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:50.680
The expression was R1
plus R2 over R1.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:55.130
If you substitute, R1 goes to
infinity, R2 equals 0, or the

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:59.240
two at the same time, you get
one in all of those cases.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:04.120
So that's a way that you can
turn this amplifier circuit,

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.960
that in general would make the
output bigger than the input,

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.650
into something that makes the
output equal to the input.

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:17.100
Now I want to turn to
a simplification.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.840
I just dragged you
through the math.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.400
Thinking about the op-amp as a
voltage controlled voltage

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.360
source, there's actually
a shortcut.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:30.230
The shortcut is something we
call the ideal op-amp.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:32.600
So what I want to do in this
slide is drag you through the

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:36.060
math one more time, but
then we're done.

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:43.150
The idea is that if you have
an op-amp, a voltage

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:46.510
controlled voltage source, if
you represent an op-amp as a

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:50.090
voltage controlled voltage
source, and if K is very big,

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:54.540
the effect will be to make the
difference between the

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.290
positive and negative
terminals of the

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:58.260
op-amp quite small.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:02.890
You can see that here by way
of a simple example.

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:08.180
So let me think about this case
with, again, the voltage

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.480
controlled voltage
source model.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.430
So here I've got Vout.

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:16.320
According to the voltage
controlled voltage source

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.730
model, Vout should be K
times the difference

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:19.980
between the two inputs.

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:25.170
The positive input
is clearly Vi.

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:28.440
The negative input is Vo.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.710
One equation, two unknowns,
solve for the ratio.

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:34.190
The ratio of Vout to Vi
is K over (1 plus K).

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:38.680
That's the answer.

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:42.540
Take that answer and back
substitute to figure out how

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.910
big was the difference between
Vplus and Vminus.

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:49.970
That's just algebra.

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:54.660
And what you see is that if this
is the answer, then Vplus

00:43:54.660 --> 00:44:00.410
minus Vminus can be written as
a fraction of Vi or a similar

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:02.630
fraction of Vo.

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:03.302
K is big.

00:44:03.302 --> 00:44:05.780
K is essentially the
same as K plus 1.

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:08.750
K is in the denominator
of both.

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:11.350
What that says is the difference
between the plus

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:14.030
and the minus leads, the voltage
between the plus and

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:22.500
the minus leads, is very small
if K is very large.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.230
OK?

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:27.710
So we call that the ideal
op-amp relationship.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:30.970
The utility of that is that it
makes solving the op-amp

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:33.480
circuits much, much
easier than what

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.350
we've just been doing.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:38.400
I've been solving the circuits
by thinking about the op-amp

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.640
as a voltage controlled
voltage source.

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.610
That's fine.

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:46.700
But if I additionally know
that K is very big, I can

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.430
shortcut it.

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:52.100
I can say, look, the effect of
the op-amp is going to be to

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:54.600
make the positive and negative
inputs the same.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.120
If it didn't do that, think
of what it would mean.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:00.460
If K is a big number, and if the
output voltage is K times

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:02.560
the difference, if the
difference is anything other

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:07.390
than epsilon, Vout has
to be infinity.

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:10.060
I mean if K is very
big, right?

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:15.160
If K is very big, the only way
the output could be some

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:19.530
reasonable number like a Volt
would be if the difference

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:22.150
between Vplus and Vminus
is very small.

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:24.490
OK, well let's work backwards.

00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:28.540
Let's start with the assumption
that Vplus minus

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.790
Vminus is very small.

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:34.460
And that lets us solve the
circuits very quickly.

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:38.600
So for example, the same circuit
that took, previously,

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:43.080
a few lines to get the answer
to, if I just take as a rule

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:46.600
that Vplus has to be Vminus,
it's a one step.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:51.130
Vplus equals Vminus, OK, Vi
equals Vo, period, done.

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:55.450
It's a very simple way to think
about the answer to an

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:57.600
op-amp circuit.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.760
So if the op-amp can be
represented by a voltage

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:04.140
controlled voltage source and if
K is very large, then Vplus

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.490
is roughly Vminus.

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:10.480
Shortcut, ideal op-amp
assumption.

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:16.325
So, use that or ignore
it depending on

00:46:16.325 --> 00:46:18.360
what your mood is.

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:21.560
And figure out the voltage
relationship for this slightly

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:22.810
more complicated circuit.

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:31.790
So what's the answer?

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.360
Yes?

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.400
No.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.080
How many are done?

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.260
How many are not done?

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:43.510
OK, take a minute.

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:47.540
This is supposed to be easy.

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:50.860
Think ideal op-amp.

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.830
OK, what's the output?

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:50.610
Everybody raise your hand,
what's the output?

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:56.980
More hands, more hands,
more hands.

00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:01.860
OK, tiny number of hands, but
those who showed hands are

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.200
about 100% correct.

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.460
I don't know how
to grade that.

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:08.760
Small participation, 100%
among those who did

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:09.760
participate.

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.830
So how do I think about this?

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:13.080
What's step (1)?

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:19.950
All right, according to the
theory of lectures,

00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:21.942
what is step (1)?

00:51:21.942 --> 00:51:23.436
AUDIENCE: Look at the
previous slide.

00:51:23.436 --> 00:51:25.440
PROFESSOR: Look at the
previous slide, yes.

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.120
What was the previous slide?

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:37.535
OK The previous slide
had to do with?

00:51:37.535 --> 00:51:38.465
AUDIENCE: The ideal op-amps.

00:51:38.465 --> 00:51:39.395
PROFESSOR: Ideal op-amps.

00:51:39.395 --> 00:51:42.250
What's ideal op-amps say?

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:44.070
Vplus equals Vminus.

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:46.085
What happens here if Vplus
is equal to Vminus?

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:52.473
Well what's Vplus?

00:51:52.473 --> 00:51:53.400
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:54.260
PROFESSOR: So what's Vminus?

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:54.960
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.390
PROFESSOR: 0.

00:51:56.390 --> 00:52:00.010
So if Vminus is 0,
what do I do now?

00:52:09.453 --> 00:52:12.450
That bad, that hard huh?

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:15.850
Well, I got a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
here in which three different

00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:16.710
currents can flow.

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:19.570
How big is the current that
can come into this node?

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:21.630
What's the sum of all the
currents that can

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:24.060
come into that node?

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:25.680
Well one could come
in this way.

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:27.750
One could come in that way.

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:30.080
One could come in that way.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:34.024
How much current flows in the
minus lead of the op-amp?

00:52:34.024 --> 00:52:34.452
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:52:34.452 --> 00:52:34.880
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:36.170
PROFESSOR: None.

00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:38.210
No current goes into
the minus.

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:41.500
No current enters the op-amp
through the minus lead.

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:44.240
So it's the sum of
three currents.

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:45.490
How big is this current?

00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:52.595
How big is the current that
flows in that lead?

00:52:52.595 --> 00:52:53.460
V1 --

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:55.570
V1 over 1, right?

00:52:55.570 --> 00:52:57.670
Ohm's Law.

00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:59.210
So this node is 0.

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:01.590
That node is V1.

00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:05.110
The voltage across this resistor
is V1 minus 0.

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:07.030
The voltage across is V1.

00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:10.600
The current is V1
over R. R is 1.

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:14.320
So the current that flows
in this leg is V1.

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.460
How much current flows
in this leg?

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:19.944
How much current flows
in this leg?

00:53:19.944 --> 00:53:20.850
AUDIENCE: V0.

00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:22.910
PROFESSOR: V0.

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:27.410
The idea is that the total
current that flows into this

00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:32.350
node is V1 plus V2 plus V0.

00:53:32.350 --> 00:53:34.660
Solve for V0.

00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:37.000
V0 is minus V1 minus V2.

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:40.440
Right?

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:41.690
Got it?

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:48.040
The idea was that this is really
easy to solve if you

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:51.160
use the ideal op-amp
approximation.

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:52.410
You can see that this is 0.

00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:53.480
Therefore, this is 0.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.520
So you have a single
KCL equation.

00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.930
And the result is that this
circuit looks like an

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:01.480
inverting summer.

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:05.060
It computes the sum of V1 and V2
and then takes the negative

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:08.450
of that and presents
that at the output.

00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:11.850
What I'm trying to motivate is
that there's a whole different

00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:15.120
level of reasoning that you
can do when you have this

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.110
element, which is an op-amp.

00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:19.640
Here what we've done is we've
made something that performs a

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:21.980
numerical operation.

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:24.780
It presents, at the output,
the negative

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:26.030
sum of the two inputs.

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:30.680
OK another problem.

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:34.720
Determine R so that V0
is twice V1 minus V2.

00:59:18.620 --> 00:59:19.870
So how should I choose R?

00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.030
Not very many hands.

00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:31.610
This is the perfect nano
quiz practice, right?

00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:35.530
This looks like a perfect nano
quiz question, right?

00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:36.780
Smile.

00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:40.550
So what's the answer?

00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:46.850
OK we're down to about
half correct.

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:48.880
This is harder.

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.580
Basically you do exactly the
same thing, it's just that

00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:55.090
it's a little algebraically
messier.

00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:58.840
So not surprisingly, the first
idea is to think about the

00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:01.080
ideal op-amp.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.300
We'll think about what was the
voltage here, what was the

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:04.970
voltage there, and then
we'll equate them.

01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:11.220
What's the voltage
at the plus lead?

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:12.020
Well that's easy.

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.840
That's just a voltage
divider here.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.830
Since no current flows in
here, I can compute the

01:00:17.830 --> 01:00:21.880
voltage relative to this ground
as R over (1 plus R).

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.110
That's showed here.

01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:24.625
Times V1.

01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:30.010
This one's a little bit trickier
because I've got two

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:32.820
sources, V2 and V0,
each pumping

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:36.000
current into this place.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.480
The way I thought about it was
start with V2 and then add to

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:45.280
it this component, which can
be thought of as a voltage

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.420
divider here.

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:51.050
So how big is the voltage
at Vminus?

01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:54.620
Well it's V2 plus a voltage
divider here,

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:57.320
which is given by this.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.330
That's a little tricky.

01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:02.930
If you're not comfortable with
that step, you could also

01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:05.160
solve for that voltage using
the node method.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.760
The node method will give
you the same answer.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.390
The answer is that the voltage
at the Vminus port is two

01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:15.930
thirds of V2 and one
third of V0.

01:01:15.930 --> 01:01:18.060
That sort of looks right because
the resistors are in a

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:19.310
ratio of 2:1.

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:26.750
And then using the ideal op-amp
assumption, we equate

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:29.880
the two, do some more algebra,
and we get some relationship

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.150
and figure out that R is 2.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.200
The point is that this is a

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.210
relatively complicated circuit.

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:41.360
You could have done it if I had
asked you to do it with

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.960
the voltage controlled
voltage source model.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:49.140
But the algebra is already
hard here with the ideal

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:51.460
op-amp assumption, and with the
voltage controlled voltage

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:52.900
source it's even harder.

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:56.900
So the idea is that the ideal
op-amp assumption, the idea

01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:01.710
that Vplus is equal to Vminus,
makes the work of calculating

01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:06.210
these responses significantly
easier.

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:07.960
Everybody's with the
bottom line?

01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:18.630
We started with the idea that
when you add an element to a

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:23.990
circuit, in general, adding an
element changes voltages and

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:26.690
currents throughout
the circuit.

01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:31.020
We wanted a way to make the
design more modular, a way of

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:36.310
adding a component without
changing everything else.

01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:40.330
We thought about this
op-amp thing.

01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:42.720
The model for the op-amp
was voltage

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.780
controlled voltage source.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:48.410
We inferred this ideal
op-amp model.

01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:50.220
The ideal op-amp model
was great for

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.060
calculating the response.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:55.780
It has this one problem.

01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:58.350
It seems to say these circuits
are identical.

01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:05.530
If I literally believe the ideal
op-amp assumption that

01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:08.940
all the op-amp does is magically
make the plus and

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:13.600
minus terminals the same, I
would conclude that this

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.820
circuit where the input comes
in the plus and the output

01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:22.570
wraps around to the minus
generates precisely the same

01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:25.510
input-output relationship as
this one, where the input

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:30.410
comes in the minus and the
output wraps around the plus.

01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:33.800
The ideal op-amp assumption
simply says for both of those,

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.060
Vi equals Vo.

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:42.110
So I would assume from the ideal
op-amp model I get the

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:45.570
result that these two circuits
work exactly the same way.

01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:46.910
Somehow that sounds wrong.

01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:54.540
I've got this part, and
I can wire it up the

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.760
right way and it works.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.440
Or I can flip the two wires,
and it still works.

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.080
Conservation of badness
doesn't let

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.160
that happen, right?

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.875
If you do something bad,
it should break.

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:09.160
The ideal op-amp assumption
seems to

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.200
lead to a bogus result.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.570
It seems to say these
two are the same.

01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:16.810
So what I'd like to do is think
about that for a moment.

01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:19.160
We want to be comfortable with
the assumption that we make.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:22.480
The ideal op-amp assumption
makes analysis really easy,

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.090
but we'd like to understand
exactly what we're assuming.

01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:27.550
This just doesn't sound right.

01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:28.880
OK, so let's back up.

01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:33.360
Let's not do the ideal
op-amp assumption.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:36.320
Let's Instead say that we use
the voltage controlled voltage

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.240
source model.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.980
So what I've done here
is substitute

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:41.760
into the left circuit.

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:47.890
So this circuit is shown here
and the other over here.

01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:50.520
All I've done is connected the
input either to the plus or to

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:55.640
the minus port and wrapped
the other one around.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:58.180
But now I'm analyzing it using
the voltage controlled voltage

01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:00.100
source model.

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.540
And I've done the
tedious algebra.

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:02.840
And I don't think there's
any mistakes

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.190
in the tedious algebra.

01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:07.690
In one case I get K over
(1 plus K), which for

01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:10.541
large K is about 1.

01:05:10.541 --> 01:05:15.150
In the other case I get minus K
over (1 minus K), which for

01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:17.460
K large is about 1.

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:21.090
The ideal op-amp assumption says
that it doesn't matter.

01:05:21.090 --> 01:05:22.690
The voltage controlled
voltage source model

01:05:22.690 --> 01:05:24.640
says it doesn't matter.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.130
And Freeman thinks this doesn't
make any sense.

01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:32.830
So what's going on here?

01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:39.770
What's going on is that we've
actually made an enormous leap

01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:42.420
in thinking about the op-amp
even as a voltage controlled

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:43.670
voltage source.

01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:48.370
The two models that we talked
about, the voltage controlled

01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:51.270
voltage source and the ideal
op-amp model, are great for

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:53.900
calculating answers.

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:58.410
They are not so good at
providing a mechanism for how

01:05:58.410 --> 01:06:00.300
the op-amp is actually
working.

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:04.300
Think about just the ideal
op-amp assumption.

01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:07.020
It's great to think, OK, the
op-amp is going to do whatever

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.770
magic is necessary to make
these two leads the same.

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:15.350
Well how does it do that?

01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:17.580
The thing about the ideal op-amp
assumption is that it

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:21.730
doesn't tell you the mechanism
by which that happens.

01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:27.530
What does the op-amp actually
do in order to get

01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:28.730
Vplus equal to Vminus?

01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:31.660
What's actually going on
inside the op-amp?

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:36.650
The ideal op-amp assumption is
very good for analysis and not

01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:39.000
very good with mechanism.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.120
What's the mechanism?

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.170
What's the op-amp
actually doing?

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:48.120
What it's really doing is
moving charge around.

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.220
8.02 --

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:53.480
charge.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.010
So if you're going to have a
change in voltage, there has

01:06:56.010 --> 01:06:57.900
to be motion of charge.

01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:00.870
And that's what's missing from
the voltage controlled voltage

01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:03.520
model and from the ideal
op-amp model.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.380
How do you think about
moving charge around?

01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:07.180
Well it's the same as
moving water around.

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:10.050
Somehow, I think it's all those
years of playing with

01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:13.870
water when I was a little kid,
I find my intuition about

01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:16.260
water is better than my
intuition about charge.

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:19.045
So let me start by thinking
about the intuition for water.

01:07:22.310 --> 01:07:26.030
The way a water tank works is
if the flow in is different

01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:27.320
from the flow out, the
height changes.

01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:31.870
That's continuity.

01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:37.800
So if the water is conserved,
if there's not significant

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.570
evaporation over the duration
of this experiment, or if

01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:43.610
molecules of water do not
spontaneously disappear or

01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:48.220
appear, under either of those
two assumptions, then the

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:50.560
change in the height is
proportional to the difference

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.400
between the rate at which it's
coming in and the rate at

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.490
which it's coming out.

01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:55.340
If the rate at which it's going
out is equal to the rate

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.590
at which it's going in, there's
no change in height.

01:07:57.590 --> 01:07:59.360
If it's coming in faster,
it's going up.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:02.070
If it's coming in slower,
it's going down.

01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:05.040
All easy, right?

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.410
Charge works the same way.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.790
The thing that accumulates
charge in an electronic

01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:15.230
circuit is a capacitor.

01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:18.990
And there's a direct analogy
between thinking about the way

01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:23.569
the flux of water generates
height and the way flux of

01:08:23.569 --> 01:08:27.200
charge generates volts.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:33.680
So we can think about the flux
of charge, that's current.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:38.990
If there's a net flux, if
there's a bigger current into

01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:42.330
a capacitor then there is
out, the voltage on that

01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:44.640
capacitor goes up.

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:47.420
If there's a smaller current in
than goes out, the voltage

01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:50.609
on the capacitor goes down
just like the height

01:08:50.609 --> 01:08:51.940
in a tank of water.

01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:57.060
We can make a much more
realistic model for the way an

01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:01.460
op-amp works by explicitly
making a representation for

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:05.899
how the charge flows.

01:09:05.899 --> 01:09:07.890
And that's shown here.

01:09:07.890 --> 01:09:09.930
I'm going to take the voltage
controlled voltage source

01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:15.290
model but explicitly make a
representation for the output

01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:17.550
charging up.

01:09:17.550 --> 01:09:18.590
What's the op-amp do?

01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:22.080
The op-amp senses the voltage
at the input and the output

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:27.270
and does something to change
the voltage at the output.

01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:32.229
The thing it does is if the
positive voltage is greater

01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:35.680
than the negative voltage,
it pumps charge

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:39.359
into the output node.

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:43.689
If the opposite occurs,
it sucks charge out.

01:09:43.689 --> 01:09:48.950
Now it's important, this is not
an accurate depiction of

01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:50.260
what's inside an op-amp.

01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:55.190
This is the model
for an op-amp.

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:58.210
I don't want to lead any of
you to think that this is

01:09:58.210 --> 01:09:59.620
literally what's in an op-amp.

01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:02.110
This is not literally
what's in an op-amp.

01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:06.060
Here is much more literally
what's in an op-amp.

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:09.120
This is the schematic
diagram of a 709

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.410
which is a Widlar circuit.

01:10:11.410 --> 01:10:14.060
It's a complicated transistor
circuit.

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.310
It's ingenious.

01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:19.660
This is how you build a
circuit that has the

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:22.530
remarkable property of the
ideal op-amp circuit.

01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:25.065
It's not perfectly obvious
from here.

01:10:25.065 --> 01:10:29.270
And even here this doesn't give
Widlar enough credit.

01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:31.000
Here's what he really did.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.120
He designed masks to shield
semiconductor materials so

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.710
that you could turn them into
transistors so that it would

01:10:38.710 --> 01:10:40.390
turn into an op-amp.

01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:42.100
We're not going to
worry about this.

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:45.560
This is two levels of
abstraction more complex than

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.370
we're going to worry about.

01:10:47.370 --> 01:10:50.410
We're just going to say, I don't
know what's in there,

01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:51.960
but this is the way
it behaves.

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:56.870
This is intended to be a
behavioral model for how an

01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:57.380
op-amp works.

01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:58.670
And in fact, that's
an important

01:10:58.670 --> 01:11:03.290
idea that we use circuits--

01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:06.440
I use circuits on a daily basis
not because I design

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.280
semiconductor devices
but because I work

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.970
on biological issues.

01:11:09.970 --> 01:11:12.830
I actually study hearing.

01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:17.500
And we make circuit models for
the way biological parts work.

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:20.490
And that helps us to understand
the way the

01:11:20.490 --> 01:11:21.810
biological part works.

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:26.400
For example, here is a model
taken from 6.021, where we try

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:31.060
to understand how a nerve
propagates an action potential

01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:32.490
by making a circuit model.

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:36.540
That's the same thing
we're doing here.

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:41.100
We're making a circuit model
for how the op-amp works.

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:42.550
it's not intended
to be literally

01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:43.590
what's inside the op-amp.

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:46.110
It's intended to be a model that
let's us think about the

01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:48.940
behavior of the op-amp.

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:51.510
This lets us understand now why
it's different when you

01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:52.760
flip the wires.

01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:58.580
Let's start with the original
configuration where I put the

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:01.880
voltage in the plus lead, and I
wrap the output back around

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:02.750
to the minus lead.

01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:04.800
What's going to happen?

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:08.550
What's the op-amp actually do?

01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:10.900
Imagine that things
had been stable.

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:12.020
This was 0.

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:13.430
The output was 0.

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:15.980
Everybody was happy.

01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:20.670
And now all of a sudden the
input voltages steps up.

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:22.300
What happens?

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:24.440
The input voltage steps up.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.440
The voltage source suddenly
generates a

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.720
huge positive voltage.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:33.330
And that starts to put current
into the capacitor that

01:12:33.330 --> 01:12:37.340
represents the voltage at the
output of the op-amp.

01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:41.200
So as a result of this voltage
being higher than where it

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:46.260
was, current is being dumped
by the op-amp into this

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:49.310
capacitor, and the output
voltage starts to increase.

01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:50.560
That's shown it red.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.310
As the capacitor voltage gets
bigger, as the output voltage

01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:59.510
increases, the difference
between Vplus and Vminus gets

01:12:59.510 --> 01:13:05.450
smaller, and the rate at which
charge is flowing into the

01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:08.270
capacitor slows.

01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:11.560
And in fact, as the voltage at
the output gets very close to

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:15.060
the voltage at the input, the
rate of current into the

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:17.530
capacitor goes to 0.

01:13:17.530 --> 01:13:19.520
And the output voltage
stabilizes

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:22.450
at the input voltage.

01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:25.120
The same thing happens in
reverse if I were to change

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.455
input voltage and make
it go negative.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.500
If the input voltage went
negative, then K times Vplus

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.290
minus Vminus would be a big
negative number and it would

01:13:38.290 --> 01:13:41.810
suck current out.

01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:45.490
The voltage controlled voltage
source would suck current out

01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:49.270
of the capacitor and make
the voltage fall.

01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:50.360
The voltage would fall.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.680
The absolute difference between
the plus and minus

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.660
port would get smaller.

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:58.080
The current flowing
would become less.

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:01.600
And it would again stabilize
when the output is

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:02.850
equal to the input.

01:14:05.670 --> 01:14:10.310
Contrast that to what would
happen if I put the input into

01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:13.450
the minus port.

01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:17.480
If I put the input into the
minus port, and the input goes

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:24.450
through a step, then the input
going positive makes the

01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:26.360
voltage controlled voltage
source generate a

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:27.870
big negative voltage.

01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:30.390
It sucks current out.

01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:31.735
So the input went positive.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.590
And the output goes negative.

01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:39.540
It goes the wrong way.

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:42.190
That's bad.

01:14:42.190 --> 01:14:46.480
So here, if I put the input
into the minus lead, a

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:49.830
positive transition of the
input leads to the output

01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:51.910
going the wrong way.

01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:56.050
And as it goes the wrong way,
the drive to make it go the

01:14:56.050 --> 01:14:58.470
wrong way gets bigger.

01:14:58.470 --> 01:14:59.530
It's a runaway system.

01:14:59.530 --> 01:15:02.670
It's positive feedback.

01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:06.520
So the idea is that by
supporting the input into the

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:09.840
negative lead instead of into
the positive lead, leads to a

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.780
positive feedback situation in
which a small change at the

01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:19.190
input makes the output go the
wrong way, convinces the

01:15:19.190 --> 01:15:21.750
op-amp that things are getting
worse, so it makes even more

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:25.450
current, which makes it go
even more the wrong way.

01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:31.050
And the same thing happens
with the flip situation.

01:15:31.050 --> 01:15:33.660
The idea then is that
by thinking

01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:35.010
about the flow of current--

01:15:35.010 --> 01:15:36.160
What's the op-amp
actually doing?

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.910
The op-amp is actually sensing
the difference between the

01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:42.330
voltage at the positive port and
the minus port, and it's

01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:45.360
sourcing current that
changes the output

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:48.540
voltage to go up or down.

01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:56.520
You need to wire the op-amp so
that ultimately the output

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.450
equals the input.

01:15:58.450 --> 01:16:01.840
Otherwise the ideal op-amp
condition that Vplus equals

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:04.670
Vminus will ever be attained.

01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:08.870
So the left one is what we would
refer to as a stable

01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:11.350
feedback situation.

01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:14.580
You can think about that as
analogous to thinking about a

01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:16.950
ball in a valley.

01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:19.850
So we have a valley,
and we have a ball.

01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:22.430
The ball's going to roll
down here eventually.

01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:23.970
It's stable.

01:16:23.970 --> 01:16:26.270
Bop it a little bit to the
right, it'll roll back into

01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:26.700
the valley.

01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:28.130
Bop it a little to the
left, it'll roll

01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:29.260
back into the valley.

01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:32.670
That's as opposed to, when we've
wired up the wrong way,

01:16:32.670 --> 01:16:36.010
it's like we have an unstable
equilibrium.

01:16:36.010 --> 01:16:39.470
It's as though we're trying
to put the ball there.

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:43.200
Bop it a little to right, it
runs away to the right.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.680
Bop it a little to the left,
it runs away to the left.

01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:48.730
That's unstable.

01:16:48.730 --> 01:16:50.760
There is a metastability
plane.

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:54.420
If you actually balanced it
exactly, exactly, exactly at

01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:58.530
the right place, it
would stay there.

01:16:58.530 --> 01:17:00.290
That's what the solution
is telling you.

01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:04.370
That was the minus K
over (1 minus K).

01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:07.140
The fact that the equations
had a solution is correct,

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:10.150
it's just an unstable
solution.

01:17:10.150 --> 01:17:15.530
The tiniest little disturbance
will make it go awry.

01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:18.770
The idea then is that
the ideal op-amp

01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:19.990
assumption is fine.

01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:21.080
It's a good thing to use.

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:23.380
It doesn't tell you about
the mechanism.

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:25.460
If you think a little bit more
about the way the physics

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:30.170
works, you have to wire the
circuit up so that it has

01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:35.740
negative feedback in order to
get a stable equilibrium.

01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:38.230
So if you understand that, and
you just make sure that you've

01:17:38.230 --> 01:17:40.680
hooked it up so that it has
negative feedback, then you

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:42.600
can use the ideal op-amp
assumption.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.290
Everything's just fine.

01:17:44.290 --> 01:17:46.500
And in the interest of time,
I'm going to just skip over

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.840
this because we've already
talked about all of this.

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:50.650
It's just another example.

01:17:50.650 --> 01:17:53.750
The last thing I want to mention
is just that in order

01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:58.140
to work this magic,
the op-amp has to

01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.455
get power from somewhere.

01:18:03.670 --> 01:18:06.640
And so that means that it's not
a three-terminal device.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:09.590
It's not the kind of device I've
been drawing so far that

01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:10.990
has got power pins too.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:16.930
The way the op-amp works is it
takes power from those power

01:18:16.930 --> 01:18:21.630
pins to be able to force the
output to a voltage that'll

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:24.780
make the input the Vplus
equal to Vminus.

01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:26.750
That's the mechanism
by which it works.

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:30.150
And that'll have important
consequences when we build the

01:18:30.150 --> 01:18:34.820
robot head, because what it
means is that we're not going

01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:37.480
to be able to generate arbitrary
voltages at the

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.020
output of an op-amp.

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:41.600
We're going to be limited to
generating voltages that are

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:44.510
between the power rails.

01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:47.630
So if we were to supply plus
and minus 10 Volts to the

01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:50.780
power pins, we would not be
expecting to be able to

01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:53.800
generate 20 Volts
at the output.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:55.650
So that's an important
implication when we do the

01:18:55.650 --> 01:18:57.560
design lab.

01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:01.260
In summary, what we've done is
we've showed how circuits can

01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:05.600
be a pain to make modular,
because in principle, adding

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:08.950
one component changes voltages
and currents everywhere.

01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:11.580
But there's a way using op-amps
to have this buffering

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:15.420
idea that lets us logically
separate parts of circuits so

01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:17.562
the one can control the other.

01:19:17.562 --> 01:19:18.812
Have a good day.
