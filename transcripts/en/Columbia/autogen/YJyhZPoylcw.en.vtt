00:47:27.469 --> 00:47:27.479 align:start position:0%
and I figure why not but my question is
 

00:47:27.479 --> 00:47:30.809 align:start position:0%
and I figure why not but my question is
it<00:47:28.479><c> seems</c><00:47:29.169><c> from</c><00:47:29.469><c> what</c><00:47:29.619><c> you're</c><00:47:29.739><c> saying</c><00:47:29.819><c> that</c>

00:47:30.809 --> 00:47:30.819 align:start position:0%
it seems from what you're saying that
 

00:47:30.819 --> 00:47:35.390 align:start position:0%
it seems from what you're saying that
women<00:47:31.029><c> are</c><00:47:31.419><c> more</c><00:47:31.659><c> accurate</c><00:47:31.959><c> in</c><00:47:32.759><c> being</c><00:47:33.759><c> self</c>

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
women are more accurate in being self
 

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.559 align:start position:0%
women are more accurate in being self

reporters of their own confidence and
 

00:47:37.569 --> 00:47:40.620 align:start position:0%
reporters of their own confidence and
that<00:47:37.599><c> so</c><00:47:38.169><c> that</c><00:47:38.499><c> translates</c><00:47:38.949><c> to</c><00:47:39.400><c> me</c><00:47:39.579><c> as</c><00:47:39.819><c> women</c>

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:40.630 align:start position:0%
that so that translates to me as women
 

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:42.209 align:start position:0%
that so that translates to me as women
being<00:47:40.779><c> more</c><00:47:40.869><c> accurate</c><00:47:41.229><c> so</c><00:47:41.890><c> it's</c><00:47:42.039><c> not</c><00:47:42.159><c> that</c>

00:47:42.209 --> 00:47:42.219 align:start position:0%
being more accurate so it's not that
 

00:47:42.219 --> 00:47:44.939 align:start position:0%
being more accurate so it's not that

00:47:44.939 --> 00:47:44.949 align:start position:0%
women are not confident enough it's that
 

00:47:44.949 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
women are not confident enough it's that
