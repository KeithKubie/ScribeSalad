00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.570
When I think about the legacy of Martin
Luther King

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.830
of course everyone remembers the I have
a dream speech it was delivered on the

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.380
on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial but
what's more profound I think about his

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.880
life and his work is what he talked
about in the later years when much of

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.470
what he was saying wasn't very popular
for those in power. That is to say he was

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.430
challenging the Vietnam War he was
talking about poverty and of course he

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.040
was assassinated 50 years ago you know
when he was there advocating for

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.059
workers for sanitation workers who were
striking in Memphis. You know so he was

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.450
asking the tough questions about Society
know inequality war and peace. You know

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.879
questions that even those who believed
in his nonviolent approach to inclusion

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.670
and equity didn't always subscribe to. So
when I think about a place like UCLA and

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.210
why many of us
first of all chose to go into academia

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.070
and to come to a place like UCLA. I think
it's really about grappling with the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.260
world's most pressing issues and
figuring out ways to bring evidence and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.380
scholarship to bear on those issues so
that we can really pave a path forward

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.280
to a world that's that's better than the
world we currently have.
