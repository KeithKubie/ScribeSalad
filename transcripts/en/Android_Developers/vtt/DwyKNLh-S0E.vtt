00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.640
GREG IVANOV: So sort of
the goal of this session

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.670
is to get into the nitty
gritty, a little bit, of what it

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.010
actually means to
develop for VR.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.580
So we've got a fascinating
selection of panelists

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.430
to take us through some of the
foundational aspects of what

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.070
it's like to actually
develop for VR.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.034
We've got Peter from
Resolution Games, who's

00:00:22.034 --> 00:00:24.450
going to talk about what it's
like to develop for a medium

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.790
where a user has
no expectations.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.560
Bradley from BBC
is going to talk

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.820
about transitioning the
brand and keeping the brand

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.510
integrity into a new medium.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.620
And then Kay from
ARTE is going to talk

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.110
about this
much-talked-about dichotomy

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.830
or interrelation between linear
and interactive experiences.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.000
So come on up, guys.

00:00:51.332 --> 00:00:54.188
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.040
And Peter, over to you
with the first lightning

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.900
talk that you're going
to take us through.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.460
PETER STAHL: So I'm
going to look over there.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.270
OK.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.800
Hi, I'm Peter.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.650
And I work at Resolution Games.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.360
We're based in
Stockholm, Sweden.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.770
And when we develop games
in virtual reality now,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.480
we like to start in
reality, and then

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:29.740
try to bring the things that
are interesting into fantastic.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.330
An example of that
is one of our games.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
We had the fortune as to
be one of the launching

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.370
titles for Daydream.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.700
And it's called "Wonderglade."

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.150
And it's basically
doing something

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.170
familiar in an
unfamiliar context.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.450
So the example
from "Wonderglade,"

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.570
that is that shooting hoops.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.450
Throwing a basketball
is very familiar.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.640
And you can't trick the brain.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.490
You've got to make
it feel like you're

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.900
throwing that basketball.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.760
But you're doing it on the moon.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.470
That's kind of unfamiliar.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.972
So that's what we found
really interesting

00:02:07.972 --> 00:02:09.430
and what the players
like the most.

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:15.010
GREG IVANOV: Awesome.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.065
Bradley?

00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:18.440
BRADLEY CROOKS:
Right, thank you.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.939
I'm Bradley from BBC Worldwide.

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.230
So sometimes when a new kind
of technology comes along,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.104
it's really tempting to
kind of get caught up

00:02:25.104 --> 00:02:26.749
in what that technology
can do for you

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:28.540
and maybe to forget
some of the things that

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.230
make your brand what it is.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.230
And you should be thinking
about the things that

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.810
make your brand what it is.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.560
And they might be as
practical as the kind

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.840
of logos that you use or
the color schemes that you

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.950
use and so on.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.979
But beyond that, there
should be other things

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:43.270
in terms of kind of like the
brand value, so the things

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.230
that represent your brand
at a very high level.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.750
And really, when you're
taking your brand

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.790
into a new media
like VR, you need

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.250
to be rigorously applying those
kind of checks and processes

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.690
when you sort of take your
brand into a new medium.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.550
And to give you an example,
we're doing a lot of work

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.380
at the moment with
our BBC Earth brand.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.164
It's natural history content.

00:03:07.164 --> 00:03:08.830
Some of you might be
familiar with this.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.246
One of the last
things that we did

00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:11.830
was called "Planet Earth 2."

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.220
There's a scene in that where
there's iguanas versus snakes.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.092
We call these kind
of iconic scenes.

00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:19.300
And these are something that
we tend to have, always,

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.060
when we put out
our kind of what we

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.800
call landmark series each year.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.660
But really, this is
just underpinning

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.670
the kind of brand
values that make up

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.740
what BBC Earth is all about.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.990
Those brand values are
things like the editorial

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.480
and scientific rigor.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.840
We make sure that everything
we do, in whatever medium,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.070
is rigorous in terms of its
application of the science

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.960
that we apply.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.070
Probably the biggest
and most important

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.630
thing is also storytelling.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.790
That's something in
everything that we do.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.930
And if you think about it, that
iguanas versus snakes example

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.940
is a good example of
storytelling, right?

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.500
And that's something that
we want to carry through

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.666
into all of the media that
we do and all the content

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:02.333
that we produce.

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:04.416
So that's something that
we're thinking about when

00:04:04.416 --> 00:04:05.740
we're creating VR experiences.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.890
And finally, and
this is easy with VR,

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.250
we're thinking about innovation.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.916
So that doesn't
necessarily come to mind

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:13.270
when you're thinking about
BBC natural history content,

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.565
but actually, every time
a new series comes out,

00:04:15.565 --> 00:04:16.690
we're using new technology.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.149
We're either using new
cameras or using drones

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:22.330
to take pictures, or we're using
new submersible techniques.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.640
And again, we want to carry
through that kind of brand

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.740
value into VR.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.247
So the types of things, the
types of kind of content

00:04:29.247 --> 00:04:31.580
that we're delivering, the
way in which people interact,

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.252
and so on, we want
to innovate with.

00:04:35.252 --> 00:04:36.210
GREG IVANOV: Thank you.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.891
Kay?

00:04:36.891 --> 00:04:37.641
KAY MESEBERG: Yep.

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:41.370
Yeah, that's me.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.960
Kay from ARTE.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.890
Our trigger for VR
at ARTE was really

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.060
that it's something-- it's a
medium which attracts interest

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.260
of all generations.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.330
I mean, from kids
to grandparents,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.880
everybody is attracted by VR
and is fascinated by that.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.580
But to get and to keep this
interest for VR productions--

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.390
we started now in 2014, I
think, with the first one--

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.760
a key question is
really the interface

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.870
and the accessibility.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.580
So interacting in VR should
be close to human behavior,

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.450
as easy as breathing
or drinking water.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.930
It should be really easy
to seamlessly get into VR,

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.740
and also the same for augmented
reality for some projects

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.300
we're working on.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.540
I would like to show you two
examples how we distinguish

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.790
the things a bit.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.660
I mean, one is that we do a lot
more linear productions based

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.570
on 360 video, but also added
with metadata, which as,

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.170
for instance, "Dolphin
Man," a series,

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.450
a VR series we just published.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.750
So we take people to
exceptional places

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.270
and to give access to
exceptional places.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.810
In this example,
you can really dive

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.700
with free divers, more than
five meters, 10, 20 meters,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.590
50 meters down in the ocean.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.090
You can swim with
dolphins and stuff

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.541
like that, and sperm whales.

00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:05.790
So it's something exceptional.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.910
You cannot live like
that out of the box.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.360
And the second one is more
interactive experiences,

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.350
but also with the same
goal to be really seamless

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.580
in terms of navigation.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.820
That's "Notes On Blindness."

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.720
Its a story of a British
man who lost sight,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.580
and he did an audio
journal about it.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.650
And the fascinating thing
with this audio journal

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.660
is that it really explains
extremely interesting what

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.050
happens to him.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.280
So we did a VR experience with
our French partners about it.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.530
And its extremely interesting.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:43.680
After you saw it, you understand
what it means to lose sight.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.930
And the interactive
part in that is just

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.811
based on the way you move, with
sound, with different things

00:06:49.811 --> 00:06:50.310
like that.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.770
You don't need to click
on something or anything.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.650
Its just seamless into
the whole experience.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.760
So these are the goals
we are working on.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.286
And we're working on more in VR.

00:07:01.286 --> 00:07:02.036
GREG IVANOV: Cool.

00:07:02.036 --> 00:07:03.290
Thank you.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.930
So super amazing to have
such a wide cross-section

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.810
of developers in the room.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.400
And I think probably, let's
make this practical, right?

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.250
So we've got developers
here who are perhaps

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.980
thinking of getting into VR.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.160
And with that, you know,
what would be the number one

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.950
piece of advice that you'd
give to someone who is thinking

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.740
of starting out in VR today?

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.730
Bradley, what would you say?

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.900
BRADLEY CROOKS: It's
a good question.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.530
I think, and I've always sort
of said, go in with your eyes

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.840
open.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.392
Quite literally, maybe.

00:07:37.392 --> 00:07:41.760
You know, it's not an
easy kind of medium

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.680
to develop for it first.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.530
There's quite a
steep learning curve.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.170
Our first foray
into it, we sort of

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.960
thought, oh, this will
be relatively easy.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.720
We'll sort of crack a couple
of experiences out there

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.970
and get them through submission.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.380
And everything took
three times as long,

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.587
cost three times as much,
as we were expecting.

00:08:01.587 --> 00:08:03.420
And actually, to kind
of go back to my point

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.430
I was making before, to
uphold the things that

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.230
are important to us
about our brands,

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.620
like the quality of
the output and so on,

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.839
actually took a
significant amount of time.

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:13.380
And I think it's
only really just now

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.780
that we've really
kind of learned

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.480
how to approach that
properly and, you know,

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.900
do things in the right way.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.450
And that will be a sort of
continuing learning process

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.690
as new tech comes out and so on.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.930
GREG IVANOV: So what
would you say, then,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:30.590
in that sense to someone's who's
just thinking of starting out?

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:35.520
Or any of you guys that
have a good piece of wisdom

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.526
in terms of the first
thing to think about

00:08:37.526 --> 00:08:39.150
or the first potential
failure that you

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:44.790
have to think about in
terms of developing for VR?

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.520
PETER STAHL: I would
say, start with the core.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.625
Start simple.

00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:51.000
One of my developers usually
says, throw crap on the wall

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.380
and see what sticks.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.180
You've got to try.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.040
You've got to try
a lot of things,

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.400
because it's a moving platform.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.425
It's a moving target
that you're aiming for.

00:08:59.425 --> 00:09:01.200
So you just try, try, try, try.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.436
And come back to the things
that just feels good.

00:09:04.436 --> 00:09:06.810
BRADLEY CROOKS: I think knowing
what your objectives are.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.270
You know, you have an end goal.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.714
What are you actually
trying to achieve with this?

00:09:10.714 --> 00:09:13.130
Are you trying to do this from
a commercial point of view?

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.349
Are you trying to do it
from a brand point of view?

00:09:15.349 --> 00:09:16.390
What are your objectives?

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:17.940
And that's probably true
of most ventures, right?

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.100
But I think it's particularly
true with something

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.270
which combines a lot of
creativity and a lot of tech.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.620
So it is, like you say, it's
kind of a moving target.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.200
And you know, sometimes
it moves whilst you're

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.500
developing for it, right?

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.290
So yeah, I mean, I
think it's good to have

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.190
an end goal in mind.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.950
KAY MESEBERG: I think
it's also extremely

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:39.120
interesting and important
to work on ideas, in the way

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.980
that you have an idea, and you
can put it in one sentence,

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.620
and you pitch to someone,
and it makes click.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.830
And I think that's a key
factor in the beginning.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.510
And then you add the tech to it.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.410
But if you have this
kind of basic idea

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.250
which really convince
people, and it convince,

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.640
you know, a little boy of
five years or a granny of 90,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.560
then you think you know
that you are really

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.840
working on something
interesting and great

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.200
and which can be really great.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.283
And then you add the tech.

00:10:04.283 --> 00:10:08.721
You add the different ways of
sound, of cameras, of unity,

00:10:08.721 --> 00:10:09.220
whatever.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.200
You decide what you
want to use for it.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.167
And that's, I
think, a key factor.

00:10:14.167 --> 00:10:15.250
GREG IVANOV: That's great.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.170
I think one interesting
mantra that we all

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.939
know in a mobile world is
fail cheap and fail fast.

00:10:20.939 --> 00:10:22.480
And I just want to
kind of drill down

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.400
on that a little bit
in the context of this

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.306
question as well.

00:10:26.306 --> 00:10:27.930
It kind of works in
mobile pretty well.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.750
You can fail cheap
and fail fast.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.290
With VR and the costs and
the know-how associated

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.610
with developing for VR, that's
presumably a lot harder to do.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.080
So how do you--

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.360
do you still apply
the same method?

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.630
Or do you just not, and you
see this as an investment

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.710
of a different kind?

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.900
And you have to
convince, perhaps,

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.230
your leadership that this is
just the way it has to be?

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.072
Peter, do you have
a take on that?

00:10:55.072 --> 00:10:57.530
PETER STAHL: Yeah, I guess they
must throw crap on the wall

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.430
and see what sticks.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.260
Yeah, it does apply,
I think, partially.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.405
I think you have
to make a few bets.

00:11:05.405 --> 00:11:07.780
I think you've got to pick a
few things that you actually

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.850
believe is going to happen.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.550
Like for example, we
believe that the cords in VR

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:14.110
are going to go away.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.000
You're going to be
moving around a lot more.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.541
There's a lot of
those examples where

00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:21.400
you got to go, that we really
believe is going to happen,

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.000
because, again, it's
a moving platform.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.690
It does apply in the
sense that if you've

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:30.600
got to do something
that you are very

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:35.620
unsure of if it's going to be
successful or not, then yeah.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.692
Fail fast.

00:11:36.692 --> 00:11:38.650
KAY MESEBERG: I think
it's also important to be

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.870
flexible in a way
that you can port

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.150
your experience with
different other platforms,

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:47.090
to do real life experiences in
cinemas, to bring it on mobile,

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.810
to bring it on different
headsets and stuff like that.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.810
I mean, that can really
trigger the evolution.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.880
And it can help
that with porting,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.880
you redefine the
things you're doing.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.010
So I think it's
really amazing to see

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:05.300
that things are working great on
Daydream, but also on Android.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.245
But on Android, they are known
as, also, some other headsets

00:12:08.245 --> 00:12:09.520
and stuff like that.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.770
But still, we can show
it in planetariums,

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.430
in screens which
are 30 meters large.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.490
And you can watch it
together with 300 people

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.350
in a cinema-like setting.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.480
So I think that's really
the interesting, great thing

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.570
with VR today, that you are
on a step into something new,

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:29.770
and everybody's trying out.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.890
And then as many as
different ways you try out,

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:36.694
and I think you will succeed
in the one or the other.

00:12:36.694 --> 00:12:38.110
GREG IVANOV: By
the way, if anyone

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.200
has a question in the audience,
feel free to raise your hand,

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.890
and we'll give you
a mic or something.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:44.730
Or just ask.

00:12:48.188 --> 00:12:50.170
Yeah.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:54.482
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:55.690
GREG IVANOV: Just over there.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:56.860
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:57.740
I'm Martin.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.420
I'm in company for [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.320
We have a division
called [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.670
And we have already more
than 3,000 VR videos

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.360
in our platform.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.060
[INAUDIBLE] reaching
5,000 in a few months.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.150
And we still have the
struggle, I would say,

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.940
like the classical
TV or video approach,

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:19.620
to have the passive watching
of the videos in 360

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.560
or virtual reality content
comparing to active.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.440
So what is your point of
view of to bring more--

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:32.660
if it's the way to bring more
active interaction with video,

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:33.870
or--?

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:40.050
We are now in Android platform,
with a new generation on Oculus

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.620
will be ready in a few weeks.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.980
And then, we have some
[INAUDIBLE] VR [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.040
in our own channel.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.040
So what is your
approach to bring

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:52.120
more customers [INAUDIBLE]
to show this, see the content

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.990
and to be entertained
by the content,

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:58.680
or to go more to interact
with the content in VR world?

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.277
Thank you.

00:14:00.277 --> 00:14:02.110
BRADLEY CROOKS: Yeah,
I mean, I think that--

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.427
it's an interesting question,
because different parts

00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:06.010
of the BBC are doing
different things.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:07.185
We're doing kind of--

00:14:07.185 --> 00:14:09.310
people who are interested
in sort of live streaming

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:12.370
e-sports through VR and so on.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.250
There's a big divide, I
think, between 360 content

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.430
and real-time content.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.430
And you know, obviously
there's a certain amount

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.560
that you can do to
overlay one or the other.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.390
I think in everything
you create, again,

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.160
thinking of what
the end goal is,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.570
you need to be adding value.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.700
And I think one of the
problems that VR has had is--

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.420
and it's the same with most kind
of new techs-- is people go,

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.920
wow, there's this
amazing new thing.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.855
Let's build some stuff for it.

00:14:34.855 --> 00:14:36.730
Not necessarily thinking
if this is something

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.230
that the audience
actually wants.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.355
And I think you have to be
thinking, in any product

00:14:40.355 --> 00:14:43.150
development, you know,
who's my audience?

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.610
What do they need?

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:46.720
And what can I offer them?

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.630
And if you can answer
those three things,

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.830
and that allows you to come
up with a product which

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.380
is going to make their life
easier or more entertaining

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.850
or whatever it is, then I
think you'll be successful.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.683
But I think just doing
something because you

00:14:57.683 --> 00:15:00.400
hope the market will develop,
I think that's risky.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.430
Very risky.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.705
So I think it's really key to
be thinking of your consumer

00:15:05.705 --> 00:15:09.010
always, what's going
to be good for them.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.800
If that answers your question.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.390
GREG IVANOV: Kay, you probably
have a point of view on that,

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:21.150
since you spoke about
linear and interactive.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:25.120
KAY MESEBERG: I think the
real interactive is still

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:25.940
based on mobile.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.580
It's based on the VR headsets.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:32.547
And we see grow, that there
are more and more headsets

00:15:32.547 --> 00:15:33.130
on the market.

00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:36.830
So the market is getting
bigger and bigger.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:42.100
Still, with linear,
you have the advantage

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:46.420
that you can really
make access to people

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.480
who don't have a
headset but who are

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.040
familiar with video in general.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.830
So they understand it like that.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:59.620
And I think if you create out
of that great experiences, that

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.050
can be a bit more
convincing just

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:06.010
to understand this
new evolutionary step

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:10.930
into computing and this kind
of new platform, this kind

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:15.870
of new interactive
realities coming up there.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.970
And it's a really good
tool, like a technology

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:21.730
that's kind of doing the
bridge between the two.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.100
And that's why we
shouldn't underestimate,

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.945
really, linear-based videos.

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:30.420
GREG IVANOV: Yeah, and I think,
[INAUDIBLE] from the Daydream

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:34.030
side, we've seen that actually
the most-used app on Daydream

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.080
was YouTube.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:40.210
So linear 360 video
is playing a big part.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:45.340
And I don't think we want to
say that 360 or linear video

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.490
is some kind of a step towards
the ultimate goal, which

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:49.270
is interactive.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:49.930
It's not.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.739
I think, as Bradley
mentioned, it's

00:16:52.739 --> 00:16:54.530
really about what you're
trying to achieve.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.940
And sometimes 360 video is
exactly the right format.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.770
And also, it's often
cheaper to produce.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:03.610
So that's a good thing, too.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.440
I think there was another
question from a gentleman here?

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.020
AUDIENCE: Hi, hello.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:11.520
I'm Antoine.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.436
I work at [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:12.436 --> 00:17:13.800
We're a language learning app.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.660
And we've just built
a VR experience

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.010
for another platform.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:24.630
And one of my questions
is around replayability,

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:29.300
because obviously, those
experiences are quite finite.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.880
And I guess, as all
platforms, we'll

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.270
be looking at retention
as a key metric.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:37.890
So how do you make
sure, you know,

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.930
that the headset
just doesn't become

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:44.130
one thing that's just left
in the cupboards out of view,

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.560
and people come back to
your experiences over time?

00:17:50.577 --> 00:17:52.160
PETER STAHL: I would
start by saying--

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:52.660
sorry.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.540
As I said, placing bets
before in what you believe

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.810
will happen in time to come.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.610
I personally believe that
we're not quite there yet.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.160
There's a cap.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.340
There's an experience
cap, which is--

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.850
that's sad, but
it's going to come.

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.800
Technology is moving
extremely fast.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:27.240
And I think, yeah, you've got to
be there when it goes relevant.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.250
I think you've got to be ready
when putting that thing on

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:36.470
and whatever happens in that
reality feels relevant to you.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.210
And also, you've got
to place those bets

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:42.870
on what you believe is relevant
to your target audience.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.910
For example, a group
of young people

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:52.290
might want to meet up and
play their favorite game

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:53.030
and so forth.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.900
And you might want to meet
with your son or your daughter

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.820
across the world.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.059
Different groups.

00:19:02.059 --> 00:19:03.600
BRADLEY CROOKS:
Yeah, I mean, there's

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.020
some BBC research, actually,
that was done recently

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.580
about little kind of barriers.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.540
You might have seen it.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.450
It's really interesting.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.366
And one of the biggest
barriers is that people

00:19:12.366 --> 00:19:13.620
lose their headsets.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.800
So you know, it's
a different thing

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.360
to kind of switch on your TV and
interact with content that way,

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.010
to actually go and
find your headset,

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.190
put it on, go through the
process of booting it up,

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.820
and so on.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.320
And the research
found that that was

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.069
one of the most difficult
things about VR,

00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:33.990
is that people tend to do things
in order of how easy they are.

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.990
And VR comes fairly
low down the list.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.490
And that's one
reason why I think it

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.800
has to have that added value.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.960
You know, it has to be
something that people

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.145
are going to kind of want
as a destination to go to.

00:19:45.145 --> 00:19:47.520
But I do think, as well-- we
were just talking about this

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.380
before--

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.790
that we are in the really
early stages of VR.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:52.666
There's been a huge
amount of noise about it.

00:19:52.666 --> 00:19:54.581
And people are saying,
it's not going to work,

00:19:54.581 --> 00:19:56.580
and people aren't
investing in it and so on.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.288
It's incredibly unfair,
because it's only

00:19:58.288 --> 00:20:01.320
really been in its current form
around for 18 months to two

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.050
years.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.341
If you look at the mobile
market, which has been around

00:20:04.341 --> 00:20:07.650
for a long, long time,
much of the sophistication

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.990
about retention and
so on is only really

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.107
now kind of coming to the fore.

00:20:12.107 --> 00:20:14.190
And you look at the way
that mobile companies sort

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:18.720
of reengage people and
so on, that's years

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.870
of R&amp;D and investment and tying
into social channels and so on.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.176
And I think VR and AR will
have that eventually as well.

00:20:26.176 --> 00:20:28.050
And that will help with
retention and getting

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.800
people to come back
in and discoverability

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.857
and all those things.

00:20:30.857 --> 00:20:32.940
KAY MESEBERG: Yeah, it's
an interesting comparison

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.760
to mobile, because,
actually, the first mobile

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.270
or smartphones, they came to
market in the '90s, something

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.130
like that.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:43.290
But it made boom in the
2000s, with Android,

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:44.670
with iOS and stuff like that.

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:50.150
So there was quite a big period
In between the first market

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:53.305
phones, like the Nokia back in
the days and stuff like that.

00:20:53.305 --> 00:20:59.160
And I think that seeing VR
moving today, since, like,

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.870
2014, since we do
it, it's really fast.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:06.990
I think I'm quite surprised
in different levels,

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:09.550
I mean, in adoption
and stuff like that.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:14.100
But I think, also, that the
midterm or the next goal

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:19.650
will be that it's kind of
something which is where people

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.690
ask for experiences,
but not because it's

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.960
VR, because they ask that they
heard something is really great

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.040
and they want to play it,
or they want to see it,

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:27.780
or whatever.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:31.342
I think that will be the
next goal for the next year.

00:21:31.342 --> 00:21:33.510
GREG IVANOV: Yeah, I think
that, to your question

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:36.600
around replayability,
there's kind of, I think,

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.820
three things that need
to happen and align

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.790
in a certain way, which
is hardware, software,

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:42.870
and content, right?

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:46.039
So if it becomes the barrier to
experiencing VR is a lot lower,

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:48.330
then replayability is not
really that much of an issue,

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.910
because you can just pick
this thing up, and it's cheap,

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.820
and it's easy, right?

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.660
And I think to follow on with
this, one interesting stat

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:01.920
that I guess you guys know
is that Goldman Sachs says

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.180
by 2025, VR will become
an $80 billion industry,

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.210
taking over TV.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.770
That's interesting.

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:17.130
So be that as it may,
what do you think

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:21.630
are the key steps that need
to happen in order for VR

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.652
to go mainstream,
whatever that means?

00:22:25.652 --> 00:22:30.180
KAY MESEBERG: I think if you
look back on smartphone market,

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.130
I mean, today you
have a phenomenon

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.890
that people say they
talked to someone,

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:35.850
but you don't know how.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:37.110
I mean, did they call them?

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.750
Did they write a
WhatsApp, whatever?

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:40.980
You know, you don't know.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.420
They just say that they are
in communication with someone.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:48.510
And I think VR should be, and
AR should be, at the same level,

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:52.740
more or less, that
it's used intuitively.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.825
Like, OK, it's there.

00:22:53.825 --> 00:22:54.450
It's something.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:58.244
And I do a call with my
friends in the states in 360,

00:22:58.244 --> 00:23:00.660
and I see where they are, and
we can share the environment

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:01.493
and stuff like that.

00:23:01.493 --> 00:23:03.540
So all this, I think, will come.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:07.680
But you know, I think this
will be more or less the kind

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.120
of level where it will arrive.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.440
BRADLEY CROOKS:
Yeah, I mean, I think

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.120
there's an interesting
kind of adoption

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:20.145
curve with any new technology,
that it has to become sort of--

00:23:20.145 --> 00:23:21.540
it has to be
accessible to people

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.550
and sort of be something that
people are familiar with.

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.680
And obviously, as a
younger generation grows up

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.290
with that tech, they'll
probably be more willing to kind

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.859
of put headsets on and so on.

00:23:30.859 --> 00:23:32.400
But again, I think
it just comes down

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:34.836
to what are the
applications going to be?

00:23:34.836 --> 00:23:36.210
And I think you'll
probably begin

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:40.367
to see VR finding
different areas which

00:23:40.367 --> 00:23:41.200
it's really good at.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.140
So I think it has
lots of applications

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.730
for business to
business and training

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:46.770
and that type of thing.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:50.914
I think there'll be a lot more
installation-based VR coming up

00:23:50.914 --> 00:23:52.080
in the next couple of years.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.820
You know, you'll see
it at theme parks.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.040
You'll see it in malls
and things like that.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.890
And I think that, again, will
kind of give the general public

00:23:58.890 --> 00:23:59.932
much more exposure to it.

00:23:59.932 --> 00:24:01.931
And that's a good way for
them getting involved,

00:24:01.931 --> 00:24:03.600
because it's not them
doing that at home

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.440
and losing their
headset or whatever.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:05.760
GREG IVANOV: Great.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.260
Awesome.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.260
OK, I think we're
all out of time.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.770
So thank you so much for
joining and discussing.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:12.700
Super interesting.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:13.770
So yeah, thank you.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:16.820
[APPLAUSE]
