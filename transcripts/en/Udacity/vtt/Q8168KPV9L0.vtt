What I want you to do is take--

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
this is the same version of the bridge problem solver that we saw before,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I want you to modify this so that it tests for the goal later

00:00:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
after pulling a state off the frontier, not when we're about to put it on the frontier.
