00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.600
Okay, so thus far we have the slow and

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.920
the fast audio effects working really well.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.840
The next thing I want to do is add an effect that make our voice sound

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.950
like that of a chipmunk.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.150
We will begin by adding this button on the storyboard.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.400
To make this button work, you will want to accomplish the same tasks as before.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.030
Here they are one more time.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.390
Check this box when you are done.
