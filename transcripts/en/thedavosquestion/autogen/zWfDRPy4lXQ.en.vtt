&gt;&gt;Tim Sebastian - Mideast Davos Debate 2009

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.519
I think role models are vitally important
at meetings like this and in general in the

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:18.029
Middle East. My issues with role models is
this, I think role models should be not necessarily

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.230
the people who are always in the spotlight,
people always in the media, but people who

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.789
get things done at a grassroots level. The
people who are helping in refugee camps, people

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.190
who work in the hospitals, the people who
are sacrificing their time and their liberty,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.141
often their liberty, to push the envelope,
particularly where free speech is concerned.

00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:29.141
And I'd like to see these people honored more
and respected more and more in the spotlight

00:00:29.141 --> 00:00:45.789
than they have been in the past. When you
have people at a meeting like this I think

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.329
it's also important to realize that you don't
go on every year saying the same things, promising

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.329
the same things to people who talking about
changing the world will leave here and you

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.570
don't follow through with it. This is the
problem. I'd like to see role models come

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.620
here and put into action some of the things
that they talk about at meetings like this.
