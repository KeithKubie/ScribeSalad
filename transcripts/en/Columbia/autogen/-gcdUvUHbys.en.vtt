and of course the real thing is always

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840
and of course the real thing is always
 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.700
and of course the real thing is always
much better but with the simulation we

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710
much better but with the simulation we
 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.220
much better but with the simulation we
can go inside so in the last eight years

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230
can go inside so in the last eight years
 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.060
can go inside so in the last eight years

taken up and so this next clip is is a
simulation of the birth of a star in the

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250
simulation of the birth of a star in the
 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.320
simulation of the birth of a star in the
early universe and it was a really long

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330
early universe and it was a really long
 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.480
early universe and it was a really long
intensive collaboration with scientists

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490
intensive collaboration with scientists
 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.520
intensive collaboration with scientists
at the University of California San

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530
at the University of California San
 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.540
at the University of California San
Diego and it actually came out of a

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550
Diego and it actually came out of a
 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.830
Diego and it actually came out of a
monstrously huge simulation of the the

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840
monstrously huge simulation of the the
 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.070
monstrously huge simulation of the the
early universe hundreds of millions of

early universe hundreds of millions of
 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.379
early universe hundreds of millions of
light-years across a huge area and this

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389
light-years across a huge area and this
 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.899
light-years across a huge area and this
was a little speck that they pulled out

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909
was a little speck that they pulled out
 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:19.980
was a little speck that they pulled out
and computed it at high resolution so

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990
and computed it at high resolution so
 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.770
and computed it at high resolution so
let's see scientists have recreated

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780
let's see scientists have recreated
 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.379
let's see scientists have recreated
these early times with supercomputer

these aren't gentle clouds as they grow
 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:02.260
these aren't gentle clouds as they grow
more and more dense they heat up

NSF and it was on last year but the the
 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.330
NSF and it was on last year but the the
dome show was a real revelation so in

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340
dome show was a real revelation so in
 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.700
dome show was a real revelation so in
its first year it's been bouncing into

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710
its first year it's been bouncing into
 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.839
its first year it's been bouncing into
about 20 theaters around the world and

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:57.849
about 20 theaters around the world and
 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:00.460
about 20 theaters around the world and
with an audience of about five to six

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470
with an audience of about five to six
 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.730
with an audience of about five to six
hundred thousand but the the great thing

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740
hundred thousand but the the great thing
 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.589
hundred thousand but the the great thing
is that the audiences are sitting right

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599
is that the audiences are sitting right
 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:07.629
is that the audiences are sitting right
there and they're not out there

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639
there and they're not out there
 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:10.930
there and they're not out there
somewhere and they seem to experience

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940
somewhere and they seem to experience
 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.709
somewhere and they seem to experience
the content very intensely and they're

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:14.719
the content very intensely and they're
 

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:16.779
the content very intensely and they're
in science museum context so they're

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:16.789
in science museum context so they're
 

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:18.279
in science museum context so they're
kind of there to learn something in the

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:18.289
kind of there to learn something in the
 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:21.040
kind of there to learn something in the
beginning and these theaters are being

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.050
beginning and these theaters are being
 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:22.450
beginning and these theaters are being
built around the world at a pretty good

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460
built around the world at a pretty good
 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.189
built around the world at a pretty good
clip so it's a really interesting kind

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:24.199
clip so it's a really interesting kind
 

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:27.189
clip so it's a really interesting kind
of a market so here's another clip and

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199
of a market so here's another clip and
 

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:30.610
of a market so here's another clip and
this is based on Andrew Hamilton we

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:30.620
this is based on Andrew Hamilton we

this is based on Andrew Hamilton we
received Colorado and his attempt to

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:32.449
received Colorado and his attempt to
 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:35.890
received Colorado and his attempt to
simulate with Einstein's equations what

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:35.900
simulate with Einstein's equations what
 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.320

a black hole is actually like and it got
 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.260
a black hole is actually like and it got
much better in the Nova show but this is

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:41.270
much better in the Nova show but this is
 

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.879
much better in the Nova show but this is
still good the black hole pulls the gas

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:45.889
still good the black hole pulls the gas
 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:51.550
still good the black hole pulls the gas

you know the screen is as big as this
 

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.440
you know the screen is as big as this
room so that's the amazing thing about

room so that's the amazing thing about
 

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.510
room so that's the amazing thing about
it we can we can put these digital

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:11.520
it we can we can put these digital
 

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.269
it we can we can put these digital
images on screens that big and really

00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279
images on screens that big and really
 

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:16.880
images on screens that big and really
blow people away and we can even like

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:16.890
blow people away and we can even like
 

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.190
blow people away and we can even like

image too much but the accessibility of

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.380
image too much but the accessibility of
 

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.850
image too much but the accessibility of
the data means we can also think about

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:25.860
the data means we can also think about
 

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.769
the data means we can also think about

00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:27.779
interacting with audiences in new ways
 

00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:30.320
interacting with audiences in new ways
so as an example we're proposing another

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:30.330
so as an example we're proposing another
 

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.170
so as an example we're proposing another

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.180
dome show dealing with climate change
 

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.570
dome show dealing with climate change
and it's also going to the NSF but the

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.580
and it's also going to the NSF but the
 

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.550
and it's also going to the NSF but the
partners are really interested in just

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560
partners are really interested in just
 

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.800
partners are really interested in just
going ahead with it anyway so I think

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:39.810
going ahead with it anyway so I think
 

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.150
going ahead with it anyway so I think
it's just going to happen there's also a

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160
it's just going to happen there's also a
 

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.440
it's just going to happen there's also a
TV project but it's kind of clear as we

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:45.450
TV project but it's kind of clear as we
 

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.810
TV project but it's kind of clear as we
look into that that the these times call

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:47.820
look into that that the these times call
 

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.290
look into that that the these times call
for strong global perspectives and these

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:50.300
for strong global perspectives and these
 

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:53.449
for strong global perspectives and these
dome shows like TV shows can really do

00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459
dome shows like TV shows can really do
 

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:56.570
dome shows like TV shows can really do
that but how do you make the global

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:56.580
that but how do you make the global
 

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.389
that but how do you make the global
perspective relevant to the local

00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399
perspective relevant to the local
 

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:08.269
perspective relevant to the local
perspective so let's see okay so so this

00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279
perspective so let's see okay so so this
 

00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:11.630
perspective so let's see okay so so this

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.980
in June in two thousand the period
leading up to 2000 it's actually kind of

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:18.990
leading up to 2000 it's actually kind of
 

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.620
leading up to 2000 it's actually kind of
some dark spots over there that's kind

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:21.630
some dark spots over there that's kind
 

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.920
some dark spots over there that's kind
of Death Valley like conditions and 120

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:24.930
of Death Valley like conditions and 120
 

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:31.210
of Death Valley like conditions and 120
degrees is is about the average fine so

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:31.220
degrees is is about the average fine so
 

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:37.040
degrees is is about the average fine so
this is a simulation of a year to 2100

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.050
this is a simulation of a year to 2100
 

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.030
this is a simulation of a year to 2100
same time June the high temperatures

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:40.040
same time June the high temperatures
 

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:45.290
same time June the high temperatures
performed by a UK global climate model

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.300
performed by a UK global climate model
 

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.840
performed by a UK global climate model
and interpolated down so you can see the

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:47.850
and interpolated down so you can see the
 

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:53.960
and interpolated down so you can see the
dark red is much much bigger so you know

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:53.970
dark red is much much bigger so you know
 

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:59.060
dark red is much much bigger so you know
they say don't mess with Texas don't go

00:10:59.060 --> 00:10:59.070
they say don't mess with Texas don't go
 

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:02.460
they say don't mess with Texas don't go
to Texas

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:02.470
 
 

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.170
 
this is this is where Death Valley is

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:04.180
this is this is where Death Valley is
 

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.280
this is this is where Death Valley is
new so our idea is to make you know data

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:08.290
new so our idea is to make you know data
 

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.430
new so our idea is to make you know data
like this much more accessible on a web

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440
like this much more accessible on a web
 

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.460
like this much more accessible on a web
project so you can really kind of look

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:14.470
project so you can really kind of look
 

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.380
project so you can really kind of look
at the model results see how things are

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:16.390
at the model results see how things are
 

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.500
at the model results see how things are
going to work in your own neighborhoods

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:18.510
going to work in your own neighborhoods
 

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.090
going to work in your own neighborhoods
based on you know different scenarios

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:21.100
based on you know different scenarios
 

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.180
based on you know different scenarios
and we don't think that's on the web

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:24.190
and we don't think that's on the web
 

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:29.360
and we don't think that's on the web
right now it's kind of surprising but

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:29.370
right now it's kind of surprising but
 

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.200
right now it's kind of surprising but
there's another thing that we're

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:31.210
there's another thing that we're
 

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.520
there's another thing that we're
interested which is making it even more

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:32.530
interested which is making it even more
 

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:37.530
interested which is making it even more
local and there's a so there's one

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:37.540
local and there's a so there's one
 

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.540
local and there's a so there's one
effort which is in North Carolina that's

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:39.550
effort which is in North Carolina that's
 

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.360
effort which is in North Carolina that's
happening now where they're taking

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:41.370
happening now where they're taking
 

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.230
happening now where they're taking
climatic data and they're putting them

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.240
climatic data and they're putting them
 

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.260
climatic data and they're putting them
into portable domes inflatable domes

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:46.270
into portable domes inflatable domes
 

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.330
into portable domes inflatable domes
which are the big things scaled down

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:48.340
which are the big things scaled down
 

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.240
which are the big things scaled down
with smaller audiences and they're

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:51.250
with smaller audiences and they're
 

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.270
with smaller audiences and they're
starting to show climatic and

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:53.280
starting to show climatic and
 

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.000
starting to show climatic and
topographical data to people communities

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:57.010
topographical data to people communities
 

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.670
topographical data to people communities
and they're focusing on flooding and

00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680
and they're focusing on flooding and
 

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.190
and they're focusing on flooding and
storm surge right now but we're going to

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.200
storm surge right now but we're going to
 

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.840
storm surge right now but we're going to
see we're going to try to feed into that

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:03.850
see we're going to try to feed into that
 

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.760
see we're going to try to feed into that
and and even make it interactive as well

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:07.770
and and even make it interactive as well
 

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.100
and and even make it interactive as well
so just imagine you know the simulations

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.110
so just imagine you know the simulations
 

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.740
so just imagine you know the simulations
can be brought down and they are to a

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:13.750
can be brought down and they are to a
 

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.610
can be brought down and they are to a
smaller scale imagine being able to test

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:17.620
smaller scale imagine being able to test
 

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:22.140
smaller scale imagine being able to test
your own scenarios to simulate global

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:22.150
your own scenarios to simulate global
 

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.620
your own scenarios to simulate global
climates impact locally that could be

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:25.630
climates impact locally that could be
 

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.200
climates impact locally that could be
very impactful as well as very

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:28.210
very impactful as well as very
 

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:35.190
very impactful as well as very
educational so and there's one effort

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:35.200
educational so and there's one effort
 

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.280
educational so and there's one effort
that's doing that too to an extent and

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:38.290
that's doing that too to an extent and
 

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.670
that's doing that too to an extent and
that's the Hadley Center in Britain is

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:40.680
that's the Hadley Center in Britain is
 

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:45.620
that's the Hadley Center in Britain is
making PC sized climate models available

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:45.630
making PC sized climate models available
 

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.170
making PC sized climate models available
regionally around the world so for local

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:49.180
regionally around the world so for local
 

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.170
regionally around the world so for local
governments and scientists to plan than

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:52.180
governments and scientists to plan than
 

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.790
governments and scientists to plan than
to project out what's going to happen

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800
to project out what's going to happen
 

00:12:53.800 --> 00:13:01.230
to project out what's going to happen
right there we're almost out of time so
