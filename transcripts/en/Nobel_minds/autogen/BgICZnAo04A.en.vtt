about the future now it's not gonna go
 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.920
about the future now it's not gonna go
quite that way and we will intermingle

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930
quite that way and we will intermingle
 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.440
quite that way and we will intermingle
the times so don't forgive us but that's

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450
the times so don't forgive us but that's
 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.440
the times so don't forgive us but that's
the basic structure so let me start by

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450
the basic structure so let me start by
 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.170
the basic structure so let me start by
those of you and who don't really know

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180
those of you and who don't really know
 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.029
those of you and who don't really know
much about gravitational waves and

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039
much about gravitational waves and
 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.219
much about gravitational waves and

most of you were trained in in high
 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.570
most of you were trained in in high
school and possibly in college is you

learnt about Newton's theory of gravity

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899
learnt about Newton's theory of gravity
 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.410
learnt about Newton's theory of gravity
which is a theory in which there are

which is a theory in which there are
 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.330
which is a theory in which there are
forces that between masses and that

forces that between masses and that
 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.609
forces that between masses and that
force gets smaller the bigger the

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619
force gets smaller the bigger the
 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.149
force gets smaller the bigger the
distance between the masses and it is a

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159
distance between the masses and it is a
 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.039

wonderful theory it does almost all you

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049
wonderful theory it does almost all you
 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.890

need in fact it got the space program

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900
need in fact it got the space program

working there's nothing terribly wrong

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909
working there's nothing terribly wrong
 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.109
working there's nothing terribly wrong
with that theory but it isn't right okay

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119
with that theory but it isn't right okay
 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.800
with that theory but it isn't right okay
and Einstein saw this pretty quickly

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810
and Einstein saw this pretty quickly
 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.120
and Einstein saw this pretty quickly
after he developed a special theory of

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130
after he developed a special theory of
 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.609
after he developed a special theory of

Sun disappeared and we know it takes
 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.640
Sun disappeared and we know it takes
about nine minutes for us to see that it

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650
about nine minutes for us to see that it
 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.440
about nine minutes for us to see that it
also should take something like nine

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450
also should take something like nine
 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.870
also should take something like nine
minutes for us to find out ravva tation

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880
minutes for us to find out ravva tation
 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.699
minutes for us to find out ravva tation
aliy that it has something has happened

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709
aliy that it has something has happened

aliy that it has something has happened
to it and that's something that again

to it and that's something that again
was not in in the Newton theory and so

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959
was not in in the Newton theory and so
 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.710
was not in in the Newton theory and so

on all those intersection points they
all read the same time but as you walk

all read the same time but as you walk

toward the Sun in this plane you'll
 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.949
toward the Sun in this plane you'll
notice that the distortion in space you

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959
notice that the distortion in space you
 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.510
notice that the distortion in space you
don't see the distortion in time because

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520
don't see the distortion in time because
 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.100
don't see the distortion in time because
I didn't put you clocks there but the

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209
clocks in here are running a little more
 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.810
clocks in here are running a little more
slowly than the clocks out there and a

slowly than the clocks out there and a
 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.370
slowly than the clocks out there and a
little bit of that also happens that the

little bit of that also happens that the
 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.050
little bit of that also happens that the

earth is a little dimple that the earth
 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.050
earth is a little dimple that the earth
does and the way John Wheeler explained

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060
does and the way John Wheeler explained
 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.300
does and the way John Wheeler explained
Einstein's theory he says matter

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310
Einstein's theory he says matter
 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.530
Einstein's theory he says matter
distorts space and time and then matter

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540
distorts space and time and then matter
 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.960
distorts space and time and then matter
moves because of the distortion in space

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970
moves because of the distortion in space
 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.820
moves because of the distortion in space
and time and that's the best I can do

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830
and time and that's the best I can do
 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.150
and time and that's the best I can do
for you people do better okay and in

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160
for you people do better okay and in
 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.759
for you people do better okay and in
that theory there is also gravitational

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769
that theory there is also gravitational
 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.360
that theory there is also gravitational
waves and I want to show you first a

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370
waves and I want to show you first a
 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.640
waves and I want to show you first a
gravitational wave the and the

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650
gravitational wave the and the
 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.920
gravitational wave the and the
gravitational waves move at the speed of

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930
gravitational waves move at the speed of
 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.170
gravitational waves move at the speed of
light you've heard that already and but

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180
light you've heard that already and but
 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.150
light you've heard that already and but
there they are as you'll see in a minute

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160
there they are as you'll see in a minute
 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.490
there they are as you'll see in a minute
and what's this picture will show is

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500
and what's this picture will show is
 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.350
and what's this picture will show is
there a transverse wave there a wave

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360
there a transverse wave there a wave
 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.260
there a transverse wave there a wave
that distorts space perpendicular to the

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270
that distorts space perpendicular to the
 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.540
that distorts space perpendicular to the
direction in which the wave moves and so

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550
direction in which the wave moves and so
 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.090
direction in which the wave moves and so
let me turn on this little animation but

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100
let me turn on this little animation but
 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.320
let me turn on this little animation but
before I do that before you because

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330
before I do that before you because
 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.240
before I do that before you because
you'll get sick looking at it there you

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250
you'll get sick looking at it there you
 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.010
you'll get sick looking at it there you
are right there that's you in that

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020
are right there that's you in that
 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.290
are right there that's you in that
little red square and now I'll turn on

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300
little red square and now I'll turn on
 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.030
little red square and now I'll turn on
the sound and animation so you can see

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040
the sound and animation so you can see
 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.310
the sound and animation so you can see
the wave coming by you and you'll see

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320
the wave coming by you and you'll see
 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.420
the wave coming by you and you'll see
some patterns in this which are

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430
some patterns in this which are
 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.100
some patterns in this which are
important for understanding how we

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110
important for understanding how we
 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.680
important for understanding how we
detected these things first of all

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690
detected these things first of all
 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.960
detected these things first of all
you'll notice that in let's say the

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970
you'll notice that in let's say the
 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.570
you'll notice that in let's say the
horizontal direction and let's say it's

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580
horizontal direction and let's say it's
 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.390
horizontal direction and let's say it's
expanding but in the vertical direction

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400
expanding but in the vertical direction
 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.430
expanding but in the vertical direction
is contracting now any one moment these

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440
is contracting now any one moment these
 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.530
is contracting now any one moment these
things will flip but will they there

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540
things will flip but will they there
 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.300
things will flip but will they there
will be opposite motions vertically and

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310
will be opposite motions vertically and
 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.000
will be opposite motions vertically and
horizontally that's one thing so that's

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010
horizontally that's one thing so that's
 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.279
horizontally that's one thing so that's
a pattern that you you exploit by the

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:12.289
a pattern that you you exploit by the
 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:13.630
a pattern that you you exploit by the
way you'll see where how we exploit that

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640
way you'll see where how we exploit that
 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.290
way you'll see where how we exploit that
the other thing about

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300
the other thing about
 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.450
the other thing about
is that that these are the objects that

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460
is that that these are the objects that
 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.580
is that that these are the objects that
you threw out into the space as the

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590
you threw out into the space as the
 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.749
you threw out into the space as the
gravitational wave comes through I

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759
gravitational wave comes through I
 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.460
gravitational wave comes through I
should have told you that so you look

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470
should have told you that so you look
 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.890
should have told you that so you look
here with not near you these let's say

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900
here with not near you these let's say
 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.629
here with not near you these let's say
these little masses they don't move very

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639
these little masses they don't move very
 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.850
these little masses they don't move very
much but the masses that are far away

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860
much but the masses that are far away
 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.719
much but the masses that are far away
from you they move a lot and that's a

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729
from you they move a lot and that's a
 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.540
from you they move a lot and that's a
picture of a constant strain along at

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550
picture of a constant strain along at
 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.700
picture of a constant strain along at
any one moment the change in distance

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710
any one moment the change in distance
 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.309
any one moment the change in distance
between objects is proportional to their

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319
between objects is proportional to their
 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:42.710
between objects is proportional to their
separation and that change in distance

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720
separation and that change in distance
 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.290
separation and that change in distance
divided by the separation is called the

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300
divided by the separation is called the
 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.300
divided by the separation is called the
strain and we will talk about that a lot

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310
strain and we will talk about that a lot
 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.029
strain and we will talk about that a lot
that's the quantity we measure while we

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039
that's the quantity we measure while we
 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.350
that's the quantity we measure while we
actually measure the distance

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360
actually measure the distance
 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.969
actually measure the distance
separations but the quantity you

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979
separations but the quantity you
 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.339
separations but the quantity you
described as the field quantity in the

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349
described as the field quantity in the
 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:59.089
described as the field quantity in the
theory is the strain and so let me tell

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099
theory is the strain and so let me tell
 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.219
theory is the strain and so let me tell
you a little bit of history now we

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229
you a little bit of history now we
 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:02.779
you a little bit of history now we
talked already about this theory being

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789
talked already about this theory being
 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.990
talked already about this theory being
developed about a hundred years ago in

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000
developed about a hundred years ago in
 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.089
developed about a hundred years ago in
1915 Einstein gave the world the general

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099
1915 Einstein gave the world the general
 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:09.860
1915 Einstein gave the world the general
theory of relativity is which was

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870
theory of relativity is which was
 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.619
theory of relativity is which was
described somewhat by that first picture

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:11.629
described somewhat by that first picture
 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:15.740
described somewhat by that first picture
but then in 1916 he wrote a paper and I

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750
but then in 1916 he wrote a paper and I
 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.089
but then in 1916 he wrote a paper and I
have to drink something just to bear

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099
have to drink something just to bear
 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:25.580
have to drink something just to bear
with me it's not forever in that theory

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590
with me it's not forever in that theory
 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.029
with me it's not forever in that theory
yeah later on he had a paper in 1916

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039
yeah later on he had a paper in 1916
 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:31.519
yeah later on he had a paper in 1916
where he describes a lot of things that

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:31.529
where he describes a lot of things that
 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:34.939
where he describes a lot of things that
showed that it had a Newtonian limit and

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:34.949
showed that it had a Newtonian limit and
 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:36.980
showed that it had a Newtonian limit and
he also shows that there are

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990
he also shows that there are
 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.290
he also shows that there are
gravitational waves in that 1916 paper

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300
gravitational waves in that 1916 paper
 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.360
gravitational waves in that 1916 paper
and the only reason why I bring this up

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370
and the only reason why I bring this up
 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.459
and the only reason why I bring this up
here is because of a very interesting

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:43.469
here is because of a very interesting
 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:45.740
here is because of a very interesting
statement he made at the very end of the

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750
statement he made at the very end of the
 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.990
statement he made at the very end of the
paper he's described these things now to

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000
paper he's described these things now to
 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.820
paper he's described these things now to
talk to them about them in a minute but

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830
talk to them about them in a minute but
 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.529
talk to them about them in a minute but
he describes an equation which is up

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539
he describes an equation which is up
 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:53.390
he describes an equation which is up
here I will only tell you what that is

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400
here I will only tell you what that is
 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.249
here I will only tell you what that is
it says this is the strength of gravity

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:55.259
it says this is the strength of gravity
 

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:57.290
it says this is the strength of gravity
with gravitational waves and this is a

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300
with gravitational waves and this is a
 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.260
with gravitational waves and this is a
source of gravitational waves

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270
source of gravitational waves
 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.939
source of gravitational waves
oscillations and accelerations of matter

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:01.949
oscillations and accelerations of matter
 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:03.619
oscillations and accelerations of matter
and he says something extremely

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:03.629
and he says something extremely
 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:04.219
and he says something extremely
interesting

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:04.229
interesting
 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:05.809
interesting
I haven't here in German but I'll read

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:05.819
I haven't here in German but I'll read
 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:08.360
I haven't here in German but I'll read
it to you in English in any case one can

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370
it to you in English in any case one can
 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.459
it to you in English in any case one can
think of a that quantity will have a

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:10.469
think of a that quantity will have a
 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:13.129
think of a that quantity will have a
practically vanishing value this is at

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:13.139
practically vanishing value this is at
 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:14.390
practically vanishing value this is at
the end of that paper since you'll never

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400
the end of that paper since you'll never
 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.860
the end of that paper since you'll never
be able to measure this it's of no

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:15.870
be able to measure this it's of no
 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.050
be able to measure this it's of no
consequence to science that's

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060
consequence to science that's
 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.860
consequence to science that's
effectively what he was saying and then

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:20.870
effectively what he was saying and then
 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.839
effectively what he was saying and then
so he makes a mistake in this paper but

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:23.849
so he makes a mistake in this paper but
 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:25.820
so he makes a mistake in this paper but
that has nothing to do with it in 1918

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:25.830
that has nothing to do with it in 1918
 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.950
that has nothing to do with it in 1918
he corrects that but I want to be I'll

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:27.960
he corrects that but I want to be I'll
 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.940
he corrects that but I want to be I'll
be presumptive

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:28.950
be presumptive
 

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.040
be presumptive
a little bit and we have I've asked the

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.050
a little bit and we have I've asked the
 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.630
a little bit and we have I've asked the
people who will have the Antonine papers

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:32.640
people who will have the Antonine papers
 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.970

to try to find what I'm about to show

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:34.980
to try to find what I'm about to show
 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.160
to try to find what I'm about to show
you and they haven't found this on the

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:37.170
you and they haven't found this on the
 

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.230
you and they haven't found this on the
back of an envelope or in his notebooks

back of an envelope or in his notebooks
 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.180
back of an envelope or in his notebooks
but I'm sure it's there somewhere

but I'm sure it's there somewhere
 

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.040
but I'm sure it's there somewhere
so let's I'm trying to give you a little

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.050
so let's I'm trying to give you a little
 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.320
so let's I'm trying to give you a little
feel for why he made that statement and

feel for why he made that statement and
 

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.540
feel for why he made that statement and
you have to put yourself in the context

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:47.550
you have to put yourself in the context
 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.230
you have to put yourself in the context
of 1915 1916 what did people know about

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240
of 1915 1916 what did people know about
 

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.960
of 1915 1916 what did people know about
and what did they have and the first

and what did they have and the first
 

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.150
and what did they have and the first
thing you might have thought about is

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160
thing you might have thought about is
 

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.550

so that quantity allows you to estimate

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.010
so that quantity allows you to estimate
 

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.700
so that quantity allows you to estimate
H so here for example for the two trains

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:13.710
H so here for example for the two trains
 

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.190
H so here for example for the two trains
coming together and by the way trains in

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.200
coming together and by the way trains in

the United States don't go much faster

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:17.550
the United States don't go much faster
 

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.430
the United States don't go much faster
than this nowadays that that has not

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440
than this nowadays that that has not
 

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.410
than this nowadays that that has not
been much advanced than that maybe in

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420
been much advanced than that maybe in
 

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.030
been much advanced than that maybe in
Europe but not here not not in the

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040
Europe but not here not not in the
 

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.210
Europe but not here not not in the
United States so let's pick 10 to the 5

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:26.220

so yeah and you have to be far enough

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:36.570
so yeah and you have to be far enough
 

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.750
so yeah and you have to be far enough
away so you're not looking at Newtonian

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:38.760
away so you're not looking at Newtonian
 

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.670
away so you're not looking at Newtonian
just a new induced field you have to go

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680
just a new induced field you have to go
 

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.810
just a new induced field you have to go
far away

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:41.820
far away
 

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:43.070
far away
enough so that you're looking at the

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:43.080
enough so that you're looking at the
 

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.230
enough so that you're looking at the
radiation field the field that carries

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.240
radiation field the field that carries
 

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.030
radiation field the field that carries
these waves so you have to go out a

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040
these waves so you have to go out a
 

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.310
these waves so you have to go out a
wavelength about that's 300 kilometers

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320
wavelength about that's 300 kilometers
 

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.010
wavelength about that's 300 kilometers
and the H value you get is 10 to the

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:52.020
and the H value you get is 10 to the
 

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.970
and the H value you get is 10 to the
minus 42 and that is truly impossible we

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:55.980
minus 42 and that is truly impossible we
 

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.040
minus 42 and that is truly impossible we
can't even do that now and that's why

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:58.050
can't even do that now and that's why
 

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.830
can't even do that now and that's why
Einstein probably made that statement so

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:00.840
Einstein probably made that statement so
 

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.690
Einstein probably made that statement so
he might have went very well looked at

he might have went very well looked at
 

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.850
he might have went very well looked at
something else I mean he knew about the

these people may not may did not know

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:10.770
these people may not may did not know
 

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.560
these people may not may did not know
about the galaxies the galaxies was

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:12.570
about the galaxies the galaxies was
 

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.880
about the galaxies the galaxies was
something I was being discovered at the

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:13.890
something I was being discovered at the
 

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.610
something I was being discovered at the
time and so but suppose he put numbers

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:16.620
time and so but suppose he put numbers
 

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.620
time and so but suppose he put numbers
into that and he takes stars that are

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:18.630
into that and he takes stars that are
 

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.500
into that and he takes stars that are
going around each other once once a day

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:21.510
going around each other once once a day
 

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.080
going around each other once once a day
here the two stars and suppose there are

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.090
here the two stars and suppose there are
 

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.390
here the two stars and suppose there are
a distance of about 10,000 light-years

away they might have guessed at that it

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:28.470
away they might have guessed at that it
 

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.440
away they might have guessed at that it
might have been 30 he probably didn't

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:30.450
might have been 30 he probably didn't
 

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.180

galaxy because you really didn't know
 

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.450
galaxy because you really didn't know
about it and you get an H value which

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:35.460
about it and you get an H value which
 

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.820
about it and you get an H value which
isn't pretty small it's 10 to minus 23

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:37.830
isn't pretty small it's 10 to minus 23
 

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.000

every half day you go through a thing

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.050
every half day you go through a thing
 

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.380
every half day you go through a thing
that looks the same so you get you look

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:48.390
that looks the same so you get you look
 

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.090
that looks the same so you get you look

describe that formula but if you look at

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160
describe that formula but if you look at
 

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.250
describe that formula but if you look at
it that's what that gives and you would

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:04.260
it that's what that gives and you would
 

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.810
it that's what that gives and you would
get something like the following I'll

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:05.820
get something like the following I'll
 

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.940
get something like the following I'll
just say what the end result is here you

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:07.950
just say what the end result is here you
 

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.530
just say what the end result is here you
would have gotten that it would take 10

and so in both ways as an astronomical

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:23.730
and so in both ways as an astronomical
 

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.270
and so in both ways as an astronomical
thing and it's a technical thing I can

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:26.280

was a major discovery and I got scooped

00:12:06.449 --> 00:12:06.459
was a major discovery and I got scooped
 

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:08.180
was a major discovery and I got scooped
up by all these wonderful places and

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:08.190
up by all these wonderful places and
 

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.740

they they listened and they heard a
 

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.120
they they listened and they heard a
thing going like that and it was going

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.130
thing going like that and it was going
 

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.280
thing going like that and it was going
in about 17 times a second that's the

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:29.290
in about 17 times a second that's the
 

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.829
in about 17 times a second that's the
pulsar and these are neutron stars stars

00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839
pulsar and these are neutron stars stars
 

00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:34.199
pulsar and these are neutron stars stars
made completely of neutrons and they are

00:12:34.199 --> 00:12:34.209
made completely of neutrons and they are
 

00:12:34.209 --> 00:12:35.850
made completely of neutrons and they are
but they have the mass of the Sun and

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:35.860
but they have the mass of the Sun and
 

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.129
but they have the mass of the Sun and
they're about the size of Stockholm it's

00:12:38.129 --> 00:12:38.139
they're about the size of Stockholm it's
 

00:12:38.139 --> 00:12:41.610
they're about the size of Stockholm it's
really unbelievably dense thing and what

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:41.620
really unbelievably dense thing and what
 

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.860
really unbelievably dense thing and what
they heard is the pulse is coming from

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:43.870
they heard is the pulse is coming from
 

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.780
they heard is the pulse is coming from
that but they weren't going at a regular

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:45.790
that but they weren't going at a regular
 

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.420
that but they weren't going at a regular
rate sometimes I'm going a little faster

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:48.430
rate sometimes I'm going a little faster
 

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.100
rate sometimes I'm going a little faster
sometimes they're going a little slower

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:50.110
sometimes they're going a little slower
 

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.410
sometimes they're going a little slower
and it turns out when they map this they

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:52.420
and it turns out when they map this they
 

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.900
and it turns out when they map this they
kept looking at it they found that for

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:54.910
kept looking at it they found that for
 

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.819
kept looking at it they found that for
about four hours and this is the model

00:12:56.819 --> 00:12:56.829
about four hours and this is the model
 

00:12:56.829 --> 00:12:58.769
about four hours and this is the model
of it it turns out it turns out to be a

00:12:58.769 --> 00:12:58.779
of it it turns out it turns out to be a
 

00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:00.870
of it it turns out it turns out to be a
pair of neutron stars and they're going

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880
pair of neutron stars and they're going
 

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.420
pair of neutron stars and they're going
around each other and when this pulsar

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:03.430
around each other and when this pulsar
 

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.249
around each other and when this pulsar
which is sending its pulses to the radio

00:13:05.249 --> 00:13:05.259
which is sending its pulses to the radio

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.879
telescope is moving toward the earth
which is over here it goes a little

00:13:08.879 --> 00:13:08.889
which is over here it goes a little
 

00:13:08.889 --> 00:13:11.460
which is over here it goes a little
faster from the Doppler effect and when

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:11.470
faster from the Doppler effect and when
 

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.199
faster from the Doppler effect and when
it's moving away from the earth it goes

00:13:13.199 --> 00:13:13.209
it's moving away from the earth it goes
 

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:14.999
it's moving away from the earth it goes
a little slower and that's what we saw

00:13:14.999 --> 00:13:15.009
a little slower and that's what we saw
 

00:13:15.009 --> 00:13:17.519
a little slower and that's what we saw
and they map that and they watched it

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:17.529
and they map that and they watched it
 

00:13:17.529 --> 00:13:20.220
and they map that and they watched it
through many many years this is time

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:20.230
through many many years this is time
 

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.189
through many many years this is time
over here and they saw in 1973 and they

over here and they saw in 1973 and they
 

00:13:23.199 --> 00:13:25.949
over here and they saw in 1973 and they
kept watching it and what they noticed

00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:25.959
kept watching it and what they noticed
 

00:13:25.959 --> 00:13:28.230
kept watching it and what they noticed
is all sorts of all the wonderful tests

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240
is all sorts of all the wonderful tests
 

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.329
is all sorts of all the wonderful tests
and general relativity were done by that

00:13:30.329 --> 00:13:30.339
and general relativity were done by that
 

00:13:30.339 --> 00:13:32.610
and general relativity were done by that
system but the one that was most telling

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:32.620
system but the one that was most telling
 

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.980
system but the one that was most telling
and most interesting for us today is

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:34.990
and most interesting for us today is
 

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.259
and most interesting for us today is

correction that Einstein made of how
that system should lose energy due to

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:06.130
that system should lose energy due to
 

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.430
that system should lose energy due to
gravitational weight

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440
gravitational weight
 

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.910
gravitational weight
so that was the very first indirect

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920
so that was the very first indirect
 

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.769
so that was the very first indirect
measurement but the first measurement of

00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:12.779
measurement but the first measurement of
 

00:14:12.779 --> 00:14:15.499
measurement but the first measurement of

thing and it won a Nobel Prize okay so

00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:18.839
thing and it won a Nobel Prize okay so
 

00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:21.259
thing and it won a Nobel Prize okay so
then the next thing that happened and

00:14:21.259 --> 00:14:21.269
then the next thing that happened and
 

00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:23.960
then the next thing that happened and
this is again it happened because of

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:23.970
this is again it happened because of
 

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.019
this is again it happened because of
technology changes and what happened

00:14:27.019 --> 00:14:27.029
technology changes and what happened
 

00:14:27.029 --> 00:14:29.179
technology changes and what happened
people began to have the fact that you

00:14:29.179 --> 00:14:29.189
people began to have the fact that you
 

00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:31.670
people began to have the fact that you
could think of these very small strains

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680
could think of these very small strains
 

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.309
could think of these very small strains
and you now had equipment as the

00:14:34.309 --> 00:14:34.319
and you now had equipment as the
 

00:14:34.319 --> 00:14:36.350
and you now had equipment as the
technology change where you could think

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360
technology change where you could think
 

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.389
technology change where you could think
of making a measurement and the first

00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399
of making a measurement and the first
 

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:40.429
of making a measurement and the first
person who actually thought of that was

00:14:40.429 --> 00:14:40.439
person who actually thought of that was
 

00:14:40.439 --> 00:14:42.439
person who actually thought of that was

in a golf course in Maryland also and
 

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.790
in a golf course in Maryland also and
they saw he saw coincident pulses and in

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800
they saw he saw coincident pulses and in
 

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.610
they saw he saw coincident pulses and in
1969 he published the paper which said

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:55.620
1969 he published the paper which said
 

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.139
1969 he published the paper which said
he had discovered gravitational waves

he had discovered gravitational waves
 

00:15:57.149 --> 00:15:59.929
he had discovered gravitational waves
and it turns out that many many other

00:15:59.929 --> 00:15:59.939
and it turns out that many many other
 

00:15:59.939 --> 00:16:02.840
and it turns out that many many other
people became interested in doing that

people became interested in doing that
 

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.939
people became interested in doing that
and science that's what always happens a

00:16:04.939 --> 00:16:04.949
and science that's what always happens a
 

00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:07.249
and science that's what always happens a
stunning result like this can be tested

00:16:07.249 --> 00:16:07.259
stunning result like this can be tested
 

00:16:07.259 --> 00:16:10.160
stunning result like this can be tested
by everybody else and to his misfortune

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:10.170
by everybody else and to his misfortune

nobody else saw these waves nobody else
saw these pulses and now we know why

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180
saw these pulses and now we know why
 

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.420
saw these pulses and now we know why
people didn't see the pulses the

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:17.430
people didn't see the pulses the
 

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.009
people didn't see the pulses the
strength will fall and this is something

00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:19.019
strength will fall and this is something
 

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:20.180
strength will fall and this is something
useful to remember

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:20.190
useful to remember
 

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:22.670
useful to remember
the strength that you need and he was

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680
the strength that you need and he was
 

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.200
the strength that you need and he was
able to measure with these things a

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:24.210
able to measure with these things a
 

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:28.370
able to measure with these things a

orders of magnitude bigger than what
 

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:35.660
orders of magnitude bigger than what
ultimately you needed okay I'm sorry

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:35.670
ultimately you needed okay I'm sorry
 

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:36.290
ultimately you needed okay I'm sorry
okay

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300
okay
 

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.750
okay
I didn't realize that was happening so

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:38.760
I didn't realize that was happening so
 

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.610
I didn't realize that was happening so
what happened is people began to think

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620
what happened is people began to think
 

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.800
what happened is people began to think
of other methods of doing this and one

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:42.810
of other methods of doing this and one
 

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.320
of other methods of doing this and one
method of doing it I'll describe here is

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:45.330
method of doing it I'll describe here is
 

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:49.010
method of doing it I'll describe here is
not with a bar but rather with a thing

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:49.020
not with a bar but rather with a thing
 

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.170
not with a bar but rather with a thing
which you really in the end was more

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:51.180
which you really in the end was more
 

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.700
which you really in the end was more
successful in making the real

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:52.710
successful in making the real
 

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.640
successful in making the real
measurements and that is to look at

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:54.650
measurements and that is to look at
 

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.740
measurements and that is to look at
three masses but like that picture of

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:57.750
three masses but like that picture of
 

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.020
three masses but like that picture of
the gravitational wave a mass over here

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:00.030
the gravitational wave a mass over here
 

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.000
the gravitational wave a mass over here
and you put another mass over there a

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.010
and you put another mass over there a
 

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.880
and you put another mass over there a
goodly distance away and you take and

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:04.890
goodly distance away and you take and
 

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.130
goodly distance away and you take and
measure the time it takes you want to

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:07.140
measure the time it takes you want to
 

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:11.059
measure the time it takes you want to
measure their separation as changing as

00:17:11.059 --> 00:17:11.069
measure their separation as changing as
 

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:12.980
measure their separation as changing as
the gravitational wave comes by that

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:12.990
the gravitational wave comes by that
 

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.780
the gravitational wave comes by that
same picture of all those dots that I

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:14.790
same picture of all those dots that I
 

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.510
same picture of all those dots that I
showed you and so the idea is really

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520
showed you and so the idea is really
 

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.380
showed you and so the idea is really
simple you take and have a light send

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:21.390
simple you take and have a light send
 

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:23.900
simple you take and have a light send
that and put a clock on those month put

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:23.910
that and put a clock on those month put
 

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.630
that and put a clock on those month put
clocks on the masses or we actually

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640
clocks on the masses or we actually
 

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.700
clocks on the masses or we actually
let's start that way clock here clock

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:28.710
let's start that way clock here clock
 

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.440
let's start that way clock here clock
there on those masses send light

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:30.450
there on those masses send light
 

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.450
there on those masses send light
measured the moment when the light left

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460
measured the moment when the light left
 

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.670
measured the moment when the light left
this mass and find out with another

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:34.680
this mass and find out with another
 

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.470
this mass and find out with another
clock over here the time when it hits

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480
clock over here the time when it hits
 

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.060
clock over here the time when it hits
that mass that's the way of measuring

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:38.070
that mass that's the way of measuring
 

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.130
that mass that's the way of measuring
the distance between those two masses

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140
the distance between those two masses
 

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.100
the distance between those two masses
and then let the thing unfold and as a

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:43.110
and then let the thing unfold and as a
 

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.870
and then let the thing unfold and as a
gravitational wave comes along it'll

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880
gravitational wave comes along it'll
 

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.420
gravitational wave comes along it'll
change that time because it's changing

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:47.430
change that time because it's changing
 

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:49.670
change that time because it's changing
that distance it's as simple as that now

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:49.680
that distance it's as simple as that now
 

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.460
that distance it's as simple as that now
if you here's the idea and this is a way

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:52.470
if you here's the idea and this is a way
 

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.400
if you here's the idea and this is a way
which a key almost works and you don't

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:55.410
which a key almost works and you don't
 

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.340
which a key almost works and you don't
you here you have a laser and the beam

00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:58.350
you here you have a laser and the beam
 

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.840
you here you have a laser and the beam
splitter which is a device that splits

00:17:59.840 --> 00:17:59.850
splitter which is a device that splits
 

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.420
splitter which is a device that splits
the light and that's as in the picture I

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:02.430
the light and that's as in the picture I
 

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.040
the light and that's as in the picture I
showed you that would be the red square

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:04.050
showed you that would be the red square
 

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.830
showed you that would be the red square
that I showed you here is a distant mass

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840
that I showed you here is a distant mass
 

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.750
that I showed you here is a distant mass
and that's a mirror and there's another

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760
and that's a mirror and there's another
 

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.920
and that's a mirror and there's another
distant mass and remember the

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:09.930
distant mass and remember the
 

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.170
distant mass and remember the
gravitational wave is coming down and

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:12.180
gravitational wave is coming down and
 

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.910
gravitational wave is coming down and
what it'll do is it'll stretch one of

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:13.920
what it'll do is it'll stretch one of
 

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.490
what it'll do is it'll stretch one of
these and compress this and it will flip

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500
these and compress this and it will flip
 

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.560
these and compress this and it will flip
then this one will stretch and that one

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:18.570
then this one will stretch and that one
 

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.480
then this one will stretch and that one
will compress and here is the way you

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:20.490
will compress and here is the way you
 

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.070
will compress and here is the way you
make that measurement which is

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080
make that measurement which is
 

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.250
make that measurement which is
effectively timing light so with us but

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:25.260
effectively timing light so with us but
 

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.080
effectively timing light so with us but
I'll describe as it goes along where

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:27.090
I'll describe as it goes along where
 

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:29.510
I'll describe as it goes along where
it's red is light and we're thinking of

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520
it's red is light and we're thinking of
 

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.070
it's red is light and we're thinking of
red lasers when they made this picture

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080
red lasers when they made this picture
 

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.490
red lasers when they made this picture
but what you see is the waves these

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:33.500
but what you see is the waves these
 

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.190
but what you see is the waves these
actual waves inside the power of the

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200
actual waves inside the power of the
 

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.810
actual waves inside the power of the
light and where it's red is where

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:37.820
light and where it's red is where
 

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.370
light and where it's red is where
there's light if you do it right and

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:39.380
there's light if you do it right and
 

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.140
there's light if you do it right and
make the time here equal to the time of

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:41.150
make the time here equal to the time of
 

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.750
make the time here equal to the time of
light there you get no light going to

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760
light there you get no light going to
 

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.550
light there you get no light going to
the photo detector that's the idea and

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:45.560
the photo detector that's the idea and
 

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.590
the photo detector that's the idea and
so if you will show that's for the

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600
so if you will show that's for the
 

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.000
so if you will show that's for the
photos it's like now when you move these

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:49.010
photos it's like now when you move these
 

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.610
photos it's like now when you move these
masses one out the other one in you'll

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:51.620
masses one out the other one in you'll
 

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.740
masses one out the other one in you'll
see that there is light when the motion

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:53.750
see that there is light when the motion
 

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.900
see that there is light when the motion
makes it so the path links are no longer

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:55.910
makes it so the path links are no longer
 

00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:00.730
makes it so the path links are no longer
equal and that is in fact the basis for

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:00.740
equal and that is in fact the basis for
 

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.220
equal and that is in fact the basis for
the entire experiment because it's no

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:03.230
the entire experiment because it's no
 

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.540
the entire experiment because it's no
more complicated than that

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:04.550
more complicated than that
 

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.610
more complicated than that
the big problem comes you have to do it

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:06.620
the big problem comes you have to do it
 

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:15.580
the big problem comes you have to do it
extremely well and here is how well kick

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:15.590
extremely well and here is how well kick
 

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.510
extremely well and here is how well kick
comes on the scene I met Kip in 1975

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:18.520
comes on the scene I met Kip in 1975
 

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:24.100
comes on the scene I met Kip in 1975
when he and I met in Washington DC he

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:24.110
when he and I met in Washington DC he
 

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.600
when he and I met in Washington DC he
was thinking at that time he was giving

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:25.610
was thinking at that time he was giving
 

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.480
was thinking at that time he was giving
testimony to a committee and he and I

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:28.490
testimony to a committee and he and I
 

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.430
testimony to a committee and he and I
spent the night talking about what kind

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:30.440
spent the night talking about what kind
 

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.200
spent the night talking about what kind
of experiments are interesting to do and

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:32.210
of experiments are interesting to do and
 

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.990
of experiments are interesting to do and
he was at that time had already the most

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.000
he was at that time had already the most
 

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.730
he was at that time had already the most
successful group I think in the country

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:36.740
successful group I think in the country
 

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.700
successful group I think in the country
doing theoretical gravitation and he was

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:39.710
doing theoretical gravitation and he was
 

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:42.370
doing theoretical gravitation and he was
hoping to start a group at Caltech start

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:42.380
hoping to start a group at Caltech start
 

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.280
hoping to start a group at Caltech start
a group in in in experimental work and

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:45.290
a group in in in experimental work and
 

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.950
a group in in in experimental work and
what we came on is that Kip at that

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960
what we came on is that Kip at that
 

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.840
what we came on is that Kip at that
meeting he you know I talked about that

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:49.850
meeting he you know I talked about that
 

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.640
meeting he you know I talked about that
ultimately there's this technique that

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:51.650
ultimately there's this technique that
 

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.500
ultimately there's this technique that
we were just talking about here would be

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:53.510
we were just talking about here would be
 

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.540
we were just talking about here would be
a good thing for Caltech to work on and

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:55.550
a good thing for Caltech to work on and
 

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.390
a good thing for Caltech to work on and
but he told us something then already

00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400
but he told us something then already
 

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.970
but he told us something then already
that you couldn't just do it in this

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:00.980
that you couldn't just do it in this
 

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.150
that you couldn't just do it in this
haphazard way that was it had to be done

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:04.160
haphazard way that was it had to be done
 

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.250
haphazard way that was it had to be done
and he was one of the first to tell us

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:06.260
and he was one of the first to tell us
 

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.410
and he was one of the first to tell us
that if you want to get in the business

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:08.420
that if you want to get in the business
 

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.900
that if you want to get in the business
you had to measure H's or these strains

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:10.910
you had to measure H's or these strains
 

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:12.910
you had to measure H's or these strains
Delta changes in length divided by the

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:12.920
Delta changes in length divided by the
 

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.120
Delta changes in length divided by the
length of 10 to the minus 21 I think

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:16.130
length of 10 to the minus 21 I think
 

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.250
length of 10 to the minus 21 I think
this is Kip about that time he'll tell

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:18.260
this is Kip about that time he'll tell
 

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.230
this is Kip about that time he'll tell
us if I'm wrong yeah he's good he's

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240
us if I'm wrong yeah he's good he's
 

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.680
us if I'm wrong yeah he's good he's
agreeing okay and big thing is that if

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:23.690
agreeing okay and big thing is that if
 

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.060
agreeing okay and big thing is that if
you make something and now we're getting

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:25.070
you make something and now we're getting
 

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.250
you make something and now we're getting
on mixing times but that's too bad

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:27.260
on mixing times but that's too bad
 

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.230
on mixing times but that's too bad
suppose if you go to something as long

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240
suppose if you go to something as long
 

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.840
suppose if you go to something as long
as four kilometers you then and you do

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:31.850
as four kilometers you then and you do
 

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.040
as four kilometers you then and you do
the a little bit of arithmetic that's

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.050
the a little bit of arithmetic that's
 

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.930
the a little bit of arithmetic that's
associated with that you find out that

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:34.940
associated with that you find out that
 

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.000
associated with that you find out that
you have to measure distances at the

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.010
you have to measure distances at the
 

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.700
you have to measure distances at the
ends that motion of 10 to the minus 18

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:39.710
ends that motion of 10 to the minus 18
 

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.770
ends that motion of 10 to the minus 18
meters that's something like a

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:41.780
meters that's something like a
 

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.169
meters that's something like a
thousandth the size of a nucleus of an

if you want to use light to do this but
then you had another problem which an

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:10.370
then you had another problem which an
 

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.010
then you had another problem which an
nhien turned out to be much harder than

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:12.020
nhien turned out to be much harder than
 

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.190

you're looking at I'm not going to be
 

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.180
you're looking at I'm not going to be
standing still well they're gonna be

being jiggled around by the ground by

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:32.900
being jiggled around by the ground by
 

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.270
being jiggled around by the ground by
about one micron

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:34.280
about one micron
 

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.630
about one micron
at least a few microns so 10 minus 6 so

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640
at least a few microns so 10 minus 6 so
 

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.190
at least a few microns so 10 minus 6 so
he got another factor of a million times

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200
he got another factor of a million times
 

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.740
he got another factor of a million times
a million and that one was a really hard

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:41.750
a million and that one was a really hard
 

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:46.240
a million and that one was a really hard
one and so here is the things that went

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:46.250
one and so here is the things that went
 

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.610
one and so here is the things that went
on and now the rest of this is really

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:48.620
on and now the rest of this is really
 

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.220
on and now the rest of this is really

from gravitational waves and he showed

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:25.130
from gravitational waves and he showed
 

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.370
from gravitational waves and he showed
us that there was an invariant way

used lasers you couldn't use just one a

00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:58.430
used lasers you couldn't use just one a
 

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.250

very weak light source
the other thing you needed to is you're

00:23:01.629 --> 00:23:01.639
the other thing you needed to is you're
 

00:23:01.639 --> 00:23:02.980
the other thing you needed to is you're
somehow allowed to make the light go

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:02.990
somehow allowed to make the light go
 

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:04.810
somehow allowed to make the light go
more than once back and forth you have

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:04.820
more than once back and forth you have
 

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.700
more than once back and forth you have
to bounce the light back and forth and

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:06.710
to bounce the light back and forth and
 

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.259
to bounce the light back and forth and
you had to do tricks to get around the

00:23:08.259 --> 00:23:08.269
you had to do tricks to get around the
 

00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:09.700
you had to do tricks to get around the
noise and there were tricks you have to

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:09.710
noise and there were tricks you have to
 

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:11.379
noise and there were tricks you have to
modulate the light you have to use all

00:23:11.379 --> 00:23:11.389
modulate the light you have to use all
 

00:23:11.389 --> 00:23:13.570
modulate the light you have to use all
the cunning tricks yeah and the other

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:13.580
the cunning tricks yeah and the other
 

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.919
the cunning tricks yeah and the other
thing you had to do is you couldn't put

00:23:14.919 --> 00:23:14.929
thing you had to do is you couldn't put
 

00:23:14.929 --> 00:23:16.750
thing you had to do is you couldn't put
the masses right on the ground

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760
the masses right on the ground
 

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.940
the masses right on the ground
you had to somehow float them so the

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:18.950
you had to somehow float them so the
 

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.519
you had to somehow float them so the
ground and motion would not make a

00:23:21.519 --> 00:23:21.529
ground and motion would not make a
 

00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:23.289
ground and motion would not make a
single so large that you couldn't see

tricks were tried in this prototype but

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:27.950
tricks were tried in this prototype but

then there was another group so they

00:25:02.799 --> 00:25:02.809
then there was another group so they

then there was another group so they
were what what did they do we will talk

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:04.460
were what what did they do we will talk
 

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.680
were what what did they do we will talk
about a little more but they built a

the people in MIT did and they showed
 

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:12.279

that a lot of the ideas were right they
 

00:25:12.289 --> 00:25:13.960
that a lot of the ideas were right they
also showed that a lot of the things

beginning they invented a whole bunch of
 

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.230
beginning they invented a whole bunch of
new ideas also and that group is

00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240
new ideas also and that group is
 

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.299

that mirror does I will just describe
 

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:58.930
that mirror does I will just describe
what it does and I'll show you is it

00:28:58.930 --> 00:28:58.940
what it does and I'll show you is it

goes into your arm is not going to the

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:04.850
goes into your arm is not going to the
 

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:06.850
goes into your arm is not going to the
voter detector it would normally go back

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:06.860
voter detector it would normally go back
 

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.950
voter detector it would normally go back
to the laser but you make it so you've

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960
to the laser but you make it so you've
 

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.990
to the laser but you make it so you've
bounced it back into the end of the

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.000
bounced it back into the end of the
 

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.970
bounced it back into the end of the
interferometer and build up the light

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:12.980
interferometer and build up the light
 

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:15.100
interferometer and build up the light
inside the interferometer for that

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:15.110
inside the interferometer for that
 

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:17.380
inside the interferometer for that
reason and that makes it as though you

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:17.390
reason and that makes it as though you
 

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:19.120
reason and that makes it as though you
had a very much more powerful laser a

had a very much more powerful laser a
 

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:23.530
had a very much more powerful laser a
very clever idea then here's Brian Mears

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:23.540
very clever idea then here's Brian Mears
 

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.830
very clever idea then here's Brian Mears
idea and that is that you've put another

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:26.840
idea and that is that you've put another
 

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.270
idea and that is that you've put another
mirror which is not this is not

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:28.280
mirror which is not this is not
 

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.340
mirror which is not this is not
immediately something that everybody can

immediately something that everybody can
capture because you need to know a lot

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:31.940
capture because you need to know a lot
 

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.150

more than I told you why this works so

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:34.160
more than I told you why this works so
 

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.670
more than I told you why this works so
well but what does it do by putting a

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:36.680
well but what does it do by putting a
 

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.530
well but what does it do by putting a
mirror between the detector and the beam

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:38.540
mirror between the detector and the beam
 

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.960
mirror between the detector and the beam
splitter it makes it so you can tailor

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:40.970
splitter it makes it so you can tailor
 

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:43.720
splitter it makes it so you can tailor
the response of the interferometer you

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:43.730
the response of the interferometer you
 

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.000
the response of the interferometer you
can make it have different shapes make

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:46.010
can make it have different shapes make
 

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:47.530
can make it have different shapes make
it have so that it's more sensitive at

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:47.540
it have so that it's more sensitive at
 

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.300
it have so that it's more sensitive at
certain frequencies and stuff like that

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:49.310
certain frequencies and stuff like that
 

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:51.340
certain frequencies and stuff like that
and that's called this is called a power

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:51.350
and that's called this is called a power
 

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.170
and that's called this is called a power
recycling mirror and that's called a

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:53.180
recycling mirror and that's called a
 

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.330
recycling mirror and that's called a
signal recycling mirror and that's an

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:55.340
signal recycling mirror and that's an
 

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.730
signal recycling mirror and that's an
important part of advanced LIGO so this

00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:57.740
important part of advanced LIGO so this
 

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:03.180
important part of advanced LIGO so this
is the advanced LIGO detector okay now

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:03.190
is the advanced LIGO detector okay now
 

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:06.190
is the advanced LIGO detector okay now
that's the technology other of the how

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:06.200
that's the technology other of the how
 

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.800
that's the technology other of the how
do you make the light get that factor of

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:08.810
do you make the light get that factor of
 

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:10.810
do you make the light get that factor of
10 to the 12 we're not quite done with

let's talk about how you build build up

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:17.690
let's talk about how you build build up
 

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:20.170
let's talk about how you build build up
and begin to build up the idea that you

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:20.180
and begin to build up the idea that you
 

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.450
and begin to build up the idea that you
don't want to do just prototypes you

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:22.460
don't want to do just prototypes you
 

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:23.920
don't want to do just prototypes you
would like to actually build a detector

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:23.930
would like to actually build a detector
 

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:30.930
would like to actually build a detector
and that happened in about 1988 II know

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:30.940
 
 

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:35.080
 
that we began to think hard about how

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:35.090
that we began to think hard about how
 

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:38.170
that we began to think hard about how
might how expensive how might you build

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:38.180
might how expensive how might you build
 

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.910
might how expensive how might you build
a system that actually could detect

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:39.920
a system that actually could detect
 

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.400
a system that actually could detect
something we were driven to that for

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:42.410
something we were driven to that for
 

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.290
something we were driven to that for
many many reasons it was hard for

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:44.300
many many reasons it was hard for
 

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.870
many many reasons it was hard for
students to at least at MIT to keep

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880
students to at least at MIT to keep
 

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.310
students to at least at MIT to keep
working on something which didn't have a

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320
working on something which didn't have a
 

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.170
working on something which didn't have a
physics result had had only an

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:50.180
physics result had had only an
 

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.180
physics result had had only an
engineering result and I don't know it

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:52.190
engineering result and I don't know it
 

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:53.590
engineering result and I don't know it
Caltech it was different they had a

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600
Caltech it was different they had a
 

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.420
Caltech it was different they had a
different attitude about this but the

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:55.430
different attitude about this but the
 

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:58.030
different attitude about this but the
thing is that what we began to think

00:30:58.030 --> 00:30:58.040
thing is that what we began to think
 

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.390
thing is that what we began to think
about is really we asked the NSF if we

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:01.400
about is really we asked the NSF if we
 

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.430
about is really we asked the NSF if we
could do and we were also encouraged by

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440
could do and we were also encouraged by
 

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.960
could do and we were also encouraged by
the NSF and we'll get to that at the

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:04.970
the NSF and we'll get to that at the
 

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:08.470
the NSF and we'll get to that at the
very end to make an industrial study

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480
very end to make an industrial study
 

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.290
very end to make an industrial study
with industry to find out where could

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:11.300
with industry to find out where could
 

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.520
with industry to find out where could
you place a thing that was big enough

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:12.530
you place a thing that was big enough
 

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:15.400
you place a thing that was big enough
and we thought of five kilometer ha arms

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:15.410

it might build this and costed it
properly and what happened is that that

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:57.680
by people you have the ground shaking
and that's fine but when the ground

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:57.690
and that's fine but when the ground
 

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:00.230
and that's fine but when the ground
shakes there's another piece associated

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240
shakes there's another piece associated
 

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.570

ground like that and as the compression
 

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.150
ground like that and as the compression
goes by this it's a little higher

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160
goes by this it's a little higher
 

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.030

the density changes in the ground make a
 

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.670
the density changes in the ground make a
change in the force on the mirror and we

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680
change in the force on the mirror and we
 

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.860
change in the force on the mirror and we

these noise-canceling headphones I'm
 

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:17.480
these noise-canceling headphones I'm
sure that people here yeah okay it's the

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:17.490
sure that people here yeah okay it's the
 

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:19.550
sure that people here yeah okay it's the
same principle what you do is you put a

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560
same principle what you do is you put a
 

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:22.070
same principle what you do is you put a
very sensitive seismometer on a platform

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:22.080
very sensitive seismometer on a platform
 

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.170
very sensitive seismometer on a platform
and measure the motion of the platform

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:24.180
and measure the motion of the platform
 

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:27.020
and measure the motion of the platform
and then what you do is you push on that

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:27.030
and then what you do is you push on that
 

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.690
and then what you do is you push on that
platform to get rid of the signal in a

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:29.700
platform to get rid of the signal in a
 

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.090
platform to get rid of the signal in a
seismometer that's the same thing you do

don't hear the outside world you only
 

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:44.420
don't hear the outside world you only
hear the music that's on the other part

hear the music that's on the other part
 

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:45.710
hear the music that's on the other part
of the headphone that's how that works

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:18.930
showed a thing that was very
 

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:20.780
showed a thing that was very
controversial at the time that

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:20.790
controversial at the time that
 

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.730
controversial at the time that
gravitational waves actually carried

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:22.740
gravitational waves actually carried
 

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.920
gravitational waves actually carried
energy away from a source that was

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:24.930
energy away from a source that was
 

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:27.110
energy away from a source that was
heavily debated a lot of people thought

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:27.120
heavily debated a lot of people thought
 

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.910
heavily debated a lot of people thought
it was just a coordinate problem but he

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920
it was just a coordinate problem but he
 

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.160
it was just a coordinate problem but he
showed there was actually energy leaving

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:31.170
showed there was actually energy leaving
 

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:34.340
showed there was actually energy leaving
a gravitational wave source and here is

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:34.350
a gravitational wave source and here is
 

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:37.190
a gravitational wave source and here is
and what he did he became the discipline

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200
and what he did he became the discipline
 

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.950
and what he did he became the discipline
chief for gravity at the NSF and he

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960
chief for gravity at the NSF and he
 

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.200
chief for gravity at the NSF and he
convinced his boss Margera Marcel Barden

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:42.210
convinced his boss Margera Marcel Barden
 

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:44.390
convinced his boss Margera Marcel Barden
at this crazy idea that we all had

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400
at this crazy idea that we all had
 

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:47.150
at this crazy idea that we all had
really had merit and he did it at a time

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160
really had merit and he did it at a time
 

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.120
really had merit and he did it at a time
when it was not so easy to do that we

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:50.130
when it was not so easy to do that we
 

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:51.890
when it was not so easy to do that we
didn't have the technology in hand and

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:51.900
didn't have the technology in hand and
 

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.720
didn't have the technology in hand and
we didn't know what sources were gonna

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:53.730
we didn't know what sources were gonna
 

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:56.960
we didn't know what sources were gonna
see and he had to sell this idea to his

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:56.970
see and he had to sell this idea to his
 

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:59.180
see and he had to sell this idea to his
boss and he did a magnificent job of it

00:41:59.180 --> 00:41:59.190
boss and he did a magnificent job of it
 

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:01.720
boss and he did a magnificent job of it
then he sold the whole agency on this

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:01.730
then he sold the whole agency on this
 

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:05.150
then he sold the whole agency on this
okay and that's something which is

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160
okay and that's something which is
 

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.640
okay and that's something which is
spectacular without him this would not

have worked and these are some of the

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:10.110
have worked and these are some of the
 

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:12.980
have worked and these are some of the
people who were influenced by that and I

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:12.990
people who were influenced by that and I
 

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:14.300
people who were influenced by that and I
want to say something special about

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:14.310
want to say something special about
 

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:16.820

these are directors of the NSF which

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:16.830
these are directors of the NSF which
 

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:20.060
these are directors of the NSF which
were critical to our development rich

Isaacson was actually deeply mixed up

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.140
Isaacson was actually deeply mixed up

Isaacson was actually deeply mixed up
with Eric block with his boss and Eric

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:24.540
with Eric block with his boss and Eric
 

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.590
with Eric block with his boss and Eric
block was an engineer and and I the same

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:27.600
block was an engineer and and I the same
 

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.240
block was an engineer and and I the same
thing happened at MIT the engineers were

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:29.250
thing happened at MIT the engineers were
 

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:31.520
thing happened at MIT the engineers were
the first to recognize and then at MIT

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:31.530
the first to recognize and then at MIT
 

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:33.260

that this might have some value the

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:33.270
that this might have some value the
 

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:35.120
that this might have some value the
electrical engineers around me it wasn't

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:35.130
electrical engineers around me it wasn't
 

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:38.390
electrical engineers around me it wasn't
so much the physicist and so he had the

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400
so much the physicist and so he had the
 

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.430
so much the physicist and so he had the
idea that this was exactly the right

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440
idea that this was exactly the right
 

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.890
idea that this was exactly the right
thing for the NSF to get into something

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:42.900
thing for the NSF to get into something
 

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:45.440

very risky but had a tremendous payoff

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:45.450
very risky but had a tremendous payoff
 

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:48.560
very risky but had a tremendous payoff
and so Eric block pushed it and then

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:48.570
and so Eric block pushed it and then
 

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:50.240
and so Eric block pushed it and then
when things really began to happen and

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:50.250
when things really began to happen and
 

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:52.190
when things really began to happen and
there were people who didn't like the

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200
there were people who didn't like the
 

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.440
there were people who didn't like the
idea that LIGO was beginning to use

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:54.450
idea that LIGO was beginning to use
 

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:56.750
idea that LIGO was beginning to use
money from the NSF there were people in

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760
money from the NSF there were people in
 

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.310
money from the NSF there were people in
the Astronomy community that actually

00:42:58.310 --> 00:42:58.320
the Astronomy community that actually
 

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.170
the Astronomy community that actually
resisted it you can read the newspapers

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:00.180
resisted it you can read the newspapers
 

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.670

and Walter Massey who was head at that
 

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:06.350
and Walter Massey who was head at that
time a little later actually told these

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:06.360
time a little later actually told these
 

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.690

we're gonna do this because it's the

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:10.620
we're gonna do this because it's the
 

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.140
we're gonna do this because it's the
right thing for the country it's the

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:12.150
right thing for the country it's the
 

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:14.600
right thing for the country it's the
right thing for the NSF and it was quite

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:14.610
right thing for the NSF and it was quite
 

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:17.480
right thing for the NSF and it was quite
a subtle and he was a magnificent person

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:17.490
a subtle and he was a magnificent person
 

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:19.700

for doing that and then to make it all

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:19.710
for doing that and then to make it all
 

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:22.280
for doing that and then to make it all
happen to the head of the NSF at that

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:22.290
happen to the head of the NSF at that
 

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:25.160
happen to the head of the NSF at that
time and this is in Barry's it was Neil
