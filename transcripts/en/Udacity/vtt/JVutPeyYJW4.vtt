00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.830
As it is right now, we're actually giving you a pretty cool tool in the resume.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.330
If you want to make a map appear at the bottom, it's actually real easy.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.200
Let's scroll down and take a look at it.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.230
We can see this great Where I've Lived and Worked map.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.860
Here we can see place markers for all the places where James has worked.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.940
To add this to your resume, it's actually pretty simple.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.980
I'm going to open up dev tools again in the sources pane, and

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.333
I've added this line to my resume builder.js.

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:30.440
I've added mapdiv.appendgoogleMap.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.710
Inside helperjs, we've got some functions set up that make it really easy for

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.120
you to add a map that automatically puts place markers where you've

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.730
lived and work.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.999
Add this to your code and see what happens.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.704
The functions in helperjs are using the JSONS created in resumebuilder.js.

00:00:46.704 --> 00:00:50.100
It iterates through the locations, it rooms google searches on

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.060
all those locations, and then uses the results to put pins on the map.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.800
It's pretty awesome and

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.060
there's actually going to be a quiz in the practice problem section after this

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.080
lecture, where you'll be able to break it apart to see how it works.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.690
&gt;&gt; But beyond a Google Map, you have tons of options for

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.040
making your resume interesting and interactive.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.590
For starters, try editing the resume's CSS to style it the way that you want.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.610
If you're unfamiliar with CSS, check out our course on HTML and CSS.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.030
It's in the instructor's notes.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.240
&gt;&gt; Or you could even use a library like D3 to add a chart that

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.669
helps people visualize your skills.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.050
&gt;&gt; I like that one.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.320
It's worth poking around D3 to check out the really cool charts, graphs, and

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.740
visualizations you can easily add to your resume.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.370
&gt;&gt; And while you're at it, check out the links in the Instructor's notes,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.480
to other cool resumes we found online.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.680
Get some inspiration and try customizing yours.
