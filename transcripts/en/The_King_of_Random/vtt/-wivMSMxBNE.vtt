00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.760
Hey, what's up guys

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.260
We Are Back

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:01.960
With A New Video

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.160
Now, in yesterday's experiment,

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.680
I tried turning ocean water into

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.800
Hydrogen and Chlorine Gas, and it was a fail,

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.300
and we found out that it's because I was using copper electrodes

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.640
That It Didn't Work, The Electrodes Need To Be Carbon Only

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.320
But I  Know That This Experiment Can Work  And I Don't Wanna Give Up Yet

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.160
Sometimes The Simplest Method Is The Best

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.480
So Today We're Gonna Modify This Setup A Little Bit

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.680
And See If We Can, In Fact, Extract Chlorine Gas

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.720
From Ocean Water

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.300
So This Thing Right Here Is The Modified System In A Nutshell

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.940
And You're Gonna See It's Very, Very Simple

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.060
All i Did Is Heat Up A Screwdriver With A Flame

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.840
Until It Get Hot Enough That I Can Poke

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.840
Two Holes In The Bottom Of This Plastic Container

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.760
Just Big Enough For The Carbon Rods

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.760
Once The Carbon Rods Are Pushed Most of The Way In

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.460
And I Mix A Batch Of Five Minute Epoxy

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.160
And I Put Liberal Amount Inside And Outside

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.960
Because We Need this Thing Completely Water Tight When It's Standing Upright

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.780
We're Gonna Keep Two Holes That We Made In The Container From Yesterdays Experiment

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.980
Now All We Have To Do Is Fill This Thing Backup With More Fresh Sea Water

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.900
And Attached Some Jumper-cables To The Bottom

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.520
And Let It Run

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.380
K Guys Update, Its The Moment Of Truth

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.340
I've Been Down Into The Ocean And I Got Some Fresh Ocean Water

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.840
 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.080
I Filled A Container, and I've Hooked it Up to My Car Battery

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.720
All Is Left Do Right Now Attached Red Jumper-Cable lead To The Battery Terminal

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.220
And See If This Thing Actually Works

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.000
Alright So Here We Go, Moment Of Truth Let's Make The Connection

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.980
Boom

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.980
Assuming Everything Is Connected Properly Here

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.980
we should be generating chlorine gas off of the left side

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.980
and hydrogen gas off of the right side

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.980
but, there's not a whole lot of voltage

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.980
or amperage so, we're just gonna have to

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.980
let this thing hang out and i'll probably

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.980
start the car and let the alternator pick up some of the load

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.980
(engine starts up)

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.880
(music)

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.880
alright, another update

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.880
I  have come out after about an hour, and i hadn't noticed much gas production

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.120
and I think that's because the necks of the bottles

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.120
were flat against the bottom

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.120
so there wasn't much way for electricity to flow

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.160
through the solution so i just used a couple

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.160
of rocks and i propped these bottles up a little bit

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
and then that allows the solution to conduct the electricity to conduct the electricity

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.160
a little bit quicker, and since then

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.400
my rate of production on these gasses have gone way up

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.400
and if we check this now, you can see

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.900
 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.140
that bottle is almost completely full of hydrogen

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.920
so now we got a full bottle of hydrogen, lets light it off

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.920
 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.920
yeah, its good test

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.640
so i built another contraption that will help us work with smaller quantites

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.080
a little bit faster

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.080
so this here, is a much, much simpler set up

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.740
you can see i'm only running carbon electrode through the side

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.400
into a much smaller bottle

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.540
and that's because the limiting factor here is the amount of salt

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.040
that's actually in our sea water

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.100
as the chlorine is extracted

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.260
it'll get collected in this bottle

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.900
so by using a smaller bottle

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.360
the concentration of chlorine that we end up with should be higher

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.360
smell this one over here and tell me what it smells like

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.300
smells like pool water

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.820
hot tub

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.620
a hot tub

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.200
it's been over three hours now

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.820
and you can see most of the solution has been pushed out of the bottle

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.520
displaced with the gas

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.520
this should be chlorine gas and looking at it

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.340
you can see its kinda got a brownish yellow tinge to it

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.600
so there's a good possibility that we do actually have chlorine

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.020
Boom

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.700
Finally 4 and a half hours of effort but we finally got it

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.960
so here we have a little soda bottle filled with chlorine gas

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.080
Chlorine is some awesome stuff because it can be used as a disinfectant for treating and sanitizing drinking water

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.440
but it is a very dangerous chemical, you dont want to breathe this stuff in, it can do some nasty damage to you

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.780
(Inhales)

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.720
If u look in side there u should be able to see a hazy yellowish brown cloud

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.720
And that appears to me to be chlorine

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.640
so i think we have done it

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.600
i don't have any use for chlorine gas right now

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.920
but i think its really cool that we can make if we need to

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.960
the thing that really blows my mind is that salt water is very tame

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.920
but if you pump a little electricity through it

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.920
you can make some pretty vicious chemicals

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.240
Whooo! Ugh ugh...

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.860
Wow, that's powerfull!

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.860
It stings the nose, stings the throat...

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.900
Burns the lungs, I think we got ourselves some good chlorine there guys!

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.320
Mark, my brother just arrived!

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.320
Here, take that buddy!

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.360
I just want you to sniff in that hole (xD) and tell me what you smell

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.480
Smells nice!

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.900
Smells like chlorine!

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.300
Smells clean?

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.240
Smells very clean, smells like a swimming pool!

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.380
Chlorine is 2x heavier than air, so if you hold on to that and if I take my hand of the top...

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.340
The chlorine should stay in the bottle.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.740
Now, if you want to very very carefully...

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.300
Smell in there...

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.060
Tell me if that's chlorine or not.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.500
WHOAAOW!

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.100
Oh that is VERY strong!

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.060
It burned my nostrils!

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.980
With a little sniff?

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.700
YEAH!

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.000
Oh my gosh that is strong!

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.200
Yeah it's crazy huh?

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.460
AAAAW!

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.740
YEAH!

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.860
That hurts!
