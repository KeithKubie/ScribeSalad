An object oriented analysis the above groupings that you've produced from

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.630
candidate classes. In object oriented analysis a class is a description of

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.079
a group of related objects, these objects are also sometimes called instances.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.100
We're going to use UML class model diagrams. And in those diagrams,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.225
classes are represented as rectangles, possible vertically partitioned into

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:34.530
sub-compartments. Thus, taking what you have, we can come up with some

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.990
initial class model diagram that has rectangles for counters and

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.660
leafs and piles and parts and trees. And in your case in your case node.
