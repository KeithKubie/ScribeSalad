00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.950
&gt;&gt; Diana Ingram: All right,
so we're going to get started.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.190
Welcome everyone, I'm Diana Ingram
I'm the Executive Director here

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.370
at Hill Center at the
Old Naval Hospital.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.970
And I just have to ask -- well
first of all, it's so lovely to see

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.030 position:56%
such a mixture of ages in folks, but
is there anyone who has never been

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.520
in this building before
would you raise your hand.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.230
Excellent, welcome.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.530
&gt;&gt; That's great.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.610
&gt;&gt; Diana Ingram: Come back.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.240
Take a look at the program
highlights that are on your chair,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.420
there's all kinds of
fabulous things happening.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.370
But the neatest thing
that's happened aside

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.350
from this event tonight next
Wednesday, the beautiful artwork

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.110
that you see that was just put

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.760
up we're having our opening
reception with the artist.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.870
So please come back 6
p.m. next Wednesday.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.970
We have sparking water
and wine and mixed nuts

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.870
and it's a fun time for all.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.550
Tonight take a moment to
turn off your mobile devices

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.030
if you would please.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.080
And it is a great pleasure to
welcome you to the 11th edition

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.470
of life of a poet, it's amazing.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.490
Featuring always effervescent
fabulous poets,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:36.020
but tonight Dunya Mikhail, the
enigmatic, effervescent poet

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.790
in residence and Ron Charles,
of course, who is, you know,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.480
such a fabulous raconteur.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.300
If you've missed any
of the previous life

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.620
of a poets conversations they are
up on our YouTube channel and also

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.840
on the Library of Congress'
website I believe.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.050
So it's a really fascinating
archive.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.930
The series is made possible
through the generous support

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.420
of National Capital Bank.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.770
So if you live on Capitol Hill

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.020
and don't bank there consider
banking there, we like them.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.630
And the format.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.550
Directly following the conversation
Dunya will sign books here.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.290
Yes, it's a slightly new format

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.980
because some people didn't
get their books signed

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.540
and they didn't get
to buy them, so here.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.890
Then everyone is invited
to adjourn to Bayou Bakery,

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.420
which is right, you
know, right there.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.290
And there's a 15% discount,
which you may not even need

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.290
to use tonight, so save the
15% discount and come back

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.100 position:56%
for another evening at Bayou Bakery.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.700
Okay, please join me in welcoming
Robert Casper, head of the Library

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.680
of Congress' Poetry
and Literature Center.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.120
He is also the program's director
for the Poetry Society of America.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.670
Casper served as membership
director for the Council

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.470
of Literary Magazines and Presses

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:04.010
and I guess 11 years ago now
founded Jubilat, one-of-a-kind.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.140
It publishes the best of
contemporary poetry anywhere.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.510
So let me turn this over
to Rob Casper, thank you.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.590
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Thanks Diana,
thanks to all of you for coming

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.860
out on a suddenly cold
evening, oh it's okay.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.510
Bayou Bakery the gumbo's
really good, it's worth going

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.950
to get it afterwards and they
actually have good coffee

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.300
drinks too.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.290
We're thrilled to be back here.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.850
Thanks to Miriam Brownlow
who dreamed this series

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.080
up a few years ago and
here we are at number 11.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.150
Of course, we want to thank the
Washington Post for its support

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.020
and I think our Washington Post
book world editor, Ron Charles.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.540
To think that once upon a time
Ron was only focusing on fiction

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.440
at our city's great paper.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.340
What he's done over the course of
10 programs I believe will continue

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.550
to entertain and educate
poetry lovers

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.070
for the years and decades to come.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.450 position:56%
And it's worth checking out the
webcast of the videos on our website

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.060
and in the insider's YouTube
channel, they're just remarkable.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.500
Before I talk about tonight's
featured poet let me say a little

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.080
bit about the Poetry and Literature
Center at the Library of Congress.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.180
We are home to the poet
Laureate consultant in poetry,

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.650
our current poet laureate is Juan
Felipe Herrera, who is terrific

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.280
and fun and wild and sweet
and worth seeing when he comes

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.360
into town next week and in April.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.130
We also host a range of
programs such as this one,

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.170
most of them are just down
the street at the Library.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.890
If you want to find out more

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:52.380
about our programs you can visit
our website www.LOC.gov/poetry.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.010
We've also left out some surveys
that should've been on your chairs.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.420
We want to find out what you
think about this program,

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.150
get your comments so that
we can improve upon it,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.020
though it's really sort
of impossible to improve

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.420
on what Ron Charles is
about to do and I mean

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.120
that completely sincerely.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Let's not waste
too much time filling that out.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.880
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: I had a fun 10
minutes before the event basically

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.410
saying I love Ron Charles so
much I don't even know what

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.230
to do with myself.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.690
So anyway, please give
us your feedback,

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.060
let us know what you
think that would be great.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.400
And now I'm excited to
introduce Dunya Mikhail

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.610
to begin our 2016 season.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.080
Mikhail was born in Iraq in
1965 and was forced to flee

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.470
in the wake of the first Gulf War.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.050
She's the author of six books
in Arabic and one Italian.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.180
Her three books in
English all published

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.880
by New Directions publishers
and I believe all three are

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.700
for sale outside include
The War Works Hard,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.200
Shortlisted for the Griffin
Prize and named one of 25 books

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.030
to remember from 2005 by
the New York Public Library,

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.520
Diary of a Wave Outside the Sea,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.300
which won the 2010
Arab-American book award

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.220
and most recently the Iraqi Nights.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.220
Mikhail's honors also include the
UN human rights award for freedom

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.210
of writing and a Kresge
Artist Fellowship.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.990
The cofounder of the
Mesopotamian form for art

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.070
and culture she's an
Arabic special lecturer

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.090
at Oakland University in Michigan.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:36.500 position:56%
And for her actually even today it's
somewhat warm coming from Michigan.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.300
Mikhail is here to participate

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:44.240
in the Al-Mutanabbi Street
Starts Here DC 2016 Book Arts

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.220
and Culture Festival
led by Split This Rock.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.620
For the last two months
exhibits, programs

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.080
and events have commemorated
the 2007 bombing

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.640
of Baghdad's historic
bookselling street.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.630
A big thanks to Split This Rock
Executive Director Sarah Browning

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.510
who is here, Sarah.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.040
[ Applause ]

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.340
Sarah is making this happen.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.700
To find out more about the events
in the festival there are a number

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.510
of events coming up
in the weeks to come,

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.260
including events with
our future speaker.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.230
You can check out this website
I'm just going to give it to you,

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:31.330
it's www.amsschdc2016.org or you
can go to Split This Rock website

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.220
and click on the link and you
should be able to check it out.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.770
But I strongly encourage you do it.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:42.090
For this series for life of a poet
tonight offers us an opportunity

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.320
to expand Ron's ongoing
engagement with poets

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.070
and poetry beyond our
country's borders.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.070
This seems apt for our capital
city considering the debates among

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.340 position:56%
thinkers of all types, positions
and perspectives within the district

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.210
on all things international.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.300
I look forward to the next hour

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.720
and the ways it will surely show
me why Dunya Mikhail's poems need

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.440
to be part of that debate.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.510
Please join me in welcoming
Ron Charles and Dunya Mikhail.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:17.040
[ Applause ]

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's such
a delight to have you here.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.640
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: My pleasure.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.350
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And to
have read your poems

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.390
and to have been so moved.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:26.770
While preparing for this interview
I ran across an exasperated poem

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.650
in which you write, please don't
ask me America I don't remember

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.410
on which street or with
whom or under which star.

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:36.930
Don't ask me I don't remember.

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.570
I'm going to ask you though.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.770
I'm going to ask you anyway.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.100
You're our 11th poet, you're
our first foreign-born poet,

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.650
of course you're our
first Iraqi poet

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.470
and you're the first poet whose
life story is so death-defying.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:57.100
No it is, I mean there is
some really exciting moments

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.040
in your biography and some of
course, some terrible moments.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.740
Tell us why you had to leave Iraq.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:09.510
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Okay, well first
about you said first, first, first.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.590
You know, I'm from Mesopotamia,
I mean originally Iraq.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:19.240
And that place everything
that happened

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.660
in the civilian the culture
happened first in history.

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:30.010
But I left Iraq, I
had to leave Iraq --

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:36.810
well I was going to leave Iraq
earlier than I had to leave

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.200
when I graduated from
secondary school.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.940
I was, you know, very good at math,

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.310
I mean I don't know how
serious was going to be,

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.070
but my father was serious
about it more than me.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.880
And he thought I was genius in
math and I have to, you know,

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.570
to show the world that make
inventions in math and he wanted

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:06.250
to send me to America to,
you know, to study math more.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.200
And that time was during
the Iraq Iran war

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.990
that when it was the
beginning of the war

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.750
when I graduated from
the high school.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.020
And, you know, I was
so excited not about --

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.560
to be honest not about math,
but excited to go to America,

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.890
be independent and imagining
everything that I can do whatever.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:31.530
Like read any book, even bad
books and a lot of things,

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:36.500
maybe be in a small apartment
versus our house was full of guests

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.780
like around-the-clock people
I don't know my mother was

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.230 position:56%
so social she's not like, so always.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.620
They were lovely, but I wanted
that something different and.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.030
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You were 18, 19?

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.740
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Eighteen I think.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:11:00.400
What age we graduate from 15, 16,
well [inaudible], yeah 18 maybe.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.000
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yeah,
I'm 18 you're right.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.100
So and anyways, so I was
talking about it 12 hours a day

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.790
and the other 12 hours
just imagining,

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.840
you know, what's going to happen.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.290
But then when we went to the
passport office to get permission

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:21.030
because we had to get permission
to leave the country all came

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:26.860
to nothing because they said the
law doesn't allow women to travel

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.200
to study at their expenses
during the time of war.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.110
So of course my father
saw my disappointment,

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.690
so he said you know what
this should be temporary

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:40.350
because the war will not last
forever and this law will change.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.850
Why don't you study English
as you prepare for America,

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.740
so that's how I went to
the English literature?

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.990
And then in the College, University
of Baghdad and with literature

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.760
and friends to be honest I
forgot about America, about math

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.680
and about all that I
was busy and, you know,

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.270
very engaged with these things.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.120
But it happened after
graduation and by the way,

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.280
I graduated from the University of
Baghdad and the law didn't change.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.850
The war was still over and
the law didn't change but.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:17.120
What happened is that in the 95
Diary of a Wave Outside the Sea

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.090
in Arabic part one came out and.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This is your?

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:23.690
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yeah.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:24.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Your first book?

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:29.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: In Iraq it was not
first, no before it was number --

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:35.410
this book was number
three, number three in Iraq.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.840
So there were two books before.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.940
But this when this came out
we have censorship department,

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.350
we have to have permission
before we publish,

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.790
it's an actual building
with actual employees.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:50.540
So that their job title is
to watch, you know, what.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: To
protect the populous.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.140
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes, yes.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: From bad ideas.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.740
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: And
yes to protect you

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.020
from bad ideas you're
right, that's perfect.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:03.710
And then there was a passage that
was highlighted by the censor

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:05.010
that should be taken away.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:08.280
And I said you know what it's
a very small text it doesn't --

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.880
I can't afford taking anything
away, it's a small one.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.590
He said you know what,
so he wanted to be

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:14.890
on the safe side I don't blame him,

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.610
he said I will just put the
note and it's up to you.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:20.540
But then I didn't take
anything away.

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:27.350
And then there was somebody came to
my office in the Baghdad Observer

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:31.280
and he pretended he's journalist
he wants to interview me,

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.970
but I know my colleagues the
journalists he was not journalist.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.880
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But this time
you were a working journalist.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.060
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: In the
Baghdad Observer yes.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.280
And then he was really
investigating,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.110
he was asking all these
questions that I were --

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:46.010
so I was suspicious about.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.670 position:56%
Because he was also focusing on this
passage that I didn't take away.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.330
And I was like pretending he's
real journalist saying, you know,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:59.510 position:56%
it's not the task of the writer to
explain it's the task of the reader.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So you
were both pretending.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:03.430
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.730
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Both
knew what was happening.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.030
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes.

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:08.830
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: And then I had
some links, friends who had links

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:15.890 position:56%
in the, you know, that somebody told
me a friend, her son-in-law knew

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.440
that there's a report out
and she said, you know,

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.510
as soon as possible
leave the country

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:26.630
because the report [inaudible]
higher rank it's not good.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:32.110
So but it was very complicated
the paperwork to leave

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:36.380 position:56%
and I don't know should I continue
then what happened or maybe because,

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.710
you know, because how I left
the poetry really saved my life.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.920
And when I say that really is
not metaphorical it's real,

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.530
that's how I left true poetry but.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You had
to change your occupation

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:48.320
from journalist to poet.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.620
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Exactly.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Then
you were free to go.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes, because well.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Please leave.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.510
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes, as a
poet you don't need a leave

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.930
of absence from anywhere.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.230
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Nobody cares.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.920
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yeah, but
leave of absence in Iraq

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.740
that time was very complicated.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:09.550 position:56%
As a journalist you need to take
papers from the Union of Journalists

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:14.480
and that is very complicated,
you know, it takes forever

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.320
and so really poetry saved my life.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.490
And it's written in my
passport I keep it, it's expired

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:23.830
but the profession is poet.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:28.900
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
Saddam saved you from math.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.170
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: I
don't think of that.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:33.470
I love math.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.770 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You still love math?

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.240
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: I still love
-- no I stopped it I mean,

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.050 position:56%
but I have that like you know how
you have first love you think of it,

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:42.950
you think about it sometimes.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:45.550
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Like
that like you forgot

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.850
about it, but it's first love.

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.150
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I was a
math major in college,

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:49.570
but now I look back I can't even --

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.620 position:56%
I don't even know what the questions
are, I can't read it at all.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.340
You received a message that let you
know it was time to get out fast

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:00.400
and that message was the
flowers are withering.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.550
Weirdly poetic and tragic.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.850
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes,
this message was

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:09.150
from my friend fiction
writer I don't know

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.650
if I'm allowed [inaudible].

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.700
We agreed that okay,
because I left but I had

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.170
in mind maybe I come
back if things calm down.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:21.940
So this was our code that if she
tells me the flower, you know,

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:24.230
are blooming and this
means okay, come back.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.530
&gt;&gt; Robert Casper: Yes.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:26.830
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: So
that was our code.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The
flowers are blooming.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Because she can't.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:30.730
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.030
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Talk
directly in the letter,

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.140
so that was her message
that don't come back.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.330
She didn't want me back.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:40.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This is a weird
question and none of us is in favor

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.600
of censorship of course,
but is there a way

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.560
in which censorship puts
pressure on language

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.910
that makes it more metaphorical,
more allegorical, more creative?

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:55.710
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes, I mean that
exactly what was happening with me

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.730
and with other writers in Iraq

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:04.320
that we were using this
metaphors sometimes as shields.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.670
I wanted to be understood,
I'm the kind of person I

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.460
like to be understood actually
by readers and by everybody,

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.900
but I didn't want to be
understood by the censors.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.360
So that's using those metaphors

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.920
because the true readers they
understand you those metaphors,

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.880
but he censors maybe not.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.870
Well a funny thing happened with
that metaphor I tell you maybe

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:29.620
if the time allows
it with the minister

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.800
of information and
culture with this.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:39.050
But another funny thing a friend
from back home while I'm in here

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:43.330
in America, you know, I kept on
contact and he said to me Dunya,

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.330
you were writing better before.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.730
So because he loved those metaphors
I was using they were maybe good

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.030
for my poetry.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right,
that's what I was wondering.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.630
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: [Inaudible]
want that but in a way.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:58.470
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yeah, it
looks like it served our poetry.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:03.120
But a lot of you know
surrealists things happened.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right, I want to
look at one of those passages.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:14.000
You note -- let's see here in this
diary about a shell, a seashell.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:21.900
I wonder if you'd read this is
a very long work without breaks

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.220
and I'm just asking
her to read a section

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.030
of it here from there to there.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.960
It's when you talk
about poetry as a shell.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:33.620
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: This is
a [inaudible] by the way,

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:38.560
but it's okay that it's compliment
everybody says it's poetry yeah.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.520
On the seashore was
an enormous shell

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:46.330
that contained the
protoplasm of poetry.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:50.310
Someone brought it to me and
linked the essence of my life

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:52.440
with its invisible threads.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.540
I felt like a kite looking
at the world from above.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:01.630
Like any child little things
make me rise or fall that shell

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:06.430
of poetry drew me from or into
everything and let me do nothing

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.950
but play with it and glorify it.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:13.610
I have tried many times to rid
myself of its magnetic power

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.740
and is deadly effect on me.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's
lovely and troubling.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:21.330
What about poetry is like a shell

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:27.100
and why would you want
to get rid of it?

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.070
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: It's
annoying, it's --

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:38.230
well, you know, really
it's so obsessed.

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:44.480
Even one time I said to someone,
you know, so how you are,

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.060
I mean when you are a
poet not even I mean

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.030
as a writer it's easier
to say I'm a writer.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:53.270
When you say I am a poet you
hesitate I don't know why.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:58.710
And like people how you deal
with it first with yourself

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.910 position:56%
like 24 hours a day you are obsessed

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:03.470
with something what is this
thing I am obsessed with this,

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:06.150
why am I obsessed with
tis all the time

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:12.040
and why is this directing my life,
everything is dictated by poetry.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.720
And on the other hand like I
found myself one time saying

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:23.190
to someone yes, I write poetry,
but all my other habits are good.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.320 position:56%
Like then I thought about it I said,

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.070
so it's like as if
you defend yourself.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.330
And as a matter of fact,
I even remember how

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.950
when I was teenager I
mean I was in my room

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:39.230
and I was lucky I had
the room of my own,

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.690
I mean Virginia Woolf was right
I mean it was very important.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.720
And my mother we always
had a lot of guests

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.710
and I heard her one time saying

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:54.390
to the guest she is busy
writing her feelings.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:57.520
And, you know, how embarrassing
that is to a teenager.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.610
But you know why she
said that she said

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.950
because in Arabic the word [foreign
language] feeling is similar

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:08.270
to share poetry and Arabic is not
her first language [inaudible] is

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.970
her first, Arabic is her second.

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:14.150
And she made her own plural
of the two words to say --

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:18.900
she said it's like she's
busy writing feelings.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.030
But you know now I
think of it I appreciate

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:27.530 position:56%
that she considered writing feelings
important enough to excuse you

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:32.060
from coming and be with the guests
or from social daily, you know.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.660
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: And
things like that.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's lovely.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.020
You were once asked if you
thought poetry was therapeutic

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.040
and you said poetry is
not medicine it's x-ray,

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.960
what do you mean by that.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.400
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes, I still
believe it's not healing,

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:53.690 position:56%
it's not -- it's an x-ray that helps
you see the wound and understand it.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:58.350
And it's like or if I say
something similar it's like a key

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.180
where you can open a door behind

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:05.160
which later you can see all
the wound that happened then.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.790
I mean it's not, I mean
although it is not healing

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.860
and it's actually used less,
but it's very effective

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.490
at the same time it's strange.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.540 position:56%
So I'm trying to like it's really --

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:24.840
it's very effective like
and delicate like the trace

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:29.640
of the butterfly on the things.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:36.900 position:56%
But to say it can stand in front
and face of catastrophe I'm not sure

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:44.210
if it can do that, but we do resort
to poetry and we feel together --

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:50.570
we feel alone and we feel
together at the same time

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:58.730
when we see all this violence
that's happening in the world.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.080
Not that it's going to, you know,

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:08.110
to heal I still believe it's
not the function of poetry.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:13.800
But as if there's a possibility
of survival, but it's not final,

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:23.460
it's not final to say I survived
it doesn't mean you are saved,

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.460
it doesn't mean.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:27.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right, right.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.760
In Diary of a Wave Outside the Sea
this remarkable autobiographical

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.740
book, I think it's a poem.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:37.220
It about 120 pages, it's in
two parts, one written in Iraq

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.170
and one written in
America, it's sprawling

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:44.310
and it has this elastic form, it's
got dreams and narratives and myths

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:48.810
and reporting and epigraphs and
lyrics, it's just really strange.

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:50.110
I mean I haven't read anything else

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.090
like it except maybe
Leaves of a Grass.

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:59.590
What was your model for
this, what were you doing?

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.790
You say that you didn't
even think of it as a poem

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.090 position:56%
which just strikes me as remarkable.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.740
I mean clearly it is
a poem it's written

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:10.590
in highly metaphoric language,
it's broken into beautiful lines,

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:14.200
it uses repetition, it uses
all the elements of poetry.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.930 position:56%
Why would you think it's not a poem?

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:21.430
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: You know,
it had the symptoms of poetry,

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:27.460
such as the symptoms are similar
to like symptoms of falling in live

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:32.870
like you feel this
excitement and you are.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:40.140
But it's happened I wrote
this after the second,

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:44.040
is it second war Gulf War we call
it or it's called many names.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:49.100
It's called the 91 war, here
it was called Desert Storm

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:52.700
and in Iraq they called it
the mother of all battles.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:58.490
It had nicknames, you know, so it
is and that war was very intense

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.540
and I very clearly
remember it very well.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.460
I mean because simply we had a room

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.370
in the house called the
war room, the room of war.

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.560
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Was it
a safety room for you?

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: My mother prepared
that room she called it the war room

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:20.900
and we were not allowed to leave
the room during that war of 91.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:29.320
And she designed it in a special
way like she taped the windows

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.590
so that the windows break
we don't get hurt so badly

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:36.640
and she taped the whole of the door

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.370
so that the chemical
weapons don't go through.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:40.970
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's intense.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.210
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: And we were
suffocating because we were trying

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:47.580
to -- my brothers and I we were
taking turns to lit that candle

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.590
and it was not because
no oxygen there.

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:56.080
And even going to bathroom was a
problem because she was afraid --

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.440
she wanted us to die
or live altogether.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.230
So she was not wanting
anybody going even

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:03.940
like to bathroom was
like quick, quick.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.660
So anyways, it was something.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:10.070
But what was I saying anyway?

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.450
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The
form of this book.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:15.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Okay, so that's
when I mean I had such an experience

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:19.950
in that war and right after I
didn't write it during the war,

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:23.640 position:56%
but when it stopped I stated writing
this as I wanted some response

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.800
to the war it caused so much mess.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Is it like
something you had read?

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:31.420
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: It was
so much mess that I felt

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:36.700 position:56%
if I give it a form this mess in my
head, I wanted to give it some form.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:42.720
And the title of it
actually I hate the saying

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.460
that they say you hit
a bird with two tones,

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.690 position:56%
I hate to hit the birds [inaudible].

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:52.570
But I had two goals in the title.

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:59.010
One is as it is understood
like the wave outside the sea,

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:01.750
the sea is the society,
the environment

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.440
that you want to be out of.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:08.700 position:56%
But the second meaning sea in Arabic
[foreign language] also has another

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:13.390
meaning which means the
pattern, the metric pattern

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.910
because we have classic Arabic
poetry, it's traditional poetry.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:22.930
It has 16 patterns and each one
is called [foreign language] sea

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:29.140
and mine was modern so I wanted
outside these patterns also.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.440
So it had some.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What we
would call free verse does

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.110
that relate in any way?

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:35.410
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: No, free verse

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:40.770
after the traditional [inaudible]
we call it there's a free verse

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:45.340
movement started in Iraq actually
in the 1940's by Iraqi poets

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.240
to Iraqi poets female
and male [inaudible]

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:53.140
and Badr Shakir al Sayyab they
started the free verse movement

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.390
and separate to other countries.

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:59.430
But that also had some
rules, it still has rhymes,

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:04.000
but it was more free with the
lines because the tradition was so,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.060
so strict with the [inaudible] what
you called in this middle and all

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:13.560
that and it was just 16
founded by [inaudible] century.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:20.810 position:56%
And my friends other modern writers,
poets and I who were serious

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.620
about not only poetry,
but modern poetry.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.750
Why should we all follow
a man's rules, you know,

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:30.500
but that was not welcome this
type of modern writing was not

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.700
so welcome in the media yet.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:38.080
Anyways, so that was kind
of a response to the sea is

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.310
that it's outside what is familiar.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:42.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:44.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: A written style
of writing and also outside the sea,

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:47.400
the society, the environment
and that.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Would you
read a passage here it's

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:51.880
about the bombing it starts
here and it runs onto here.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.180
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Okay.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:06.770
The radio says that light planes
are dropping cluster bombs

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:08.880
on shelters and bridges.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.610
I never heard of such a phrase
except as a cluster of grapes.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:17.510
Oh life a suspension
bridge between two wars.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.640
Why don't the flowers of
others like to bloom save

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.790
in the remains of our ashes.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.730
The letters do not arrive,

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:28.290
the telephone does not
ring, nothing rings but me.

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:32.840
What time is it now, is the
war over, will they return,

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.020
was there enough room
in the sky for the birds

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.690
when the planes raised our dreams,

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:42.520
I'm sorry when the
planes raided our dreams

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.440
and turned everything to flour.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.040
It was a night of extremes some

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.210
of the residents could not
sleep while others left forever.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:55.450
And when the spots of slide
multiplied in the darkness,

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:58.040
flying things lost their minds.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.720
No one could tell if the
birds had changed into planes

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.910
or if the planes had
changed into flaming birds.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:09.390
Everything was shaking, the city
and the people inside the city,

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:13.680
the hearts inside the people and
the people inside the hearts.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:17.850
The planes circled over the
capital, bumping its residence

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:22.880 position:56%
into the villages towards an unknown
fate and toward the questions

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:28.200
of children that grown-ups
do not know the answers to.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:32.160
The planes flew over at the
[inaudible] filling the eyes

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:36.840
of [inaudible] with dismay
as his horses left the city.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:41.830
The planes flew over the shelters,
over the debris that collected

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:46.650
in the shelters, over the children
who slept under the debris,

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:49.880
over the body parts
that had been children,

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:55.760
over the ash the body parts became
over the walls sprinkled with ash,

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.460
over the drops of blood
on the walls.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.800 position:56%
In war no one is rescued from death.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:06.000
The [inaudible] die physically
and the killers die morally.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.970
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So beautiful and
so horrific, such a weird tension

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:16.800
between what's being
described in the language

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.930
and the rhythms of those phrases.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:22.090
What's it like for you
to hear this in English

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.000
when you wrote in a
different language?

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.850
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes, it's kind
of different when I did in Arabic,

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:37.130
you know, of course I did it
better excuse my bad reading.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:38.430
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No, no.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:39.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: My third language.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:41.030
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You read lovely.

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:42.330
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yeah, it's
really my third language,

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:43.630
but I'm improving in it.

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:48.470
And, you know, English helped me
make more sensitive towards my

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:49.770
original language.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:55.650
I kind of made me really think more
carefully about Arabic because,

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:59.730
you know, how your first
language is automatic.

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:03.470
But then because of
translation you go back and forth

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:09.760
and you even improve your first
language as a result of the second.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: War poetry has
such a long history like from Homer

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:17.840
and beyond I suppose all the
way up to our great Iraq poets,

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.740
our great Iraq war poets in America
like thinking of Brian Turner

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:25.360
and Kevin Powers, both
that you know from Iraq.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:30.450
But your position to the war is
different you were never a soldier

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:34.710
is your primary difference,
as well as other differences.

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:38.690
You write on the first
morning of the new year all

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:41.490
of us will look up at the same sun.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:47.210
You're not writing about being
in battle, which gives the poems

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:50.010
in your descriptions of
war such a different tenor.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:55.000
I'd wonder if you'd read this poem
called Iraqis and Other Monsters.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.340
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yeah
and this is really

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:09.100
about stereotyping the Iraqis, but
I found here in America you know

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:15.260
that Americans also are
stereotyped by our people.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:19.520
Yeah, so this is we
have these ethic groups

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.700
and all the conflicts between.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.240
Anyways, let me [inaudible].

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.110
Iraqis and Other Monsters.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:35.500 position:56%
They are terrifying, their heads are
dark and tremulous, no tremeliou --

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.800
how do you say it tremelious
[phonetic]?

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Tremulous.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.940
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Tremulous right.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:46.210
They are terrifying, their
heads are dark and tremulous.

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:50.020
They roam the desert in
the form of bulls and lions

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.780
with swords gleaming in their eyes.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.400
They rub their mustaches
when they make promises

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.370
or threats or when they flirt.

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:05.170
Smoke pours out of their massive
noses and rises to the sky.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:09.580
They shake the earth with such
strength it wakes the dead.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.480
They live in darkness
without water or electricity.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.570
Dust is their food,
clay their bread,

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.380
they no neither sleep nor rest.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:24.220
The war visits them every day
with new baskets of bones.

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:30.010 position:56%
They have strange customs, the
Sunnis say the Shias all have tails,

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:32.480
the Shias carry keys to have

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.460
in their pockets in
case of sudden death.

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:38.620
The Kurds take to the
mountains when they fight

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:41.660 position:56%
and when they dance the [inaudible].

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:45.600
The Chaldeans consult the
stars in all decisions.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.090
The Syrians put feathers
on their heads

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:52.260
to prove they have
vanquished the eagle.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:57.680 position:56%
The Armenians throw themselves in
the river whenever they are annoyed.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.080
The [inaudible] celebrate
their festivals

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:05.270 position:56%
by staying home for three full days.

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:08.580
The [inaudible] honor the
peacock and consecrate letters.

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:13.360
The Turkmens are always waiting
for the Sultan to return.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:19.700
When the sun sets and the
guns fall silent these Iraqis

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:26.530
and other monsters take out
their [inaudible] and make music

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:29.780
for the missing together
until morning.

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:34.960
And I want to say something
though about --

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.640
this was written before
all this happening,

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:42.970
well this is a pre-ISIS
era you know.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:50.820
And I mean to be honest this would
be written different maybe I don't

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:56.110
know after because I am so
occupied, my mind is so occupied

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:59.230
with what's happening in
Iraq, especially in the north,

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:02.590
especially to the [inaudible]
minority and also

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:06.590
to Christians these days
that I'm afraid I have some

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.890
in [inaudible] now because of this.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:09.980
Because I've been involved
with it day and night

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:15.150
and I've been writing my
new work on this thing.

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:17.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But this poem
does it stand outside all these

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.920
prejudices, all these stereotypes
it makes them all seem a little

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:22.780
ridiculous right?

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:28.570
Makes us realize that we can
transcend these ridiculous images

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:31.190
of one another for peace if
we would just be a little more

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:34.350
morally imaginative.

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:37.550
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes, but at the
end they are all missing something

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:42.370
and that, I mean they are monsters
but in the poem they look monsters,

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:53.350
but they're really from inside
it's fragility and I don't know.

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:54.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Another one

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:59.440
of your poems captures the
city just before it ends.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:05.090
It's a really startling,
frightening poem.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:06.450
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: I
wonder which one.

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:07.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
called Five Minutes.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:12.720
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Oh, oh that
one, that's a very old one yes.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:16.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What
like 2,000 years old?

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Twentieth century.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:23.240
I am a poet, when they say poet
from the 20th century I say whoa,

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:28.650
whoa I'm a dinosaur or
something still living.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:29.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:32.280
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes and this was
imagining the last five minutes

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.030 position:56%
in the world like last five minutes.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:41.010
In five minutes the world will end,

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:45.880
the owner of the shop next-door
has just put up the closed sign

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:50.480
and gone away as if he knows
there's no time left for work.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:55.340
There are other stores open, their
owners are still absorbed in work,

00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:02.410 position:56%
but the world will end in a group of
lively boys, rushes by the street,

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:05.530
following them a dog
leading an old man.

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:07.650
The traffic light is red,

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:13.790
the bus driver makes a slight
adjustment to the rearview mirror.

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:17.430
There are still several [inaudible]
that move across the mirror.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:21.830
The driver pulls away now,
the traffic light is green.

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:25.120
It will keep changing
even after five minutes.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:29.260
A young man checks his watch
and waits for the next bus.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.880
In the public park a couple
walks past the statues

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.940
and smiles under the sun.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:39.550
The statutes are carefree,
they stare firmly at nothing.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:43.700
A tourist wanders full of
curiosity and takes pictures

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.080
of what will soon be absent.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.440
There in the white hospital women,

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:55.230 position:56%
their new babies too late the babies
might leave the world without names.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:58.540
In one of the words they
will be left forever

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:04.530 position:56%
in test tubes while the wiggling lab
mouse performing a test will be free

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:08.770
at last from the big
eye that always watches.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:14.170
The test is not difficult, but time
will run out before the answer.

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:18.430
And it no longer matters
whether or not you knew,

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:20.770
smell the roses and keep going.

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:25.450
The rose always knows that the
world will end in five minutes.

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:30.240
The blue shirt in the shop window
seems beautiful on the mannequin.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.230
A young woman points
it out to her friend

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:36.780
and they had toward the
revolving door to be swallowed

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.630
by the towering building.

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:45.180
On the wall glossy advertisements
huge sale, new remedy for wrinkles,

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:50.880
cigarettes don't harm your
health, but the world will end.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.740
In his world room inside
the wall palace,

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:58.300
inside the wall city the
tyrant is chewing on an apple

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:02.370
and watching himself on television.

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:06.030
Who would believe that in five
minutes he will relinquish

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:07.330
his throne?

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:10.510
Another defendant receives
a life sentence,

00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:14.190
his attorney wants an
appeal but the world will.

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.770
Passengers push through
the exit door,

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:19.740
others come in through
the entrance door.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:25.000
A woman sets down her suitcase
and waves her hand it's not me.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.530
A man waves to her from behind
the airport glass it's not you.

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:34.910 position:56%
I don't know if they met or at the
time that university student prefers

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:38.750
to travel by train, it doesn't
make much difference now.

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:41.510
He has agreed with a
friend to go on a picnic,

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:44.140
I don't know if the picnic
ended before the world

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:46.160
or the world before the picnic.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.390
As for me I'm writing a letter,

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:51.970
I don't think it will be
finished within five minutes.

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:58.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's so haunting the
way you identify all these ordinary

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:02.120
little tales of people's lives
and hovering over that is the fact

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.840
that everything will be destroyed.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:07.710
It really captures
the tragedy of war.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:10.460
We sort of wince as we read
that poem knowing what's coming,

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.780
you know, having lived through it.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.670
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: But this was
published in Iraq and, you know,

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:20.250
like what I meant by censorship
like that stands of tyrant and all

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:23.100
that they question you about
like what do you mean by that.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:27.700
And it's happened one time a friend
published that's why they said your

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.630
poetry is subversive
they called it there.

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:34.230
And I had a friend, a very
nice friend who was also poet

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:36.650
and he was editor in one

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:42.810
of the Iraqi newspaper I don't
remember which one we had three.

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:49.070
And that poem pronoun which is in
the end of the world works hard

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:52.140
in 91 he published it
and he told me something.

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:55.850
He said you know what I
[inaudible] if someone asks you

00:41:55.850 --> 00:42:00.260
who is the general in the
poem say that's Schwarzkopf.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:07.100
So this was our ways of survival
like in Iraq, these ways, tricks.

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.290
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Nice, very nice.

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:12.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: So if they say
who's the tyrant I say like someone.

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:17.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's good that
tyrants aren't very smart.

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:22.040
A very brief poem called The Plane.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.480
The Plane arriving
from Baghdad carries,

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.060
it rises above the moon
reflected on the Tigris.

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.970
Above clouds piled like
corpses and an ancient harp

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:34.420
and the beating breasts and
the ones who were kidnapped.

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:37.570
It rises above the destruction
that grows with the children

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:42.810
and the long lines of the passport
office and Pandora's open box.

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:46.460
The plane and its exhausted
passengers will land 6,000 miles

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:51.210
away from an amputated
finger lying in the sand.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:55.170
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: I love
when you read it's so good.

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:56.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No, I
should make you read it.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.160
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Oh my God.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Just such --

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:04.210
it's such a devastating poem the
way it takes this world, you know,

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:10.450
world shaping action, the war, the
planes, all this political disaster

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:13.380
and then it brings us right
down, right down onto the ground

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.500
to one little moment that
says everything right,

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.780
which is that somebody died.

00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.550
Somebody precious is
now blown to bits.

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:28.630
And of course it's startling too
and it's an amputated finger lying

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:32.720
in the sand, but even though it is.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:39.540
But's a devastating little poem
that captures the whole war.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:42.200
Bravo.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.360
There's another one I want you

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:54.400
to read called The
Prisoner remember that?

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.230
[Inaudible] you haven't read
these as recently as I have.

00:43:56.230 --> 00:44:02.160
Again, it's one of
these little moments.

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.190
As we experience the war, you
know, in the newspaper or on TV

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:10.310
and it just seem so abstract and so
large and so loud and so, you kind,

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:13.150
kind of videogamesque
[phonetic] for Americans.

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:15.970
And then you bring
us moments like this.

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:18.720
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: I thought
you going to read it, but so.

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.970
The President.

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:25.850
She doesn't understand
what it means to be guilty.

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:31.250 position:56%
She waits at the prison entrance
until she seems him to say take care

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:35.840
of yourself as she always used
to remind him when he went off

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:41.160
to school, when he left for work,
when he returned while on vacation.

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:46.100 position:56%
She doesn't understand what they are
saying now at the back of the podium

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.770
in their official uniforms.

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:51.780
The report that he
should be kept there

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:55.870
with [inaudible] strangers
it never occurred to her

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:58.610
as she sang lullabies on his bed

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:04.820
in those distant days someday he
would end up in this cold place

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.380
without windows or moons.

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.500
She doesn't understand,

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:14.890
the prisoner's mother doesn't
understand why she should leave him

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:17.830
just the visit is over.

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:21.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's what war is

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:24.700
for actual people is
losing their family members,

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:28.080
being separated, being
bewildered by it.

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:33.860
I suppose all these are
based on actual friends

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.310
or experiences you've
heard about or knew about?

00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:38.610
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes,
we always heard of --

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:42.520
always somebody disappeared, I mean
when I was a journalist in Iraq.

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.860
I mean there was in the
corner of every newspaper

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.530
in Iraq there is a
saying, the same saying,

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:52.270
it says write feely whether
the government likes it or not.

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:54.400
But nobody believed
it we knew that was

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:58.020
like not even a joke it
was a trap and we were

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:01.150
because we were seeing
our colleagues disappear,

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:08.570
every day somebody disappearing
whether in prison or gone or like

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:12.180
in best case scenario
too what they call exile.

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.480
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Like you.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:14.780
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: I
don't know what exile is.

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.080
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.380
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes.

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.680
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah,
that does seem.

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:19.980
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: That's
the best case.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Preferable yes.

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.620
In the diary.

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:27.640
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: You know, I
wanted to say how lucky I was

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.740
that I had a suitcase, but
these days because, you know,

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.930
I can't get rid of these
images of those going on.

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:36.680
Now the people are
leaving with no suitcases,

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:38.510
with nothing just leaving.

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:42.970
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The story in
today's paper was so disturbing.

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:48.000 position:56%
Just a little moment from the diary.

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.900
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: I wander
among the ruins like a word

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:02.790
in the dictionary roaming
in search of its meanings

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:05.240
in a language without verbs.

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:11.120 position:56%
I'm a verb of the past trying vainly
to change to the present tense.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:16.510
They said behind every window no
matter how small a horizon can

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:18.100
be seen.

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:21.720
Ever since I heard that I
have been drawing windows

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.330
that open up, do nothing.

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:28.690
This was all written like a long
time ago I don't even remember it.

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:30.550
Really seriously I'm so surprised.

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:32.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Still
incredibly powerful.

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.280
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Thank
you for bringing of this.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: To wander among the
ruins like a word in a dictionary.

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:39.720
We're going to take a little break.

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:45.790
There is a weird sardonic humor
about the war in some of your poems

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:48.500
that I think comes from
having survived them.

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:52.640
A kind of cosmic absurdity.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:59.930
One called Silent Movie.

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:01.480
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Oh.

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:05.000
What I was, what was I thinking.

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:19.220
There in the sky's playground the
gods toss us around like purses

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:23.830
and cast us down from above
without speaking a word.

00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:26.510
They watch us, but don't hear us.

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:31.390
We are a silent movie with a bad
director now wonder the gods get

00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:36.930
bored or switch us off and go to
sleep or forget about us as we bend

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:43.850
like a question mark on an empty
screen or sneeze as we pray

00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:48.030
for return of the gods
even without any words.

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:54.070
You know, I would change a
lot in this if I rewrite it.

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:59.980
It's interesting that you ask me
the poems I never read in public.

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:04.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This reminds me of
Gloucester and King Lear talking

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:07.710
about the gods killing
us for their sport.

00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:11.510
I'm sure half the people
can recite the lines.

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:16.040
Then there's another one here with
a title called The War Works Hard.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:20.870
It begins how magnificent the war
is, how eager and efficient early

00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:23.990
in the morning it wakes up the
sirens and dispatched ambulances

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:27.630 position:56%
to various places, swings corpses
through the air, it rolls stretchers

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:31.080
to the wounded, summons rain
from the eyes of mothers and digs

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:33.480
into the earth, dislodges
many things.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:36.700 position:56%
Summer life wasn't glistening,
others are pale and still throbbing.

00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:39.600
It produces the most questions
in the minds of children.

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:46.540
The poem goes on like this with
this really strange kind of humor.

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:50.000
What are you reaching for there,
how magnificent the war is?

00:49:58.350 --> 00:49:59.650
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: I
don't know it's how --

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:03.480
why I mean it's, I
know it's person fight.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:08.740
I wanted to be treated
like something

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:12.680
like somebody like doing their job.

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:21.040
And it was, you know, in my mind
I think I'm not sure this comes

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:26.820
to my mind always as if like
what I saw the scenes from war

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:31.280
as if they are scenes
from thousands of films

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:34.000
that don't relate each other and
they're seen from here and there

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.280
and they come -- it's strange how
they come to your mind together.

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:44.760
But they are very vivid in
my mind that it's strange

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:47.710
because my memory is not
so good, I forget a lot,

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:50.750
I find myself it's
embarrassing how much I forget.

00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:56.590
But how vivid are these scenes
in my mind from that time.

00:50:56.590 --> 00:51:05.410 position:56%
And so I get always question is this
about a certain war and it's not

00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:08.630
about a certain war
it's about war itself.

00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:10.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
always working hard.

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:11.550
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes.

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:13.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, too hard yeah.

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:16.190
It ends with these lines.

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:18.950
The war works with
unparalleled diligence,

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:21.000
yet no one gives it
a word of praise.

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:32.330 position:56%
Let's talk about the immigrants, the
immigrant story which is your story.

00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:33.630
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes.

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:35.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You write as I left
I knew I was forgetting something,

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:38.350
it bothered me to leave it
behind, but I was determined not

00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:41.800
to look back like Orpheus
leaving the underworld.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:47.140
But of course you do
look back all the time.

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:48.710
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes,
I mean this method

00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:55.790 position:56%
of Orpheus fascinated me always how,
you know, in case it's [inaudible]

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:58.590
but just in brief I tell
you sorry if you know it

00:51:58.590 --> 00:51:59.890
and I'm repeating it to you.

00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:06.710
But Orpheus lost his beloved wife
Eurydice and then he was promised

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:10.790 position:56%
that he would have her back with one
condition if he doesn't look back

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:15.150
when she's after him from
underworld to the upper world.

00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:20.950
But he does look back and
he loses her by that look.

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:23.460
But I always think,
I mean I even have

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:27.780
in the Iraqi [inaudible] poem
called The Gaze of Orpheus

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:30.890 position:56%
because I wanted always like I want
to get rid of it, I talked about it,

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:33.640
about the gaze of Orpheus.

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:37.540
What if he didn't look back, but
you know kind of I understand him.

00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:38.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Of course.

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.140
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: To look back,

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:41.440
I mean how can you
not look back I mean.

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But she
pays the price not him,

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:44.750
I mean he gets to leave.

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.170
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Right, but
I think that looking back

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:49.160
because maybe he liked her so much

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.360
that he was making
sure she's behind him.

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:52.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right definitely.

00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:55.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Or I mean the same
way like you can't not look back

00:52:55.470 --> 00:53:02.920
to let's say your country,
your original country.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:06.960
I know I mean that I said like
when you leave you have --

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:11.400
I mean a child me something
one time, a neighbor child.

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:15.510
She said you know why we have our
eyes in front of us because we want

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:17.920
to look forward not backward.

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:22.390
I said wow, I love that.

00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:24.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah, that's good.

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:27.910
You write why am I blamed
for departing from mirrors

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:29.980
that reflected what
I didn't like to see.

00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:35.200
You remember that phrase, why am I
blamed for departing from mirrors

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.810
that are reflected what
I didn't like see it.

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:40.590
Who do you think, do you feel
a sense of blame for leaving,

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:45.700 position:56%
even abandoning your country is that
sort of a nagging sense of guilt?

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:48.990
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes, I mean on an
official and less official level,

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:51.920
on official level there
was a list where I was --

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:56.660 position:56%
the list as being traitor because I
left without leave of absence I just

00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:58.970
like escaped and everything,
suddenly [inaudible].

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:00.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You're
officially guilty.

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:02.080
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Officially,

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:07.160
but also not even casually
what you call it or inside me,

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:12.340
I mean I don't know to leave
suddenly without saying goodbye

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.950
to anybody, your friends and.

00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:16.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It sounds horrible.

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:17.880
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: And
even pictures and ID cards

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.670 position:56%
and those were left and [inaudible].

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:24.730
But you know a neighbor of
us was so sincere he went

00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:28.240
and he kept some of
these ID cards and.

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Nice [inaudible].

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:30.840
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Some
pictures that was nice of him.

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
got it eventually?

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:34.290
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Not
everything, but he kept --

00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:38.400
he told us when people were there
to like buy things or get things

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:41.700
and all he worried about is
the ID cards he took them

00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:44.520
and kept them for later.

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:49.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This is a very
painful section of the diary,

00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:53.420
which you apologize and apologize.

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:57.580
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Also that's
an answer for your question.

00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:01.850
I am sorry I left you
among the ruins.

00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:05.010
I'm sorry I left without
saying goodbye.

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:10.050
I apologize to my new home for
carrying the ruins with me.

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:14.940
I apologize for not being able
to be in two places at once.

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:18.990
I apologize to the war for
avoiding its nightmares

00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:21.890
by turning my face to the wall.

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:26.900
I apologize to the sirens for
preferring the sound of music

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:29.760
and the rhythm of water fountains.

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:33.560
I apologize for running
to lose weight instead

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:36.810
of running to escape explosions.

00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:41.160
I have left my friends too
busy for their sufferings.

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.440
Life continues behind their backs.

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:50.610
I'm sorry away from you I look at
the blue spaces between skyscrapers

00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:56.070 position:56%
and the America of lottery
tickets, credit cards and fast food.

00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:57.370
Leave you and love you.

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
write in another poem.

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:23.000
We crossed borders lightly like
clouds, nothing carries us.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.730
But as we move on we
carry rain and an accent

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:29.990
and a memory of another place.

00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:33.150
The pain of leaving
people behind just seems

00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:37.140
to me incalculable I can't
imagine what it's like.

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:40.290
As you say you had to leave very
quickly there were no going away

00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:44.740
parties, no winding down,
no cleaning out your desk.

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Not only that even
my brother had his wedding coming

00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:53.320 position:56%
in two weeks after that and I wanted
to wait two weeks and he said no,

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:57.510 position:56%
you know, just go if you can because
we can send you the video later.

00:56:57.510 --> 00:57:01.500
[ Laughter ]

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In one of your
poems you write there is a knock

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:12.000
at the door how disappointing
it is the New Year and not you.

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.620
Let's talk about that leaving

00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:29.530
in a hurry this is
called I Was in a Hurry.

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:31.600
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: You know this
is the first poem I wrote here

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:32.900
in America.

00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:34.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh my gosh.

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.500
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: After
not right away,

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:36.800
in the beginning I
didn't write I was trying

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:40.170
to find a space called
a place or something.

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:44.240
But when I returned to writing

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:47.010
like this was my returning
to writing poetry.

00:57:47.010 --> 00:57:49.870
This was this first
poem I wrote here

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:57.190
and I really could connect more
better to the new place I felt more

00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:59.900
when I was able to write.

00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:01.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That helped.

00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:02.500
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: It
felt more at home.

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:03.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It was therapeutic.

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.600
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: No.

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:10.500
[ Laughter ]

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:18.690
Almost got me.

00:58:18.690 --> 00:58:19.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:22.310
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: I Was in a Hurry.

00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:24.870
Yesterday lost a country.

00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:29.110
I was in a hurry and didn't
notice when it fell from me

00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:33.030
like a broken branch
from a forgetful tree.

00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:38.140
Please if anyone passes by
and stumbles across it perhaps

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:44.790 position:56%
in a suitcase open to the sky or
engraved on Iraq like a gaping wound

00:58:44.790 --> 00:58:49.300
or wrapped in the blankets
of immigrants or canceled

00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:55.000
like a losing lottery ticket or
helplessly forgotten in purgatory

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:00.040
or rushing forward without a goal
like the questions of children

00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:05.790
or rising from the smoke of war,
eroding in a helmet on the sand

00:59:05.790 --> 00:59:10.720
or stolen in Alibaba's jar
or disguised in the uniform

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:14.690
of a policeman who stirred
up the prisoners and fled.

00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:20.330
Or squatting in the mind of a
woman who tries to smile or scatter

00:59:20.330 --> 00:59:23.370
like the dreams of new immigrants.

00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:28.110
If anyone stumbles across
it return it to me please.

00:59:28.110 --> 00:59:33.650
Please return it to me it's
my country I was in a hurry

00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:35.040
when I lost it yesterday.

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:39.820
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I love the
way that poem rolls and seems

00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:42.760
to pick up momentum as it goes.

00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:45.570
Did you write it in English?

00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:48.560
The poem, did you write
that poem in English?

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.860
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Now.

00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:51.160
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And someone
else translated it for you or?

00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.460
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: You
mean did I write?

00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:53.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Originally you.

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.060
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Oh I wrote it

00:59:55.060 --> 00:59:56.360
in Arabic I always
write in Arabic first.

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
always -- even now.

00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:00.360
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Oh yeah I
always write in Arabic first.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:04.360
You know, now I have the habit of
going on the page first from right

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.150
to left and left to right
like this and this, you know,

01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:12.580
why it drives me crazy
that's one of the reasons.

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:15.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Much more efficient.

01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:18.620
You could write in English clearly.

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:23.100
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: I think so.

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:24.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How
much time do we have?

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.260
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Some sentences
sometimes in English first due

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:37.110
to their cultural connotations
being here sometimes.

01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:42.300
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Your attitude
about America is complex.

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:46.670
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: My attitude.

01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:50.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Your write
America is but a baby of a country,

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:53.130
she doesn't really cause problems,
she always thinks it's easier

01:00:53.130 --> 01:00:55.380
to replace problems
than to fix them.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:57.570
Your washer is broken
the repairman says,

01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:59.650
it's easier to replace
it than fix it.

01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:02.060
Your country is broken
the politician says,

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:04.150
it's easier to replace
it than fix it.

01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:08.250
It's funny, but it's awful.

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:13.350
Other times your attitude
is even more playful

01:01:13.350 --> 01:01:18.340
in a poem called Choices
you begin paper or plastic,

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:21.060
I am not sure how to respond.

01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:25.140 position:56%
I wish I'd had such a choice in
pressing matters long ago when I was

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.640
in the country that cared
less about our choices

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.600
or what kind of bag we used.

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:37.250
A reminder to us in America
that we sometimes don't worry

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:38.850
about the most important things.

01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:50.470
If you'd read part of a poem called
The Foreigner, the second part.

01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:53.690
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Foreigner
I have that [inaudible].

01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:54.990
The second part.

01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:56.290
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes please.

01:01:56.290 --> 01:01:57.590
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: You
know by the way this

01:01:57.590 --> 01:02:02.930
in Arabic The Foreigner it was hard
to translate, it's the foreigner

01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:07.340
and it's feminine and [inaudible]
Arabic every word is either

01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.380
masculine or feminine by
there's a feminine ending.

01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:13.150
I mean [inaudible] like for
example the room is feminine,

01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:18.010
like the moon is masculine and
the sun is feminine and so on.

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:21.830
So and this was the
title like foreigner

01:02:21.830 --> 01:02:25.800
and it's feminine ending
or has feminine ending.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.610
But I don't know why
we couldn't do that,

01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:32.430
I mean we didn't do it
in English that way.

01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:33.730
But anyways.

01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:35.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You would want
something like the foreign woman is

01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:39.480
that what you're trying to
suggest a femininity about it?

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.860
Is that what you're saying?

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:45.540
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: It was [foreign
language] which is the foreigner

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:51.140
or stranger and his feminine ending
as if it's something attached

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.640
to it, it's a double thing.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.050
It's the female foreigner,
is the female foreigner other

01:02:56.050 --> 01:02:58.260
than the masculine specifically.

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:04.930 position:56%
But the way I say it in Arabic as
if this feminine female is attached,

01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:08.140
she's not the second, she's the
second because feminine ending.

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.830
Like I didn't say just
[foreign language]

01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:11.700
which is we have that
[foreign language].

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:16.300
But I said the masculine
foreigner and his feminine ending

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:19.000
which means the female, but I
said it in a complicated way.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:26.420 position:56%
I like to make things complicated,
but sometimes I'm just like a child.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.420
I don't know a thing about
my role in this new play

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:35.350
and all my lines will mean
nothing to the audience

01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:39.230
since they understand neither
my Aramaic nor my Arabic.

01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:43.560
So I'll imitate the gestures of
whoever I encounter on the road

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:48.190
as I guess their facial
expressions under the foreign sky.

01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:52.230
I won't tremble more than a
baby leaving the test tube

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:56.790
against his will and I won't
cry despite all these bodies

01:03:56.790 --> 01:03:59.740
who greet me kindly and carelessly.

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:02.230
I have already seen them in a dream

01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:05.390
like me they rush to
prove they exist.

01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:09.200
They have fingerprints
and memories and wings

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:14.710
and like me they sometimes gets
stricken with boredom and the flu.

01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:17.940
They too depart for
new places though

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:22.020
as tourists and not the immigrants.

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:25.580
It's not enough after all
to complain of the climate

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:28.520
or of my role in this new play.

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.820
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That is you writing

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.050
about the way you feel
in this new place.

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:34.110
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: I think you're
right I have attitude but why.

01:04:34.110 --> 01:04:35.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Like.

01:04:35.410 --> 01:04:39.150
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: No, no you
meant a different way I know that.

01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:44.290
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Like you're in
this new place it's like a play

01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:45.860
and you don't entirely
know the lines,

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:47.490
but you have a role
you have to play.

01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:50.840
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes, I mean
this after all isn't this true

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.930
in the world we have a role.

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:54.230
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:55.530
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: In the world,

01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:58.550
I mean I even have a
poem called a Second Life

01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:02.210
where we all need a second chance

01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:06.800
because in the beginning I thought
we Iraqis need a second life it's

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:09.630
not fair we lived all that way and
we're not given a second chance.

01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:13.050
But then I wrote the
poem after I thought no,

01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:14.690 position:56%
maybe everybody needs a second life.

01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:19.280
So it's like yes, I think
we need that second life.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah,
we all feel like we're

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:21.880
in a play we don't know the lines.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:24.580
In one of your poems
you write outside

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:28.260
of Iraq I often dream
of returning home.

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:30.730
It's still true?

01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:32.200
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Continue
what's after,

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.200
but then I get afraid
that I get caught again.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.500
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, of course.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.960
Do you still dream
of returning home?

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.610
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: You
know, it comes honestly --

01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:43.060
two things come always
in my dream my father,

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.360
my dead father always
comes in my dream

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:50.070
and I always dream that I am back.

01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:54.630
But to be honest always
not happy dream when I'm

01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:57.470
like something happens
that I say oh,

01:05:57.470 --> 01:06:00.980
but my daughter is not here
or something like that.

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:02.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You could go back.

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:06.200
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: I think yes,
I can now is different reasons,

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.850
but I think I can go back.

01:06:08.850 --> 01:06:14.290
I am planning to be honest to go
back north of Iraq specifically

01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:17.530
to visit the dead, not to
visit the living because.

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:18.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles Your own family?

01:06:18.830 --> 01:06:22.510
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: I don't
know if I should oh my God,

01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:24.850
a lot of terrible things,
you know, happening.

01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:31.030
But my grandmother who was very, I
don't know maybe we don't have time

01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:34.910
and we have a minute, two how many?

01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:37.320
Two minutes or that we have?

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:40.200
And my grandmother
who was this figure

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:44.280
who I started my first literature
experience with her she was the one

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:48.550
who was telling me stories over
the roof of our house and all that.

01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:56.530
And back in June 2014, I
watching a video of a group,

01:06:56.530 --> 01:07:01.840
a terrorist group ISIS and they
were destroying these statutes,

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.650
these symbols.

01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:09.610
Not only that they
were destroying graves

01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:13.890
because there were some symbols
on them they didn't understand

01:07:13.890 --> 01:07:18.760
like Aramaic or Hebrew writings
and or crosses or things like that.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:24.750
And so that's why I thought of the
grave of my grandmother which was

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:27.730
in the village north in [inaudible]
that's the village we went

01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:31.810
to when it was war.

01:07:31.810 --> 01:07:37.260
And so I wrote a poem it was
published it's new it's not

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:38.610
in these books it's published

01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:42.830
in poetry My Grandmother's
Grave, it's about that.

01:07:42.830 --> 01:07:51.170
And so that's one reason and there
are mass graveyards now in Sinjar,

01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:56.880
Mount Sinjar mass graveyards
of these --

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:59.330
most of them [inaudible] people.

01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:05.540
And these mass graveyards
are families, are men

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:10.700
and there are women who were not
suitable as sex slaves and children

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:14.800
who refused to be separated
from them.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:19.730
So I want to go and visit the
dead this time not the living,

01:08:19.730 --> 01:08:21.740
that's what I want to do, to go.

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
have to make that trip.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.140
It will be a very difficult
trip on many levels.

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:34.790
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: I think, I
mean I'm serious I planned it

01:08:34.790 --> 01:08:39.990
and everything and end
of May, beginning of June

01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:47.390
and I have a manuscript related
so it would be good to finish this

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:53.230
and have myself to see
things and interview people.

01:08:53.230 --> 01:08:58.430
So I mean I don't promise, but
I'm doing my best to do it.

01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:00.050
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Your
daughter's name is Larisa.

01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:01.350
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Yes.

01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:02.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And she's
mentioned in this poem,

01:09:02.650 --> 01:09:05.000
this is the final lines
of the diary.

01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:15.090
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: It's a great
relief to have my daughter far away

01:09:15.090 --> 01:09:21.100
from danger, from clouds like
corpses, from kidnappers' masks,

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:26.940 position:56%
from long lines at passport offices,
from amputated fingers in the sand.

01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:32.320
Larisa scatters the old pictures
and mixes them with the new ones.

01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.540
She mixes pictures of snowballs
in Michigan with pictures

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:41.700
of a round city with two
rivers, palm trees, poetry, wars,

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:43.830
a thousand and one nights.

01:09:43.830 --> 01:09:46.400
Inside that city was our home.

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:51.270
Inside the home was our garden not
separated from the neighbors even

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:56.450
by a wall and inside that garden
was a raspy flower I will never

01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:58.830
smell again.

01:09:58.830 --> 01:10:00.430
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank you
so much this was lovely.

01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:07.990
&gt;&gt; Dunya Mikhail: Thank you,
thank you for having me,

01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:09.290
I really appreciate this.

01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:10.590
Thanks.

01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:12.020

of the Library of Congress.
