CHIA-YING WANG: The purpose
of this laboratory course

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.150
is to introduce students
with modern techniques

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.010
of experimental
physical chemistry,

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.740
and inorganic chemistry.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.230
One of the projects is
building a spectrometer.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.050
So the students really
build these from scratch.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.440
They really have this
firsthand experience

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.740
about how to build a
homemade optical setup,

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.810
and that's usually
only experience

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.380
for graduate students.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.380
PHIL BROOKS: It was a
really independent project

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.300
putting all the components
together, and we

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.890
had to code up the whole
interface to run the machine,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.350
using special
laboratory software,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.685
and learn about optics,
learn about controls.

00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:45.810
If you're actually doing
state-of-the-art research,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.935
you really need to know
how the machine is working.

00:00:47.935 --> 00:00:51.900
So this project gave all of us
a really in-depth understanding

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.064
of how an absorbance
spectrometer works

00:00:54.064 --> 00:00:55.980
and what sort of things
could go wrong with it

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.230
and what its limitations are
that you might not otherwise

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.730
get.
