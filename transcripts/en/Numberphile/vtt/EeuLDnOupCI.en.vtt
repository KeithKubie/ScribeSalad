00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800
Here comes Cliff's attempt to
make a story that never ends:

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.120
A recursive story - it's a story that swallows itself!

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.600
I'll be my own subtitle.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.360
"Once upon a time, 108 rebels gathered on the lakeshore.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:26.760
Their leader, Song Jiang, turned to his
captain, and commanded: "Tell us a story!"

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:39.460
So the captain began, "Once upon a time,
108 rebels gathered on the lakeshore.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:51.500
Their leader, Song Jiang, turned to his
captain, and commanded: "Captain! Tell us a story!"

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.220
So the captain began, "Once upon a time" -

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.900
Okay, the story keeps swallowing itself.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.000
Ever computer scientist know the difference between 'recursion' where you have something going deeper and

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.060
deeper into its own self, and 'iteration' where you do a repeat of the same thing on slightly different data.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.800
Boy, this will be a challenge for me.
[Sorry, but I don't speak Chinese.]

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.080
I hardly even know any Chinese [yeah, me too] but I'm gonna try doing this in two languages.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.040
[Chinese word for English, I guess] - I'll use English and I'll use [Chinese word for Chinese?]  - Chinese.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.560
And instead of doing it on a ribbon like this
I'm gonna see if I can do it on a Möbius loop.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.300
So here comes Cliff's Möbius story:

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.680
Okay, be prepared for lots of mistakes. I apologise in advance.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.800
The story will be a recursive story that has no
end. But I'll iterate between languages.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.400
If I knew five languages I'd try it with five languages. But let me just make mistakes in two.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.480
"Once upon a time, 108 rebels gathered on the lakeshore.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:21.520
Their leader, Song Jiang, turned to his captain and commanded: "Tell us a story!" (using Chinese).

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.880
So his captain began:

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:39.720
[Presumably the same story as before, in Chinese.]

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.980
[Basically the same story as before]
[Might talk a little bit as well.]

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.040
[Basically the same story as before]
[Hi there, people from the internet!]

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.720
[Basically the same story as before]
[How are you doing?]

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:59.560
[Basically the same story as before]

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.440
"Once upon a time, 108 rebels gathered on the lakeshore."

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.560
And that's on a Möbius loop.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:17.480
You say: "What a weird story!" Well, more that a billion people in China all know this is one of the great stories

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.560
of China where 108 rebels work against the corrupt administration.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:37.720
This book 'Outlaws of the Marsh tells the story of fantastic acrobatics, fantastic rebellion. Each individual -

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.080
there's chapters about people who -- boy, you
wouldn't want to meet them on a street corner.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:57.460
These are guys who - one after another - come along with hatchets, with knives and they are all rebels

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:06.980
who are fighting together under their leader, Song Jiang, who is, of course, badly treated by the administration.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:16.100
I'm heading back to my hot chocolate and I assume that as a math lover, you know about the 'Droste effect'.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:25.380
I assume that as somebody who knows math
you already know that on 'Droste hot cocoa',

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:35.720
on the cocoa box, is a drawing of a woman who's coming in carrying a plate that has a serving of

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:44.460
'Droste hot cocoa' of course, and a box that has her on it, and in the middle of it is a box with her on it.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:52.000
It's a recursive box. Indeed, this kind of recursion in advertising is called the 'Droste effect'.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.340
For those who speak English I'm about to apologise
for my terrible Chinese.
[A lot of mixed English and Chinese coming up.]

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.800
My Chinese is not very good. I have just
about forgotten all of my Chinese.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:17.940
Forty years ago I studied Chinese.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:27.800
I also taught astronomy at Nanjing University

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.060
in 'purple mountain observatory' over in southern China.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:53.440
But right now I've pretty much forgotten my Chinese, so again I apologise, but I still have just happy thoughts

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.480
whenever I try to use Chinese.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.720
...like a thousand made. Come on over, check this out.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.220
Under my house is a,

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.400
is my little forklift robot to go pick Klein bottles from stock.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.760
Tilt the thing, if you look carefully at it, see if I can actually show this...
