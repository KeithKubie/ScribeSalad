00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.510
We'll just look at two of the most dramatic
pictures.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:11.589
One of which is of a jumbo jet at night taken
by what light was available at the airport.

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:17.740
The next slide shows a picture taken from
exactly the same

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.550
view, position but taken by this camera,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.179
which is recording not the light, but the
heat being radiated

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.660
by the different things that it can see.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.400
And you can see that the aircraft itself is
slightly warm

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.240
with respect to the background, at least most
of it is,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.450
its tail plane here isn't you see, but there
you can see.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.300
And you can see the detail, you can see which
airline it belongs to.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.800
And these improvements which have taken place
in the last two or three years

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.920
really have changed this situation out of
recognition,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.660
and we can now actually with this camera,
which is here,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.360
have a look and see what it can see.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.160
And if someone will come and operate the camera

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.140
It's visual presentation is here

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.820
but it's entirely compatible with the BBC
television.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.240
And the signals can be fed straight in

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.080
and so we'll be able to see them on the monitor.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.480
And now you see we've got no light, pretty
well, in the lecture room.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.840
And there you are, all radiating.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.820
Your faces... would you like to hold your
hands up?

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.620
And you see at once there are your hands showing
up, or wave them about.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.800
Even separate fingers are being seen, you
see. Like that.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.740
And so you can see for example if you're guarding
a site

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.140
where you might have intruders,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.920
this will give you a very good picture in
complete darkness.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:04.320
Purely by the heat radiation coming off the,
even just one's face like that.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.560
There are various things it may do, if I can
find...

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.200
Oh, here's a sponge, I'll go out in front
for the moment.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:23.840
And one can, you see, because water evaporating
loses its fastest molecules

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.140
like that, a wet surface is always slightly
cooler than the surface, than the body,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.520
than the things around it.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.360
And there you can see immediately that the
sponge is really quite cold,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.960
because you see my hand is quite warm but
this is blacker than anything,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.200
anything else it can see, just because of
the slight lowering in surface temperature

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.980
because of the cooling produced by evaporation.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.900
So there is that.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.740
I wonder what happens if we put this in front
of it.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:07.200
Ah, yes, this is beautiful. You see now we
see the Royal Institution as black on white.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.340
Now much of that difference is not due to
the fact that those

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.080
letters are at a different temperature, it
may be partly that,

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.940
but one of the effects which is very clear
here,

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.620
is that the black is showing up there,

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.579
whereas if we have the visual picture, and
I think we can now have the lights up,

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:37.220
you'll see that it in fact is light on dark.
And the reason is that,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.840
and it's a very, you probably learnt this
rule,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.160
who knows, who'd know the rules that good
absorbers make good radiators?

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.840
Well you see here is a case in point.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.800
The black is a good absorber, the metal is
a good reflector, bad radiator,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.279
and the thermal picture you see shows it quite
correctly the other way around,

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:04.900
because the black is radiating more effectively
than the white.
