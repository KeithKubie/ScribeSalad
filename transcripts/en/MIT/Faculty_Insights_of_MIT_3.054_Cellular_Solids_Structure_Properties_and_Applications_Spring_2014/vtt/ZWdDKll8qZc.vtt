LORNA GIBSON: So I think
one of the special things

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.910
about this course
and about my kind

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.616
of research on
cellular materials

00:00:11.616 --> 00:00:13.490
is that I spend a fair
amount of time talking

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.630
about materials in nature.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.960
So I talk about wood,
for instance, and what

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.320
it is about the cellular
structure that gives rise

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.950
to the density dependence
of wood properties

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.220
and the anisotropy
in wood properties.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.140
I talk about
trabecular bone, and I

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.090
talk about the structure
and properties of the bone,

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.050
but also we do a
little bit of modeling

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.090
on how you might look at
bone loss and osteoporosis.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.370
So if you lose a certain
fraction of the bone

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.140
density, what residual
strength would

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.570
you expect the bone to have.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.500
We have a project
on bamboo right now.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.210
We talk about the
structure of bamboo.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.810
Bamboo is actually a grass.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.590
And this is a Chinese species
of bamboo called moso bamboo,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.090
and you can see how
big this one is.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.274
They even get bigger, maybe
six or eight inches across.

00:01:00.274 --> 00:01:01.690
And what we're
interested in doing

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.950
is making something called
structural bamboo products.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.020
And this is an example of a
bamboo oriented strand board.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.419
So the same way
people take wood,

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:11.835
and they chop wood
up into strands

00:01:11.835 --> 00:01:15.180
and make oriented strand boards
for housing construction,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.810
you could, in principal, do
the same thing with bamboo.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.762
And we have a project
that's in collaboration

00:01:19.762 --> 00:01:22.220
with some colleagues at the
University of British Columbia.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.595
They're the ones
who are actually

00:01:23.595 --> 00:01:25.950
making the bamboo
oriented strand board.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.750
And with some architects in
England, in Cambridge, England,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.270
we're looking at things like how
you might modify wood building

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.500
codes that talk about
wood structural products,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.202
how you would modify that for
bamboo structural products.

00:01:37.202 --> 00:01:38.660
And what we're
doing here at MIT is

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.694
we're looking at the
structure of the bamboo

00:01:40.694 --> 00:01:42.860
and doing some modeling of
the mechanical properties

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.450
of the bamboo itself.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.370
So that's one example.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.330
Here's another example.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.320
This is a bamboo laminate.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.986
So this is a little bit like
a glue laminated wood member,

00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:53.360
but in fact, this
one is made out

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.970
of bamboo instead
of out of wood.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.270
So it's the same kind of idea.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.770
Let's see.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.550
We've also had a project
in the past on cork.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.300
So this is a cork
from a wine bottle,

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.690
and we've looked at that.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.950
Cork has an unusual
mechanical property.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.539
You know, if you take a rubber
band and you pull on it,

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.280
if you can make it longer this
way, it gets narrower that way.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.420
Well, if you load cork
in one direction, if you,

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.430
say, pull on it
or compress it, it

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.182
doesn't get any
wider or narrower

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:21.140
in the other direction.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.180
It just stays the
same kind of size.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.070
And you can show
that that's related

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.590
to the structure of the cells.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.860
The cells are like
little bellows,

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.360
or like a little concertina.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.494
So you can imagine if you
have a little concertina,

00:02:32.494 --> 00:02:34.410
and you push on it this
way, it doesn't really

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.410
get any bigger that way
or smaller that way.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.810
It just stays the
same dimension.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.768
And the cork cells look
a little bit like that,

00:02:39.768 --> 00:02:41.160
and that's why they do that.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.360
So we have all these
natural materials.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.690
We talk a little about
the hierarchical structure

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.430
in plants.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.750
The cell walls are
fiber composites,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.680
and then there's a
cellular structure.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.939
And plant materials have a
sort of hierarchical structure,

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.730
with several different
levels of hierarchy,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.344
and we talk about that
in the class as well.

00:02:59.344 --> 00:03:00.760
And we talk a
little bit about why

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.590
that makes these materials
mechanically efficient

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.350
and how you might look
at designing engineering

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.580
materials based on that.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.760
So there's a little bit of
biomimicking in the class

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.450
as well.
