&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.420


00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.440
&gt;&gt; Let me say, first of
all, that Michele is here

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.886
with a couple members of her
posse who I have to recognize.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.083
One of them is from the
McNeil Lehrer News Hour.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.566
It's Gwen Ifill who's
right down here,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.233
who's tried to remain anonymous.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.600
[ Applause ]

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.666
I do that not only because I
love Gwen and respect her work

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.700
but because she and my wife also
went to Simmons College and I have

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.926
to be able to go home
tonight [laughing].

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.613
And also I want to recognize
another one of the great reporters

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.073
of the Washington Post,
Athelia Knight.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.540
[ Applause ]

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.766
Now, I had the distinct
pleasure some 20 years ago

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.013
of hiring Michele Norris
at the Washington Post.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.066
And we interviewed
her at a convention

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.800
of the National Association
of Black Journalists.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.423
And the person who was directly
responsible for bringing her

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.143
onto the staff who worked for me has
most recently been the chief speech

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.986
writer for Secretary of
State Hillary Rodham Clinton,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.646
Lissa Muscatine.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.263
And when I asked Lissa after
she had breakfast with Michele,

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.763
So what did you think of her?

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.030
She said, She's incredibly smart.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.363
She's really very good.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.480
And, when she talks, she sounds like
a black Lauren Bacall [laughing].

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.990
Because she has this deep
voice which, of course,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.093
those of you who knew
Catherine Rehm [phonetic],

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.713
Mrs. Rehm also had a deep voice.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.380
You know, we'd say,
How are you, Mrs. Rehm?

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.113
[Deep voice] I am fine.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.580
How are you?

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.980
Okay. That will work.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.180
Catherine Wingus [phonetic]
does not have a deep voice.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.380
That doesn't really matter.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.180
You know, the interesting
thing about Michele Norris is

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.046
that we introduce her in the long
shadow of the current headquarters

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.183
of the National Council
of Negro Women.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.103
And Michele, through her
work, has really been someone

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.026
who I'm sure the pioneers
in that organization,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.853
Mary McCloud Bethune, Dorothy I.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.120
Height would be very, very proud of.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.656
Many, many reporters who
are really very good come

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.213
to the Washington Post newsroom.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.236
Most of them do not win
the Livingston Award

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.796
for Young Journalists.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.596
Michele Norris did.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.730
Most of them write --

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.750
[ Applause ]

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.343
Most of them write a lot of stories

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.310
that no one really pays
too much attention to.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.716
Michele Norris wrote
stories that the President

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.936
of the United States paid
attention to and talked about.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.623
And the fact that she writes now an
American story, American memoirs,

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.083
her own memoirs which tells
us something about the nation

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.496
in which we live, the good as well
as the bad is really a tribute

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.256
to her and to a whole
cadre of young writers

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.593
who are telling us very,
very important stories.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.406
Some 20 years ago, I had
the distinct privilege

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.136
of introducing a young
promising reporter

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.493
to the newsroom of
the Washington Post.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.646
This afternoon, with great pride,
I have the privilege of presenting

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.473
to you an award winning reporter
and an author, Michele Norris.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.510
[ Applause ]

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.450
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Milton.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.250
Boy, you know, when we
met all those years ago --

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.583
we're not going to
say really how many.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.116
&gt;&gt; Please don't.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.060
&gt;&gt; I never dreamed that
I would be standing here.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.096
Milton mentioned a few members of
my posse that are in the audience.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.020
I have to call out some very
important members of my posse

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.760
that are also at the fringe
of the audience over there:

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.800
my husband, Broderick Johnson;

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.300
[ Applause ]

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.106
our son, Broderick Johnson, Jr.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.040
;

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.320
And the littlest people
in my household,

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.553
Norris Johnson and Asia Johnson.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.243
And they're both saying, Mom,
why are you doing this right now?

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.030
[ Applause ]

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.706
And they're with their god
mommy, Marcia Jones Ferguson.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.460


00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.510
[ Applause ]

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.746
I'm calling out my family

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.093
because this is a --
this is a family memoir.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.933
And, in many ways, it's
an accidental memoir.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.943
It's not the book that
I set out to write.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.423
You see, I thought that there was
this interesting conversation going

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.330
on across the country in
the lead-up to the election

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.010
of President Barack Obama and
in the wake of his election.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.550
And I thought that this
conversation was not the one

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:00.183
that you were hearing
necessarily on the evening news.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.880
It wasn't the one you were
hearing on cable television.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.383
It was the conversation
that was out of earshot.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.856
It was taking place
in private spaces.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.813
And I wanted to try to
chronicle that conversation,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.100
to eavesdrop on it and then to
write a series of essays on that.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.310
When I began listening to the hidden
conversation in my own family,

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.530


00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.683
I began hearing profound things.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.816
I realize that my parents kept
certain things from my generation.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:37.100
There were secrets that they kept to
themselves, secrets they locked away

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.946
because they didn't want to
clutter our path forward.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.446
They didn't want to saddle us with
their pain and their frustration.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.850


00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.050
And at first I thought that
these things might be an anecdote

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.763
in that book that I was planning
to write about other people

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.460
and how other people
talk about race.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:04.816
But, over time, I couldn't let go
of the things that I was learning.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.690
The more I learned,
the more I had to know.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:10.016
And the more that I knew,
the more I had to learn.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.296
These stories got up on top of me
and they wouldn't get off my back.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.616
And so I had to pivot, and I wound

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.350
up writing these --
this accidental memoir.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.930
And among the things I learned
was that my father was shot

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.680
by a police officer in 1946
when he was a young man,

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.933
when he had returned to Birmingham,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.333
Alabama after his service
in World War II.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.066
Now, you noticed that I
paused before I said that;

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.493
because I've written the
book, I've told the story,

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.130
but I never will get used to saying
that sentence, My father was shot.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.936
Apparently, he chose not to
say that sentence to anyone.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:59.970
He didn't tell the kids.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.890
He didn't even tell my mother.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.276
I learned of this only recently, and
she learned of this only recently.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.086
And, if you think of all the
conversations, if you're married,

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:10.613
you know what I mean; and if you're

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.546
in an intimate relationship,
you know what I mean.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.613
all the conversations you
have in intimate moments,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.480
how you think you know
everything about a person;

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:18.590
and then imagine realizing
that something that monumental,

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.903
that profound was kept from you.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.963
So, when I wrote this memoir,

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:28.466
I wound up pulling family
members along on this journey.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.926
And they didn't necessarily
buy a ticket.

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.903
And so we had to lock
arms and do this together.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.560


00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.073
My father, when he was a young
man, after serving in the military,

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.900
in a segregated military at that
time, returned to Birmingham

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.526
as did many black war veterans.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.593
Black war veterans were -- black
World War II veterans were streaming

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:55.656
into Birmingham and
many other cities.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:57.836
And they were wearing the uniform.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:00.470
They had a certain pride
after serving in the military.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.270
They had greater expectations.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.906
They wanted to participate
fully in civic life.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.033
They wanted to vote.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.666
And they faced in Birmingham

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.200
and in many other cities a
white wall of resistance.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.510


00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.930
My father was a postal worker.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.596
He was a very gentle man.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.330
If you met him, one of the
first words you would use

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:26.330
to describe him would probably be
kind, maybe funny, probably calm.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.610
He was someone who liked
things a certain way.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.116
He was always dressed in
exactly a certain way.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.843
When he wore his postal
uniform, everything was laid out.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.370
When he went out, you could
practically cut your finger

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:43.770
on the crease of his pants.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:44.370
He took care of his
home beautifully.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:46.170
He was very quiet, very reserved.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:48.920
But, in 1946 when a police
officer tried to stop him

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:55.020
from entering a public building, a
building he had the right to enter,

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:55.663
he did something that
was as surprising

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.530
to me as learning he was shot.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:08:59.913
He stood up to that policeman
and he paid a price for it.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.053
A scuffle ensued.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.453
He was shot in the leg.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.586
I never knew any of this.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:09.120
My mother never knew any of this.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.586
But it turned out she,
too, had a secret.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.050


00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.226
She never talked about
something from her past.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.993
Her mother, in the late 1950s --
in the late 1940s -- excuse me --

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.346
and the early 1950s had spent years
traveling the Midwest doing pancake

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.446
demonstrations, dressed
up as Aunt Jemima

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.463
with a hoop skirt and a head scarf.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:40.533
My mother didn't talk about this

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.733
because it made her feel
a certain degree of shame.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.020
Now, when I learned of this, I
didn't immediately go to that place.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:49.713
I didn't immediately feel shame.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.250
I felt a certain amount of
fascination and a great deal

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.426
of surprise; because the
woman that I remember,

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.860
the Ion Brown that I remember,
was someone who was very elegant.

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:04.170
She always had pastel
dresses or church suits.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.506
She was very bossy, and she
used that to great effect

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:09.980
to control her grandchildren
but also to do some great things

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.940
in my hometown of Minneapolis.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.526
She founded a senior citizen
center that still bears her name,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.533
and she was always getting
awards from the city.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.656
And I remember, when I was young,
she got the key to the city.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:24.343
And she was fussing at mayor Fraser

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.216
because something wasn't
happening fast enough.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.136
That's the kind of
woman that she was.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.070
She was always dressed to the nines.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:33.706
She would wear -- now, some of you

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.500
in the audience may remember
the days when women would go out

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.846
and their shoes matched
their handbag.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:41.736
You would never, ever, ever wear
brown shoes and a black handbag.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:45.163
I have black shoes
and a brown handbag;

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.673
that would be like a major
fashion faux pas at that time.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.650
So the shoes matched the handbag,
and the handbag had a little pair

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:56.390
of gloves that kind of peeked
out over the side of the purse.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:56.980
And she always had like a silk scarf

00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.113
that would cover her
well-coiffed hair.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.253
And she would tie that
scarf underneath and very --

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.906
sort of "Jackie O" style.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:06.916
But when I learned about
the work she had done,

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:12.250
I had to imagine what it must have
been like for her to get dressed

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.976
up as Aunt Jemima and wear
a different kind of scarf.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.456
You probably couldn't
call it a scarf.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:21.000
Maybe call it a kerchief;
maybe you'd call it a rag.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.023
And she'd have to reach up behind
her head and put that rag back here

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.470
and tie it up on top of her head.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.786
Now, I don't know what kind
of hard bargains she made

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:31.943
with herself before she dressed up,
before she hiked up that hoop skirt.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.696
But I was fortunate in
that I found a newspaper --

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:40.576
I found some newspaper
clippings that described her work

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.213
under the headline Aunt
Jemima's Coming to Town.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:44.900
I saw her picture.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.100
And then it became very real for me.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.446
And I also saw what she told
a reporter at that time,

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.523
and it was like her speaking
to me almost from the grave.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:54.423
And there was no shame
in her description.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.940
Now, again, I don't know what, you
know, what went through her head

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.240
when she was in front of the mirror.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.240
But, when she talked
to the reporter,

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.640
she talked about how
she used that position

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.800
to serve as a kind of ambassador.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.120
She had a six-state region:
Minnesota, Wisconsin,

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:11.273
Michigan, the Dakotas, and Iowa.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:13.740
And, when she went
to these small towns,

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:15.740
she knew that she was
facing an audience

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:17.873
that didn't see very
many people of color.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.940
So she spoke a certain way.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:21.406
She carried herself a certain way.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.540
She said that she would sing gospel
songs because she wanted people

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.443
in these towns to know that she
was a church woman, "chuch woman,"

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.903
as she probably would say.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.426
And she would speak in a way
that probably was quite different

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.263
than the Aunt Jemima that people in
those small towns would encounter

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:38.110
if they picked up a
magazine of the day.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.820
Because Quaker Oats, the company she
worked for, was a huge advertiser

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.510
and they advertised in
all the women's magazines.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:46.096
And the Aunt Jemima you would meet
in the women's magazines was someone

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.406
who wore the head scarf and
the hoop skirt but she spoke

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:56.160
in a certain slave patois that was
totally made up by advertising men.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.446
Her catch phrase was lawd --

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.393
her catch phrase was
"I's in town, honey."

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:02.570
And she would talk
about "Lawsy [phonetic],

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:04.436
my pancakes are tantalizingly
delicious."

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.266
And they would spell this out
phonetically so you could see

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.206
that she didn't exactly
use the King's English.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:11.436
Well, apparently when Ion
Brown was serving pancakes,

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:15.963
she did use something that was a
bit closer to the king's English.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:21.710
So Quaker Oats, in that sense,
got more than they bargained for.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:22.950


00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.760
My mother hated this story.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.360
She didn't want me to talk about it.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.826
And I had to wait her out
because, once I learned about it,

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.760
I knew I had to learn more.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.123
And I knew eventually it would
have to be a stop along my journey.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:37.530
And finally she started to
give me signals and clues

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.496
that she was ready
to talk about this.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:42.936
And she started telling me
not just about grandmother

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.203
but about her experiences.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:48.576
And there were yet more surprises.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:50.596
My father's from Birmingham;
my mother's from Minnesota.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:52.850
Her family has lived in
Minnesota for several generations.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.186
They were for a time the only black
family in Alexandria, Minnesota.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:58.900
My grand --

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:00.870
my great-great-great-grandfather
was a barber.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:02.850
When she and my father purchased
their home on the south side

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.810
of Minneapolis, the
home that I grew up in,

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.136
they weren't exactly
welcomed by the neighbors.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:11.276
Now, I didn't know any of this.

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.610
I grew up in a highly integrated
neighborhood; took it for granted,

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:16.593
this little rainbow community on
the south side of Minneapolis.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.860
But it wasn't exactly a rainbow
community when they moved in.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:21.900
They purchased their home in
1961, the year I was born.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.286
I guess I shouldn't
say that out loud.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.320
[ Laughing ]

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.573
But they were the first black family
to purchase a home on that block

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:33.860
on the south side of Minneapolis.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.193
They were blockbusters.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.873
Now, in some cases, blockbusters
were recruited by the NAACP

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:40.710
or the Urban League or
civic organizations.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:43.716
In this case, they were
recruited by no one.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:45.850
They wanted to live where
they wanted to live.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.916
They wanted to live near water.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:49.716
It being Minnesota,
there was a lot of water

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:51.116
and they wanted to be close to it.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.116
They wanted to send their
kids to certain schools.

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:55.810
So they purchased this house, stucco
Tudor house on the south side.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:02.556
And, immediately, every neighbor
whose property line touched ours

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.260
moved out or at least
tried to move out.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:07.630
Because those that didn't
move quick enough found

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.630
that it was awfully hard to sell.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.183
I discovered these
stories by accident.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.090
My parents had been carrying
these around for years.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:22.330
But once I finally gave them
permission to talk about this --

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.330
I never had the chance to
talk to my father about this.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:26.183
He took his secret to his grave.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:28.593
But once my mother started
talking about these things,

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.160
through her strength
and through her wisdom

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.140
and through her great courage,
she started to share her stories.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:36.643
And some of them were quite
painful; and some of them,

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.116
frankly, were delightful.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:40.983
And I'd like to share one
with you, if you don't mind.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.450


00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:45.606
My parents moved into
their home within a week.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.180
And, as I said, the white families
whose property line touched ours

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.220
soon put their homes up for sale.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:58.003
Three who owned houses across from
my parents also decided to decamp.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:59.123
As my parents celebrated
their new home

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.786
with the picnic supper amid
boxes in the living room,

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:04.686
their neighbors furiously burned
the dial: calling each other,

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:07.726
calling my folk's mortgage
lending to complain,

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.206
and eventually calling
real estate agents

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.006
to put their homes
up for sale pronto.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:14.770
Mom says she watched
the white flight

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.836
with a mixture of anger
and amusement.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:19.490
The desperation of her new neighbors

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:24.623
to sell gave her an opportunity
for a little mischief.

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:26.860


00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:31.233
Every time a real estate agent
pulled up with a prospective buyer,

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:31.490
she would send my older
sisters, Marguerite

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.603
and Cindy, out to play in the yard.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.510
[ Laughing ]

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.380
Or she would saunter out herself,
holding her back or stretching

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.586
out her arms -- hmm -- so
anyone could plainly see

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:51.356
that another child was on the way.

00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:54.290
That child was me.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:57.500
My sisters and I never knew
any of this until recently,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.150
but now Mom loves telling the story.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:03.646
I'd wait until they got inside
the house and had time to check

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.473
out the bedrooms and
look inside the closets.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.563
And right about the moment
I thought that they were

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:10.240
in the kitchen giving
it a real good look see,

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.500
I'd say to myself, "Showtime."

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.510
[ Laughing ]

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:18.573
So I learned a lot of
things that made me laugh.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.980
Some of them tickled me.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.313
But many of them made me cry.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.313
Many of them made me curious.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.980
Many of them made me think
about the country I lived in

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.546
and what I really didn't
know or didn't understand

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.866
and how I was shaped, not just
by all the advice that I got

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.190
from my parents and
the love and the wisdom

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.893
but how I might have also been
shaped by the weight of silence,

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.140
all the things that were never said.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.586
You see, I'm left with this image
of my father and his secret,

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.290
of a man who was carrying
around a weight all his life,

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.133
a big heavy 50-pound barbell
that none of us could see

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:04.730
but he was quite aware of, dragging
it around and trying very hard not

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.483
to let the world know
what was behind him.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.173
I see that image almost
like a shadow next

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.880
to the man that I remember.

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.636
And, when I went back and tried
to understand what Birmingham was

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.443
like in 1946, I realized that,
despite the horror of what happened

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.803
to him, that he was actually lucky.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.040
Black veterans were returning
to a country that they loved

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.740
but didn't always love them back.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.686
I learned that, in the
first six months of 1946 --

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.063
excuse me, the first
six weeks of 1946,

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.950
that period in which
my father was shot,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.533
that half a dozen black veterans
were killed by police officers in

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.446
and around the city of Birmingham.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.466
I learned that, throughout the
year in 1946, black veterans

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:59.253
around the country were beaten and
burned and maimed and castrated

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:05.023
and lynched and blinded
and, in some cases, killed.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.206
In fact, it was the blinding of
a veteran named Isaac Woodard,

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.620
three hours after he was honorably
discharged, that so moved,

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:16.583
so incensed President Harry Truman
that he created a commission

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.183
that ultimately led to the full
integration of the military.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.743
I did not know this.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:24.676
I'm ashamed to say I did
not know more about this.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.476
But what I know now is that my
father was part of a generation

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.226
that experienced horrible things
but didn't let that define them.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.083
I called my book The Grace
of Silence for a reason,

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:39.050
and it's not the just
because they kept silent

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.876
about what they experienced.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.410
I realized that a group of
people, a cohort, really,

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.996
that had every reason to
be angry at the world,

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.526
every reason to be
disappointed, every reason perhaps

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:59.526
to live their life as malcontents,
instead chose to look back not

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:01.046
with anger -- at least not
look back and hold that anger

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.333
in such a way that it was manifest.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.533
They decided to look
forward with hope.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:10.766
They decided to show America what
they could be and, in doing so,

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.140
decided to show America
what it could be

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.380
by leading lives of utter rectitude.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:23.413
They put their hope and their faith
in their children, in my generation.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:23.790
And they chose not to arm us
with their rage but, instead,

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:26.916
to arm us with their ambitions.

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:30.383
They wanted us to soar.

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.716
And, if you want your children
to soar, you don't send them

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.116
out into the world with
boulders in their pockets.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.313
And so that is why I call this
book The Grace of Silence.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.630
But I hope that you will
read it and buy it --

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.440
that's a line that bears
repeating [laughing].

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.040
I hope that you will
buy it and read it.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:54.316
And I hope that, when you
do, that perhaps you decide

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.766
to exercise the grace of
silence in a different form,

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.526
and that is to listen to
people in your own lives,

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.940
to capture your own histories.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.513
The thread that runs through
this book is a simple question:

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.700
How well do we really know
the people who raised us?

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:12.510
You know, they keep things from
us not because they're dishonest

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.656
but because they want
the best for us.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.856
They're very careful
about what they say.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.523
And sometimes when you're
actually ready to capture

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.056
that history, it's too late.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:24.190
They're gone.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.323
That's what happened in my case.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.923
I had to go through this
anthropological exercise to find

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.256
out what happened to my father.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.190
I'm lucky.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:35.856
I'm honored that I had the chance to
sit down and talk about my history

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:36.456
with my mother and with
other elders in my family.

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:39.056
So I hope that you will consider
practicing a special grace

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.390
of silence in that sense but also

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.856
in another sense: to
hear each other out.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:44.590
Because, in doing this work,
I went back and I tried

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.866
to understand how life was lived
on both sides of the color line.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:49.123
I tried to talk about race
and racial attitudes today.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.236
And I heard things that
made my hair stand on end.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:00.140
I heard people talk about how
they hated people of another race;

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.006
how they weren't ready to have a
black family in the White House;

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.360
how they thought that things might
have been better under segregation.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.893
I learned things and I heard things

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:10.770
that I didn't necessarily
agree with but I listened.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.176
And we don't always do that.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.033
When someone says something,
speaks candidly,

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.213
if they say something
that's impolitic,

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.613
particularly if it involves
race, we tend to bark them down.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:25.196
We send them back to their corner.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:28.396
How dare you say that.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.796
Sometimes we have to listen.

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:32.663
Sometimes you have to go to
the table, stay at the table,

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:33.463
sit down at the table
and remain there,

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:36.396
even when someone says
something that you don't like;

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:41.330
even when someone says something
that might make your stomach turn.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:45.296
That is exercising the grace
of silence in a different way.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.150
And so I hope this book, in the end,
even though it's called The Grace

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:53.176
of Silence, may be the first step
on a journey that will lead you

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:59.046
as individuals and maybe in
some small way us, as a nation,

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.200
towards something called
a great conversation.

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:04.546
And I'm hoping that we can have
a bit of a conversation today.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:05.983
I wanted to make sure that we left
time for questions and answers.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:10.193
And so, if there are any
questions, I'll try to be as honest

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.360
as I can in answering them.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:17.510
[ Applause ]

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:32.210
Thank you.

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:35.210
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Miss Martin.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:38.143
I, too, have found some
secrets in my family.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:39.450
My mother and my grandfather told me

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:42.483
about something just
before they passed away.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.883
And most of my family are now gone,

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:46.480
and I'm not married
with no children.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.880
And I found out I have a few
family members who've made history.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.336
But once I started doing
genealogy research recently,

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:55.976
and I put it on the back
burner for a long time

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:57.613
because it's emotional -- I now
have about seven family members

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:00.846
who have made history in some way.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:05.246
And I can go back to
1600 now, my family.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.160
&gt;&gt; Wow. Good for you.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.760
&gt;&gt; Oh, my gosh.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.760
I'm so excited.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.626
So my question is: How
do you begin to write

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.760
about your genealogy research?

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:16.680
I mean, can you talk a little bit
about ghostwriters and publishers

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.056
and editors and how do
you bring this about?

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:24.756
Because I understand it can
be quite expensive to do.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:25.473
So, economically, I mean,
how do you get started

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.086
with something like that?

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.420
&gt;&gt; One sentence at a
time; one word at a time.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.686
I mean, I don't know very
much about ghostwriters.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.686
I know that through self-publishing
and through the proliferation

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:40.150
of smaller houses, it's become
easier to get published as a writer.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.826
So I think that there's
probably a lot of information

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:46.913
that you can get even here at
the National Book Festival.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.036
But I can talk about
to you about writing

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:51.056
because I have more
experience with that.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:53.723
And a writer writes.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:54.533
And it's one word and
one sentence at a time.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.780
And we often think that
writers are those other people.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:01.776
For a long time, I did, even though
I swim in words all day long,

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:05.956
first as a newspaper reporter, then
in television, now on the radio.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:08.916
And I tell you, when
someone gave me a badge today

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:09.983
that said author, I almost swooned.

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:13.116
Because I thought, oh!

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:14.516
New adjective that
applies to me [laughing].

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.583
I mean, I'm not used to that.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:18.236
But we all have stories,
and we can all tell them.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.520
And so I just encourage
you to write.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.673
And, if you're intimidated by a
blank page, write in a journal.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.083
When I did some of the
writing I did for this book,

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:30.593
I had to find my authentic
voice as a writer.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.096
So sometimes I would
write in email form.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.650
I would pretend like
I was sending --

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:36.873
literally, I would call up an
email window; and I would pretend

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.116
like I was sending an email
to my husband, Broderick;

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:42.113
or to my best pal, Gwen; or
to, you know, a family member

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:45.783
that I was trying to
elicit information from.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:48.323
And I would write an email because
I felt free to use bad punctuation

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:53.116
and sort of say the things
that I would normally say.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.420
And then I would cut and
paste and move it into Word

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.480
and then turn it into English.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:00.780
So, you know, whatever you have
to do to tap into that voice;

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.560
but I will say one last thing.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.826
A writer does write and a
writer writes every day.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:06.893
Because it's a muscle; and the more

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.226
that you use it, the
more that it builds.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.216
And if you don't use
it, it does atrophy.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:12.850
So I empower you to
write your story.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:16.423
May the force be with you.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:18.510
[ Applause ]

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:22.050
&gt;&gt; Hi, Michele.

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.383
Thank you very much.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:26.516
It was very inspiring.

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:27.153
I wanted to ask you a question
that involves the craft also.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.746
Was The Grace of Silence
your working title?

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:34.780
&gt;&gt; No.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.780
&gt;&gt; How long ago did you start,

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:38.446
and how did you get
that authentic voice?

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:40.646
And I just need to
preface this by saying --

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:41.933
talk about six degrees
of separation --

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.893
I met Miss Brown by the River
Raisin in Monroe, Michigan.

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:48.493
&gt;&gt; Wait. My grandmother, Ion Brown?

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.293
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, yes.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:52.226
Aunt Jemima was coming to town.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:54.360
It was my first year of teaching.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:56.826
I had just graduated
from Michigan State,

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:58.560
and I was their first black teacher.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.960
And she spoke the King's --

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:02.293
&gt;&gt; Wait. You met my grandmother?

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.693
&gt;&gt; Yes! That's how
old I am [laughing].

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:09.036
Six degrees of separation here.

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.370
Monroe, Michigan by
the River Raisin, okay?

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:16.510
[ Laughing ]

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:19.183
&gt;&gt; If it was your grandmother,
that's who I met.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:21.050
Michigan.

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:23.316
&gt;&gt; Oh, my goodness.

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:24.783
&gt;&gt; And she spoke the
King's English to me;

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:27.083
because I'm wondering why is Aunt
Jemima here in Monroe, Michigan.

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:32.150
I was the first black
teacher for the city.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.366
There was a first black
teacher for the county.

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.756
We both ended up at the Episcopal
church, and they thought it was

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:40.840
because they were nice to
us when that just happened

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.353
to have been our religion.

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:45.820
But the point I wanted to make --

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:48.620
[ Laughing ]

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:53.686
-- is that it was Aunt Jemima
talking to me as a person that I

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:55.903
"got it," because I knew
she was making a living

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:00.510
when she was doing that.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:04.510
And a couple months later,
I was asked to play the maid

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:08.370
in a school play put on by
the Monroe school system.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.840
And I said no because
of Aunt Jemima.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.813
Because I didn't have to
play a maid any longer.

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:22.283
Just because she was doing that,
it was clear it was a role.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.213
And she didn't have
any shame about it.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:25.940
She was putting food on
the table or whatever.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:27.780
&gt;&gt; Serving pancakes
and making bacon.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:30.126
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And she did not
speak a dialect to me.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.166
We had a conversation.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:34.193
So it made my hair stand up
on my arm to hear that story.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.206
&gt;&gt; Oh, my goodness.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:39.340
&gt;&gt; So I definitely
will get the book.

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.740
So my question again was --

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:43.940
[ Laughter ]

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.806
What was your working title?

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.273
&gt;&gt; What's your name?

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:49.940
&gt;&gt; Gloria.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:51.406
&gt;&gt; Okay. Don't go way
when we're done.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.740
We need to talk, obviously.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:55.606
The working title initially
was Say What?

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.600
And that was when I was planning
to write this other book.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:28:59.343
And I liked it because
it had a double entendre.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:03.113
Among people of color, "say
what" is sort of a term

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.786
of slang, like, Say what?

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:06.366
You know, or sometimes
it's incredibly, Say what?!

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.340
And then it also was sort
of plaintive, you know,

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.920
for people who were having a hard
time figuring out what to say.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.720
What do I say?

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.986
Say what? Say what?

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.720
I'm walking through eggshells.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.186
How do I say anything.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.253
But, then, when the book turned, it
didn't seem like the right title.

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:32.143
It seemed flippant, too much like
a game show almost or something.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.213
So we thought about You
Don't Say for a time.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:38.536
And, actually, I was
with my children.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.710
We were hiking in a canyon.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.833
And we were so far away from
civilization, it was silent.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:46.516
And you could hear the wind create
almost like a certain kind of music.

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:50.426
And the title came to
me, The Grace of Silence.

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.700
And that's where we are.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:54.566
And how did I find
my authentic voice?

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.593
It was basically just trying
to write the way I write emails

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.406
to Gwen all day [chuckling].

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.406
That's how I told the story.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:03.710
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:06.176
&gt;&gt; Two more questions.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:07.310
&gt;&gt; Okay. We can take
two more questions.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.843
&gt;&gt; Michele, I'm very much looking
forward to reading your book.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.033
My question is: How did your
reporting background and skills

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:13.593
as a journalist inform
your work on this memoir?

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.173
And, then, also, what were the
memoirs that you found inspiring

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:19.886
or useful as a guide
in your own writing?

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.220
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.886
I had to shift my reporter's
hat when working on this

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.713
because I couldn't
stand on the sidelines.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.480
I had to get inside the story.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.280
I had to begin a lot
of sentences with "I,"

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:33.903
which I generally don't do a
lot of in my role as a host.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.656
I'm a host, not a columnist.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:39.300
But it helped me do
a lot of digging.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:44.633
It helped me do the kind of
investigative work that I had

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.900
to do to unpack this story.

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:48.566
And I think it helped inform the
kind of story I ultimately told,

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:51.923
in that I tried to understand
things from lots of different sides.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:56.730
So I very much wanted
to know what life was

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:00.330
like for the police
officers involved

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:00.746
in the shooting, where they lived.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.683
And I realized that their
lives were a lot similar,

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:04.943
they were very similar to the lives

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:07.276
that my grandparents
lived in Birmingham.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:09.646
And maybe if the color -- the
color line wasn't 100 miles high

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:11.963
and 100 yards thick, they
would have seen that, you know,

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:17.516
something of themselves
in each other.

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:21.310
In terms of memoirs that
were inspiring to me,

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.100
The Color of Water was something
that very much helped me,

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.613
that the courage that he
had in telling that story.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.186
And my mother had given me --
actually, she didn't give it to me.

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.953
I have it [laughing], I should say.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:42.956
The book Eleanor and Franklin,
which is not truly a memoir.

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:46.896
But, in that book, Eleanor
Franklin talks about the letters

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:50.043
that she received from
service members.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.480
And I wound up going back and
looking at a lot of those letters.

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:58.340
It's not exactly memoir, but it is
a way of telling their own stories.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.866
And those two things really
did have a strong impact on me,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.403
the letters of the serviceman,
black servicemen, in particular.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.596
Thank you for your question.

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:13.063
&gt;&gt; So you spoke a lot about
burdens that were not given to you.

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:21.850
And so that's kind of
like the negative space,

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:26.473
the white space on the paper.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:28.816
What I'm curious about is --

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.066
is if you can tell us
what messages you got,

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:37.090
what positive messages you got from
your parents and your grandparents

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:41.883
that have -- that have -- that have
driven you to where you are, I mean.

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:43.963
&gt;&gt; You know, I think I
might have been a little bit

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:45.466
of a different person if I had known
some of what they kept from me,

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.060
particularly about the
Birmingham shooting.

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.830
I went to Birmingham almost
every summer when I was a kid.

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:54.930
Birmingham would have been a very
different place to me if I had known

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:57.450
that it was the place
that my dad got shot.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.326
And so I didn't -- you know,

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.206
I probably had a more
expansive view of the world.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:06.376
And when they would tell me
look for the good in everybody,

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:07.300
it was easier to do because I
didn't know about, you know,

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:11.060
some of the things that
they'd locked away.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:14.503
I mean, though they didn't
use the words of Gandhi,

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:17.373
that was essentially the
message they passed on.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:19.803
Be the change that you
want to see in the world.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:23.130
They taught me to try
to be fearless.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:24.133
But, at the same time, you know,
they also did tell me you might have

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.606
to work twice as hard
to get half as far.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.880
You might not meet people
who are always going

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:34.943
to treat you with respect.

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:36.033
And they basically said
ignore them [chuckling],

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.356
because we expect great
things of you and we want you

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:42.483
to expect great things of yourself.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.640
Thank you.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000

[ Applause ]

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.180
Thank you.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.380
One last question.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:52.886
&gt;&gt; What was the most astounding
thing you've learned in your career,

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.340
whether it was positive or negative?

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.046
&gt;&gt; The most astounding
thing that I've learned?

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.780
Well, I've been -- oh, boy.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:07.313
I've had several periods of great
astonishment over the past year.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.320
So if I had to say which
was the most astounding,

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:17.396
I guess I would answer simply
that I am astounded every day

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:21.343
that people are willing
to tell their own story.

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:23.470


00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.916
I tell stories on the
radio all the time.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:28.266
I ask people to tell me about
themselves or I ask them questions.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.973
And I'm always somewhat
astounded that they answer.

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.940
And it's a simple thing.

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:38.720
But I truly am every day astounded
that Americans are willing

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:41.933
to tell their story, less astounded,
though, as time goes on because,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:44.326
now that we're in the
Twitter universe

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:50.073
and maybe people are sharing
too much, like maybe, you know,

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:50.726
there's a few things we
don't need to consider.

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:53.660

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:57.680

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.206
&gt;&gt; Oh. Do they make you listen?

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:03.330
Are you a prisoner of
public radio [laughter]?

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:04.470
&gt;&gt; I don't know but
I listen some times.

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:08.390
&gt;&gt; It's worth listening.

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:10.723
If you want to conquer the
world, you have to understand it.

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:11.790
