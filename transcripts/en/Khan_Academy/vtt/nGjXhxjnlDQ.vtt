00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Voiceover] Miku plans to buy a new car,

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.291
but she has learned that her
car will lose value quickly

00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:06.141
in the first few years that she owns it.

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:08.411
An online calculator uses the following

00:00:08.411 --> 00:00:10.211
formula to show her the value,

00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:13.931
V of T, in dollars, of
the car T years from now.

00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:16.172
Let's look at this.

00:00:16.172 --> 00:00:18.232
So, when T equals zero--

00:00:18.232 --> 00:00:21.312
it's always good to kinda
see the starting conditions.

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:24.872
When T equals zero, so V of zero,

00:00:24.872 --> 00:00:25.813
time equal zero,

00:00:25.813 --> 00:00:26.914
that's when the car is brand new

00:00:26.914 --> 00:00:28.873
zero point eight five to the zero power

00:00:28.873 --> 00:00:30.073
is just going to be one.

00:00:30.073 --> 00:00:34.793
So the brand new value
of the car is $24,900.

00:00:34.793 --> 00:00:36.493
And you can see where this is constructed

00:00:36.493 --> 00:00:38.454
as every year that goes by we're gonna--

00:00:38.454 --> 00:00:41.654
we're only gonna retain 85% of the value.

00:00:41.654 --> 00:00:43.453
So after a year it's gonna be

00:00:43.453 --> 00:00:47.413
24,900 times zero point eight five, once.

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:49.834
After two years we're
gonna take 85% of its value

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:53.953
for the first year and then 85%
of that for the second year.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.473
And before we even calculate--

00:00:55.473 --> 00:00:57.673
so one way you could say is
like after a two year period,

00:00:57.673 --> 00:01:01.753
after one year I'm going
to retain 85% of my value

00:01:01.753 --> 00:01:06.753
and then after another year I'm
going to retain 85% of that.

00:01:07.473 --> 00:01:09.053
and we could calculate what this is

00:01:09.053 --> 00:01:11.294
but before we even do that
let's look at the choices.

00:01:11.294 --> 00:01:13.994
So, we're clearly going to--

00:01:13.994 --> 00:01:16.335
we're clearly going to decline in value.

00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:17.674
So after a two year period

00:01:17.674 --> 00:01:19.774
my car's not gonna be
worth one point seven

00:01:19.774 --> 00:01:20.954
times its present value,

00:01:20.954 --> 00:01:22.095
it's not gonna go up in value.

00:01:22.095 --> 00:01:25.916
We know that after every year my car only

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:28.036
retains 85% of its value.

00:01:28.036 --> 00:01:29.556
So after two years there'e
no way its gonna retain

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:32.237
92.19% of its value.

00:01:32.237 --> 00:01:34.137
So that's not gonna be it.

00:01:34.137 --> 00:01:35.636
Once again we know after two years

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:36.356
it's going to---

00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:39.696
it's going to, it's going
to lose 15% of its value

00:01:39.696 --> 00:01:40.917
two years in a row,

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:41.696
it's going to--

00:01:41.696 --> 00:01:43.876
Year one it's going to
retain 85% of its value,

00:01:43.876 --> 00:01:46.416
but then year two it's
going to retain 85% of that.

00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:50.357
85% of 85%, so it still
cant, that's not gonna be 85.

00:01:50.357 --> 00:01:52.477
And just deductive reasoning we can say

00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:55.877
"Well this is gonna be
this, right over here."

00:01:55.877 --> 00:01:59.277
And we can verify that
zero point eight five

00:01:59.277 --> 00:02:03.597
times zero point eight five
is indeed equal to that.

00:02:03.597 --> 00:02:06.177
Five time five is 25.

00:02:06.177 --> 00:02:07.976
Eight times five is 40.

00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:09.057
You get 42.

00:02:09.057 --> 00:02:10.436
Scratch that out.

00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:13.197
So, eight times five is 40.

00:02:13.197 --> 00:02:17.655
Eight times eight is 64 plus four is 68.

00:02:17.655 --> 00:02:19.255
Add them all together

00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:22.276
you get five two seven--

00:02:22.276 --> 00:02:26.996
whoops, five two two seven,

00:02:26.996 --> 00:02:28.896
and then you have four number
behind out decimal place.

00:02:28.896 --> 00:02:31.435
Zero point seven two two five,

00:02:31.435 --> 00:02:33.076
which is exactly what you have there.

00:02:33.076 --> 00:02:36.376
Now another way that
you could tackle it is,

00:02:36.376 --> 00:02:38.376
you could do something a little bit--

00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:39.815
a little bit more sophisticated.

00:02:39.815 --> 00:02:42.335
You could say "Okay let's say
its present value is new."

00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:44.255
Let's say we're just doing the car

00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:46.466
right when it's brand
new, so it's V of zero.

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.376
And then how many times V of zero

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:50.637
would the car be worth after two years,

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.336
so this could be V of two.

00:02:52.336 --> 00:02:53.436
V of two.

00:02:53.436 --> 00:02:55.576
We could've done V of one
in comparison to V of three,

00:02:55.576 --> 00:02:57.637
or V of 10 in comparison to V of 12,

00:02:57.637 --> 00:02:59.036
but this is just going to be easier.

00:02:59.036 --> 00:03:01.416
So we wanna figure out
how many times more is

00:03:01.416 --> 00:03:03.776
V of two than V of zero.

00:03:03.776 --> 00:03:05.056
How many times more--

00:03:05.056 --> 00:03:06.616
how many times its present value

00:03:06.616 --> 00:03:08.817
would be its value in two years?

00:03:08.817 --> 00:03:10.877
Well, so we take its value in two years,

00:03:10.877 --> 00:03:13.497
divided by it's present value.

00:03:13.497 --> 00:03:14.836
What's that going to be?

00:03:14.836 --> 00:03:18.657
Value in two years is 24,900 times

00:03:18.657 --> 00:03:22.677
zero point eight five to the second power

00:03:22.677 --> 00:03:27.677
over 24,900 times zero point eight five

00:03:29.316 --> 00:03:30.777
to the zero power.

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:32.996
Well these are going to cancel,

00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:34.356
this is just one,

00:03:34.356 --> 00:03:36.417
and you're just left
with what we had before.

00:03:36.417 --> 00:03:39.506
Zero point eight five squared.
