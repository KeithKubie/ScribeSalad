00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.353
- [Instructor] All right, let's see if

00:00:01.353 --> 00:00:04.010
we can find the indefinite integral of

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.010
one over five x squared
minus 30x plus 65 dx.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.713
Pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.920
All right, so this is going
to be an interesting one.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.350
And it'll be a little bit hairy,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.630
but we're gonna work through it together.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.070
So, immediately you might try multiple

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.800
integration techniques
and be hitting some walls.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.330
And what we're going to
do here is actually try

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.170
to complete the square in this
denominator right over here.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.580
And then by completing the
square, we're gonna get it

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.830
in the form that it looks
like the derivative of arctan.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.750
And if that's a big
hint to you, once again

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.220
pause the video and try to move forward.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.050
All right, now let's do this together.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.650
So I'm just gonna try to
simplify this denominator

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.300
so that my coefficient on
my x squared term is a one.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.820
And so I could just factor a
five out of the denominator.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.250
If I did that, then this
integral will become

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.250
1/5 times the integral of one over,

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.890
so I've factored a five
out of the denominator

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.873
so it is x squared minus six x plus 13 dx.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.360
And then as I mentioned I'm gonna

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.640
complete the square down here.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.540
So let me rewrite it,
so this is equal to 1/5

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.480
times the integral of one over,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.570
and so x squared minus six x is clearly

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.340
not a perfect square the way it's written.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.940
Let me write this plus 13 out here.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.460
Now what could I add and then I'm gonna

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.610
to have to subtract if I don't want

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.290
to change the value of the denominator.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.960
In order to make, In order to make

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.000
this part right over
here a perfect square.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.720
Well we've done this before,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.410
you take half of your coefficient here,

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.660
which is negative three
and you square that.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.420
So you want to add a nine here.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.640
But if you add a nine then you have

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.970
to subtract a nine as well.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.820
And so this part is going to be

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.990
x minus three squared and then this part

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.380
right over here is going to be

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.300
equal to a positive four and we of course

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.730
don't want to forget our dx out here.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.130
And so let me write it in this form.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.404
So this is going to be equal to

00:02:12.404 --> 00:02:17.404
1/5 times the integral of one over,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.620
get myself some space,
x minus three squared

00:02:23.337 --> 00:02:27.700
plus four, which we could also
write as plus two squared.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.700
Actually let me do it that
way, plus two squared dx.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.890
Now many of y'all might already say

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.740
hey this looks a lot like arc tangent,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.780
but I'm gonna to try to
simplify it even more

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.350
so it becomes very clear that

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.690
it looks like arc tangent
is going to be involved.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.523
I'm actually gonna do some

00:02:43.523 --> 00:02:45.880
u substitution in order to do it.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.242
So the first thing I'm going to do is

00:02:47.242 --> 00:02:52.242
let's factor a four out
of the denominator here.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.230
So if we do that, then this is going

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.930
to become 1/5 times 1/4 which is going

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.110
to be 1/20 times the integral of

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.110
one over x minus three squared

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.800
over two squared.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.293
And this is going to be a plus one,

00:03:15.293 --> 00:03:18.690
and of course we have our dx.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.460
And then we could write this as,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.270
and I'm trying to just do every step here.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.103
A lot of these you might have

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.530
been able to do in your head.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.060
One over, and I'll just write this as,

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.060
x minus three over two squared plus one.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.870
Plus one and then dx.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.630
And now the u substitution
is pretty clear.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.090
I'm just going to make the substitution

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.170
that u is equal to x minus three over two.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.100
Or we could even say that's u is equal to

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.130
one half x minus three halves,

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.110
that's just x minus three over two.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.110
And du is going to be
equal to one half dx.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.600
And so what I can do here is, actually

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.510
let me start to re-engineer
this integral a little bit

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.680
so that we see a one half here.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.690
So if I make this a one half

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.930
and then I multiply the outside by two.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.830
So I divide by two multiply by two.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.920
It's one way to think about it.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.380
This becomes 1/10 and so
doing my u substitution

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.030
I get 1/10, that's the 1/10
there times the integral of.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.430
Well I have one half dx right over here

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.600
which is the same thing as du.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.330
So I can put the du
either in the numerator

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.980
or I could put it out here.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.000
And then I have one over,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.863
this is u squared, u squared plus one.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.300
Now you might immediately recognize,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.260
what's the derivative of arctan of u?

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.200
Well that would be one
over u squared plus one.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.720
So this is going to be equal to 1/10

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.440
times the arc tangent of u, and of course

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.040
we can't forget our big constant C

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.050
because we're taking
an indefinite integral.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.170
And now we just want to do
the reverse substitution.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.220
We know that u is equal to
this business right over here.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.070
So we deserve a little bit of a drum roll.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.280
This is going to be equal to 1/10

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.950
times the arc tangent of u.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.190
Well u is just x minus three over two,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.970
which could also be written like this.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.970
So arctan of x minus three
over two and then plus C.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.103
And we are done.
