00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.490
so today we're going to talk about

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500
so today we're going to talk about
 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.379
so today we're going to talk about
Pascal's triangle it's one of my

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389
Pascal's triangle it's one of my
 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.720
Pascal's triangle it's one of my
favorite things in math particularly

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730
favorite things in math particularly
 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.010
favorite things in math particularly
because whenever I talk to other

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020
because whenever I talk to other
 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.049
because whenever I talk to other
mathematicians they always have some

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059
mathematicians they always have some
 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.549
mathematicians they always have some
interesting patterns they like talking

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559
interesting patterns they like talking
 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.589
interesting patterns they like talking
about it's almost never the same one so

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599
about it's almost never the same one so
 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.930
about it's almost never the same one so
Pascal's triangle is sort of like an

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940
Pascal's triangle is sort of like an
 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.240
Pascal's triangle is sort of like an
addition triangle so we start with the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250
addition triangle so we start with the
 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.040
addition triangle so we start with the
number 1 and every time I draw one

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050
number 1 and every time I draw one
 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.540
number 1 and every time I draw one
assume that everything around it is a

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550
assume that everything around it is a
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.759
assume that everything around it is a
bunch of zeroes so what we do is we have

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769
bunch of zeroes so what we do is we have
 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.740
bunch of zeroes so what we do is we have
one and then we add whatever's to the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750
one and then we add whatever's to the
 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.420
one and then we add whatever's to the
left of it let's neighbor here is zero

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430
left of it let's neighbor here is zero
 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.189
left of it let's neighbor here is zero
and we just drop that down in between us

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199
and we just drop that down in between us
 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.689
and we just drop that down in between us
and I do the same thing on the right all

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699
and I do the same thing on the right all
 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.640
and I do the same thing on the right all
right cool now I have two ones in this

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650
right cool now I have two ones in this
 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.749
right cool now I have two ones in this
row and I'll do the same thing so

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759
row and I'll do the same thing so
 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.880
row and I'll do the same thing so
there's a zero we can imagine here so we

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
there's a zero we can imagine here so we
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.440
there's a zero we can imagine here so we
drop that down there's one in this

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450
drop that down there's one in this
 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.600
drop that down there's one in this
neighbor now so we can have a two and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610
neighbor now so we can have a two and
 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.130
neighbor now so we can have a two and
then there's one in this zero to its

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140
then there's one in this zero to its
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.290
then there's one in this zero to its
right so we make another one and we just

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300
right so we make another one and we just
 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.959
right so we make another one and we just
keep doing this for awhile and you can

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
keep doing this for awhile and you can
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.880
keep doing this for awhile and you can
see that the triangle just keeps getting

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
see that the triangle just keeps getting
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.170
see that the triangle just keeps getting
bigger this is nothing that's going to

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
bigger this is nothing that's going to
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.760
bigger this is nothing that's going to
stop so you can just keep doing this for

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
stop so you can just keep doing this for
 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.590
stop so you can just keep doing this for
as long as we want and for me as long as

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600
as long as we want and for me as long as
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.060
as long as we want and for me as long as
I want is when the first double digit

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
I want is when the first double digit
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.350
I want is when the first double digit
number shows up because that's when

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360
number shows up because that's when
 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.100
number shows up because that's when
adding gets hard

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
adding gets hard
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.220
adding gets hard
so Pascal was also a convener tourist so

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
so Pascal was also a convener tourist so
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.080
so Pascal was also a convener tourist so
in particular like problems where I have

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090
in particular like problems where I have
 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.060
in particular like problems where I have
n things that I want to choose K of them

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070
n things that I want to choose K of them
 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.500
n things that I want to choose K of them
how many different ways can I do that

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510
how many different ways can I do that
 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.929
how many different ways can I do that
and it turns out that Pascal's triangle

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
and it turns out that Pascal's triangle
 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.240
and it turns out that Pascal's triangle
it's really like child like adding game

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
it's really like child like adding game
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.120
it's really like child like adding game
as it seems to be actually encodes n

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
as it seems to be actually encodes n
 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.170
as it seems to be actually encodes n
choose K so if I have n things in

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
choose K so if I have n things in
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.210
choose K so if I have n things in
particular let's say I have four things

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
particular let's say I have four things
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429
particular let's say I have four things
and I want to choose let's say one of

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439
and I want to choose let's say one of
 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.560
and I want to choose let's say one of
them then I go to the fourth row I move

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
them then I go to the fourth row I move
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.300
them then I go to the fourth row I move
over one and that's how many ways I can

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
over one and that's how many ways I can
 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.130
over one and that's how many ways I can
do it four ways if I have four things

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
do it four ways if I have four things
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.920
do it four ways if I have four things
let's say I have like four circles and I

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
let's say I have like four circles and I
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.749
let's say I have like four circles and I
want to only choose one of them there

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759
want to only choose one of them there
 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.219
want to only choose one of them there
are four ways I can do that right I can

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
are four ways I can do that right I can
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.120
are four ways I can do that right I can
choose this one I can choose that one

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
choose this one I can choose that one
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.590
choose this one I can choose that one
you can choose that one just that one

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
you can choose that one just that one
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.510
you can choose that one just that one
and it turns out Pascal's triangle says

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520
and it turns out Pascal's triangle says
 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.850
and it turns out Pascal's triangle says
if I go down to the fourth row where is

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860
if I go down to the fourth row where is
 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.800
if I go down to the fourth row where is
like this is a zero with row and I

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810
like this is a zero with row and I
 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.990
like this is a zero with row and I
choose one thing so I move one over and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
choose one thing so I move one over and
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.520
choose one thing so I move one over and
that's exactly how many ways I can do it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
that's exactly how many ways I can do it
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.649
that's exactly how many ways I can do it
so if I told you to choose two circles

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659
so if I told you to choose two circles
 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.139
so if I told you to choose two circles
then there are six ways to do it you

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149
then there are six ways to do it you
 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.569
then there are six ways to do it you
notice that the sides are always ones

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579
notice that the sides are always ones
 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.520
notice that the sides are always ones
like this isn't going to change because

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530
like this isn't going to change because
 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.590
like this isn't going to change because
we just keep doing one plus zero and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
we just keep doing one plus zero and
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.450
we just keep doing one plus zero and
then oh look one plus zero 1 plus zero

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
then oh look one plus zero 1 plus zero
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.969
then oh look one plus zero 1 plus zero
it's just going to keep happening so we

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
it's just going to keep happening so we
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.880
it's just going to keep happening so we
can define this entire diagonal as plus

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890
can define this entire diagonal as plus
 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.859
can define this entire diagonal as plus
zero because every time I go down one

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
zero because every time I go down one
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.050
zero because every time I go down one
I'm not changing anything well then I

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060
I'm not changing anything well then I
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.449
I'm not changing anything well then I
get to this row right and we have one

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459
get to this row right and we have one
 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.089
get to this row right and we have one
plus one plus one plus one because I

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099
plus one plus one plus one because I
 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.949
plus one plus one plus one because I
have zero

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959
have zero
 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.229
have zero
two three four five so I can define this

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239
two three four five so I can define this
 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.709
two three four five so I can define this
row if I felt like it as plus one then

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:17.719
row if I felt like it as plus one then
 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.289
row if I felt like it as plus one then
this this pattern looks less fun right I

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299
this this pattern looks less fun right I
 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.929
this this pattern looks less fun right I
have one three but the difference

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939
have one three but the difference
 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.280
have one three but the difference
between three and one is two the

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290
between three and one is two the
 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.630
between three and one is two the
difference between six and three is

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640
difference between six and three is
 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.339
difference between six and three is
three the difference between ten and six

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349
three the difference between ten and six
 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.759
three the difference between ten and six
is four so it turns out this pattern is

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769
is four so it turns out this pattern is
 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.940
is four so it turns out this pattern is
plus 1 plus 2 Plus 3 keeps going so

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950
plus 1 plus 2 Plus 3 keeps going so
 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.619
plus 1 plus 2 Plus 3 keeps going so
around here one would be tempted to look

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629
around here one would be tempted to look
 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.569
around here one would be tempted to look
for more patterns like right here is

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579
for more patterns like right here is
 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.629
for more patterns like right here is
like plus what 3 plus 6 but that's when

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639
like plus what 3 plus 6 but that's when
 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.649
like plus what 3 plus 6 but that's when
you start to notice what we've been

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659
you start to notice what we've been
 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.119
you start to notice what we've been
doing all along which was just adding

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129
doing all along which was just adding
 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:44.860
doing all along which was just adding
contempor to the top left like Pascal

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870
contempor to the top left like Pascal
 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.390
contempor to the top left like Pascal
wanted us to anyway let's just look at

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400
wanted us to anyway let's just look at
 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.500
wanted us to anyway let's just look at
something else that one might be tempted

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510
something else that one might be tempted
 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.909
something else that one might be tempted
to do when they see a bunch of numbers

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:48.919
to do when they see a bunch of numbers
 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.530
to do when they see a bunch of numbers
and that's add them in a different way

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540
and that's add them in a different way
 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.970
and that's add them in a different way
so this is 1 1 plus 1 is 2

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980
so this is 1 1 plus 1 is 2
 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.879
so this is 1 1 plus 1 is 2
1 plus 2 plus 1 is 4 1 plus 3 is 4 plus

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889
1 plus 2 plus 1 is 4 1 plus 3 is 4 plus
 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.300
1 plus 2 plus 1 is 4 1 plus 3 is 4 plus
3 is 7 plus 1 is 8 you'll notice at some

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310
3 is 7 plus 1 is 8 you'll notice at some
 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.690
3 is 7 plus 1 is 8 you'll notice at some
point I just stopped adding because we

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700
point I just stopped adding because we
 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.729
point I just stopped adding because we
can actually rewrite everything over

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739
can actually rewrite everything over
 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.949
can actually rewrite everything over
here as the powers of 2 so the sum of

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959
here as the powers of 2 so the sum of
 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.530
here as the powers of 2 so the sum of
the rows of Pascal's triangle is 2 like

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540
the rows of Pascal's triangle is 2 like
 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.539
the rows of Pascal's triangle is 2 like
if I'm on the nth row and I call the

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549
if I'm on the nth row and I call the
 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.719
if I'm on the nth row and I call the
first one row zero then the sum of that

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:19.729
first one row zero then the sum of that
 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:22.390
first one row zero then the sum of that
row is 2 to the N let's just read these

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400
row is 2 to the N let's just read these
 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.399
row is 2 to the N let's just read these
as numbers let's not add them let's not

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409
as numbers let's not add them let's not
 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:25.479
as numbers let's not add them let's not
treat them as anything else

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489
treat them as anything else
 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.809
treat them as anything else
so the first row is 1 the next row is 11

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819
so the first row is 1 the next row is 11
 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.179
so the first row is 1 the next row is 11
next row is 121 next row is 1331 and we

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.189
next row is 121 next row is 1331 and we
 

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:39.449
next row is 121 next row is 1331 and we
get 14 6 4 1 and then we get to this so

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459
get 14 6 4 1 and then we get to this so
 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.490
get 14 6 4 1 and then we get to this so
right now these are actually the powers

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500
right now these are actually the powers
 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.420
right now these are actually the powers
of 11 2

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430
of 11 2
 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.159
of 11 2
so this next row looks pretty

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169
so this next row looks pretty
 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:46.869
so this next row looks pretty
frightening because if I wrote it out

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879
frightening because if I wrote it out
 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.039
frightening because if I wrote it out
just as it is I get a pretty big number

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049
just as it is I get a pretty big number
 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.270
just as it is I get a pretty big number
right like once I put in these commas

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280
right like once I put in these commas
 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.399
right like once I put in these commas
this is around 15 million that's not a

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409
this is around 15 million that's not a
 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.409
this is around 15 million that's not a
little to the bone it's not but it turns

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419
little to the bone it's not but it turns
 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.210
little to the bone it's not but it turns
out Pascal's you know his triangle

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220
out Pascal's you know his triangle
 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.649
out Pascal's you know his triangle
doesn't quit that early so what's

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659
doesn't quit that early so what's
 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.420
doesn't quit that early so what's
happening here is that when I was

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430
happening here is that when I was
 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.030
happening here is that when I was
writing these as digits before I was

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040
writing these as digits before I was
 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.009
writing these as digits before I was
actually considering that place value

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019
actually considering that place value
 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.420
actually considering that place value
right like the one place the tens place

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430
right like the one place the tens place
 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.640
right like the one place the tens place
the hundreds place so I'm just going to

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650
the hundreds place so I'm just going to
 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.349
the hundreds place so I'm just going to
do the same thing where I rewrite these

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359
do the same thing where I rewrite these
 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.140
do the same thing where I rewrite these
numbers as ones in tens and hundreds

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150
numbers as ones in tens and hundreds
 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.110
numbers as ones in tens and hundreds
place so the first one will be 1 times

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120
place so the first one will be 1 times
 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.610
place so the first one will be 1 times
10 to the 0 because this is the 0th row

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620
10 to the 0 because this is the 0th row
 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.190
10 to the 0 because this is the 0th row
then we have 1 times 10 to the 1 plus 1

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200
then we have 1 times 10 to the 1 plus 1
 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.010
then we have 1 times 10 to the 1 plus 1
ten to the zero so this one's one this

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020
ten to the zero so this one's one this
 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.680
ten to the zero so this one's one this
one's 11 let's do one times 10 squared

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690
one's 11 let's do one times 10 squared
 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.770
one's 11 let's do one times 10 squared
plus 1 times 2 times 10 to the 1 my bad

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780
plus 1 times 2 times 10 to the 1 my bad
 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.830
plus 1 times 2 times 10 to the 1 my bad
plus 1 times 10 to the 0 that's 121 so

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840
plus 1 times 10 to the 0 that's 121 so
 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.320
plus 1 times 10 to the 0 that's 121 so
let's let's skip on down to our friend

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330
let's let's skip on down to our friend
 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.600
let's let's skip on down to our friend
here we do 1 times 10 to the 5 plus 5 10

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610
here we do 1 times 10 to the 5 plus 5 10
 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:57.770
here we do 1 times 10 to the 5 plus 5 10
to the 4 plus 10 10 to the 3 plus 10 10

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:04.640
to the 4 plus 10 10 to the 3 plus 10 10
squared yeah 5 to the 10 to the 1 and 1

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650
squared yeah 5 to the 10 to the 1 and 1
 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.140
squared yeah 5 to the 10 to the 1 and 1
times 10 to 0 and this is 11 to the 5 is

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150
times 10 to 0 and this is 11 to the 5 is
 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.600
times 10 to 0 and this is 11 to the 5 is
11 to the 5 it is 11 to the 5 it's just

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610
11 to the 5 it is 11 to the 5 it's just
 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.120
11 to the 5 it is 11 to the 5 it's just
hiding so now I have this really cool

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130
hiding so now I have this really cool
 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.830
hiding so now I have this really cool
thing that I found extremely recently

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840
thing that I found extremely recently
 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.930
thing that I found extremely recently
call them the hockey sticks method I

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940
call them the hockey sticks method I
 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.700
call them the hockey sticks method I
think some people call it it's just a

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710
think some people call it it's just a
 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.860
think some people call it it's just a
really cool trick that you can do on

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870
really cool trick that you can do on
 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.230
really cool trick that you can do on
Pascal's triangle another result of the

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240
Pascal's triangle another result of the
 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.420
Pascal's triangle another result of the
fact that it's the coefficients of like

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430
fact that it's the coefficients of like
 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.540
fact that it's the coefficients of like
a binomial expansion which is all of it

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550
a binomial expansion which is all of it
 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.980
a binomial expansion which is all of it
will make more sense once I draw a

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990
will make more sense once I draw a
 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.810
will make more sense once I draw a
hockey stick what you do is you pick a

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820
hockey stick what you do is you pick a
 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.570
hockey stick what you do is you pick a
one somewhere on the edge and you just

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580
one somewhere on the edge and you just
 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.250
one somewhere on the edge and you just
go down diagonally so I'm going to pick

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260
go down diagonally so I'm going to pick
 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.830
go down diagonally so I'm going to pick
this one and then I'm going to go down

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840
this one and then I'm going to go down
 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.940
this one and then I'm going to go down
to a million and then I'm just going to

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950
to a million and then I'm just going to
 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.260
to a million and then I'm just going to
keep going and then at some point I'm

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270
keep going and then at some point I'm
 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.300
keep going and then at some point I'm
just going to veer off in this case I

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310
just going to veer off in this case I
 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.950
just going to veer off in this case I
have to veer off because I didn't draw

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960
have to veer off because I didn't draw
 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.490
have to veer off because I didn't draw
any more rows so the number that I veer

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500
any more rows so the number that I veer
 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.250
any more rows so the number that I veer
off to is the sum of all the numbers I

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260
off to is the sum of all the numbers I
 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.350
off to is the sum of all the numbers I
trace down one plus two plus three plus

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360
trace down one plus two plus three plus
 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.340
trace down one plus two plus three plus
four equals 10 so this row or this

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350
four equals 10 so this row or this
 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.030
four equals 10 so this row or this
diagonal rather equals 10 so I'm gonna

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040
diagonal rather equals 10 so I'm gonna
 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.530
diagonal rather equals 10 so I'm gonna
start with this one and it's going to be

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540
start with this one and it's going to be
 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.060
start with this one and it's going to be
off real quickly actually I'm just going

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070
off real quickly actually I'm just going
 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.560
off real quickly actually I'm just going
to all right so works on small ones

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570
to all right so works on small ones
 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.330
to all right so works on small ones
let's use this one because why not we

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340
let's use this one because why not we
 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.890
let's use this one because why not we
can do the other direction right and we

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900
can do the other direction right and we
 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.560
can do the other direction right and we
get one plus two plus three equals six

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570
get one plus two plus three equals six
 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.560
get one plus two plus three equals six
I'm going to do Pascal's triangle mod

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570
I'm going to do Pascal's triangle mod
 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.790
I'm going to do Pascal's triangle mod
two so brief aside mod two in this case

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800
two so brief aside mod two in this case
 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.710
two so brief aside mod two in this case
is just going to mean that every time a

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720
is just going to mean that every time a
 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.720
is just going to mean that every time a
number is odd I write it as a one and

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730
number is odd I write it as a one and
 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.250
number is odd I write it as a one and
every time a number is even I write it

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260
every time a number is even I write it
 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.860
every time a number is even I write it
as a zero so cool right that's still a

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870
as a zero so cool right that's still a
 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.909
as a zero so cool right that's still a

yeah just mod - it doesn't like

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:40.379
yeah just mod - it doesn't like

going to outline all of the diagonals
 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.820
going to outline all of the diagonals
that are all ones and all the roads that

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830
that are all ones and all the roads that
 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.860
that are all ones and all the roads that
are all one so I'm going to do this

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:56.870
are all one so I'm going to do this
 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.659
are all one so I'm going to do this
which isn't the world's prettiest thing

00:06:59.659 --> 00:06:59.669
which isn't the world's prettiest thing
 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:11.089
which isn't the world's prettiest thing
but it's pretty nice and this shape

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:11.099
but it's pretty nice and this shape
 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:13.279
but it's pretty nice and this shape
should maybe start to look a little

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:13.289
should maybe start to look a little
 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:15.170
should maybe start to look a little
familiar if you played on a Legend of

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180
familiar if you played on a Legend of
 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.309
familiar if you played on a Legend of
Zelda before it's also the Triforce but

recognize your pesky triangle I start

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199

with an equilateral triangle I inscribe

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:28.289
with an equilateral triangle I inscribe
 

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:31.189
with an equilateral triangle I inscribe
another one upside down and then I can

00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199
another one upside down and then I can
 

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:32.839
another one upside down and then I can
just keep doing this on all of the

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:32.849
just keep doing this on all of the
 

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:36.350
just keep doing this on all of the
upward facing triangles as many times as

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360
upward facing triangles as many times as
 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.450
upward facing triangles as many times as
I want

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:37.460
I want
 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.709
I want
so yeah this can just go on for a long

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:39.719
so yeah this can just go on for a long
 

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:43.579
so yeah this can just go on for a long
time and it turns out that the way that

00:07:43.579 --> 00:07:43.589
time and it turns out that the way that
 

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:45.829
time and it turns out that the way that
the evens and odds show up in Pascal's

00:07:45.829 --> 00:07:45.839
the evens and odds show up in Pascal's

can make Pascal's triangle as big as I

00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919
can make Pascal's triangle as big as I
 

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:51.140
can make Pascal's triangle as big as I
want and I'm just going to keep getting

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:51.150
want and I'm just going to keep getting
 

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.179
want and I'm just going to keep getting
iterations of sequential triangle so

00:07:53.179 --> 00:07:53.189
iterations of sequential triangle so
 

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:54.679
iterations of sequential triangle so
that's really cool

00:07:54.679 --> 00:07:54.689
that's really cool
 

00:07:54.689 --> 00:07:57.079
that's really cool
it's really good by itself but it gets

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:57.089
it's really good by itself but it gets
 

00:07:57.089 --> 00:07:59.360
it's really good by itself but it gets
cooler using the mod two construction

00:07:59.360 --> 00:07:59.370
cooler using the mod two construction
 

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.159
cooler using the mod two construction
there's something else we can do in mod

00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:01.169
there's something else we can do in mod
 

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:03.950
there's something else we can do in mod
two though in particular we can write

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:03.960
two though in particular we can write
 

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.679
two though in particular we can write
down the same things but let's write

00:08:06.679 --> 00:08:06.689
down the same things but let's write
 

00:08:06.689 --> 00:08:09.439
down the same things but let's write
them now is we've got ones and zeros

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:09.449
them now is we've got ones and zeros
 

00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:12.260
them now is we've got ones and zeros
right and for most people ones and zeros

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:12.270
right and for most people ones and zeros
 

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:15.469
right and for most people ones and zeros
kind of remind them of binary so let's

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479
kind of remind them of binary so let's
 

00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:18.439
kind of remind them of binary so let's
just see what happens when we transcribe

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:18.449
just see what happens when we transcribe
 

00:08:18.449 --> 00:08:21.279
just see what happens when we transcribe
these from binary you know one binary 1

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:21.289
these from binary you know one binary 1
 

00:08:21.289 --> 00:08:26.570
these from binary you know one binary 1
and then 1 1 in binary is 3 1 0 1 is 5 1

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:26.580
and then 1 1 in binary is 3 1 0 1 is 5 1
 

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:31.129
and then 1 1 in binary is 3 1 0 1 is 5 1
1 1 is 15 and then the next one 1 0 0 0

00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:31.139
1 1 is 15 and then the next one 1 0 0 0
 

00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:35.750
1 1 is 15 and then the next one 1 0 0 0
1 is 17 now these may not immediately

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760
1 is 17 now these may not immediately
 

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.600
1 is 17 now these may not immediately
appear pretty cool but if I kept going

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:38.610
appear pretty cool but if I kept going
 

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:43.269
appear pretty cool but if I kept going
the next one is 51 the next one is 85

00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279
the next one is 51 the next one is 85
 

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:47.180
the next one is 51 the next one is 85
after that is 255 and here I'm going to

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:47.190
after that is 255 and here I'm going to
 

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.980
after that is 255 and here I'm going to
stop and I'm going to look at what these

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:48.990
stop and I'm going to look at what these
 

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.280
stop and I'm going to look at what these
numbers are 3 is prime 5 is prime

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:52.290
numbers are 3 is prime 5 is prime
 

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:58.579
numbers are 3 is prime 5 is prime
15 is 5 times 3 17 is prime 51 is 17

00:08:58.579 --> 00:08:58.589
15 is 5 times 3 17 is prime 51 is 17
 

00:08:58.589 --> 00:09:04.910
15 is 5 times 3 17 is prime 51 is 17
times 3 85 is 17 times 5 and 255 is 17

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920
times 3 85 is 17 times 5 and 255 is 17
 

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.340
times 3 85 is 17 times 5 and 255 is 17
times 15 so you'll notice that every

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:07.350
times 15 so you'll notice that every
 

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.309
times 15 so you'll notice that every
time I get a prime I go back and just

00:09:10.309 --> 00:09:10.319
time I get a prime I go back and just
 

00:09:10.319 --> 00:09:12.230
time I get a prime I go back and just
multiply by all the things that came

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240
multiply by all the things that came
 

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.780
multiply by all the things that came
before and I can generate the next you

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:14.790
before and I can generate the next you
 

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.420
before and I can generate the next you
know n minus 1 entries so the prime is

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:17.430
know n minus 1 entries so the prime is
 

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.329
know n minus 1 entries so the prime is
that we have here actually at least the

00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:20.339
that we have here actually at least the
 

00:09:20.339 --> 00:09:23.139
that we have here actually at least the
ones that I'm that were certain of are

00:09:23.139 --> 00:09:23.149
ones that I'm that were certain of are
 

00:09:23.149 --> 00:09:26.540
ones that I'm that were certain of are
actually format Prime's for Fermont

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:26.550
actually format Prime's for Fermont
 

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.809
actually format Prime's for Fermont
Prime's rather which means that they can

00:09:29.809 --> 00:09:29.819
Prime's rather which means that they can
 

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:33.290
Prime's rather which means that they can
be written of the form 2 to the 2 to the

mathematician even 10 minutes ago when I

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360
mathematician even 10 minutes ago when I
 

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.879
mathematician even 10 minutes ago when I
asked a different mathematician for an

asked a different mathematician for an
 

00:09:40.889 --> 00:09:42.889
asked a different mathematician for an
idea he told me something I had never

00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:42.899
idea he told me something I had never
 

00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:45.610
idea he told me something I had never
heard before it so even if maybe

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:45.620
heard before it so even if maybe
 

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.990
heard before it so even if maybe
somewhere out in the world all of the

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000
somewhere out in the world all of the
 

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.040
somewhere out in the world all of the

things you couldn't do with this
triangle are done I don't know if

00:09:51.319 --> 00:09:51.329
triangle are done I don't know if
 

00:09:51.329 --> 00:09:52.550
triangle are done I don't know if
there's any one person who knows them

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560
there's any one person who knows them
 

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.280
there's any one person who knows them
all and maybe there's only one person

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:55.290
all and maybe there's only one person
 

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:56.870
all and maybe there's only one person
who knows one of them and we just have

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880
who knows one of them and we just have
 

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.000
who knows one of them and we just have
to keep exploring this triangle and

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.010
to keep exploring this triangle and
 

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.129
to keep exploring this triangle and
seeing if we can collaboratively explain

00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:01.139
seeing if we can collaboratively explain
 

00:10:01.139 --> 00:10:03.019
seeing if we can collaboratively explain
everything inside of it but it's an

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:03.029
everything inside of it but it's an
 

00:10:03.029 --> 00:10:04.850
everything inside of it but it's an
infinite triangle right so maybe there

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:04.860
infinite triangle right so maybe there
 

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.650
infinite triangle right so maybe there
are things on the hundredth line down

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:06.660
are things on the hundredth line down
 

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.139
are things on the hundredth line down
that we haven't explored yet I feel like

00:10:09.139 --> 00:10:09.149
that we haven't explored yet I feel like
 

00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:10.970
that we haven't explored yet I feel like
it wouldn't be a numberphile video if

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:10.980
it wouldn't be a numberphile video if
 

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.769
it wouldn't be a numberphile video if
somehow the Fibonacci sequence didn't

00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779
somehow the Fibonacci sequence didn't
 

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:17.210
somehow the Fibonacci sequence didn't
show up so I'm going to show you what if

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:17.220
show up so I'm going to show you what if
 

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.860
show up so I'm going to show you what if
it been a few sequences in the Pascal

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:18.870
it been a few sequences in the Pascal
 

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.199
it been a few sequences in the Pascal
triangle because it's a numberphile

00:10:21.199 --> 00:10:21.209
triangle because it's a numberphile
 

00:10:21.209 --> 00:10:25.069
triangle because it's a numberphile
video so what we're going to do is we're

00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:25.079
video so what we're going to do is we're
 

00:10:25.079 --> 00:10:28.579
video so what we're going to do is we're
going to add up the shallow diagonals so

00:10:28.579 --> 00:10:28.589
going to add up the shallow diagonals so
 

00:10:28.589 --> 00:10:30.439
going to add up the shallow diagonals so
what that means here is the triangle

00:10:30.439 --> 00:10:30.449
what that means here is the triangle
 

00:10:30.449 --> 00:10:32.000
what that means here is the triangle
kind of inscribed diagonals already

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.010
kind of inscribed diagonals already
 

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.230
kind of inscribed diagonals already
right like I could look at this one and

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240
right like I could look at this one and
 

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.660
right like I could look at this one and
just kind of follow this but a shallow

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:35.670
just kind of follow this but a shallow
 

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.100
just kind of follow this but a shallow
diagonal means that I'm going to kind of

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:37.110
diagonal means that I'm going to kind of
 

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.040
diagonal means that I'm going to kind of
go off at a slightly higher angle than I

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:40.050
go off at a slightly higher angle than I
 

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:41.840
go off at a slightly higher angle than I
would have if I was just following the

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:41.850
would have if I was just following the
 

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.910
would have if I was just following the
way I drew this triangle so for example

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920
way I drew this triangle so for example
 

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.250
way I drew this triangle so for example
the first Fibonacci number is 1 so

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:46.260
the first Fibonacci number is 1 so
 

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.460
the first Fibonacci number is 1 so
that's my shallow diagonal and then this

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:49.470
that's my shallow diagonal and then this
 

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.410
that's my shallow diagonal and then this
one doesn't have any other shallow

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:51.420
one doesn't have any other shallow
 

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.059
one doesn't have any other shallow
neighbors so it's just by itself also

00:10:53.059 --> 00:10:53.069
neighbors so it's just by itself also
 

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:57.889
neighbors so it's just by itself also
now we have 1 1 so this shallow diagonal

00:10:57.889 --> 00:10:57.899
now we have 1 1 so this shallow diagonal
 

00:10:57.899 --> 00:11:02.240
now we have 1 1 so this shallow diagonal
is a 1 and then this one so we do this

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:02.250
is a 1 and then this one so we do this
 

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.140
is a 1 and then this one so we do this
you get 2

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:04.150
you get 2
 

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:08.940
you get 2
then we do this one with this too we get

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:08.950
then we do this one with this too we get
 

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:11.670
then we do this one with this too we get
three we do this one with this three

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680
three we do this one with this three
 

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.590
three we do this one with this three
with this one we get five and you know

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:16.600
with this one we get five and you know
 

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.350
with this one we get five and you know
how this game goes so we have one four

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360
how this game goes so we have one four
 

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.000
how this game goes so we have one four
and three here so we're going to get

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.010
and three here so we're going to get
 

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.220
and three here so we're going to get
eight we get I'm going to do one more in

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:23.230
eight we get I'm going to do one more in
 

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.200
eight we get I'm going to do one more in
case you don't believe me we're going to

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:25.210
case you don't believe me we're going to
 

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:29.010
case you don't believe me we're going to
do five plus six plus one and this one

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:29.020
do five plus six plus one and this one
 

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:33.329
do five plus six plus one and this one
down here that I didn't address and we

00:11:33.329 --> 00:11:33.339
down here that I didn't address and we
 

00:11:33.339 --> 00:11:37.829
down here that I didn't address and we
get 13 cool so they have it

00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839
get 13 cool so they have it
 

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:40.890
get 13 cool so they have it
the two biggest recurrence relations in

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:40.900
the two biggest recurrence relations in
 

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.700
the two biggest recurrence relations in
math that involve addition probably a

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:43.710
math that involve addition probably a
 

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:46.530
math that involve addition probably a
tied together in the triangle they're

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:46.540
tied together in the triangle they're
 

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.230
tied together in the triangle they're
not unique things you know you can have

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240
not unique things you know you can have
 

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.019
not unique things you know you can have
one it encodes the other and it's all

00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:52.029
one it encodes the other and it's all
 

00:11:52.029 --> 00:11:53.550
one it encodes the other and it's all
just related in really beautiful ways

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:53.560
just related in really beautiful ways
 

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.380
just related in really beautiful ways
it's so beautiful

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:55.390
it's so beautiful
 

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.510
it's so beautiful
you know this triangle has all of these

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:57.520
you know this triangle has all of these
 

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.100

really cool properties about it and
 

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.840
really cool properties about it and
again like you said earlier it feels

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:00.850
again like you said earlier it feels
 

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.430
again like you said earlier it feels
like it's really childlike thing right

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.440
like it's really childlike thing right
 

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.320
like it's really childlike thing right
like I just you know add the things next

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:04.330
like I just you know add the things next
 

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.269
like I just you know add the things next
to me and I just popped them down under

00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:06.279
to me and I just popped them down under
 

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:08.250
to me and I just popped them down under
but I've been playing with this triangle

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:08.260
but I've been playing with this triangle
 

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.980
but I've been playing with this triangle
since I want to say eighth or ninth

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:10.990
since I want to say eighth or ninth
 

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.100
since I want to say eighth or ninth
grade and I learned half of these things

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:14.110
grade and I learned half of these things
 

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.260
grade and I learned half of these things
in the past once and there are still

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:16.270
in the past once and there are still
 

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.699
in the past once and there are still
other things that I could ramble on

00:12:17.699 --> 00:12:17.709
other things that I could ramble on
 

00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:19.620
other things that I could ramble on
about about this triangle and this isn't

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:19.630
about about this triangle and this isn't
 

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.210
about about this triangle and this isn't
even my field like I'm still an

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:21.220
even my field like I'm still an
 

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.829
even my field like I'm still an
undergraduate I don't even study this

00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:22.839
undergraduate I don't even study this
 

00:12:22.839 --> 00:12:25.199
undergraduate I don't even study this
triangle professionally so just imagine

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:25.209
triangle professionally so just imagine
 

00:12:25.209 --> 00:12:27.120
triangle professionally so just imagine
what people know about this triangle

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:27.130
what people know about this triangle
 

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.980
what people know about this triangle
that I don't even know that they don't

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:28.990
that I don't even know that they don't
 

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.620
that I don't even know that they don't
even know amongst themselves like it's

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:31.630
even know amongst themselves like it's
 

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.110
even know amongst themselves like it's
amazing
