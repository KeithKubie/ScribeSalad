00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.102
A magazine interview
with Dwayne Johnson,

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:05.505
the only rock
your girlfriend would rather get

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:06.739
than an engagement ring,

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:08.708
has been getting a lot
of attention today

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:10.076
because of one
interesting revelation--

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.079
his legitimate desire
to run for president.

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:15.081
I have no problem with this
at all.

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:16.582
I think, compared to Trump,

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:19.085
The Rock is
a much better choice, you guys.

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:20.686
First of all...

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:23.189
(applause, cheering
and whooping)

00:00:23.222 --> 00:00:26.759
-First of all,
his tan is real. -(laughter)

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:28.461
Secondly,
his clothes actually fit,

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:30.229
as opposed to Trump,
who always looks

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:33.032
like he's trying to smuggle
a yoga ball in a sport coat.

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:34.667
-(laughter, groaning)
-And if he wanted to,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.004
The Rock could destroy way
more people in Atlantic City.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:40.306
-(applause and cheering)
-He's amazing. I love him.

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.542
I love The Rock.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.977
But here's where
I just have a slight problem.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.546
This is a slight problem,

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.681
and please don't get mad at me,
The Rock.

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:50.583
So, this interview with Dwayne,
the Dwayne "The POTUS" Johnson

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:54.654
was on the cover
of GQ magazine's comedy issue.

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:57.657
That's a comedy issue.
The (bleep) comedy issue.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.992
Look at that comedy bicep

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:02.595
-right there on the front
of the comedy issue. -(laughter)

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:04.597
I mean, I guess
this makes sense, you know,

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.898
considering next month,

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:08.201
I'm featured
in Fire Hydrant Arms magazine's

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.336
"50 Polynesians
Who Can't Fit in a Prius" issue.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.306
(applause and cheering)

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:15.041
But...

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:19.212
 GQ, guys, I know you want
to sell magazines, I get it,

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:21.047
but try to understand
what's going on

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.349
and what comedy actually means,
all right.

00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:25.918
Thousands of comedy folks they
could have put on the cover,

00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:27.320
like-- I don't know-- how about

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.188
-Chris "The Rock" Rock,
for example. -(laughter)

00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:32.725
Or maybe Stephen Colbert,
Maria Bamford, Bill Burr,

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:35.094
Tig Notaro, Rick and Morty, 
Kate Berlant, Nikki Glaser...

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:37.497
-(applause and cheering)
-...Hannibal Buress, Louis C.K.,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.931
Norm MacDonald, Noel Fielding,

00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:40.900
Dave Chappelle,
Jim Jefferies, Sarah Silverman,

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:43.336
Bob Newhart, The Onion, 
Steel Panther...

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.139
-(applause and cheering swell)
-...Cheech &amp; Chong.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:50.810
Cheech &amp; Chong, Ken Jeong,
Ali Wong, Patton Oswalt,

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:53.079
every member of The State, 
every member of Monty Python,

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:55.148
every comedian
on Another Period,

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.616
who were a lot of people
from The State,

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.852
Leslie Jones, Samantha Bee,
John Oliver, Melissa McCarthy,

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:01.487
Kumail Nanjiani, Ron Funches,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.589
a hamster in a sweater,

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:07.026
-or... or this kid.
-(applause and cheering)

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:09.428
-Hello, mother(bleep).
-(laughter)

00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:12.098
-(applause and cheering)
-I mean, so many...

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:15.001
-Wow.
-...comedians

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:19.705
you could have put on the cover
of your (bleep) comedy issues!

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:21.707
I mean, guys,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.576
maybe I'm personalizing
this a little much,

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.045
but, like, do the jocks have
to take this one, too?

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:28.748
Do they have to take this one
away from the comedy nerds?

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:30.082
This kind of feels like--

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:32.318
and maybe this is, again,
too personal for me--

00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:34.820
but, like, when you're in
Chess Club your whole life,

00:02:34.853 --> 00:02:37.390
and then a (bleep) football
player puts on fake nerd glasses

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:38.858
and sits at a chess table,

00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:40.126
and that's
the (bleep) photograph

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.494
for Chess Club in the yearbook.

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:43.629
-It's, like, they can't
get everything! -(applause)

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:45.932
-Don't get me wrong. I love The
Rock. -(applause and cheering)

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:47.667
He could on the cover
of anything else,

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.468
and I'd be fine with it.

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:51.804
He is the world's
greatest action star.

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:54.607
Maybe he's not
actually a comedian?

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.509
Like, an official
professional comedian?

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:59.178
Actually, he might not even be
the world's funniest rock.

00:02:59.211 --> 00:03:01.347
I think this is actually
the world's funniest rock.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.583
(laughter)

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:07.086
(applause and cheering)

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.088
And...

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:12.291
I think it's safe to say this
one has a much smaller penis.

00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:14.093
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:16.128
But, uh, yeah,
I-I love you, Rock.

00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:18.564
Don't hit me,
don't get mad at me. This is...

00:03:18.597 --> 00:03:21.033
My beef is with GQ. 
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:24.003
-(applause and cheering)
-I just don't understand!

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:26.105
-A big rock.
-HARDWICK: So comedians,

00:03:26.138 --> 00:03:30.109
in honor of GQ magazine's
comedy issue, I guess,

00:03:30.142 --> 00:03:31.644
please give me
a less appropriate

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:33.312
cover person for a magazine.

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:35.314
Michael Starr.

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:37.883
Billy Joel on the cover
of Sober and Forever magazine.

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:39.385
HARDWICK:
All right, points.

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:41.320
-(applause and cheering)
-Right? -Nice job.

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:42.955
Stix.

00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:45.558
Oscar Pistorius
on Functional Legs Quarterly.

00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:47.059
-HARDWICK (laughing):
Oh, Jesus Christ. -(laughter)

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:49.929
Well, okay. You know what?

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:52.398
Yeah, he did a bad thing.
We can make fun of him.

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:53.766
All right, Lexxi Foxx.

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.265
Limp Bizkit on the cover
of Better Homes and Gardens.
