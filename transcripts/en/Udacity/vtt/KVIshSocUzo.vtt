00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.050
Let us look at the processes that Watson may be using a little bit more closely.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.250
Clearly Watson is doing a large number of things. It is trying to understand

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.650
natural language sentences. It is trying to generate some natural language

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.420
sentences. It is making some decisions. I'll group all of these things broadly

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.460
under reasoning. Reasoning is a fundamental process of knowledge based data.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.417
A second fundamental process of knowledge based AIs learning.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.500
What simply is learning also? It perhaps gets a right answer to some questions,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.100
and stores that answer somewhere. If it gets a wrong answer, and then once it

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.060
learns about the right answer, it stores the right answer also somewhere.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.400
Learning to is a fundamental process of knowledge based AI.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.800
A third fundamental process of knowledge based ai is memory. If you're going to

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.220
learn something, that knowledge that you're learning has to be store somewhere,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.780
in memory. If you're going to reason using knowledge, then that knowledge has to

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.250
accessed from somewhere, from memory. From memory process it will store,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.640
what we learn as well as provide access to knowledge it will need for

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.920
reasoning. These three forms of processes of learning, memory, and

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.040
reasoning are intimately connected. We learn, so that we can reason.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.480
The result of reasoning often. Result in additional learning.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.200
Once we learn, we can store it in memory. However, we need knowledge to learn.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.760
The more we know, the more we can learn. Reasoning requires knowledge that

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.470
memory can provide access to. The results of reasoning can also go into memory.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.650
So, here are three processes that are closely related.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.680
A key aspect of this course on knowledge based AI is that we will be

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.520
talking about theories of knowledge based AI that unify reasoning, learning,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.610
and memory. And sort of, discussing any one of the three separately as sometimes

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.860
happens in some schools of AI. We're going to try to build, unify the concept.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.570
These 3 processes put together, I will call them deliberation. This deliberation

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.080
process is 1 part of the overall architecture of a knowledge based AI agent.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.339
This figure illustrates the older architecture of an AI agent.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.310
Here we have input in the form of perceptions of the world. And

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.990
output in the form of actions in the world. The agent may have large number of

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.940
processes that map these perceptions to actions. We are going to focus right now

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.230
on deliberation, but the agent architecture also includes metacognition and

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.950
reaction, that we'll discuss later
