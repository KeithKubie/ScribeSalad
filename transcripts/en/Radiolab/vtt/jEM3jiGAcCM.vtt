00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.520
You're listening to radio lab from New York public radio, public radio,

2
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.490
W and y.

3
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.740
C. N. N. P. R.

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.670
I'm Jad Abumrad and I am Robert Krulwich and this is radio season three.

5
00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:20.600
And let me start with a story. Okay. 1893 and anthropologist friends,

6
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.330
Bill eyes goes to the woods of British Columbia.

7
00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:27.830
He has a giant wax cylinder recorder with him and he records this Guy

8
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.123
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

9
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.473
<v 2>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.340
<v 1>and who, who is this?</v>

11
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.430
This gentleman is an Indian from the [inaudible] tribe and his name will told

12
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.173
his [inaudible].

13
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.500
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.540
<v 3>Well, Kessel I was pronounced the caseloads, I don't know.</v>

15
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:50.400
I'm not quite sure how it would be pronounced with [inaudible].

16
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.790
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

17
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.880
<v 0>Daniel Mormon, he's an anthropologist.</v>

18
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.300
He's written a lot about Kessel because it's a neat story and it goes like this.

19
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.110
The young castle, it begins as a sketch.

20
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.350
Debbie was skeptical about the activities of the shame and he thought they were

21
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.410
tricking people in some way. The Shaman or the village healers. Very,

22
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.490
very powerful man. They were scary man.

23
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.320
And he sees them doing these dramatic healing rituals.

24
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.420
He thought they were full of it and so he decided to go undercover one day.

25
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.690
Kessel approaches some of the Shaman and asks if he can apprentice with them.

26
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.490
Yeah,

27
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.410
there's three or four of them taken about it to the woods or doors to a clearing

28
00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:30.260
or something. I'm like, tell him a bunch of things. I, they taught him the songs

29
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:34.773
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

30
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.330
<v 0>he learned that stuff and eventually after he'd gained their trust a little,</v>

31
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.950
they taught him their best trick of a trick that's widespread in the world of

32
00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:47.770
shamanism. Will you find variations on it all over the world?

33
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.900
Usually what you do, they told them, get some feathers,

34
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.470
some down feathers and just tuck it in your cheek record.

35
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.570
Just stick it in your mouth secretly so that nobody knew that it was there.

36
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.100
Then during the ritual,

37
00:01:57.101 --> 00:01:58.960
let's say the patient is there and they're on the ground.

38
00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:01.330
Maybe their chest hurts. You lean down,

39
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.190
literally get down in the cure mouth on the patient's chest and suck and here's

40
00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:07.450
the last thing. While you're sucking,

41
00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:10.960
you bite the inside of your cheek to get some blood in there which mixes with

42
00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:14.500
the feathers. Then at the pivotal point you throw your head back in,

43
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.743
<v 1>cough out the feathers</v>

44
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.170
<v 3>which were now bloody and nasty,</v>

45
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.810
so you end up with this bit of bloody down in the palm of your hand,

46
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.700
which you would then say is the disease which you have sucked out of.

47
00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:28.630
The body of the patient.

48
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.720
<v 0>Kessel had learned all this and thought I knew it, those</v>

49
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.240
<v 3>liars.</v>

50
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.040
The problem was that part of the obligation of his apprenticeship was that

51
00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:40.380
whenever anybody asked, he had to go and treat them for free.

52
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:43.680
That was sort of part of the deal of being an apprentice and somebody from a

53
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:46.710
famous family called him to come and a treat.

54
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.810
A daughter who was sick,

55
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.860
very sick according to the written account and so he went to see this family,

56
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.160
any treated the girl and he went through with the songs that he's saying

57
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.900
<v 1>and he did the feather trick which he knew was false.</v>

58
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.520
He put feathers in his mouth bit.

59
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:06.580
The inside of the chief pretended the sub cost the whole thing out,

60
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.220
<v 3>and Lo and behold, she was healed. She was fine. She was fine. She's fine. Yeah,</v>

61
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.100
it was. It was a great success. Wow. And what did he think? Well, he, he,

62
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:19.430
he clearly indicates a kind of ambiguity.

63
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.550
He knows that he was tricking her, but he also knows that she's better

64
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.210
<v 0>not convinced. Kessler tries to trick again and again and again.</v>

65
00:03:26.211 --> 00:03:29.960
And every time he does it, it works. So at the end of the story,

66
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.970
he decides to become a healer.

67
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.570
Does that mean that he ends up believing in the lie that he set out to disprove?

68
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.460
<v 3>I think that he realizes that truth and lies are not that fundamentally</v>

69
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:44.020
different as we might think they are

70
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.310
<v 0>today on radio lab. We look at that,</v>

71
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.140
<v 4>the true healing power of lies, which she,</v>

72
00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:55.490
in medicine we call the placebo effect. No, no, we don't Lamey no, we don't.

73
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.890
It's actually called [inaudible] who calls it that? It was Latin scholars.

74
00:04:00.891 --> 00:04:03.260
I think it's a Latin word. [inaudible] originally.

75
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.720
Let word why you call it the placebo effect.

76
00:04:05.721 --> 00:04:07.490
I'm going to try and figure out how it works.

77
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.780
And then I would tell some stories,

78
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.600
including one about a dramatically dressed gentleman.

79
00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:15.770
He dressed entirely in purple and maybe it was lilac who used a placebo effect

80
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.170
to make the lady's fuel wheel good.

81
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.650
<v 0>That's all coming up on radio lab.</v>

82
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.053
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

83
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.930
<v 0>Steve [inaudible] documented it,</v>

84
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.850
<v 7>eh? Yes, I am. February two.</v>

85
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:36.060
[inaudible]

86
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.830
<v 0>we had a little trouble with the phone connection for reseal.</v>

87
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.070
Benedetti is a doctor at the Turin Medical Center in Italy and he's one of the

88
00:04:43.071 --> 00:04:47.970
most expert experts on the placebo effect. Better. Yeah. Now I can hear you.

89
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.260
Yeah. So we thought we'd start with him.

90
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.980
He's been studying the placebo effect for about 15 years. Yes.

91
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.870
<v 7>I got too interested in the placebo effect because, uh,</v>

92
00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.200
I realize that sometimes the placebo group gets much better than,

93
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.030
uh, the active treatment group.

94
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:05.443
<v 0>Much, much better.</v>

95
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.230
<v 7>Yeah. Sometimes. Sometimes</v>

96
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.370
<v 0>for what kind of stuff? Well, he saw it first in pain.</v>

97
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.610
<v 3>Hey [inaudible]</v>

98
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.060
<v 0>pain trials. Oh, and then he saw it in depression, depression,</v>

99
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.300
antidepressants. Right. And then digestion immune response.

100
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.280
All of these places where placebos were doing things, they just, yeah,

101
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.183
we're not supposed to.

102
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.110
<v 7>Yeah. It's really amazing. Particularly for Sam conditions like</v>

103
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.910
<v 0>this one's a little surprising Parkinson's disease.</v>

104
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Since the Z series neurological disorder, people with Parkinson's have shakes,

105
00:05:38.001 --> 00:05:38.751
they have tremors.

106
00:05:38.751 --> 00:05:42.440
Dr Benedetti treats a lot of these folks and in the really bad cases,

107
00:05:42.441 --> 00:05:46.050
the only treatment that really seems to work at all is surgery.

108
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.980
So these patients,

109
00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:51.981
you open up the patient's skull and implant a little stimulator deep into their

110
00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:52.960
brain,

111
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.020
<v 7>deep into the brain in two brain regions.</v>

112
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.010
<v 0>Essentially what that does it hot wires, the</v>

113
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.170
<v 7>parts of the brain that aren't working. And when you do that,</v>

114
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.570
you turn the stimulator on, the shakes go away. It's a real treat. Yes.

115
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.690
So we can switch the stimulator on or off and the patient doesn't know that the

116
00:06:11.171 --> 00:06:12.970
stimulator is on or off.

117
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.200
<v 0>And that is where the trickery comes in. And one experiment,</v>

118
00:06:16.201 --> 00:06:19.110
he stood in front of his patient with the stimulator and said,

119
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.490
<v 7>now we are going to switch your stimulator on</v>

120
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.063
<v 0>except you didn't [inaudible].</v>

121
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.620
<v 7>No, of course. Of course. It is a sham turning.</v>

122
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.350
<v 0>He only pretended to turn it on, but that's the weird thing.</v>

123
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.520
It didn't matter pretending to turn it on work just as well as turning it on for

124
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.190
real. The tremors disappeared. Really?

125
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.180
He even has a video of this where he's with a Parkinson's patient and he says

126
00:06:40.181 --> 00:06:40.880
those words,

127
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.870
<v 7>no, we are going to switch your stimulator on [inaudible]</v>

128
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.470
<v 0>which is a lie by the way. Yeah,</v>

129
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:49.550
but it doesn't matter because what you see on the video screen is a shaking hand

130
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:50.860
go completely [inaudible].

131
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.940
<v 7>Yeah, that's correct.</v>

132
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.510
In a few seconds you see that the Riza dramatic improvement in motor

133
00:06:58.511 --> 00:07:01.870
performance, even though the, the stimulator is still off

134
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.060
<v 0>just from words and this is an equivalency. The lie is as good as the medicine</v>

135
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.720
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

136
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.670
<v 0>for awhile. What do you mean for a while coming out of the gate?</v>

137
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.690
A placebo seems to be 100% as effective as say a real Parkinson's drug.

138
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.430
Gotcha.

139
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.900
<v 7>The plaster only about 25% do duration of Dr Drunk.</v>

140
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.470
<v 0>Ah, still it's just words. My words are cheap. Yeah. You're just cheaper than</v>

141
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:30.280
wow.

142
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.280
Overstatement 25% that is so different from 100% I never said it was 100% yes.

143
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.710
I didn't roll the tape back. And what's wrong with you?

144
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.950
The fact that it happens at all, that words, that's all we're talking about.

145
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:45.280
Words can be as effective as surgery. Doesn't that one,

146
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.100
doesn't that intrigue you that you want to know how that works? Yes,

147
00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:51.920
actually I do. How does it work? We have no idea,

148
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.820
but for the first time we can see it.

149
00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.430
See what we'll see it in action. See the placebo effect in action. Oh, testing.

150
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:04.500
Testing. Dr Benedetti referred us to a guy. Actually right here.

151
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:09.850
Any of your yard, probably. You have a token with the Tar Wagga? No.

152
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:14.340
Should we? Yes, totally. [inaudible] yeah. Hey, how are you?

153
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.310
[inaudible] he's a very good new imager. We should introduce yourself. Okay.

154
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.173
I'm Troy [inaudible].

155
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.480
I'm assistant professor of Psychology at Columbia University and here's what

156
00:08:22.481 --> 00:08:24.220
tour wig or does he put subjects in?

157
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:28.550
The [inaudible] brain scanner puts a hot pad on their arm like I'm doing to you

158
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:32.780
right now, so that's very, yeah. Great. We'll give them these pulses of heat

159
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.960
and then he'll give you some pain relief. Green.

160
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.560
This creamier cream, yes that we tell you is lie. Can you say,

161
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:44.900
this is going to be really effective? This is going to block pain.

162
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.620
Take away the pain. Really, it's just fascinating,

163
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.330
but you don't know that I'm having a hard time playing this role. In any case,

164
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:56.010
right? As you're putting on this fake cream and feeling better,

165
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:59.460
having a placebo effect, in other words, he takes a picture of your brain,

166
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:03.720
so I have many things I can show you. Come on until I show it to him. He does.

167
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:05.990
He shows me one on his computer. It's very pretty woo.

168
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.350
Now we have a brain in front of us, right?

169
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.740
A brain scan of a person right in the middle of being placebo,

170
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:14.970
meaning that they've just been given the placebo cream and now they're expecting

171
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.470
to feel better. Those expectations, placebo expectations, first of all,

172
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:23.580
they seem to start here in your forehead like I'm on the sides of your forehead,

173
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:26.010
above your temples. When you believe that you're going to feel better.

174
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.160
That belief seems to live kind of near your temples,

175
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:34.380
but then once that belief is there, it seems to turn on turn on this,

176
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.230
this other part, the midbrain, he points to it on the screen.

177
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:40.980
It's a little nugget deep in the center of the brain and what's important about

178
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:45.981
this area is that it's one of the major centers for the production of opioids in

179
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:51.360
the brain. Oh, opioids like opium. Yes. Yeah. Right.

180
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:56.480
Like opium. Opium as in

181
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.170
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

182
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.630
<v 0>Jack, what the greatest painkiller known to man there.</v>

183
00:10:05.631 --> 00:10:08.690
It was inside our heads in a strike. Use Weird by the way,

184
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:11.910
that that stuff actually is inside our heads. I can't get over that. That,

185
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.140
that these illicit substances are actually inside us. Right?

186
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.850
We know there's kind of a neat story about that and here is where tore blows my

187
00:10:19.851 --> 00:10:23.540
mind right out my face as he explains it.

188
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.910
Every drug out there in the world, every single one,

189
00:10:25.911 --> 00:10:30.911
even the ones you see on TV or in a sense already inside our heads,

190
00:10:31.401 --> 00:10:34.550
your brain must have its own internal chemicals.

191
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.510
The only reason those drugs work he says is because our brain has receptors for

192
00:10:38.511 --> 00:10:40.400
them and why would it have those receptors?

193
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.690
Because it can already make them inhouse every pharmacological agent or drug

194
00:10:44.691 --> 00:10:45.524
that there is.

195
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:50.090
You know there is a chemical that's produced by your own brain that essentially

196
00:10:50.091 --> 00:10:50.924
does that thing

197
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.510
where it's like an internal pharmacy in there that's docked full of drugs.

198
00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.380
Right. And we just have to figure out how to unlock it.

199
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.410
<v 7>We have a of Tava as you said, we can turn the pharmacy,</v>

200
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.440
but we don't know why. Sometimes for you does not work.

201
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.771
<v 0>What? What does that mean? Well,</v>

202
00:11:08.771 --> 00:11:12.070
what it means is that the placebo effect though it can be incredibly powerful

203
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.500
[inaudible] it's rarely consistent.

204
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.500
It's hard to predict who's going to get a placebo effect under what

205
00:11:17.501 --> 00:11:18.334
circumstances.

206
00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:22.870
But just imagine if we could figure this out and we can have all the drugs we

207
00:11:22.871 --> 00:11:25.350
ever need without those nasty side.

208
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.180
<v 7>Oh yes, absolutely. Yes.</v>

209
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.650
We are working a lot with drug companies in this direction

210
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.630
<v 0>with Dr Benedetti he's looking at now,</v>

211
00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:37.260
which could be huge for patients with chronic pain, right. Is to take

212
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.280
<v 7>I toxic drug like morphine,</v>

213
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.560
<v 0>gradually replace it with a placebo substitute.</v>

214
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.490
So say on Monday he would give you some morphine and then on Tuesday slip in a

215
00:11:46.491 --> 00:11:47.110
placebo

216
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:51.210
<v 7>and you'd give motion to gay on Wednesday and the placebos on Thursday and so</v>

217
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:55.630
forth. In the longer run that you can have a reduction of morphine by 50%

218
00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:00.810
<v 4>Aha. And perhaps one day, I'm sorry, I can't contain my enthusiasm.</v>

219
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.130
We won't need drugs at all.

220
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.000
Maybe one day we'll have a little box that I can plug directly into my midbrain

221
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.130
and I can just spend all day hitting the joy button. Jolene joy,

222
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.333
joy

223
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.123
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

224
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:25.910
<v 4>Hello. Sorry about that too. Well,</v>

225
00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:30.710
while we're waiting for your glorious drug soaked future,

226
00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.250
you can do it much more simply by simply telling a story.

227
00:12:34.251 --> 00:12:37.190
I'll tell you a story about telling stories. How about that?

228
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.440
I have no idea what you're talking about, right? Well, let me start with,

229
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:42.880
it's a story I learned from Daniel car, Daniel B car, m d a.

230
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.490
He told me about a guy who's really the father of placebo research.

231
00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.950
His name is Henry Henry.

232
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.110
On the banks on angst on [inaudible]. Annexed is his original name, German.

233
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:57.470
As Dr Carl will tell you which given the poor quality of my German,

234
00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:02.500
I would roughly scan as meaning anti anxiety or perhaps anti pain.

235
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:09.200
This may be one of those cases with a name shapes the man.

236
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.160
It may well be,

237
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:13.910
it may well be because even though he ends up changing his name to beat. Sure.

238
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.410
Henry knows Beecher.

239
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:19.070
He does go into medicine to become a doctor and then during World War II he

240
00:13:19.071 --> 00:13:21.330
joined the army as a doctor and found himself,

241
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.940
did the great battle of Anzio when the Americans landed in Nazi Europe and he

242
00:13:25.941 --> 00:13:27.860
was right there

243
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.580
<v 5>on the beach. Well, let's, we're flying.</v>

244
00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.890
Soldiers were being killed and some were being wounded.

245
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.420
<v 4>Sergeant [inaudible] and sins. Beecher was the doctor.</v>

246
00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:43.550
It was his job to treat them. That's correct.

247
00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:51.340
The treatment at that time for pain as it still is nowadays was morphine.

248
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.030
One problem though,

249
00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.310
features division was cut off from supplies and reinforcements and he began to

250
00:13:58.311 --> 00:14:03.020
run low on morphine. He had to figure out which soldiers needed it the most.

251
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:04.031
And he's,

252
00:14:04.031 --> 00:14:07.400
he's talking to them and he's asking him that how much pain they're actually

253
00:14:07.401 --> 00:14:09.890
having. And this is Scott Podolsky, who's a doctor and his star.

254
00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.940
And he would go up to these patients and see them soldier.

255
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.060
Yes. As you lie there, as you lie there,

256
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:21.050
are you having any of you having any pain, quote unquote. So imagine Jed,

257
00:14:21.051 --> 00:14:21.711
you're a soldier,

258
00:14:21.711 --> 00:14:25.670
you're lying there with shrapnels stuck in your guns or severe injuries and you

259
00:14:25.671 --> 00:14:29.540
haven't had any morphine for at least seven hours previously. Yeah. Seven hours.

260
00:14:29.541 --> 00:14:34.160
So what would you say, what would I say? Well, um, I'd say,

261
00:14:34.161 --> 00:14:36.530
give me some more freedom in pain. What you want to know? Something.

262
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:40.310
The striking finding was that in 75% of them they'd say, no, no,

263
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.790
no doc, I'm okay. I don't need any morphine right now.

264
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.250
Three quarters of them said that, wow,

265
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.100
this didn't make a whole lot of sense to be true because he knew about pain

266
00:14:49.101 --> 00:14:51.770
before the war. He ran a clinic, Boston.

267
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.400
So he would see people with bullet injuries and gut injuries. More or less.

268
00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:58.680
Yeah, the same kind of injuries you saw on the battlefield, but back in Boston,

269
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:03.420
doc, they really hurt. Did I have anyone? Morphine please. Nurse.

270
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.600
For some dreams, reasons has Daniel car,

271
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:11.630
the intensity of the pain associated with being shot was lower in the

272
00:15:11.641 --> 00:15:15.740
battlefield than in civilian life. What could explain that? Yeah,

273
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.570
maybe soldiers are just, they're tough guys. They don't. They suck it up.

274
00:15:18.571 --> 00:15:23.400
They don't. Well, no, no context context. That was Beatriz.

275
00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.580
Very simple explanation. Context, context,

276
00:15:26.581 --> 00:15:29.610
meaning that the pain that you feel when you're hit by a bullet,

277
00:15:29.611 --> 00:15:31.350
it's not just about the bullet,

278
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.070
it's just as much about the story that comes with the bullet.

279
00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.260
So consider these two different stories. Story number one,

280
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:41.480
you are a soldier and you've been shot

281
00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.980
as the Bullitt pastors to you. The first thing you think is, Oh man,

282
00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:52.820
I'm shot. The second thing you think is, wait a second, I'm alive.

283
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.480
If I can be evacuated from here, I'll have a period of recuperation.

284
00:15:56.481 --> 00:15:58.580
They'll take me to a hospital, there'll be nurses there.

285
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.980
I may get a medal and a pension or bonus. I'll certainly be acclaimed.

286
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.860
They'll send me home, throw me a parade.

287
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.823
<v 5>I'll be a hero.</v>

288
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.530
<v 4>Now consider the civilian story this time you're a regular guy,</v>

289
00:16:12.531 --> 00:16:15.920
civilian in Boston. Maybe you own a shock kit. Can I help you sir? Pick up.

290
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:17.380
Give me your money. God, no,

291
00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:22.460
and you've been shot as the bullet passes to you this time,

292
00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:28.640
the thoughts flashing to your head have nothing to do with glory. That's right.

293
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.970
Instead you think, yeah, I'm alive, but what's going to happen to me now?

294
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.980
You wouldn't get a medal. You were in trouble.

295
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.310
Am I going to pay the doctor bills going to be out of commission,

296
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.000
but I'll lose my job? How do I pay the rent?

297
00:16:38.001 --> 00:16:40.730
And if your family was depending upon you, they suffered.

298
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.390
Nothing good is going to come up. This one bullet,

299
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:49.450
two very different stories and it's the difference in the stories to Dr.

300
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.950
Be true. That explains the difference in the experience of pain.

301
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.480
Those stories you're saying or are somehow filtering the pain even before it's

302
00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.740
felt here,

303
00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:02.180
that even as the bullet enters the skin right away or within seconds thereafter,

304
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.540
you spin yourself a story about what's going to happen to you next.

305
00:17:05.541 --> 00:17:06.374
Not Consciously,

306
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:11.540
but way down deep in your head and the story you tell that makes all the

307
00:17:11.541 --> 00:17:12.374
difference.

308
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:19.470
<v 9>Scientists currently view our whole identity as something that we construct one</v>

309
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.880
fraction of a second to another.

310
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.350
You are the unfolding of an ongoing narrative,

311
00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:31.750
but it's not just a narrative in words. It's a narrative that involves touch,

312
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.430
color, odors.

313
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:37.200
We use all those inputs to generate the next frame from the last four

314
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:46.960
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

315
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.340
<v 4>That's true. Let me talk for a second about color. He just mentioned color,</v>

316
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.290
<v 3>right? Daniel Mormon. Yeah. Okay.</v>

317
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.370
Tell me something really interesting about color and pills.

318
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.510
Cool colored pills,

319
00:17:57.511 --> 00:18:02.511
blue pills or purple pills as placebos make better sleeping tablets than yellow

320
00:18:04.021 --> 00:18:07.500
or red pills, which tend to wake people up. That's been, that's been shown.

321
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.200
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a, okay, take two pills that are the same.

322
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.520
It says color, one blue,

323
00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.000
call it the other red and the people that take the blue pill will sleep longer

324
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:17.790
or they will sleep better than people who took the red. But this has been shown,

325
00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:22.020
he says all over the world except, and here's the cool part. Yeah.

326
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.650
Except in Italy, Italy, him in Italy,

327
00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.760
blue sleeping tablets of the paradoxical effect of being sleep inducing for

328
00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:34.500
women but not for men. What, how does that work? Well, I'm not really sure,

329
00:18:34.501 --> 00:18:35.460
but uh,

330
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.520
but my speculation is that the Italian national football team is called

331
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.990
[inaudible], which is blue.

332
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:48.110
And so what blue evokes in an Italian man is the World Cup and soccer and

333
00:18:48.361 --> 00:18:49.480
screaming and hollering again.

334
00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:54.970
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

335
00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:56.550
<v 3>and it's hardly something that's like</v>

336
00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.003
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

337
00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:03.410
<v 3>you guys by contrast, Hulu for Italian women is the color of the virgin.</v>

338
00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.050
Ah, the original does of course always presented in blue.

339
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:16.240
And the virgin is a very comforting and protective figure for women in Italian

340
00:19:16.241 --> 00:19:17.074
culture.

341
00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.040
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

342
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.270
<v 3>language and meaning are, are the most crucial dimensions of our lives.</v>

343
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.713
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

344
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.050
<v 3>this is Radiolab.</v>

345
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.870
I'm Chad up and Rod Robert Krulwich and I will continue in a moment.
