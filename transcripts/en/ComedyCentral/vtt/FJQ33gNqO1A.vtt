00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:04.671
Ugh!

00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.006
I hope it's not a hybrid.

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:07.907

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:12.078
What are you doing?

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:12.912

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.816
I just detailed this puppy.

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.650

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.485
- Yeah!

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:20.320
Got a new air freshener,

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:23.990

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.225
- Why are you my driver?

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:26.559
- Oh, it's gorilla
marketing, you know?

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.328
They thought this was
the most efficient way

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.063
to get the word out

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.131

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.098

You know what I miss
about making our movie?

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:39.706
- Getting paid to
nap in the trailer?

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:42.242 align:start size:88% position:13%
- The immediate feedback
on my personality.

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:43.076
- Uh huh.

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:44.210
- Are you in a rush?

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.045
- I am.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.913
- Aren't we all?

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:48.248
I wanna be a father,

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.450 align:start size:88% position:13%
but I think I'd be
better as a cool uncle,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.284
you know what I mean?

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:52.252
He wears no pants.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:53.086
He lives in the basement.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:53.987
He doesn't have a job.

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:54.821
Nobody cares.

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:55.989
He's the cool,

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.257 align:start size:84% position:16%
yet slightly
misunderstood uncle.

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:58.224

00:00:58.224 --> 00:00:59.492
What's going on?

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:00.760
- No, these are just
my unscripted thoughts

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.529

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:03.763
You know, cool uncle.

You go to him if
you need a condom.

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:06.733
This guy knows what
I'm talking about.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.567
- Who? What guy?

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:08.501
- Speaking of driving,

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:09.969
you know what drives me batty?

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.137
- Oh, god.

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:12.172 align:start size:84% position:16%

hey, it's mom.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:14.474
- I wish I had headphones.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.176
- Yes, I know who you are.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.278 align:start size:84% position:16%
I recognize your voice
from yelling at me

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:19.712
to move out of the basement.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.114
- Is this what you're doing?

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:23.183 align:start size:97% position:3%
Trapping people and forcing
your comedy on them?

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:24.217
- No.

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:25.051
Just like, you know,

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:26.052

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:29.189
what I'm talking about, right?

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.023
- What guy?

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:30.857
There's no guy.

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:32.459
- What else is going on?

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:33.460 align:start size:94% position:6%
Oh, how--
- Okay, what are we doing?

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.394
Why aren't we moving?

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:36.062
- Oh, I'm completely out of gas.

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:38.998
Air conditioner and hair
conditioner sound the same,

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.100
but they're totally different.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.067
No one's like,

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:42.202
turn on the hair conditioner.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:44.504
- That joke's a four.

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:45.672

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:46.506
Ten?

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:47.340

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.641
Four?

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.243
You know, mint's a
funny word, right?

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:52.879 align:start size:97% position:3%
Like, you could say
something's mint condition,

- Wait, we haven't
even had sex again yet.

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:02.789 align:start size:81% position:19%
- I'm just not

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.424
I only have sex once
on the first date.

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:06.126
