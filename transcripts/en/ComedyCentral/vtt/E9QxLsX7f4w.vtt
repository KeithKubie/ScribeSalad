 - So this thing is about Tom
 Felton and Emily Rodakowski

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:08.374
 playing secret service agents?

00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:10.243 align:start position:0%
  Yeah right, and I've never
  been to a whore house

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.411
 in Thailand.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.279 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - What's up homies,
 how we doing?

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:14.480
 Oh I'm sorry.

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:17.784
 What's up Kevin, are
 you feeling well?

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:21.087 align:start position:0%
 - Do they turn you out of
 some kind of Seacrest factory

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.422 size:84% position:42%
  because you're in my star
  path and you've been on

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:24.457 size:88% position:44%
  my dick for years.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.625 size:84% position:42%
  What's your beef?

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:28.561 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Listen Centrum Silver,
I want your show.

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:30.496 size:88% position:44%
  Okay, and you're
  in the way of that

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.365 size:84% position:42%
  and everyone knows you're
  a fuck up so step aside

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:34.400
 and let me take it all right?

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:37.270 align:start position:0%
 - If I hadn't had hemorrhoid
 surgery a week ago

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:39.405 size:84% position:42%
  I would kick your
  ass right here.

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:41.441 align:start position:0%
  - Hi, so we're going to
  head up to the 15th floor.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:42.442 size:88% position:44%
  We're going to get
  started soon okay?

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:45.645 align:start size:88% position:13%
 So you three please
 come with me.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.413
- It's like Celebrity
Death Match but without

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:49.382 size:88% position:44%
 the celebrity part.

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:51.818
 (upbeat music)

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:57.490
 - You are such a little shit.

00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:58.624 size:88% position:44%
  I've heard enough.

00:00:58.657 --> 00:01:00.359 size:88% position:44%
 I think you're just
 born a douche bag.

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:01.427 size:84% position:42%
  - You're so dumb.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.395
- Tom, that's movie's terrific.

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:03.529
 No seriously, you are.

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:04.430 size:84% position:42%
  - You never stop.

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:05.398
 - Do you get that in
 your mother's milk.

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.532 size:84% position:42%
  - You never stop.

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:07.433 size:88% position:44%
 - [Voiceover] What up guys?

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.133
 - [Voiceover] Oh my
 god look, fudge tray.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:10.303
- [Voiceover] Are you for real?

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.405
- Dude.

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:14.440
- I'm available.

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:15.308
- Great.

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.346
I will just get on this
supermodel's elevator.

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:26.786
 - I'm Emily.

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:29.489
 - Hey Deckard.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.424
- Oh my god, from Movie Leagues?

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:33.092
- Yeah.

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:34.694 size:84% position:42%
  - Wow, I loved your piece
  on the DC multi-verse.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:37.163
- Did Kevin put you up to this?

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:40.266
- I don't know who Kevin
is, but can I just say

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.202
 like can we please all
 agree what Cannon is?

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:46.272 align:start position:0%
 Don't throw away what Grant
 Guston is doing on CW.

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:47.340 size:88% position:44%
  - Oh my god right?

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:48.341
- [Emily] Yeah.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:49.542
- Why don't you give him
a little room jerk face?

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:50.576
 - Jerk face?

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:51.777
- Yeah.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.446
 - What was that like the hot
 insult of 1993 or something?

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.814 size:88% position:44%
  - You know Tom, I
  want to apologize.

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:56.549
This is unprofessional.

00:01:56.582 --> 00:01:58.518 size:88% position:44%
 I don't mean to involve you
 in what we're doing here.

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.987
 - It's fine, it's fine really.

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:05.491 align:start position:0%
 - No, no, no look, you
 don't have to bring yourself

00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:06.559 size:88% position:44%
 into it, seriously.

00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:08.128
It's between us.

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:10.497
- That's weird.

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:13.566 align:start position:0%
 - [Voiceover] Ladies and
 gentlemen, our elevator power

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.234 size:84% position:42%
  is temporarily shut down.

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:19.105 size:84% position:42%
  Please remain calm, sorry
  for the inconvenience.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.608
- Oh, oh, are you, are you okay?

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.378
 - You would make an
 amazing Wonder Woman.

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:27.713
 - Okay you know when
 they say remain calm,

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:30.416 align:start position:0%
  that means that they can't
  do anything about this

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:31.350 size:88% position:44%
  right now.

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:33.553
We are all going to die in here.

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:34.687 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - No, no, no, we
 are not going to die

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.088 size:88% position:44%
 because I just got
 verified on Twitter

00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:37.423
and it is really
hard to do that.

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:39.058
All right, now is not the time.

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:40.560 size:88% position:44%
 - Would you just calm down?

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:43.296 size:84% position:42%
  - I knew I was going to
  die with somebody famous.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.463
 Take me Lord.

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:45.398 size:84% position:42%
  - [Tom] What is he doing?

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:46.532 size:88% position:44%
 No one's going to die dude.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:49.769 align:start position:0%
 - There's a hooker's panties
 in my glove compartment.

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.237
 - Is he, is he crying?

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.706
 - (crying) There's so
 many regrets I have.

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.475
 I should have punched
 you so much earlier.

00:02:56.508 --> 00:03:00.012 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - So wait, like you've
 written 23 books

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:01.214 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and you haven't
 published any of them?

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.249 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Well I'm almost
 done with number 24.

00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:05.284
 - I would love to read that.

00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:06.519
 - You would?

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:09.455
 - Yeah, I'd love to
 get inside that brain.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:11.424
- Okay.

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:14.160 size:88% position:44%
 - You guys need to
 sort your shit out,

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:16.128 align:start size:88% position:13%
 okay, this isn't,
 it's not professional,

00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:17.564 size:84% position:42%
  it's not healthy.

00:03:18.497 --> 00:03:19.465 size:84% position:42%
  Try this.

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:21.300
 We used to actually do
 this on Potter when me

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:22.368
 and Maggie Smith would clash.

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:25.371 size:84% position:42%
  You're going to look deep
  into each other's eyes

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:28.207 align:start position:0%
 and say the very first thing
 that comes to your mind.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.242
- Crypt keeper.

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:30.176
 - Job stealer.

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:30.710
- Did you call my crypt keeper?

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:32.378
 - Yes.

00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:33.179 align:start position:0%
 - That, that, that's no, that
 was like four words each.

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:34.447
 It was supposed to be.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.248 size:84% position:42%
  - He did too many
  words, I did one.

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:36.482 size:88% position:44%
 - Well I...

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:37.416
 - I did one word, so
 I followed the rules.

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.118 size:84% position:42%
  Let's try something else.

00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:41.687
- This is taking a while, yeah?

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.457
- Wait, we're not in
the elevator right now?

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.725
 - No.

00:03:45.758 --> 00:03:46.392
 - Honestly this whole
 time I thought we were

00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:47.793
in the elevator.

00:03:47.826 --> 00:03:48.694 align:start position:0%
 - Yeah, no, no, we're
 definitely not in an elevator

00:03:48.727 --> 00:03:50.296 size:88% position:44%
  right now.

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.564 size:88% position:44%
 - We haven't gone anywhere?

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:53.332 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - No, we're definitely
 in the lobby.

00:03:53.365 --> 00:03:55.568
- What floor are we on?

00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:56.502
 - In a lobby.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.305
- Shake it, get that energy out.

00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:01.207 size:88% position:44%
 - You don't exist because
 you're not on social media.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.608 size:88% position:44%
  - Hummmmm.

00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:05.311
 - Kevin you're really
 kind of my role model.

00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:06.712
 - You're a cat, you're a cat.

00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:08.681
 - Christopher, I feel
 like you're my son.

00:04:08.714 --> 00:04:09.515
 Am I cat too?

00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:11.150
- No, you're a unicorn.

00:04:11.183 --> 00:04:12.452
- Woo, running.

00:04:13.752 --> 00:04:15.421 size:88% position:44%
 - Let's hug it out.

00:04:15.454 --> 00:04:18.992 align:start position:0%
  - No, no, with
  Christopher, Christopher.

00:04:30.602 --> 00:04:34.774 align:start position:0%
 - [Kevin] (crying) You're
 like a son to me, like a son.

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:39.111 align:start position:0%
 - Do you ever feel like
 these kind of things happen

00:04:39.144 --> 00:04:40.813
 for a reason?

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:44.417 align:start position:0%
 - Like when Kylo Ren murdered
 his father Hans Solo.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.552 size:84% position:42%
  - Spoiler alert, but yes.

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:48.587
- I do.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.790 size:84% position:42%
  (sighing)

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:53.660
 - Oh.

00:04:55.694 --> 00:04:58.731
 - Oh hey, guys this is Emily.

00:04:58.764 --> 00:04:59.765 align:start size:88% position:13%
 We were just trapped
 in the elevator

00:04:59.798 --> 00:05:01.434 size:84% position:42%
  and it was magical and...

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.202
- I was just trying to be nice.

00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:04.137 size:88% position:44%
 - Oh sorry.

00:05:05.437 --> 00:05:06.472 size:88% position:44%
  - Call me.

00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:12.178 size:84% position:42%
  (dinging)

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:14.213 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Hey thank Tom,
 thanks, thanks a lot.

00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:15.247 size:88% position:44%
 - Tom, thank you very much.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.482 size:84% position:42%
  - All right guys.

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:17.483
- Yeah, I just wanted to
be clear on something.

00:05:17.516 --> 00:05:19.118
 If anyone catches wind
 of this I'm just going

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:19.752 size:88% position:44%
 to deny it.

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:20.586
 - Deny what?

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:21.420 size:88% position:44%
  - Exactly.

00:05:21.453 --> 00:05:22.455 size:88% position:44%
  - All right, cool.

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:23.488
 (rock music)
