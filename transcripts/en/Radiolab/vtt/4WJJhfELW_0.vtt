00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.900
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab today. Uh,

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.740
kind of a hard topic to describe. We're calling it, um,

3
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.390
animal minds animal more.

4
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.690
Maybe the better way to say this is mines other than our own,

5
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.440
which would be the animals. No, that's the, yeah, we're we're animals though.

6
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.260
Yeah, you're right. Yeah. So we live with, yeah.

7
00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:22.060
Wherever you weren't having enough trouble just talking to each other.

8
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.930
But imagine if I would try, if you were a Labrador, that'd be tough. See,

9
00:00:25.931 --> 00:00:29.120
then we'd have a problem or a way. That's kind of what we're looking at.

10
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.120
How much can you really share with, you know, a Labrador or a whale. Right?

11
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.640
And we're not solving this problem in this show at all. No,

12
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.720
but we really could do this.

13
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:39.840
Maybe instead of talking to scientists about other minds,

14
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.910
maybe we should talk to, um, a writer. Yeah. Paul, can you hear me?

15
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.540
Paul, can you hear Paul? Paul, Paul, Paul, the writer. We chose to look for it.

16
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.440
You may now know. Wasn't named Paul. Okay. Standby. Paul. Through hearing,

17
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.100
he's the author of any number of travel books, novels.

18
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.110
Didn't he win a big prize? I'm sure. Yes. Is that Jed? Yes. Hi j d,

19
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.640
that's me. And like a Pulitzer, one of the,

20
00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:08.860
one of the big ones and I didn't win a Pulitzer, but he,

21
00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:12.760
he won a prize of my heart when he wrote that Patagonia Express. Oh,

22
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.240
so you're taping. Okay, great. Yes, yes. Anyhow,

23
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.900
Paul through travels all around the world writing about all kinds of things,

24
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:23.370
but the reason we called him is for something that actually happened in his

25
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:26.880
backyard, which luckily for him happens to be in the state of Hawaii.

26
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.970
I own seven acres on a slope,

27
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.680
a west facing slope on the north shore of Oahu. And I had very,

28
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:38.820
very long grass and someone said, oh, I know what you need it. Some geese,

29
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.050
they'll take care of that grass.

30
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.630
So I got a couple and you decided not to go to the hardware store and buy a lawn

31
00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:48.480
mower. You decided to buy to animate bird. That's right. I would've deed.

32
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:51.990
So I really, really serious industrial Moa.

33
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.570
Instead I got to nonindustrial geese.

34
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.720
<v 1>I actually got three two gand in a goose and this strange thing happened,</v>

35
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.360
one of the Candace imprinted on me.

36
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.543
So what does that mean?

37
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.880
Show me the baby chick boy looked at you as 10 the first moving thing they see

38
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.390
is the mother figure. This goose became very attached,

39
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.200
very protective. It would sit by lap. When another goose came up,

40
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.030
it would peck at them. Anyway,

41
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.930
it was both protective and attentive.

42
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.100
But as the gander grew up,

43
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.860
<v 0>strange things began to happen. First it became detached from me,</v>

44
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.730
then aggressive toward me and then needed me.

45
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.460
It was very strange and it made me think,

46
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.730
I want to get some more geese and I want to read more about them and then and

47
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:50.690
then watch them. So he, well he asked friends and friends said to him, look,

48
00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:53.450
if you want to know everything that's important to know about geese,

49
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:55.760
you have to read. He be white.

50
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.250
Most people mentioned Eby white when they talk about geese.

51
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.250
And of course I know and love Eby and if you're not a Marcia and you'd probably

52
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:06.910
love Eby too. I mean, what do you mean? And B people.

53
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:08.230
It's possible for people not to move,

54
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.350
read Stuart little or how many people read Charlotte's web?

55
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.830
And if you don't love the children's fiction, he's certainly one of the great,

56
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.650
greatest of all American essayist. Yeah, see that's the point.

57
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:20.800
He's one of the great American writers. He actually, uh,

58
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.430
wrote the Bible for a writing elements of style of the Bible for writing

59
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:27.940
weirdly. And it was written like 50 years ago.

60
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.720
So when people point to anything by a BYG, you point seriously.

61
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.430
And in this case, very late in life, after he'd moved up to a cabin in Maine,

62
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:38.780
he was in his seventies.

63
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.480
And this particular essay we're going to talk about is called very simply the

64
00:03:42.481 --> 00:03:46.320
geese, the geese, Allen Cove,

65
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.900
July 9th, 1971.

66
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.313
<v 2>Okay.</v>

67
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.740
<v 0>I've had a pair of elderly gray goose goose and the gander living on this place</v>

68
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:00.580
for a number of years and they have been my friend.

69
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.310
So Paul threw open the US alien the spring,

70
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.890
fully expecting to learn all about these.

71
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.580
But then he kept running across these little phrases and adjectives that made

72
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:17.860
him cringe.

73
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.410
[inaudible] he talks about a Gosling that grows into, I'm quoting now, a real,

74
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.650
real dandy full of pompous thoughts and surely just thoughts and surly gestures.

75
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.180
You know, they'd come on, I mean, doesn't that make the goose a little bit more,

76
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.890
um, easy to relate to? Alright, take one word malice.

77
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.800
I could not tell whether the looking is,

78
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.550
I was one of novice or affectional lists. Fellas is a word you use for,

79
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.250
you know, Mussolini or you know, somebody else from deuce.

80
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.700
But what's the sin in that?

81
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.560
If a man who's a professional storyteller and one of the greatest ones says,

82
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.360
let me tell you about my keys.

83
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.420
And then talks about them as though they were uncles,

84
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.020
aunts and neighbors with moods that are distinctly human.

85
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.180
You could say so. Or You could say so what if you put them in, you know,

86
00:05:12.181 --> 00:05:14.520
little Halloween costumes too for that matter. So what,

87
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.510
but I'm in the writing business. The business, it should be unsparing.

88
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.260
He could be quite unsparing himself in his writing.

89
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.170
You're giving if you write too much license,

90
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.230
if you're saying it really doesn't matter, it does matter to me.

91
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.160
And the reason it matters says Paul Theroux is it?

92
00:05:32.161 --> 00:05:37.161
Eby got so attached to the idea of those geese as aging critters like himself

93
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.210
did he missed something deep and important about the Geek?

94
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:47.800
The elements of that behavior that is,

95
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.910
that is pure groups all pointed to the end of the essay. Suddenly,

96
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.300
I heard sounds of a rumble outside in the bond where the ganders where formerly

97
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.680
Greek gander gets unseated by a younger meal. Goose is a big fight,

98
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.520
lots of squawking and the old gander loses.

99
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.900
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

100
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.970
<v 3>I watched as he threaded his way,</v>

101
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:18.840
slowly down the narrow path between clumps of pistols and daisies.

102
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.130
His head was barely visible above the grasses,

103
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.330
but his broken spirit was plain to any eye.

104
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.800
I felt very deeply his sorrow and his two feet,

105
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.520
<v 0>the defeated Aganda goes off. Well, this isn't true at all.</v>

106
00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:38.550
When aganda loses a battle, he goes off,

107
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.940
gets his strength back and waits for a chance to attack again.

108
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.040
That kind is going to come back and fight again.

109
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.370
So you're saying that he got it wrong? Of course. Of course.

110
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.610
Here's a man who is solitary.

111
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.850
He's a New Yorker who goes to Maine and becomes a gentleman farmer of a kind and

112
00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.000
begins to relate to his geese and then writes about them as though he's one of

113
00:07:00.001 --> 00:07:04.920
them. I know I'm not one of them, but if you can't use words that are,

114
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.950
you know, very human and psychological words,

115
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.280
and if you can't because you're not a goose,

116
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.510
have whatever it is that ds have on there inside,

117
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.690
then what if you wanted to share something with a goose and I bet you you do.

118
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:28.310
Is there any way in which you could honestly describe yourself as a friend of

119
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.640
any of these gates?

120
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.720
<v 4>Oh yeah. I would say, you know, the, the, this is a very good question. I,</v>

121
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.600
I had a very surly to use an Eby white word, a very, uh, very,

122
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.040
um, rambunctious Ganda and he got very sick. You know,

123
00:07:50.041 --> 00:07:53.400
the thing is sitting on the ground just falling its nest.

124
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.960
I thought he was really going to die and I nursed him back to health.

125
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.550
I gave him, uh, a antibiotic with a Turkey based, uh,

126
00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.390
and it took about three or four weeks.

127
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.870
And the first thing he did when he was nurse back to health he is,

128
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.830
he got up on two legs and I came up with the Turkey base to give him one last

129
00:08:13.831 --> 00:08:18.600
drink and he bit me and I thought, pop, where did he bite?

130
00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.230
He bit my leg hard. And I thought, okay, he's back to hell.

131
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.970
You didn't think al You. How could you?

132
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.560
<v 0>Well, I thought he, he's, he's healthy.</v>

133
00:08:25.561 --> 00:08:28.440
He's healthy again and he's behaving just as a goose.

134
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.630
Why don't you see though that if the moment of true of your true most goosey

135
00:08:33.631 --> 00:08:37.920
moment is a moment when you're with the goose that you help bites you,

136
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:42.870
then you are out of this story in effect. I absolutely,

137
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:47.870
<v 4>totally agree with that. In all of this, there's an implied, uh, loneliness.</v>

138
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.290
I'm not his friend. I'm not a feathered creature.

139
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.180
I'm a human being among birds.

140
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:00.770
Well,

141
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.770
curiously Paul Theroux does have an approach to communing with his keys.

142
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:12.240
He takes a chair, puts it on the lawn, plops down in the chair

143
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.020
and disappears. You know,

144
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:20.860
my writing day ends or the early afternoon I have lunch and after lunch there's

145
00:09:20.861 --> 00:09:24.850
a long sunny period in the afternoon when I'm alone,

146
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.360
I'm with the geese and I sit around with them and try to make out what they're

147
00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:35.650
doing among each other and paying no particular attention to meet.

148
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.490
It's simply watching the world as it was.

149
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:44.950
You're seeing creatures who are behaving as though cities don't exist.

150
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.050
Presidents don't exist. Governments don't exist.

151
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.620
Roads don't exist as if it's before the fall.

152
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.710
Well as though it's the peaceable kingdom,

153
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:59.380
simply watching animals who are content doing their thing.

154
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.600
Then you feel a bit like Adam

155

164
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:04.940
It just feels weird to end the show this way with this lonely geese thing,

165
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:09.300
so we're going to play for you. One final story. It's kind of a continuation,

166
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.470
uh, of Paul through in his geese,

167
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.040
except involves a very different guy in a very different climate. First of all,

168
00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:16.840
who would, who are you, what's your name?

169
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:21.070
My name is Paul Nicklin and I'm a contributing photographer to National

170
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.820
Geographic magazine. Paul Nicklin is basically national geographics, Arctic guy.

171
00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:25.210
It's,

172
00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:29.680
I've been pegged as their polar specialist and this particular tale involves his

173
00:11:29.681 --> 00:11:32.830
attempt to photograph one of the Great Arctic predators,

174
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.940
the leopard seal leopard seal, which by reputation is a very nasty creature.

175
00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.860
Preface to this story is in 2003, tragically, a scientist was actually killed.

176
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.970
Kirstie Brown was doing underwater research and she was taken down by a leopard

177
00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:48.310
seal and drown. Well, she just yanked off the ice.

178
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.670
She was swimming and it just came up and grabbed her and took her down to 300

179
00:11:51.671 --> 00:11:52.800
feet. Nonetheless,

180
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.670
our story starts with Paul and his guide go down there in a boat and the Arctic

181
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:01.450
Ocean looking for seals. The first seal we encountered,

182
00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:04.980
I'd never seen a leopard seal before. And we came around in,

183
00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.580
into this bay where there was a penguin colony. And right away got on,

184
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:12.490
who's seen many, many leopard seals. He said to me, you know, bloody hell,

185
00:12:12.491 --> 00:12:14.110
that's the biggest seal I've ever seen.

186
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.450
And she came up to the boat with a penguin in her mouth.

187
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.200
She went underneath the boat and she started ramming the pain,

188
00:12:19.201 --> 00:12:22.090
went underneath the whole of the boat, lifting the bowel out of the water.

189
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.550
And that's when good on looks to me. And he says, Paul,

190
00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:28.510
it's time for you to get in the water. Yeah. And his thick Swedish accent. Wow.

191
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.740
Were you freaking out? I had dry mouth. Um, just from the nervousness,

192
00:12:32.741 --> 00:12:36.600
I was trembling and you know, I put my mask on and slipped over there,

193
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:41.350
the 29 degree Fahrenheit water. And uh, there she was instantly right there.

194
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:42.860
<v 2>Mm.</v>

195
00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:47.240
<v 6>Massive. Huge. Well, how huge. Probably over a thousand pounds. Oh my God.</v>

196
00:12:47.241 --> 00:12:48.074
12 feet long.

197
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.150
She dropped her pain when she came right over to me and she opened up her mouth

198
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.030
and she engulfed the front of the camera.

199
00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.990
Her canines were up on top of my head to her below my chin and I'm basically

200
00:12:59.991 --> 00:13:03.170
staring down her throat and I can't believe you managed to take a picture of

201
00:13:03.171 --> 00:13:06.770
this cause I'm looking at this picture and these teeth are huge,

202
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.120
the canines and they're like massive. So you were doing business at this moment?

203
00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.480
Yeah, I'm working at that point. You can even see the texture of the seals.

204
00:13:14.481 --> 00:13:17.720
Tongues, like she has these little fibers on it. It's 180 degree view.

205
00:13:17.721 --> 00:13:19.580
So he had to get that, that perspective.

206
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.650
I'm basically in the mouth to get that shot. Wow.

207
00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:25.670
So then what happened is she backs off, looks at me, sniffed my flippers,

208
00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.130
touched him with her nose, poked me in the bum, came up,

209
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:32.960
did this open mouth threat display again, then she swims away.

210
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:41.760
Wow. Just, I was just getting ready to swim back to the Zodiac. You know,

211
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.510
I've been in the water for quite awhile and I'm cold and all of a sudden she

212
00:13:45.511 --> 00:13:47.790
shows up with a freshly caught life. Penguin, chicken,

213
00:13:47.791 --> 00:13:51.630
her mouth [inaudible] and I'm sitting there staring at her and she stops about

214
00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:55.260
10 feet away from me and she's got the penguin by the feet and the penguin's

215
00:13:55.261 --> 00:13:56.790
flapping its flippers trying to get away.

216
00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.510
She lines a penguin up to face perfectly in my direction and she lets it go.

217
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.350
The penguin swam right by me and she chases off after it and grabs it,

218
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.040
comes back and does it again and again and again.

219
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.260
Why Gam and what was she doing?

220
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.000
At first I couldn't figure out what was going on.

221
00:14:12.001 --> 00:14:15.030
I thought maybe she was having a hard time eating it and then it dawned on me

222
00:14:15.031 --> 00:14:16.230
she was trying to feed me.

223
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.220
<v 2>Whoa.</v>

224
00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:24.910
<v 0>Well, how did you make any attempt during this period to say no thank you.</v>

225
00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:29.720
<v 6>No, nope. I'm so in such disbelief at this point. I'm just trying to capture it.</v>

226
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:33.240
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

227
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:33.361
<v 0>well,</v>

228
00:14:33.361 --> 00:14:38.280
didn't you feel compelled as a social human to just offer some kind of gestural

229
00:14:38.281 --> 00:14:41.740
explanation? I mean, with me, I would've made some look like con,

230
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.410
I don't eat that stuff. Or

231
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.780
<v 6>maybe it's like you take, you take the penguin at that point you're like,</v>

232
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:49.810
well I mean I couldn't rubs them, you know, penguins swimming 15 miles an hour,

233
00:14:49.811 --> 00:14:51.960
you know. Oh so you me wind up when she, lets go at it.

234
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.110
She goes film like a bullet. Oh he's pathetic.

235
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.160
Cause what he's saying is I'm a pathetic creature. I can't,

236
00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:59.450
I actually catch the [inaudible] exposures. Get the shot, keep shooting.

237
00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.540
You're such a photo dude. You know. Oh I'm, I work for NASA.

238
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.650
I don't want to anthropomorphize too much.

239
00:15:06.651 --> 00:15:10.010
But as the penguin was swimming by this huge seal,

240
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.730
she looked over at me and I swear she had a look of disgust interface.

241
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:19.810
So she goes off and gets another penguin and this penguin now is quite weak and

242
00:15:20.361 --> 00:15:23.780
tired looking. And so I think she's worn it down and she lets the penguin go.

243
00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:24.830
Penguin takes off,

244
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.980
she grabs it does out a couple more times and you're still not eating the

245
00:15:27.981 --> 00:15:29.120
penguin. Right.

246
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:32.840
Next encounter was bringing me dead penguins and sometimes she would just drop

247
00:15:32.841 --> 00:15:36.580
off a dead penguin right on top of the camera and she would just sit there with

248
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:39.320
this dejected look on her face staring at me.

249
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:43.280
And then she went to the stage of flipping dead penguins on top of my head and

250
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.460
trying to force feed me these penguins telling me at this point, you know,

251
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:50.270
eat these damn penguins. I'm trying to feed you. Why won't you eat my penguins,

252
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:51.163
eat the penguins.

253
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.350
And she would start to eat the penguins right in front of me and show me how to

254
00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:56.450
eat them. She would rip them apart on the surface,

255
00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.510
get the skin off them and she's stretching them in the water in front of me.

256
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.320
How much time is passing here? I mean we were talking minutes, hours.

257
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:07.350
This went on for four days for good.

258
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.070
And when you're in the water, you know, day after day,

259
00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:11.480
what's happening for you at this point?

260
00:16:11.481 --> 00:16:14.030
Are you still just a guy with a camera or, I mean,

261
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.080
I was starting to fall in love with the seal. It's just a [inaudible] animal.

262
00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:22.010
That's just so intelligent, so a powerful, and it could kill you in an instant.

263
00:16:22.011 --> 00:16:25.080
Yet you're, I mean, well, we'll usually, you are to love what you,

264
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.210
will you in love with the idea of this or did you really like her?

265
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.780
I really liked her. She was beautiful. She was big. She had this,

266
00:16:33.781 --> 00:16:34.910
this beautiful face,

267
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.480
beautiful silver color to her and she kind of glowed underwater.

268
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:42.170
I'm just so in love with the seal at this point. I'm not sleeping at night.

269
00:16:42.171 --> 00:16:44.360
I have a hard time eating. I just can't wait to see her.

270
00:16:44.361 --> 00:16:47.780
I can't the first thing in the morning, you know, first sign of light,

271
00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:48.680
I'm in that Zodiac

272
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:53.870
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

273
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.540
<v 6>and then on the fourth day is when, you know, I was thinking, okay,</v>

274
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:59.360
maybe she's weary of me and she's getting tired of me,

275
00:16:59.361 --> 00:17:00.770
so I'm just going to totally leave her alone.

276
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.920
That's when I started going off and presenting myself to other seals who were

277
00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:05.160
swimming around the rookery and,

278
00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:10.660
and I was in the water and same big female came up to me and she started to do

279
00:17:10.851 --> 00:17:12.980
all these really beautiful belly like moves.

280
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.220
I'm photographing her and looking at her and all of a sudden she drops her

281
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:20.190
penguin, she turns upside down and she does as big guttural Cook, Cook, Cook,

282
00:17:20.191 --> 00:17:24.590
Cook, Cook, cook, this big jarring noise as vibrating my whole body.

283
00:17:24.591 --> 00:17:27.710
I can really feel it in my chest. It's so loud and I'm thinking,

284
00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:28.580
am I being attacked?

285
00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:32.030
She'd finally told me that she's sick of me and wants me off her feeding

286
00:17:32.031 --> 00:17:34.070
grounds, but as soon as she did that,

287
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.090
another leopard seal shot out from right behind me and so this leopard seal had

288
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:41.630
stuck in behind me and she did that noise to chase that seal away,

289
00:17:41.631 --> 00:17:45.380
a smaller seal. She chased the seal away. It too had a penguin.

290
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.380
She grabbed its penguin and brought me that seal's penguin and dropped it off in

291
00:17:48.381 --> 00:17:51.690
front of me. Ah,

292
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.110
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

293
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:57.160
<v 6>wow. Lucky guy. Wow. I mean, what was getting emotional? We live in that.</v>

294
00:17:57.161 --> 00:17:58.150
I mean it's very powerful.

Have you ever been in love with an animal in quite this way before? Never.

296
00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:06.280
Never. Have you ever had an experience with a,

297
00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.850
with another human that rivals is perhaps when I was a kid with my mom,

298
00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.420
someone taking care of you and feeling safe and nurtured and protected,

299
00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:17.370
but I've never had that in, in my life as an adult. It sounds,

300
00:18:17.371 --> 00:18:20.710
this is such an interesting species moment here. I mean,

301
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.970
it sounds like you're doing something you're transgressing or something.

302
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.180
Sounds like you're stealing something from the gods right here,

303
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:31.340
right at this moment. I mean, I don't know what words I can find to,

304
00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:32.283
to explain it.

305
00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:34.400
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

306
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.920
<v 6>Thank you so much. Thank you.</v>
