00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.620
One of the best known features of Jupiter
is the great red spot.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.020
It's been there for hundreds of years, it's
a big storm, a vast hurricane on Jupiter.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.300
And when the Voyager spacecraft got a look
at that,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.120
it noticed you get complicated, turbulent
vortices spinning off.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.740
What we see on Jupiter is turbulence.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.960
Big vortices, smaller vortices, very small
vortices,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.449
and if we could look closely - smaller and
smaller and smaller ones.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.020
That's an example of chaos but it's chaotic
geometry.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.920
Any geometrical object with that structure
is called a fractal.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.300
So fractals are the geometry of chaos.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.260
They're unlike all the usual things you get
in geometry.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.460
You take something like a circle.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.180
If I've got a circle and I make it bigger
and bigger and bigger,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.280
look more closely at it, it just gets flatter
and flatter and flatter.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.320
Nothing interesting there.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.060
If I start with a sphere and make it bigger
and bigger,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.400
it just seems flatter and flatter like a plane.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.200
This is why a lot of people thought the Earth
was flat in ancient times.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.939
Fractals are different. When you magnify them,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.620
you see more and more and more structure.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.000
And yet that very intricate geometry can be
created by very simple mathematical rules.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.120
And the next demonstration is going to show
us an example

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.299
of a fractal pattern created by simple mathematical
rules.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.980
OK, now, I need some assistance for doing
this as well.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.380
Young man there.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.640
OK, and your name is? - Richard.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.219
OK, Richard, now what we've got here for you,
that's it,

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.759
you might as well stand there, is a whole
pile of stuff.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.680
There's a triangle marked one, two, three.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.000
Pile of red dots.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.380
A three sided die.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.080
It looks like an ordinary die but it's got
a 1 on that side,

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.380
and it's also got a 1 on the opposite side.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.189
And the same for the 2 and the 3.

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.630
So, you hold that for a minute, so whatever
you throw with that

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.479
is either a 1, a 2 or a 3.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.569
And you've also got a ruler. - OK.

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.110
So what we do is we start by putting a dot
somewhere in the triangle.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.260
I'll put it in the middle.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.140
Now roll that. It's a 2.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.130
I want you to find the point half way between
that dot and corner two.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.200
I'll pop it there if you tell me where to
put it.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.260
That's it, let's have a measure.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.780
OK, what's that? - 11.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.280
OK, so about there.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.219
And now do it again.

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.630
Three. OK, that's over there.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.340
So half way between your new dot and 3.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.849
About there? OK.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.040
That's alright, we can put that one back.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.260
And once more.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.610
One. Half way between your new dot and one.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.620
Right, and that would be? - 16.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.739
OK, that's great.

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:01.670
OK, thank you very much.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.840
So there's some simple mathematical rules.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.379
Roll the die. Start from wherever you are

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.629
and go half way towards the corner that the
die has given you.

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.519
And just repeat.

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.409
The question is - what shape would you expect
to see?

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.920
Well the most likely thing you'd expect to
see is just

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.939
a sort of smeary mess in the middle of the
triangle.

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:21.909
But let me show you what happens if you do
it thousands and thousands of times.

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:28.129
Again, we'll use the computer and we'll see
exactly what pattern builds up.

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.319
OK, we start with random looking dots.

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.659
Nothing very interesting, just sitting in
the triangle.

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.409
But now we'll just speed it up a little bit.
Keep going.

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:44.620
And you'll start to see very, very beautiful
surprising mathematical pattern appearing

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.970
here.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.280
This is called the Sierpinski gasket.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.870
Gasket, all of you car mechanics will know,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.959
a gasket is the thing you take out of your
car and it's full of holes of different sizes.

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.730
Sierpinski, Waclaw Sierpisnki was a Polish
mathematician

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.390
who invented this shape for totally different
reasons.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.510
It's got big holes in the middle

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.510
and then in the pieces around there are smaller
holes and smaller holes

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.609
and smaller holes and smaller holes.

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.670
And mathematically those holes go on forever.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.519
And that's typical of fractals.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.400
Simple rules create structure on all scales,
even the finest.
