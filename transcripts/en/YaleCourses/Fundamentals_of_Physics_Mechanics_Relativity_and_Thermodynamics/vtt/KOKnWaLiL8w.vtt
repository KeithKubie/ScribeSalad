1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.690
This is a first part of the year long course introducing you to all the major

2
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:11.010
ideas in physics,
starting from

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.220
Galileo and Newton,

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.300
right up to the big revolutions of the last century,

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.300
which was on relativity and quantum mechanics.

6
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.190
The target audience for this course is really very broad.
In fact,
uh,

7
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.510
have always been surprised at how broad the representation is.

8
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.550
So I don't know what your major is.
I don't know what you're going to do later.

9
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.870
So I picked the topics that all of us in physics find fascinating.
Uh,

10
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.700
some may or may not be useful,
but he just don't know.

11
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.820
Some of you are probably going to be doctors and you don't know why I'm going to

12
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:53.880
do a specialist activity or quantum mechanics,

13
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.360
but you don't know when it'll come in handy.

14
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.920
If you're a doctor and he got a patient who's running away from you or the speed

15
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:04.980
of light,
you'll know what to do.

16
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.710
Or if you're a pediatrician with a really small patient who will,

17
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.930
who will not sit still.

18
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.710
It's because the laws of quantum mechanics don't allow objects.

19
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.520
I have a definite cannot have a definite position and momentum.
So,

20
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.360
so these are all things you just don't know when they will come in handy.

21
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.270
And I teach them because uh,

22
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.660
these are the things that turned me on and got me going into physics and whether

23
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:35.550
or not you go into physics,

24
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.320
you should certainly learn about the biggest and most interesting revolutions

25
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.010
right up to present day physics.
All right,

26
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:47.250
so that's what the subject matter is going to be.

27
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.870
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about how the course is organized.

28
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.550
First thing is this year it's going to be taped.

29
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.610
You can see some people in the back of the cameras as part of an experimental

30
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.940
pilot program funded by the Hewlett Foundation.
And uh,

31
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.290
at some point they will decide what they will do with this lectures.

32
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.580
Most probably they'll post them somewhere so people for elsewhere can have the

33
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:18.390
benefit of uh,
what you have sitting in the yield classroom.

34
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.020
So I've been told that a firm,
not one,

35
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:27.021
we just ignore the camera and do business as usual and I think it's going to be

36
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:32.920
changed.
I tried to negotiate the laugh track so that the jokes don't work.

37
00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:36.300
We can superimpose some laughter.
I was stolen.
No,

38
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:40.350
I just got to deal with it as it happens.
So it's going to be,

39
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.490
it's like one of the reality show us where things are going to be asked.

40
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:47.850
They are and hopefully after awhile we'll uh,

41
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.190
we'll learn to act and behave normally and not worry about his presence.

42
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.920
Then coming to the rest of the details of course,
by the way,

43
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.710
that are more details on the website that I posted that was given to me by the

44
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:05.860
university.
If you want to know more about what all this is about,

45
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.600
the course organization is fairly simple.

46
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.070
We are going to meet Monday and Wednesday in this room.
Uh,

47
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.850
1130 to 1245.

48
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.990
I will give you some problems to do on Wednesday and I'll post them on the

49
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:26.290
website.
You guys should get used to going into the classes website.

50
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.610
I'm really,
really dependent on that now.
I finally learned how to use it.

51
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.480
I will use that to post information.
Uh,

52
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.420
maybe once in a while we'll send email to the whole class.

53
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.490
If you want to get those emails,

54
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.810
you got to sign up for the course because I push a button and it goes to anybody

55
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:44.770
who's signed up there.

56
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.660
The homework will be given on Wednesday and it's due before class the following

57
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:57.340
Wednesday.
And I let me introduce you to our head,

58
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:59.470
ta Myra Daniel,

59
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.890
who's recently Myra rabbits,

60
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.650
right?
Uh,
she's really come a little.
Okay.

61
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:13.651
Samira is going to be the person who will see you after class and she will take

62
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:20.410
the problem sets that you have submitted before class and she'll give you the

63
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:24.040
greater ones from after class.
Okay.
That'll be sorted out.

64
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.540
It'd be up there.

65
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.130
So you should drop the homework before they come into class rather than

66
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.400
furiously working on it during class and the solutions will be posted the same

67
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.200
afternoon so that it's not much point in giving a homework that's late,

68
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.660
but once in a while you know,

69
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:46.540
you will come up with a reason that I just cannot argue with.

70
00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.070
He got married getting a transplant,
whatever it is.

71
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.600
That's fine.
You got a transplant,
I want to see the old body part.

72
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.740
You got married,
I want to see your spouse.
If something happened to grandparents,

73
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.830
I'm counting and up to four I don't get suspicious,
go five,
six,
seven,
eight.

74
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.300
I will have to look into the family tree,
but you know,
look,

75
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:15.301
any reasonable excuse will be entertained and the relative importance given to

76
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:21.880
these different things is 20% for your homework,

77
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.460
30% for the midterm,
which will be sometime in October and 50% for the final.

78
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.630
That'll be the way that average,
but I have another

79
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.870
plan called the amnesty plan in which I also compared just your final grade,

80
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.490
what you're in the final exam and whichever is higher up the two is what I will

81
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:44.770
take to determine your overall course grade.

82
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.220
This is something I used to announce near the end,

83
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.780
but then some people felt that it's not fair not to know this from the
beginning.

84
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.780
So I'm telling you from the beginning,
but don't,

85
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.350
don't dream and think that somehow the final's going to be so much different

86
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:02.930
from your regular day to day performance.

87
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.720
But to give you some reason to live after the midterm.

88
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.580
So you feel like that is hope I can change everything overnight.
It does happen.

89
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.020
I put that in for a reason because sometimes some of you have not taken a

90
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:18.500
physics course and you don't know how to do well in physics and slowly you catch

91
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:21.500
on and by the time his final exam you crack the code,

92
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.800
you know how to do well as far as I'm concerned that it just fine if at the end

93
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:32.321
of the semester you take a three hour exam in a close environment than you

94
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:35.960
answered everything.
I don't care what you did in your homework or your midterm,

95
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.200
that's not relevant.
So that's how the grading will be done.

96
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.950
We have a virus group of TA's,

97
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.100
she is the head ta and she's the one you should write to whenever you have a

98
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:50.450
problem.
Then we also have,
uh,
two faculty members.

99
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.460
One is a postdoctoral fellow,
Mark Caprio mark.
Okay.

100
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.990
So he will have a discussion section on Tuesdays between one and two in Sloan

101
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:04.130
lab and uh,
Steve Fuller Neto.

102
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:07.940
I don't know if Steve is here or not.
They'll Steve,
our new assistant professor,

103
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:12.050
he will have a section on Tuesday night in Dunham Lab,

104
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.080
a room to 20 uh,

105
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.660
Tuesday night is the night when you people realize homework is due on Wednesday

106
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:18.650
so we know that.

107
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.540
So he will be there to comfort you and give you whatever help you need.

108
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.130
All right.
My own office hours.
I'm not determined yet.

109
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.460
I'll have to find out when it is.
Good for you.
I used to,

110
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.500
you know I live and work out of Sloan lab up on the hill and it was easy to have

111
00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:40.460
office hours before or after class,
but now you have to make a special trip.

112
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.410
So just give me a little bit of time to find out maybe by soliciting email

113
00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:49.280
responses from you.
What would be a good time for my office hours,

114
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.250
but for any procedural things like you know,

115
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:54.590
this problem set was not greater properly and so on.

116
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.520
There is no point emailing me because I'm going to send it to Myra anyway,

117
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.550
so directly deal with the powers that be

118
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.120
okay.
Finally,

119
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.750
I want to give you some tips on how to do well in this course and what attitude

120
00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:12.884
you should have.

121
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.210
First advice is you should come to the lectures.

122
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.520
It's not self serving,
it's not the

123
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.330
so much for my benefit.

124
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.590
I think there is something useful about hearing the subject presenter once

125
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.320
orally.
Secondly,

126
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.520
the book you can see one of you had a book here,
uh,

127
00:08:34.521 --> 00:08:39.521
in sport it's bought a 1100 pages and when I learned physics it was like 300

128
00:08:41.781 --> 00:08:44.480
pages.
Now I look around this room,

129
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.390
I don't see anybody who's head is three times bigger than mine.

130
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.810
So I know that you cannot digest everything the books have.

131
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:55.590
So I have to take out what I think is really essential part and cover that in

132
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:59.190
the lecture.
So you come to class to find out what's in and what's not.

133
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:01.860
Then if you don't do that,
it's a danger.

134
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:06.840
You will learn something you don't have to and we don't want that.
Okay,

135
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:09.930
so that's where you come to class.
Second thing,

136
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.250
most important thing for doing well in physics is to do the homework.

137
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.500
The 20% given to the homework is not a real measure of how important it is.

138
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.390
Homework is when you really figure out how much you know and don't know.

139
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.290
If you watch me do the thing on the blackboard,
it looks very reasonable.

140
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.310
It looks like you can do it,

141
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:33.450
but only way we're going to find out is when you actually deal with the problem.

142
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.610
That's the only time you're going to find out,

143
00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:39.780
so I asked you to do the problems as and when they're posted.

144
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.490
If you're posted on Wednesday is to cover the material for that week,

145
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.050
then you should attempted as quickly as possible because I'm going to assume

146
00:09:49.051 --> 00:09:49.381
you've done.

147
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:54.381
The problem is when you come for the next few lectures and in doing the

148
00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:58.470
homework,
it is perfectly okay to work in groups.

149
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:02.040
You don't have to do it for yourself.
That's not a physics has done.

150
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.600
I'm now writing a paper with two other people that are my experimental

151
00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:09.090
colleagues who write papers with 400 other people,

152
00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:12.750
maybe even a thousand other people when they do the big collider experiments in

153
00:10:12.751 --> 00:10:16.020
Geneva and Fermi lab collaborations can run into a hundreds,

154
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.920
so it's perfectly okay to be a part of it collaboration,

155
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.280
but you got to make sure that you're pulling your weight.

156
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.550
You got to make sure that if you explain to others how to do this problem,

157
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:31.200
then somebody else contributed something else.
But you know what?

158
00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:32.670
Everybody contributed in the end.

159
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.540
So the game is not just to somehow or other get the solution,
the problem set,

160
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:41.130
but to fully understand how it's done and the ts will be there to help you.

161
00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:45.270
That's every day that's going to be a ta in the undergraduate lounge.

162
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.550
I would urge you to use that.

163
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.360
That's a beautiful new lounge that the provost's office allowed us to build for

164
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.210
physicists and chemists,
whoever happens to be in the building.

165
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:57.060
If you go there on the third floor of Sloan,

166
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.940
you may run into other people like you.

167
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.120
We're trying to work on problems you may run into upper class students.

168
00:11:03.121 --> 00:11:05.430
Students are more advanced,
you run into your ta.

169
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.270
So that's a good climate that our coffee machines and that allowing sofas and

170
00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:13.170
everything else,
uh,
that are computers or printers.

171
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.400
So it's a good lounge.

172
00:11:14.401 --> 00:11:19.140
And I think if you go there one day a week to do your problem sets or more
often,

173
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.780
that's a good meeting place.
I recommend that.

174
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.460
Final piece of advice,
this is very important.

175
00:11:26.461 --> 00:11:29.520
So please pay attention to this,
which is,

176
00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:34.521
I asked you not to talk to your neighbors during lecture.

177
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.580
Now this looks like a very innocuous thing,
but you will find out.

178
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.240
It's the only thing that really gets my backup.
Most of the time.

179
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.790
I don't really care.
I'm very liberal,

180
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.460
but this disturbs me because I am looking at you.

181
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.020
I'm trying to see from your reaction how much of your,

182
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.470
of my lecture you're following.

183
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.840
And then it's very distracting when people are talking.

184
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.900
So please don't do that.
Uh,
if you talk,

185
00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:04.690
I'm going to assume you're talking about me.
If you laugh,

186
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:07.210
I'm going to assume you're laughing at me.
Let's make that.

187
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.860
That's not really what I think,

188
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:13.861
but that's how disturbing it is when people talk and very nice students who do

189
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:18.370
not realize this often disrupt my straight,
my line of thinking.

190
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:20.080
So I asked you to keep that to a minimum.

191
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.630
Once in a while you'll have to talk to your neighbor and say,

192
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:27.040
can you please pass me my pacemaker that fell down?
That's fine.

193
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:31.120
Then you go back to your business,
but don't,
don't do too much of that.

194
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.340
Finally that this is ancient issue about sleeping in the class.

195
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:41.830
Now my view is it's just fine.
Okay,
I know you guys need the rest.

196
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:47.080
And interestingly,
the best sleeper cell in the first couple of rows,

197
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:48.760
I haven't met you guys at person.

198
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:53.260
I have found some people really have to come to the first or second row because

199
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:56.110
they claimed that if they don't hear me,
they cannot really go to sleep.

200
00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.630
That was true in Sloan,

201
00:12:58.631 --> 00:13:02.860
but I think Lewis has got very good at acoustics so you can stretch out in the

202
00:13:02.861 --> 00:13:07.720
back.
But my only,
uh,
only criteria is if you talk in your sleep.

203
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:12.400
Now that's not a lot of talking us.
Next,
if you're going to sleep,

204
00:13:12.401 --> 00:13:17.020
I ask you to sit between two non slippers because sometimes what happens the

205
00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:21.130
whole row will topple over.
We don't want the domino effect.

206
00:13:21.131 --> 00:13:24.640
Now it's going to be a captured on tape and I'm just going to be really bad for

207
00:13:24.641 --> 00:13:25.900
my reputation.

208
00:13:25.901 --> 00:13:30.010
So spread yourself for yourself around the other people.

209
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:36.370
Alright,
so that's it.
In terms of class,
you know,
largest sticks and everything.

210
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.370
I'm going to start going into the physics proper.

211
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.520
I will try to finish everything on time,

212
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.370
but sometimes I move in the middle of a sentence or in the middle of the day

213
00:13:46.371 --> 00:13:48.910
innovation and they have to go over by a couple of minutes.

214
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.850
There was no need to shuffle your feet and move stuff around.

215
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.180
I know what time it is.
I also want to get out like you guys,

216
00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.780
but let me finish something.
Other days I may finish a few minutes before time.

217
00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:04.530
That's because the ideas of physics don't fall into a 75 minute segments and

218
00:14:05.321 --> 00:14:07.780
sometimes they spill over a little bit.
Also,

219
00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:11.710
I'm used to teaching this course three times a week and now it's suddenly twice

220
00:14:11.711 --> 00:14:12.544
a week.

221
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:17.350
And so things that fell into a nice 50 minutes units are now being snipped up

222
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.260
different ways.
So it's pretty difficult.
So even for me,

223
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:24.520
some of it will be new and the timing may not be just right.

224
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.130
Okay.
Anybody have any,

225
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.840
I should tell you first of all that in this class,

226
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.110
the taping is not going to affect you because the camera's going to be behind

227
00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:35.944
your head.

228
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.330
I mentioned to you in the website that this is not the big opportunity.

229
00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:45.280
You've been looking for a to be a star.
Uh,
only the back of it,
it'll be seen.

230
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.330
I've,
in some cases,
the back of the head could be more expressive than the front,

231
00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.150
in which case this is your opportunity to get,
I wish you luck,

232
00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:57.260
but otherwise just don't worry about it because you will be only heard,

233
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.350
you may not even be heard.
Uh,

234
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.480
so I've been asked that if a question is not very clear,

235
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:07.070
I should repeat it so that people listening to the later we'll know what the

236
00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:11.290
question was,
but I would ask you,
uh,

237
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.420
let me make one thing very clear that is I'm not in favor of you are talking to

238
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:21.470
each other because of distracting your stopping me anytime.
It's just fine.

239
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.850
All welcome that because I've seen the subject for gardeners how many years.

240
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.420
The only thing that makes it different from me is the questions that you people

241
00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:30.254
have.

242
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:35.440
So you can stop me anytime and you should not feel somehow you're stopping the

243
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.990
progress of the class.
That is no fixed syllabus.

244
00:15:38.991 --> 00:15:40.920
We can move things around and just part him.

245
00:15:40.921 --> 00:15:45.350
What exciting for me to answer your questions then to have a monologue.

246
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.050
So don't,
don't worry about that.

247
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.970
So stop me anytime you don't fall or something and don't assume that you're not

248
00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:57.140
falling something because there's something wrong with your level of

249
00:15:57.141 --> 00:15:57.771
comprehension.

250
00:15:57.771 --> 00:16:02.030
Quite often you guys come up with questions that never crossed my mind.

251
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:07.170
It's a very interesting and things we may repeat in year after year after year

252
00:16:07.311 --> 00:16:08.780
because they sound so reasonable,

253
00:16:08.781 --> 00:16:13.160
suddenly sound unreasonable when some of you point out some aspect of it that

254
00:16:13.161 --> 00:16:13.820
you didn't follow.

255
00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:18.820
So it could be very interesting for all of us to have issues discussed in class

256
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.510
and quite often some precedence are very common and your classmates will be

257
00:16:23.511 --> 00:16:27.470
grateful to you that you brought it up.
Otherwise,
do you know you get 10 tiers,

258
00:16:27.471 --> 00:16:31.760
get 10 emails all with the same question.
Okay.

259
00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:36.680
So I'm going to start now.
Okay.
Anybody have any uh,

260
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.600
questions about class?
The format,

261
00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:45.650
the midterm exams?
All right.

262
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:47.323
Yes.

263
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.030
<v 1>There's going to be two hours to be announced.</v>

264
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.840
<v 0>Oh,
you mean,
uh,
my office hours?</v>

265
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.473
<v 1>Nope.</v>

266
00:16:59.560 --> 00:16:59.741
<v 0>No,</v>

267
00:16:59.741 --> 00:17:04.741
the discussion sections are Tuesday afternoon from one to two and Tuesday night

268
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.470
from eight to 10.
And the,

269
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.130
the website has got all the details on when and where.
Yes.

270
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:18.020
Yeah.
That are many,
many lab times.
And uh,

271
00:17:18.021 --> 00:17:22.310
you have to go to the website for the lab.
And by the way,
that reminds me,

272
00:17:22.311 --> 00:17:26.750
I got here lots of flyers given to me by the director of the laboratories,

273
00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:31.550
which we'll tell you which lab is the right lab for you and they're offered many

274
00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:36.170
times a week.
Yes,
I'm as far as goes into material just from your class.

275
00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:38.810
How important is taking the lab and currently with this class?

276
00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.840
I think it's a good idea to take the lab because it,

277
00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:47.240
particularly in this particular class,
because I don't have any demonstrations,

278
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.320
they're all in the other building.

279
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.460
So this will remind you that physics is after all an experimental science and

280
00:17:53.461 --> 00:17:56.550
you will be able to see where all the laws of physics come from.

281
00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:01.350
So if you're going to take it,
you should take it at the same time.
Yes.

282
00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:05.790
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

283
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.530
<v 0>Ah,
very good.</v>

284
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:13.250
This is a calculus based class and expect everyone to know at least the

285
00:18:14.011 --> 00:18:19.000
rudiments of differential calculus.
What's the function,
what the data deliver,

286
00:18:19.001 --> 00:18:23.580
do what the secondary with the how to take derivatives,
elementary functions,

287
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:25.570
how to do elementary integrals.

288
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.930
Sometime later I will deal with functions are more than one variable,

289
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:35.960
which I will briefly introduce you because that is may not be prerequisite,

290
00:18:36.001 --> 00:18:39.660
but certainly something you will learn and you may use on and off.

291
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:41.551
But,
uh,

292
00:18:41.551 --> 00:18:46.551
there are different ways of doing physics minus to demonstrate over and over how

293
00:18:47.071 --> 00:18:49.440
little mathematics you need to get the job done.

294
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.280
There are others who like to show you how much mathematics you could somehow

295
00:18:53.281 --> 00:18:56.490
insinuate into the process.
Okay.

296
00:18:56.491 --> 00:19:01.200
There are different ways of playing the game and some of his find great pride in

297
00:19:01.201 --> 00:19:05.400
finding the most simple way to understand something that certainly my trademark,

298
00:19:05.401 --> 00:19:07.080
that's how I do my research also.

299
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:10.890
So if you feel there's not enough Matthews,

300
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.090
I guarantee you that I certainly know enough.
Uh,
eventually the snow,

301
00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:16.800
the whole class.
But that's another point.

302
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:21.830
I will use it in moderation and used it to use it to the best effect possible

303
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.660
rather than use it because it is there.
Okay.
So,

304
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.540
I don't know your mathematical background,

305
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.920
but the textbook has an appendix because reasonable measure of how much math you

306
00:19:34.921 --> 00:19:37.890
should know,
you got to know you or trigonometry,

307
00:19:37.891 --> 00:19:41.460
you got to know what's the sign and what's the cost sign.
Uh,
you cannot say,

308
00:19:41.461 --> 00:19:42.300
I will look it up.

309
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:47.990
Your birthday and social security number is what you look up trigonometry,

310
00:19:48.211 --> 00:19:52.920
functions,
you know,
all the time.
Okay.
I will assume you do.
All right.

311
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.990
And of course [inaudible] metric identities,

312
00:19:54.991 --> 00:19:57.540
you know from high school pages and pages of them.

313
00:19:57.541 --> 00:20:00.390
So no one expects you to know all those identities,

314
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.770
but there are a few popular ones we will use.
All right.
Uh,

315
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.690
anything else?
Yes,

316
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.880
<v 1>that's maybe a bit really.</v>

317
00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.810
<v 0>Yeah.
Midterm will be sometime around 20th of October.</v>

318
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.530
I have to find out exactly the right time.

319
00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:23.740
We have 24 lectures for this class and the first 12 roughly will be part of the

320
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.080
midterm.
But after the 12th lecture,

321
00:20:27.081 --> 00:20:30.740
I may wait a week so that you had time to do the problems and get the solutions.

322
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:34.310
Then I will give you the midterm.
Yes.

323
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:37.813
<v 1>Which one?</v>

324
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:42.890
<v 0>Yeah.
This tells you in detail this flyer answers exactly that.</v>

325
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:48.250
Okay.
There's one more question.
Somebody.
Yes.
I'm a few people I've talked

326
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.850
<v 1>to have recommended that will start taking the labs second semester instead of</v>

327
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:54.850
first.
Would that be advisable or should we take photos?

328
00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:02.400
<v 0>I don't have a strong view.
I think you should take the lab sometime but uh,</v>

329
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.460
I don't know how many semesters semesters of it you have to take.

330
00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.990
But I would say the advice of your predecessors is very important.

331
00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.150
It did tell you this is what works.

332
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.950
That's better than what somebody like me can tell you.
Honestly.

333
00:21:16.951 --> 00:21:19.800
You should talk to Steven Irons who is the director of the labs.

334
00:21:19.801 --> 00:21:22.980
He has seen every possible situation he would give you good advice.

335
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.250
<v 1>Let's stop now.</v>

336
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:28.873
<v 0>Okay,</v>

337
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.360
so we are going to be studying the beginning watch called Newtonian mechanics.

338
00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.860
It's pretty remarkable that the whole edifice was set up by just one person,

339
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:46.010
Newton and he set us on the road to understanding all the natural phenomena till

340
00:21:48.111 --> 00:21:53.111
the year 1800 and something when Maxwell invented the laws of electromagnetism

341
00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:58.910
and wrote down the famous Maxwell equation.
But except for electromagnetism,

342
00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.530
the basics of mechanics,

343
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:06.160
which is the moist enough billiard balls and trucks and marbles and whatnot was

344
00:22:06.521 --> 00:22:11.000
set up by Newton.
So that's what we're going to focus on.

345
00:22:11.001 --> 00:22:16.001
And you will find out that the laws of physics for this entire semester

346
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.260
certainly can get it done on one of those blackboards that even half of those

347
00:22:21.261 --> 00:22:22.094
blackboards.

348
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:27.970
And the purpose of this course is to show you over and over and over again that

349
00:22:28.051 --> 00:22:30.020
starting with those one or two laws,

350
00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:34.640
you can deduce everything and I would encourage you to think the same way.

351
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.900
In fact,
I would encourage you to think the way physicists do,

352
00:22:38.901 --> 00:22:40.730
even if you don't plan to be a physicist,

353
00:22:40.731 --> 00:22:44.990
because that's the easiest way to do the subject and that is to follow the

354
00:22:44.991 --> 00:22:47.360
reasoning behind everything I give you.

355
00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.430
And my purpose will be not to say something as a postulate,

356
00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:56.900
but to show you where everything comes from and is best for you if you try to

357
00:22:56.901 --> 00:23:00.530
follow the logic that way you don't have to store do many things in your head.

358
00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.710
In the early days when there were four or five formulas.

359
00:23:03.711 --> 00:23:07.220
You can memorize all of that and you can try it one of them until something

360
00:23:07.221 --> 00:23:07.581
works.

361
00:23:07.581 --> 00:23:10.370
But after a couple of weeks you will have a hundred formulas and you cannot

362
00:23:10.371 --> 00:23:12.950
remember is all of them.
You cannot resolve to trial and error.

363
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:15.880
So you have to know the logic,
the logical ways,

364
00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.830
not just the way the physicist do it.
It's the easier way to do it.

365
00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.800
If that is another way that you work for non physicists,

366
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.780
I won't hesitate to teach it to you that way.

367
00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.980
That turns out to be the best way to try to follow the logic of everything.

368
00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:35.050
Okay,
so Newtonian mechanics is that we're where's topic?

369
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.030
So Newtonian mechanics has two

370
00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:53.840
or all of physics can consists of two is a two part program plan.

371
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:58.310
Every time is to predict the future given the present.

372
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.510
That's what we always do.
When we do that right,
we are satisfied.

373
00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:07.370
The question is what do you mean by predict the future?

374
00:24:07.371 --> 00:24:11.810
What do you mean by the future?
What do you mean by the present?
By present,

375
00:24:11.811 --> 00:24:16.460
we mean we'll pick some part of the universe we want to study

376
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:22.990
and we will ask what information do I need to know about that system at the

377
00:24:23.721 --> 00:24:27.800
initial time,
like right now in order to be able to predict the future.

378
00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:34.010
So for example,
if you were trying to study the motion of some object,

379
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:36.290
okay,
here's one example here.

380
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.760
See that's an example of Newtonian mechanics.

381
00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.780
I'll give you one more demonstration.
Let's see,
we can get this one.

382
00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:46.460
That's a good example.

383
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:51.850
So that was Newtonian mechanics at work because what did I do is I released a

384
00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:58.540
piece of candy through it from my hand and the initial condition had to do with

385
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.600
where do they release it and with what?
Velocity.

386
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.240
That's what he sees with his eyes.

387
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.930
Then that's all you really need to know.

388
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:11.420
Then he knows it's going to go up,

389
00:25:11.421 --> 00:25:13.640
it's going to curve follow some kind of Parabola.

390
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:18.620
Then his hands go there to receive it.
That is verification of a prediction.

391
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.470
It's prediction was the candy's going to land here and he put his hand there.

392
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.480
He also knew where the candy is going to land,

393
00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:27.680
but he couldn't get his hand there in time.
But we can always make predictions.

394
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:30.080
But this is a good example of what you need to know.

395
00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.340
What is it he had to know about this object that was thrown?

396
00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:38.510
I claim is the initial location of the object,
the initial velocity,

397
00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:44.030
the fact that it was blue or red,
not relevant.
And if I threw a girl at him,

398
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:46.080
it doesn't matter.
Uh,

399
00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:49.030
you know what the color of the good realize what mode it is in.
Uh,

400
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:53.660
these are things we don't deal with in physics or if there is a tall building

401
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:56.570
standard physics problem and object falls off,

402
00:25:56.571 --> 00:26:01.490
a tall building object could be a person.
So we don't ask,

403
00:26:01.491 --> 00:26:04.850
why is this guy ending it all today?
That's not,

404
00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.110
we don't know.
And we cannot deal with that.
So we don't answer that everything.

405
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:12.050
We just want to know when it's going to hit the pavement

406
00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:18.710
and with what speed.
So we asked very limited questions,

407
00:26:18.711 --> 00:26:21.980
which is why we brag about how accurately we can predict the future.

408
00:26:21.981 --> 00:26:26.870
So we only ask limited goals and we already successful and satisfying them.

409
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.650
So we had basically dealing with inanimate objects.

410
00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:37.030
So the project of Newtonian mechanics or predicting the future given the present

411
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:43.450
has got two parts and I'll one is called kinematics and the other is called

412
00:26:44.521 --> 00:26:45.354
dynamics.

413
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.670
So kinematics is a complete description of the present.

414
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:55.290
It is the list of what you have to know about the system right now.

415
00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:00.030
But example,
if you're talking about the chocolate,
but throw the chalk,

416
00:27:00.031 --> 00:27:02.370
you will have to know where it is and how fast it's moving.

417
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.350
The dynamics doesn't dynamics then tells you

418
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.020
why the object goes up,
why the object goes down,
why is it pulled down and so on.

419
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:13.920
That's dynamics.

420
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.600
The reason it comes down as gravity's pulling it in Kinematics,

421
00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:22.070
you don't ask the reason behind anything.
You simply want to describe things,

422
00:27:22.071 --> 00:27:27.071
the where they are and then dynamics tells you how they change and why they

423
00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:28.014
changed.

424
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:34.760
So I'm going to illustrate the idea of kinematics by taking the simplest

425
00:27:35.761 --> 00:27:36.780
possible example.

426
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.170
That's going to be the way I'm going to do everything in this course.

427
00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:45.320
I'm going to start with the simplest example and slowly add on and wisdoms and

428
00:27:45.321 --> 00:27:46.740
make it more and more complicated.

429
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:49.223
<v 2>So</v>

430
00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.880
<v 0>some of you might say,
well I've seen this before,</v>

431
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:55.340
so maybe that is nothing new here that may well be,

432
00:27:55.341 --> 00:27:59.720
I don't know how much you've seen,
but quite often the way you learn physics,
uh,

433
00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:04.340
earlier on in high school is probably different from the way professional

434
00:28:04.341 --> 00:28:07.310
physicists think about it,
the sense of values we have.

435
00:28:07.311 --> 00:28:10.760
But things that we get excited about a different and the problems may be more

436
00:28:10.761 --> 00:28:11.594
difficult.

437
00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:16.310
But I want to start in every example in every situation that explained to you

438
00:28:16.311 --> 00:28:19.400
the simplest example and slowly add on things.

439
00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:25.420
So what we are going to study now is a non living object and we're going to pick

440
00:28:29.091 --> 00:28:30.770
it to be a mathematical point.

441
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:36.470
So the object is a mathematical point.
It has no size.
If you rotated,

442
00:28:36.471 --> 00:28:39.620
you won't know.
It's not like a potato take a potato,
you turn it around,

443
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:42.770
it looks different.
So it's not enough to say the potato is here,

444
00:28:42.771 --> 00:28:45.110
you got to see which way the nose is pointing and so on.

445
00:28:45.111 --> 00:28:46.310
So we don't want to deal with that.

446
00:28:46.311 --> 00:28:49.910
Now that comes later when we study what are called rigid bodies.

447
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:54.710
Right now we want to study an entity which has no spatial extent,

448
00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:59.480
so it just a doc and the doc can move around all over space.

449
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.550
So we're going to simplify that too.

450
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:06.950
We are going to take an entity that lives along the x axis.

451
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:13.090
It moves along the line so you can imagine a bead with the wire going through it

452
00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:18.050
and the beat can only slide back and forth.
So this is about the simplest thing.

453
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:21.680
I cannot reduce the number of dimensions.
One is the lowest dimension.

454
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:25.250
I cannot make the objects simpler than being just a mathematical point.

455
00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.350
Then you've got to say,

456
00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.490
what do I have to know about this object at the initial time?

457
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:36.640
What constitutes the present or what constitutes maximal information about the

458
00:29:36.651 --> 00:29:40.700
present?
But what we do is we pick an origin college zero.

459
00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:46.340
We put some markers there to measure distance and we say this guy is sitting at

460
00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:50.620
one two,
three,
four,

461
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:55.510
five is sitting at x equal to five.

462
00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:57.230
Now,

463
00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:01.090
of course we got have units and the units for lengths are going to be meters.

464
00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.690
The units for time will be second

465
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.310
at time,
will be measured in seconds.

466
00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.790
Then we'll come to other units right now in kinematics.
This is all you need.

467
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:20.500
Now there are some tricky problems in the book.

468
00:30:20.501 --> 00:30:24.130
Sometimes they give you the speed in miles per hour,
kilometers per year,

469
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.510
pounds per square foot,
whatever it is you gotta learn to transform them.

470
00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:32.470
That I won't do that.
I think that's pretty elementary stuff.
But uh,

471
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.980
sometimes I may not rate the units,
but I weren't the right to do that.

472
00:30:35.981 --> 00:30:39.310
And you guys haven't.
So you still have to keep track of your units.

473
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.830
Everything's gotta be in the right units.
If you don't have the units,

474
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:45.910
then if you say the answer is 19,
then we don't know what it means.

475
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:52.540
Okay,
so here's an object or a given instant.
It's got a location.

476
00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:57.520
So what we would like to do is to describe what the object does.

477
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.960
We're drawing a graph of time versus space.

478
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.120
And the graph could be something like this.

479
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:07.810
You got to learn how to read this graph.

480
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:09.910
I'm assuming everyone was how to read it.

481
00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:13.540
This doesn't mean the object is bobbing up and down.

482
00:31:13.541 --> 00:31:16.870
I hope you realize that even though the graph is going up and down,

483
00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:21.760
the object is moving from left to right.
So for example,

484
00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:27.220
when it does,
this is crossed the origin and is going to the left of the origin.

485
00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.920
Now which the left of the origin,
it turns around,

486
00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:34.990
they start coming to the origin and going to the right.
That is x versus t.

487
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:38.680
So the language of calculus x is a function of time

488
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:43.030
and this is a particular function.

489
00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:47.020
This function doesn't have a name are other functions which have a name.

490
00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.153
For example,

491
00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:53.110
this is x equals t x equal the t square.

492
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.160
You're can have x equal the scientists co-signed t and live.

493
00:31:56.161 --> 00:31:58.930
These are some functions have a named.
Some functions don't have a name.

494
00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:03.010
What a product will tries to do generally is some crazy thing which doesn't have

495
00:32:03.011 --> 00:32:05.150
a name,
but it's a function except tea.

496
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.030
So you should know when you look at a graph like this,
water is doing.

497
00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:15.850
So the two most elementary ideas you learn or what is the

498
00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:22.450
average velocity of an object
that's been ordered by the symbol,

499
00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:28.450
the bar.
So the average is found by taking two instance in time,

500
00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:33.300
say t one and later t two

501
00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:40.290
and you find out where it was a t to wellness where this was a t one and divide

502
00:32:43.041 --> 00:32:44.570
by the time.

503
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:51.650
So the average velocity may not tell you the whole story.
For example,

504
00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:56.690
if you started here and he did all this and you came back here,

505
00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:58.081
the cabinet to the lost,

506
00:32:58.081 --> 00:33:01.310
it would be zero because you start and end at the same value of x.

507
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:04.850
You get something zero divided by time,
it would still be zero.

508
00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.980
So you cannot tell from the average everything that happened because of the way

509
00:33:09.981 --> 00:33:14.010
to get the same zero is to just not move at all.
So the average is what it is.

510
00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:16.430
It's an average.
It does not give you enough detail.

511
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.520
So it's useful to have.

512
00:33:19.521 --> 00:33:24.521
The of philosophy is useful to have the average acceleration which you can find

513
00:33:25.011 --> 00:33:28.160
by taking a similar differences of velocities,

514
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:30.140
but before they even do that,

515
00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:35.620
I wanted to find for you an important concept which is the velocity at a given

516
00:33:36.741 --> 00:33:41.630
time.
So this is the central idea of calculus,

517
00:33:41.631 --> 00:33:44.000
right?
I'm hoping that if you learned your calculus,

518
00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.990
you learned about derivatives and so on by looking at experts as tea.

519
00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:51.710
So I will remind you again,

520
00:33:51.711 --> 00:33:54.920
this is an odd of course in calculus I don't have to do with any detail.

521
00:33:55.580 --> 00:34:00.580
I will dry the famous picture of some particle moving and it's here at time t at

522
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.930
some value of x
a little later,

523
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:11.530
which is time t plus Delta t the Delta t is going to stand always for a small

524
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.940
finite interval of time,
infinite decimal interval of time,
not yet zero.

525
00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:22.220
So during that time the particles gone from here to there.

526
00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:27.940
That is x plus delta x and the average velocity in that interval is delta x.

527
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.630
They waited with Delta t graphically.

528
00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:38.350
This guy is delta x and this guy is Delta t and Delta x over delta.

529
00:34:39.081 --> 00:34:39.914
T is the ratio.

530
00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:48.320
So in Calculus,
what do you want to do is to get the notion of the velocity.

531
00:34:48.321 --> 00:34:52.190
Right now we all have an intuitive notion of velocity.

532
00:34:52.191 --> 00:34:53.780
Right now when you're driving in your car,

533
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:58.310
that's the needle and the needle says 60.
That's the velocity at this incident.

534
00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:04.010
It's very interesting because the velocity seems to require two different times

535
00:35:04.011 --> 00:35:06.860
to define it.
The initial time in the final time.

536
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:11.300
And yet you want to talk about the velocity right now that is the whole triumph

537
00:35:11.301 --> 00:35:12.001
of countless.

538
00:35:12.001 --> 00:35:17.001
This know that by looking at the position now the position slightly later,

539
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:21.620
take the ratio and bringing later as close as possible.

540
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:26.180
Right now we define a quantity that we can say is the velocity at this incident.

541
00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:31.850
So VFT
is the limit.

542
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.380
Delta t goes to zero.

543
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:41.490
If a bell tags over Delta t and we use the symbol

544
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:45.090
dx dy,
deeper velocity.

545
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.030
So technically if you ask what is the velocity is stand for,

546
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:54.470
it stands for,
uh,

547
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:59.280
let me drop general situation.
If a particle goes from here to here,

548
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.440
Delta x over Delta t,
I don't know how well you can see it in this figure.

549
00:36:04.441 --> 00:36:09.060
Here is the slope of a straight line connecting these two points and as the

550
00:36:09.061 --> 00:36:13.320
points come closer and closer,
straight line will become tangent to the curve.

551
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:19.010
The velocity at any part of the curve is kinder to the curb at that point is

552
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:22.440
tangent of the data.
This angle is data.

553
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:26.850
Then delta x over Delta,
t by Technomic tree stand data.

554
00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:28.873
<v 2>Okay.</v>

555
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:32.510
<v 0>Okay.
Once you can take one day out of it too,</v>

556
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:37.040
you can take any number of elevators and the of of of the velocity

557
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:42.680
is called the acceleration and we write it as the second bit of it.

558
00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.710
The position position.

559
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:50.930
I'm hoping you guys are comfortable with the notion of taking one or two or a

560
00:36:50.931 --> 00:36:54.740
number of databases.
Interestingly,
the only,

561
00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.360
the first two directors have a name.

562
00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:59.960
First one is if I lost the second one is acceleration.

563
00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:05.200
The third data to unfortunately was never given a name and I don't know why.

564
00:37:06.861 --> 00:37:10.610
I think the main reason is that there are no equations that involve the third

565
00:37:10.611 --> 00:37:15.611
delivered to explicitly f equals m a the a is this fella here and nothing else

566
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:20.930
is given an independent name.
Of course you can take a function and did it take,

567
00:37:20.931 --> 00:37:22.910
did have it.
There's any number of times.

568
00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.590
So you're supposed to know.
But example,

569
00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.950
if x of t is due to the end,

570
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:36.670
you're supposed to know DXDT end to the t with n minus one.

571
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:42.680
Then he supposed to know I did of it is so simple functions like science and

572
00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.980
coastlines.
So if you don't know that,

573
00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:50.800
then of course you have to work harder than other people,
you know that uh,

574
00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.520
that may be enough for quite some time.

575
00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:56.791
Okay.

576
00:37:56.791 --> 00:38:01.791
So what I've said so far is a particle moving in time from point to point can be

577
00:38:04.201 --> 00:38:08.430
represented by a graph x versus t or any point on the graph.

578
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.750
You can take the date of it too,

579
00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:12.720
which will be tangent to the curve on each point.

580
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.100
And there's new medical value will be what you can call the instantaneous

581
00:38:17.101 --> 00:38:18.210
velocity at that point.

582
00:38:18.211 --> 00:38:21.780
And you can take the deliver to the derivative and call it the acceleration,

583
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:28.250
so we are going to specialize to a bitty limited class of problems in the rest

584
00:38:30.781 --> 00:38:31.614
of this class.

585
00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:36.850
The limit of class of problems is one in the acceleration

586
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:39.490
is just a constant,

587
00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:46.671
no,

588
00:38:46.671 --> 00:38:50.960
that is not the most general thing but I am sure you guys have some idea why we

589
00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:55.250
are interested in that so anybody know why that's such a big so much time is

590
00:38:55.251 --> 00:39:00.200
spent on that.
Yes.
Pardon me.
Right.

591
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:05.030
The most famous example is that when things fall near the surface of the earth,

592
00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:10.570
they all have the same acceleration and the acceleration that's most common is

593
00:39:11.691 --> 00:39:16.691
called g and this 9.8 meters per second square,

594
00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:23.180
so that's a very typical problem and you falling in the surface of the earth,

595
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.880
you are describing a problem,
constant acceleration.

596
00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:30.920
That's the way this is a lot of emphasis on sharpening your deep by doing this

597
00:39:30.921 --> 00:39:34.760
class of problems.
The question we are going to ask is the following.

598
00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:39.530
If I tell you that the particle is a constant acceleration,
a,

599
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:43.820
can you tell me what the position x is?

600
00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.173
<v 2>Okay.</v>

601
00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.890
<v 0>Normally I will give you a function and tell you to take any number of
databases.</v>

602
00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.160
That's very easy.
This is the backwards problem.
You,

603
00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:57.980
you're only given the particulates acceleration a and you want to ask to find

604
00:39:57.981 --> 00:40:01.940
out what is x.
In other words,

605
00:40:01.941 --> 00:40:06.941
your job is to guess a function secondary to his aid

606
00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:13.400
and this is called integration,

607
00:40:13.401 --> 00:40:17.270
which the opposite of differentiation and integration is just guessing.

608
00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:22.400
Integration is not an algorithmic process like different stations.

609
00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:24.930
If I give you a function,
you know how to take the date of it.

610
00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:28.340
It changed the independent variable,
find the change in the function,

611
00:40:28.341 --> 00:40:29.820
take the ratio and that's the bit of it.

612
00:40:29.821 --> 00:40:34.100
Then the opposite is being asked here I tell you something about the second bit

613
00:40:34.101 --> 00:40:36.830
of it to have a function and ask you what is the function.

614
00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:42.880
The way we do that is we guess and the guessing has been going on for 300 years.

615
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.450
So we sort of know how to guess.

616
00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:49.880
So let me think aloud and ask how I will guess in this problem.
I would say,
okay,

617
00:40:49.881 --> 00:40:54.350
this guy wants me to find a function which reduces to the number a,

618
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:59.320
when I take two databases,
and I don't sound bad here,
uh,

619
00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.810
this result we'd say is that when I take a derivative,

620
00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:07.490
I lose the power of t
in the end.

621
00:41:07.491 --> 00:41:10.460
I don't want any powers of tea very clear.

622
00:41:10.461 --> 00:41:14.000
I got to start with function that looks like t square.

623
00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.920
This weight.
When I take two derivatives,
there'll be no t left.

624
00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.730
But unfortunately we know this is not the right answer because if it take the

625
00:41:22.731 --> 00:41:26.000
first little bit of,
I get to t,
I take the second date of it too.

626
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:30.020
I get to what I wanted to get a and not to.

627
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:31.760
Then it's very clear.

628
00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:36.200
The way you find Pat's it up is you multiply it by this constant,

629
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:41.330
and I'll be at onset.
This function will have the right secondary of it.

630
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:46.790
So there's certainly describes a particle whose acceleration is a but a is not

631
00:41:46.851 --> 00:41:51.590
dependent on time.
But the question is,

632
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:56.220
is this the most general answer odyssey?

633
00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.510
Just one answer,
and I think you all know that this is not the most gender land,

634
00:42:00.511 --> 00:42:04.700
city.
There's one answer,
but I can add to this some number like 96

635
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:09.160
they'll still have the property that if you take two derivatives,

636
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:10.880
you're going to get the same acceleration,

637
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:15.500
so 96 now we said typical constants.

638
00:42:15.501 --> 00:42:18.650
I'm going to give the name,
see that constantly

639
00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:24.800
everyone was from calculus that if you'd it to find a function about which you

640
00:42:24.801 --> 00:42:25.790
know only the date of it have.

641
00:42:25.791 --> 00:42:30.380
You can always add a constant to one person answer without changing anything,

642
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:35.510
but I think he had,
you know,
you can do more,
right?

643
00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:40.340
You can add something else to the answer without invalidating it and that is

644
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:43.220
anything with one power of t in it

645
00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.120
because if you'd take one database,
it'll survive,

646
00:42:49.121 --> 00:42:52.390
but if you take two derivatives it it'll get wiped out.

647
00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:58.630
No,
it's not obvious,
but it is true that you cannot add to this anymore.

648
00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:05.410
Basic idea in solving these equations in integrating is you find one answer,

649
00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:06.890
so they'd been taken.

650
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.490
A bit of it is the function does what they're supposed to do,

651
00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:12.580
but then having phone one answer,
you can add to it.

652
00:43:12.581 --> 00:43:16.760
Anything that gets killed by the act of taking databases,

653
00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:19.630
you're taking only one database.
We can add a constant.

654
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.110
If you're taking to that evidence,
you can add a constant and something linear.

655
00:43:23.111 --> 00:43:26.290
In t if you knew only the third database of the function,

656
00:43:26.291 --> 00:43:28.900
you can have something quadratic and t without changing the outcome.

657
00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:32.410
So this is the most general

658
00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.670
position for a particle of constant acceleration.

659
00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:39.163
<v 2>Hey,</v>

660
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:43.560
<v 0>oh,
you must remember that this describes the particle going side to side.</v>

661
00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:48.420
I can also describe a particle going up and down.
If I do that,

662
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:51.270
I would s I would like to call that coordinate why.

663
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:53.160
Then I will write the same thing.

664
00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.870
You've got to realize that in Calculus,

665
00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:01.560
the symbols that you call x and y are completely arbitrary.

666
00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:05.640
If you know what the second database,
why I like to be a,

667
00:44:05.641 --> 00:44:07.020
then the answer looks like this.

668
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:10.170
If you knew the second [inaudible] the answer looks like that.

669
00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:16.600
No.
We have asked,
uh,
what are these numbers B and c.

670
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:21.490
So let me go back now to this expression,

671
00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:26.260
x of t equals [inaudible] squared over two

672
00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:31.710
plus c.
Let's beat t.

673
00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:33.873
<v 2>Okay?</v>

674
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:37.580
<v 0>It is true mathematically you can add two numbers,</v>

675
00:44:37.581 --> 00:44:38.540
but you've got to ask yourself,

676
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:42.080
what am I doing as a physicist when I add these two numbers,

677
00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:45.500
what am I supposed to do with a and B?
I mean with this BMC,

678
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:47.090
what balance should I pick?

679
00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:52.070
The answer is that simply knowing the particle has that acceleration.

680
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.270
It's not enough to tell you where the particle will be.
For example,

681
00:44:56.690 --> 00:45:00.110
let's take the case where the particle is falling under gravity.

682
00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:01.940
Then you guys know,

683
00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:06.970
you just told me acceleration is minus 9.8 but Geez,

684
00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:13.120
minus 9.8 we call it minus because it's accelerating down and upper stake and to

685
00:45:13.131 --> 00:45:16.490
be the positive direction in that case,
y of t

686
00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:22.130
will be minus one half Gd Square.
Let's see,

687
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:23.463
let's bt.

688
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:29.750
So the point is every object falling under gravity is given by the same formula.

689
00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:30.681
But there are many,

690
00:45:30.681 --> 00:45:35.540
many objects that can have many histories all falling under gravity and what's

691
00:45:35.541 --> 00:45:36.940
different from one object.

692
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:41.750
The other object is when was the drop from what height and with what initial

693
00:45:41.751 --> 00:45:42.584
speed

694
00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:46.940
that that's what these numbers are going to tell us and we can verify that as

695
00:45:46.941 --> 00:45:50.090
follows.
If you want to know what the number is,
c is you say,

696
00:45:50.091 --> 00:45:54.230
let's put time t equals to zero.
In fact,

697
00:45:54.231 --> 00:45:59.231
let me go back to this equation here for put time t equals zero x six zero it

698
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:03.980
doesn't have this term,
it doesn't have this term and it is c.

699
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:09.430
So I realized that the constancy is the initial location of the object and it's

700
00:46:10.071 --> 00:46:13.400
very common to denote that by x not.

701
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:16.400
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

702
00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.480
<v 0>so the meaning of the constant is where was the object of the initial time.</v>

703
00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:24.530
It could've been anywhere simply knowing the acceleration.

704
00:46:24.531 --> 00:46:26.480
It's not enough to tell you where it was.

705
00:46:26.481 --> 00:46:29.240
That initial time you get to pick where it was at the initial time.

706
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:32.780
Then to find the meaning of B.

707
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:38.230
We take one day too with this DXDT that's velocity as a function of time,

708
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:43.400
and if you took the derivative of this guy,
you'll find this 80 plus B.

709
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.440
That's the velocity of the object.

710
00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:53.160
Then you can then understand that the UB zero is what bees,

711
00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:56.410
which we write as vizio.

712
00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:05.800
Okay,
so the final answer is that x of t

713
00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:11.140
looks like X.
Nod plus B,
not the,

714
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:14.500
there's one half 80 square.

715
00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.193
<v 2>Okay.</v>

716
00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:21.091
<v 0>Okay,</v>

717
00:47:21.091 --> 00:47:26.091
so what I'm saying here is we are specializing to limited class of motion where

718
00:47:27.691 --> 00:47:29.770
the particle has a definite acceleration.

719
00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:34.800
A then in every situation where the body has an acceleration,

720
00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:35.620
a,

721
00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:40.620
the location has to have this form where this number is where it was initially.

722
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:43.120
This was the initial velocity of the object.

723
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:47.080
So when I threw that thing up and you caught it,

724
00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:52.450
what you were doing mentally was immediately figuring out where it started and

725
00:47:52.451 --> 00:47:53.284
at what speed.

726
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:59.530
That was your initial data then in your mind,
without realizing it,

727
00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:02.350
you found the trajectory at all.
Fuse at times?

728
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:05.743
<v 2>No.</v>

729
00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:10.860
<v 0>That is one other celebrate formula that goes with this.
I'm going to find that.</v>

730
00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:13.050
Then we will,
I'll give you an example.

731
00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:19.210
No,
I'm fully aware that,
uh,

732
00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:23.380
this is not the flashiest example in physics,

733
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:25.420
but I'm not worried about that right now.
You will have,

734
00:48:25.421 --> 00:48:27.400
you'll see enough things that will confound you.

735
00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:32.970
But right now I want to demonstrate a simple paradigm of what it means to nor

736
00:48:33.791 --> 00:48:37.720
the present and what it means to say this is what the future behavior will be.

737
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.610
And we want to do that in the simplest context.

738
00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:42.220
Then we can make the example more than more complicated,

739
00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:46.750
but the phenomenon will be the same.
So what we have found out so far,

740
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:48.343
uh,

741
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:53.710
I'm purposely going from x to y because I want you to know that the unknown

742
00:48:53.711 --> 00:48:57.670
variable can be called an exit can be called a y.
It doesn't matter

743
00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:04.150
as long as the second day debate of is it,
that's the answer.
No,

744
00:49:04.151 --> 00:49:06.280
that's the second Formula One.
Did I from this?

745
00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:11.270
You guys probably know that too from your days at the daycare,
but I wanted,

746
00:49:11.271 --> 00:49:14.970
did I have that formula?
And put it up.
Then we will see how to use them.

747
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:19.960
Second formula tries to relate the final velocity at some time.

748
00:49:19.961 --> 00:49:24.550
T two the initial velocity and the distance traveled with no difference at a

749
00:49:24.551 --> 00:49:25.384
time.

750
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:30.400
So the trick is to eliminate time from this equation.

751
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:32.500
So let's see how we can eliminate time.

752
00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:38.550
You know that if you took a deliver to with this will find the EFT is v zero

753
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:40.500
less AA fee.

754
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:48.130
What that means is if you know the the last year they've given time and you know

755
00:49:48.131 --> 00:49:50.590
the initial velocity,
you know what time it is,

756
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:54.270
the time in fact this v Minus v zero over day.

757
00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:56.830
If I don't show you any arguments for be,

758
00:49:56.831 --> 00:50:00.490
it means to be at time t and the subscript zero means we have zero.

759
00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:06.310
So what this says is you can measure time by having your own clock.

760
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:07.840
The clock tells you what time it is,

761
00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:11.890
but you can also say what time it is by seeing how fast the particle is moving.

762
00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:16.690
Because you know it started with some speed,
it gaining speed or some rate a.

763
00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:20.410
So if the speed was so and so now that the time had to be this,

764
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:23.980
the time can be indirectly inferred from these quantities.

765
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:29.390
Then you'd take that here and you put it here,

766
00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:32.300
able to see at time t you put this expression,

767
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:36.310
so what will you get will get an expression in which that is no,

768
00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.320
he has been banished in favor of this.

769
00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:41.930
I'm not going to waste your time by asking what happens if you put it there.

770
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:43.490
I will just tell you what happens.

771
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:48.850
What happens is you will find that we square is equal to v Zero Square plus two

772
00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:52.460
times x minus x zero.

773
00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.410
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

774
00:50:55.410 --> 00:50:57.540
<v 0>How many people have seen this thing before?</v>

775
00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:05.620
Okay,
that's a lot.
Look,
I know you've seen this
at the moment.

776
00:51:05.621 --> 00:51:10.621
I have to go through some of the more standard material before we go to the more

777
00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:13.660
nonstandard material.
If this part's very easy for you,

778
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:18.650
there's not much I can do right now,
so let me draw a box.

779
00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:23.140
Just drawing a box.
Do you guys means important?

780
00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.240
These are the two important things

781
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:32.390
I claim.
Now remember,
I want you to understand one thing.

782
00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:35.390
How much of this should you memorize supports?

783
00:51:35.391 --> 00:51:38.240
You've never seen this in high school?
How much are you supposed to memorize?

784
00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:43.190
I would say keep that to a minimum because what the first formula tells you,

785
00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.830
it should be so intuitive that you don't have to cram this.

786
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:48.650
We're talking about particles of constant acceleration.

787
00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:51.710
That means when I take two derivatives,
I want to get a,

788
00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:53.720
then you should know enough calculus.
You know,

789
00:51:53.721 --> 00:51:57.770
it has to be something like 80 square and a half comes from taking to

790
00:51:57.771 --> 00:52:02.330
derivatives.
The other two,
you know or stuff you can add and you know what,

791
00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:03.980
while you're adding those things,

792
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:08.590
because the particle has a headstart is going to get an initial position even at

793
00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:13.580
equal to zero and it has an initial velocity.
So even without any acceleration,

794
00:52:13.610 --> 00:52:17.300
it'll be moving from.
Why not two?
Why not?
Plus VT?

795
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:20.870
The acceleration gives you an extra stuff,
a quadratic and time.

796
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:26.900
Once you get God that one day that will give you the velocity than in a crunch.

797
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:29.180
You can eliminate tea and put it into this formula.

798
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:33.650
But most people end up memorizing these two because you use it so many times,

799
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:37.040
eventually sticks in you.
But you shouldn't try to memorize everything.

800
00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:42.940
So we are now going to do one standard problem where we will convince ourselves

801
00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:45.973
we can do,

802
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:50.210
we can apply these formulas and predict the future given the present.

803
00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:53.990
So the problem I want to do,

804
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:57.230
there are many things you could do but I just picked one.

805
00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.040
This is the one with the round numbers so I can do it without a calculator.

806
00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:04.130
So here's a problem that is this building

807
00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:08.330
and it's going to be 15 meters high

808
00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:14.390
and I'm going to throw something and it's going to go up and come down.

809
00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:19.910
But something I throw up as an initial speed of 10 meters per second.

810
00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:31.680
So we have to ask now,
now that my claim is,

811
00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:36.570
you can ask me any question you want about this party and I can answer.

812
00:53:36.571 --> 00:53:41.130
You can ask me where did it be nine seconds from now,

813
00:53:41.131 --> 00:53:45.000
eight seconds from now.
How fast will it be moving?
I can answer anything at all,

814
00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:50.940
but what I needed to do it to do this problem was to find these two unknowns.

815
00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:54.690
So you got to get used to the notion of what will be given in general and what

816
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:58.470
is tailor made to the occasion.
So we know in this example,

817
00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:04.100
the initial height should be 15 meters in the initial velocity should be 10 and

818
00:54:05.281 --> 00:54:09.630
for acceleration I'm going to use minus g and to keep life simple,

819
00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:13.440
I am going to call it minus 10 as you know,

820
00:54:13.441 --> 00:54:17.850
the correct answers 9.8 but we don't want to use the calculator now so we'll

821
00:54:17.851 --> 00:54:21.720
call it my understand.
Consequently for this object,

822
00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:27.530
the position why or any time t is known to be 15 plus 20 minus five t square,

823
00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:35.923
<v 2>okay?</v>

824
00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:41.790
<v 0>That is the full story of this object.
Of course,</v>

825
00:54:41.791 --> 00:54:45.300
you've got to be little careful when you use it.
Uh,
for example,

826
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:49.260
let's put t equal to 10,000 years.

827
00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:54.630
What are we going to get if a particular 10,000 years or 10,000 seconds you're

828
00:54:54.631 --> 00:54:59.631
going to find why is some huge negative number now set right there.

829
00:55:00.161 --> 00:55:02.490
What's wrong with that reasoning.

830
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:08.340
So you cannot use a formula once it hits the ground because once it hits the

831
00:55:08.341 --> 00:55:09.090
ground,

832
00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:14.090
the fundamental premise that a was a constant of minus 9.8 or minus 10 is wrong.

833
00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.610
So that's another thing to remember.
Once you get a formula,

834
00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:21.720
you got to always remember the terms under which the formula was derived.

835
00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:26.130
If you blindly use it beyond the validated you will get results with.

836
00:55:26.131 --> 00:55:28.080
Don't make any sense.
Conversely,

837
00:55:28.081 --> 00:55:30.420
if you get an answer and it doesn't seem to make sense,

838
00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:35.130
then you got to go back and ask,
am I violating some of the assumptions?

839
00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:38.730
And here you will find the assumption that the particle have that acceleration

840
00:55:38.731 --> 00:55:42.690
is true as long as it's freely falling under gravity but not when you hit the

841
00:55:42.691 --> 00:55:45.750
ground.
My,
if you dug a hole here

842
00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:52.890
till there,
then of course it may work til that happens.
Okay,
but you have,

843
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:56.940
you got an every time when you,
this is so obvious in this problem,

844
00:55:56.941 --> 00:55:59.010
but when you see more complicated formula,

845
00:55:59.011 --> 00:56:03.240
you may not know all the assumptions that went into derivation and quite often

846
00:56:03.241 --> 00:56:08.241
you'll be using it when you shouldn't or exceed this you agree is a complete

847
00:56:08.461 --> 00:56:11.730
solution to this miniature tiny Mickey mouse problem.

848
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:16.530
You to give me the time and I'll tell you where it is if you want and how fast

849
00:56:16.531 --> 00:56:19.740
it's moving at a given time.
If you want another philosophy,

850
00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:22.470
I just take the deliver to of this answer,

851
00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.360
which just 10 minus 10 t

852
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:28.440
<v 2>yeah,</v>

853
00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:31.650
<v 0>so let me pick a couple of trivial questions.
One,
can I ask,</v>

854
00:56:32.010 --> 00:56:35.370
one can ask the following question,
how high does it go?

855
00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.420
How high will it rise?

856
00:56:39.421 --> 00:56:43.650
To what height will it rise so we know it's going to go up and turn it around

857
00:56:43.651 --> 00:56:47.280
and come down.
We're trying to see how high that is.

858
00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:54.810
So that is a tricky problem to begin with because if you take this formula here,

859
00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:01.180
it tells you why if you not tea.
But now we are not saying that.

860
00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:05.440
We don't know at the time
and we don't know how high it's rising,

861
00:57:05.441 --> 00:57:07.810
so you're can ask,
how am I supposed to deal with this problem?

862
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:10.960
Then you put something else that you know in your mind,

863
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:13.990
which is that the highest point is the point.

864
00:57:13.991 --> 00:57:17.380
When is neither going up nor coming down.
If it's going up,

865
00:57:17.381 --> 00:57:21.190
that's not the highest point.
There's coming down.
That's not the highest point,

866
00:57:21.191 --> 00:57:24.010
so at the highest point it cannot go up and it cannot go down.

867
00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:28.450
That's the point where velocity is zero.
If you do that,

868
00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.330
let's call the particular time please star.

869
00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:36.840
Then 10 t star minus 10 is equal to zero.

870
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:39.130
Our t start is one second,

871
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:44.560
so we know that it'll go up for one second.

872
00:57:44.561 --> 00:57:45.970
Then it'll turn it around and come back.

873
00:57:46.890 --> 00:57:49.930
Now we had duck because now you can ask how high does it go?

874
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:55.830
Then you go back to your why of one and way of one is 15 plus 10 minus five

875
00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:05.290
which is what?
20 meters.
By the way,

876
00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:09.370
you will find that I make quite a lot of mistakes on the blackboard.

877
00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:11.380
You're going to find out,

878
00:58:11.381 --> 00:58:15.190
you know one of these years when you start teaching that when you get really

879
00:58:15.191 --> 00:58:17.800
close to blackboard or you just cannot think,

880
00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:22.690
that's definitely an inverse correlation between your level of thinking and

881
00:58:22.691 --> 00:58:26.740
approximately to the blackboard.
So if you find me making mistake,

882
00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:31.150
you got to stop it.
Why do you stop me for two reasons.
First of all,

883
00:58:31.310 --> 00:58:35.770
I am very pleased when this happens because I'm pretty confident that I can do

884
00:58:35.771 --> 00:58:38.500
this under duress,
but I may not do it right every time,

885
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:41.320
but if my students can catch me making mistake,

886
00:58:41.321 --> 00:58:45.670
it means they are following it and they're not hesitating to tell me.
Secondly,

887
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.490
as we go into the more advanced part of the course,

888
00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:51.130
we'll take a result from this part of the blackboard,

889
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:53.530
stick it into the second part and keep manipulating.

890
00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:56.410
If I screwed up in the beginning and you guys keep quiet,

891
00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:59.870
we'll have to do the whole thing again.
I would,

892
00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:02.680
I would ask you when you follow this thing,

893
00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:07.600
do it actively try to be one step ahead of me.
For example,

894
00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:11.740
if I'm stuck by lightening,
can you do anything?

895
00:59:11.770 --> 00:59:15.790
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
You have any idea where this is going?

896
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:20.730
You shouldn't have a clue.
If I die and you stop,
that's not a good sign.
Okay?

897
00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:24.140
You got to keep going a little further because you should follow the logic.

898
00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:29.570
So for example,
you know I'm going to calculate next when it hits the ground,

899
00:59:29.571 --> 00:59:33.950
you should have some idea how I'll do it because this is not a spectator sport.

900
00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:36.590
If you just watch me,
you're going to learn nothing.

901
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:40.250
It's like watching the US Open and thinking you are some kind of player you will

902
00:59:40.251 --> 00:59:40.760
have to do,

903
00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:44.120
you will have to shed the tears and you got to bang your head on the wall and go

904
00:59:44.121 --> 00:59:46.820
through your own private struggle.
I cannot do that for you.

905
00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:50.930
I cannot even make it look hard because I've memorized this problem from

906
00:59:50.931 --> 00:59:54.110
childhood.
So there is no way I can make this look difficult.
Okay,

907
00:59:54.111 --> 00:59:56.750
that's your job.
All right,

908
00:59:56.751 --> 01:00:01.700
so we know this point at one second is 20 meters.

909
01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:03.980
So let's just ask one other question.
We'll start.

910
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:08.450
One other question may be when does it hit the ground and at what speed?

911
01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:13.910
At typical physics question.
So when does it hit the ground?
Well,

912
01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:19.190
I think,
uh,
you must know now how to formulate that question.

913
01:00:19.550 --> 01:00:24.500
When does it hit the ground is when is y equals zero.
By the way,

914
01:00:24.501 --> 01:00:28.760
I didn't tell you this but I think you knew that I pick my origin to be here and

915
01:00:28.761 --> 01:00:33.080
measured why positively to be upwards.

916
01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:36.350
And I call that 15 meters.
You can call that your origin.

917
01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:40.700
If you call that your origin,
your y zero will be zero,

918
01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:45.860
but ground will be called minus 15.
So in the end the physics is the same,

919
01:00:45.861 --> 01:00:47.750
but the numbers describing it can be different,

920
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:52.040
but you have to interpret the data differently.
But the standard,
uh,

921
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:54.590
origin for everybody is the foot of the building.

922
01:00:56.180 --> 01:01:00.170
You can pick your origin here,
some crazy spot,
it doesn't matter,

923
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:04.850
but some origins are more equal than others because there are some natural

924
01:01:04.851 --> 01:01:08.390
landmark they're here for,
to the building is what I call the origin.

925
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:10.790
So in that notation,

926
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:14.300
I want to ask when is y equal to zero

927
01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:17.690
for ask when y is equal to zero.

928
01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:23.050
Then I say zero is 15 plus 20 minus five t square or I canceling the five

929
01:01:26.301 --> 01:01:29.420
everywhere and changing the sign here I get teased.

930
01:01:29.421 --> 01:01:34.421
Square minus two t minus three equals zero that's when it hits ground.

931
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:44.030
So let's find out what the time is.
So t is then

932
01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:51.040
two plus or minus four plus 12 over two which is two plus or minus four over two

933
01:01:56.990 --> 01:02:00.290
which is minus one or three.

934
01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:06.380
Okay,
so you get two answers when it hits the ground.

935
01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:11.180
So it's clear that we should pick three,

936
01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.260
but you can ask why is it giving me a second solution?

937
01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:22.830
Anybody have an idea why it's yes.

938
01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:27.090
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

939
01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:33.970
<v 0>that's correct.
So to answer was if we'd had,</v>

940
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.410
if it was a full of Parabola,

941
01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:40.890
then we know it would have been at the ground before I set my clock to zeroes.

942
01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.960
First of all,
negative time should not bother anybody.

943
01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.110
T equals zero is when I set the clock a measured time forward.

944
01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:50.140
But yesterday would be t equal to minus one day.
Right?

945
01:02:50.141 --> 01:02:52.420
So we don't have any trouble with negative times.

946
01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:55.750
So the point is this equation,

947
01:02:58.030 --> 01:02:59.350
that's not,
no,
I bought the building,

948
01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:03.550
doesn't know the whole song and dance that you went to a building and he threw

949
01:03:03.551 --> 01:03:06.970
up a rocket,
knows nothing.
What does the mathematics,
no,

950
01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:12.930
it knows that this particle happened to have a height of 15 at time zero and a

951
01:03:14.321 --> 01:03:18.460
velocity of 10 at times zero and it is falling under gravity with an

952
01:03:18.461 --> 01:03:20.710
acceleration of minus 10 that's all it knows.

953
01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:25.570
If that solid noise then in that scenario,

954
01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:27.880
if that is no building at anything else,

955
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.570
it continues a trajectory both forward and time and backward in time.

956
01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:35.380
And it says that um,
whatever seconds,

957
01:03:35.890 --> 01:03:39.310
one second before you set your clock to zero,
it would have been in the ground.

958
01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:45.720
What it means is if you release the rock at that location one second before with

959
01:03:46.301 --> 01:03:47.980
a certain speed that we can calculate,

960
01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:52.630
it would have ended up here with precisely the position and velocity had had at

961
01:03:52.631 --> 01:03:53.710
the beginning of I would expect.

962
01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:59.940
So sometimes the extra solution is very interesting and you should always listen

963
01:04:00.821 --> 01:04:05.240
to the mathematics when you get extra solutions.
In fact,

964
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:10.210
when a very famous physicist called Dirac was looking for the energy of a

965
01:04:10.211 --> 01:04:13.210
particle in relativistic quantum mechanics,

966
01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:17.050
he found the energy of a product is connected.
There's momentum.

967
01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:21.550
This P is what we call momentum and it's mass.
Bye.

968
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.400
This is relation.
It's a particular mass m and momentum p has this energy.

969
01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:32.850
So you saw it for the energy,
you get two answers.

970
01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:34.373
<v 1>Okay?</v>

971
01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:37.541
<v 0>Oh,</v>

972
01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:41.020
your temptation is to keep the first answer because you know energy is not going

973
01:04:41.021 --> 01:04:44.920
to be negative particles moving.
It's got some energy and that's it.

974
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:47.680
But the mathematicians stall Dereck,

975
01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:51.790
you cannot ignore the negative energy solution because it tells you there's a

976
01:04:51.791 --> 01:04:55.780
second solution and you cannot throw them out and it turns out the second

977
01:04:55.781 --> 01:05:00.760
solution with negative energy was when the theory is telling you,
hey,

978
01:05:00.761 --> 01:05:04.900
that are particles in their antibiotics and the negative energy you've been

979
01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:07.620
properly interpreted.
We'll describe antibiotics.

980
01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:10.210
So the equations are very smart.

981
01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:14.890
The way the physics works is you find some loss of motion in mathematical form.

982
01:05:14.891 --> 01:05:16.540
You put it in the initial conditions or whatever.

983
01:05:16.541 --> 01:05:20.020
You solve the equations and the answer that comes,
you have no choice.

984
01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:21.370
You have to accept the answer.

985
01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.310
Is that our new answers besides the one you were looking for,

986
01:05:24.311 --> 01:05:27.700
you got to think about what they mean and that's one of the best things of what

987
01:05:27.701 --> 01:05:31.450
physics because he us a person was not looking for antibiotics.

988
01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.730
You guys trying to describe,
I like France,

989
01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.110
but the theory said there are two routes in the quadratic equation and the

990
01:05:38.111 --> 01:05:40.810
second route is mathematically as interesting as the first one.

991
01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:45.010
It has to be part of the theory and then trying to adjust it so it can be

992
01:05:45.011 --> 01:05:47.600
incorporated.
You discovered antibiotics.

993
01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:52.420
So always amazing to us how we go into the problem.

994
01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:55.750
I would,
I,
our mind can see one class of solutions,

995
01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:58.960
but the math will tell you sometimes there are new solutions and you got

996
01:05:58.961 --> 01:06:02.560
respected and understand and interpret the unwanted solutions.

997
01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:07.210
And this is a simple example where you can follow what the meaning of the second

998
01:06:07.211 --> 01:06:08.044
solution.
Yes.

999
01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:13.120
It means that to the problem you post that is more than the answers that you

1000
01:06:13.121 --> 01:06:13.954
could imagine.

1001
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:18.700
He hit it meant article that was released from the ground earlier that it meant

1002
01:06:18.701 --> 01:06:23.350
something much more interesting.
Namely antiparticles accompanying particles.

1003
01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:25.120
They are going to accompany particle.

1004
01:06:25.121 --> 01:06:29.020
Surely as it is quadratic equation is two solutions.

1005
01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:31.330
All right,

1006
01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:36.600
so now in this problem they can do something slightly different and that's used

1007
01:06:38.021 --> 01:06:42.160
this expression here and I will do that.
Then I'll stop for today.

1008
01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:47.680
If you were asking questions like how high does it go,

1009
01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:50.980
but you don't ask,
when does it go to the highest point?

1010
01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:55.600
Then you don't have to go through the whole process of finding the time at which

1011
01:06:55.601 --> 01:06:58.420
it turned around.
I don't know where that is that disappear in the blackboard.

1012
01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:01.840
Then putting the time equal to one second into this formula.

1013
01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:05.920
If the question of time is not explicitly brought up,

1014
01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.650
then you should know that you have to use this formula.

1015
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:12.670
So how do we get it here?
Well,

1016
01:07:12.671 --> 01:07:17.671
we say at the top of the loop when it goes up and comes down,

1017
01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:21.670
the velocity is zero.
Therefore you say zero square

1018
01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:28.380
equals initial velocity squared plus two flames minus G.

1019
01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.810
That's my acceleration times.

1020
01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.600
Y minus Y is zero.

1021
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:37.420
If you solve for that,

1022
01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:42.450
you find y minus y Zero Equals v Zero Square over to g and if you put in The v

1023
01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:49.630
Zero I gave you which was what a pen,

1024
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:55.510
there's hundred over 20 which is five meters,

1025
01:07:56.890 --> 01:08:01.890
so y equals y is zero plus five meters and that is the height to weight that

1026
01:08:02.951 --> 01:08:04.840
rises.
I think we got it somewhere else.

1027
01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:08.560
We phoned the maximum height to be 20 meters.

1028
01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:14.930
Another thing you can do is you can find the speed.

1029
01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.500
If you want to find the speed there,

1030
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:23.890
you put the Equation v Square Equals v Zero Square plus two times minus g.

1031
01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:31.480
What does y minus y zero the final why is zero the initial y is minus is 15 you

1032
01:08:33.081 --> 01:08:36.770
solve for that equation.
Then you will find the final velocity.

1033
01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:41.180
So if time is not involved you can do it that way.

1034
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:45.290
I wanted did I the last result in another way,

1035
01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:50.650
then I will stop and that's pretty interesting because it tells you a use and

1036
01:08:51.081 --> 01:08:52.250
abuse of calculus.

1037
01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:58.420
I'm going to find for you this result using calculus in a different way.

1038
01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:05.680
So from the calculus we know DVD t is equal to a

1039
01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:10.850
multiply both sides by V.
Okay.

1040
01:09:15.370 --> 01:09:15.641
No,

1041
01:09:15.641 --> 01:09:20.641
you have to know from Elementary Calculus that v Times Dvdt is really d by Dt of

1042
01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:27.350
the square over two.
No,

1043
01:09:27.351 --> 01:09:31.670
I hope you guys know that much calculus that when you take a derivative of the

1044
01:09:31.671 --> 01:09:32.840
function of a function,

1045
01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:37.520
namely v squared over two is a function of v And v itself as a function of tea

1046
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:41.540
than the rule for taking the derivative is first take the v Derivative,

1047
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:45.320
this object.
Then take the d by Dt of the,
which is this one,

1048
01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:51.560
the right hand side.
I'm going to write us a Dxdt.

1049
01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:54.740
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1050
01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:59.650
<v 0>this much as standard,
but no.
Here's what I'm,
yeah,</v>

1051
01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:02.840
I'm going to do something with somehow we are told never ever to do,

1052
01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:05.540
which is to just cancel the

1053
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.863
<v 2>dts.</v>

1054
01:10:09.850 --> 01:10:13.030
<v 0>You all know that when you do the white Dx,</v>

1055
01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:17.230
you're not supposed to cancel that d that's actually correct.
Okay.

1056
01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:18.970
You don't want to cancel the d and the date of it too,

1057
01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:23.290
but this happens to be completely legitimate so I'm going to assume it's true

1058
01:10:23.291 --> 01:10:25.570
and I'll maybe take a second to explain why he's related to me.

1059
01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.290
What this really means is in a given time,

1060
01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:32.990
Delta t the change in this quantity is eight time.

1061
01:10:32.991 --> 01:10:37.810
The change in this quantity that for you can multiply both sides by the Delta t

1062
01:10:37.811 --> 01:10:42.400
but the only thing you should understand this delta t as long as they're small

1063
01:10:42.401 --> 01:10:47.320
and finite will lead to some small and finite editors in the formula because the

1064
01:10:47.321 --> 01:10:51.040
formula is really the limit in with Delta x and Delta t both go to zero.

1065
01:10:51.850 --> 01:10:55.690
So what do you have to do is multiply both sides by Delta t but remember it's

1066
01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:57.880
got to be in the end made vanishingly small.

1067
01:10:59.170 --> 01:11:02.500
As long as we understand that we can do this cancellation.

1068
01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.270
And this says on the left hand side,

1069
01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:08.310
the change in the Quantity v squared over two is the change a time.

1070
01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:13.320
The change in the quantity x.
So add up all the changes are,

1071
01:11:13.321 --> 01:11:16.770
what do you mean by integral?
Same thing.
Add up all the changes.

1072
01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:22.440
The change in v squared over two will be the final v squared over two minus the

1073
01:11:22.441 --> 01:11:27.441
initial v squared over to the other side will be eight times the change in x.

1074
01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:30.203
X minus x not.

1075
01:11:31.210 --> 01:11:31.510
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1076
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:33.070
<v 0>and that's the formula I wrote for you.</v>

1077
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:37.640
This wade is Vz to squared plus two x minus X.
Now,

1078
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:46.390
so the point is whenever you have directives with something over Dt,

1079
01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:51.650
do not hesitate to cancel the dts and think of them as a Delta v squared over

1080
01:11:53.181 --> 01:11:56.290
two is equal to eight times delta x.

1081
01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:01.790
This will be actually true as long as both quantities are vanishingly small,

1082
01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:03.560
they will become more and more true.

1083
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:07.460
As delta x and Delta p squared become vanishingly small in the limit and we're

1084
01:12:07.461 --> 01:12:10.640
still approaching zero,
the two will be in fact equal.

1085
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:13.850
You've dealt by acts as a finite.
I'm only like one second.

1086
01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:17.630
This will not be true because in the starting equation,

1087
01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:21.650
Delta x and Delta t and Delta v Square or all assumed to be infinitesimal.

1088
01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:23.280
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1089
01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:27.540
<v 0>so don't hesitate to do manipulations of this type and I will do them quite</v>

1090
01:12:27.541 --> 01:12:31.560
often.
So you got to understand when it's okay and when it's not.
Okay.

1091
01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:32.950
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1092
01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:37.950
<v 0>What this means is in a time Delta t this wanted to changes by some amount and</v>

1093
01:12:38.681 --> 01:12:42.670
the same time Delta t that wanted changes by some amount than keeping the delta

1094
01:12:42.671 --> 01:12:43.780
t equal to some number.

1095
01:12:43.810 --> 01:12:47.980
We may equate the changes in the two quantities provided it is understood.

1096
01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:53.400
The Delta v Square over two is a change in v squared over two in the same time

1097
01:12:53.471 --> 01:12:55.810
in which the particle moved a distance delta x.

1098
01:12:55.990 --> 01:13:00.490
Then by adding the differences we eliminate time and we get this final result.

1099
01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:05.350
All right,
so if you go onto your website today,

1100
01:13:05.351 --> 01:13:09.970
you will find I have assigned some problems and you should try to do them.

1101
01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:11.590
They applied to this chapter.

1102
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:17.550
Then next week we'll do more complicated problems that involve motion and higher

1103
01:13:17.771 --> 01:13:20.070
dimension.
How to go to two dimensions of vitamins.
