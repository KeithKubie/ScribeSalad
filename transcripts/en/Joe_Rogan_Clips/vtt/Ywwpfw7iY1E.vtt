WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.930
It's three hours ago.
Oh,
Jay McGraw or your,
uh,
your boyfriend is a,

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.780
I love him.

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.430
<v 1>I had his daddy on the show and now he's calling me.</v>

4
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:12.260
Now he's dropping science and his Daddy,

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.640
his dad's a fucking genius.
Doctor Phil.
Yup.
Yeah.
Great Guy.

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.960
Like people who don't know,
Dr Phil,
he's a fucking great guy.

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.360
<v 0>You know,
it,
it's uh,
he,</v>

8
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.670
he sent me a text the other day and he goes,
I've got this Id,

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.240
you're going to things crazy.
And uh,
so we,

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.050
we made it the Beverly Hills Hotel and,
uh,

11
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:42.051
and I play a lot of golf with doc and I know him well and I have for 10 years or

12
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:46.980
whatever,
who's duck duck?
Phil.
Oh,
and yeah.

13
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.280
<v 1>Do you remember who we're talking about?
He said,
doc,
I never called him doc.</v>

14
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:52.440
Call Him Phil.
Oh,
I thought I call him doc.

15
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.710
Jay's daddy can check them out and play.
That's what I say.

16
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.540
<v 0>So he goes,
all right,
here's what we should do.</v>

17
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.080
We should do a two man show.
And,
uh,
and uh,

18
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.400
and I know he's out of production and I know he's bored and he's also hurt.

19
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.920
So he's had that motorcycle wreck and you know,
get new shoulder surgery.
Right.

20
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.340
So he's like,
he really can't play golf.
No,
he's just bored.

21
00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:22.820
And so it,
so it really,
and,
and,

22
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.510
and I would do anything doctor Phil wanted to do,
you know,

23
00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:29.510
cause I love spending time with him and uh,

24
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.410
and the ad or any thing he does is a big success anyway.
So I would do it,

25
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.600
but he really is,
he here was his idea.
It's a,
it's a,

26
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.580
it's a two man show on Broadway.
Right.

27
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.380
And they goes,
and then,
you know,

28
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.130
I'm not sure how it starts and I'm like,
okay,

29
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.280
it would probably start with the curtain opens and you and I are standing there

30
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.240
because it's a two man show on Broadway.
That's probably how it starts.

31
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.730
And it goes in.
Then we can do a Q and a and I'm like,

32
00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:05.270
now we'd have to do something before the Q and a doc.
Right.

33
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:08.210
Because when we've done that before and it's hilarious.
Right.

34
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:11.110
Or just as close as we are,
I mean,

35
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.100
where we're born and our circumstances in life and,

36
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:18.490
uh,
and,
and,
and,

37
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.500
and he's completely under missionally fuck fucking beyond me as far as any kind

38
00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:26.600
of success than anybody's ever had.

39
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.820
But it wa but we both came from nothing in the same part of the world.

40
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.960
And so we have this connection that people have a hard time understanding,

41
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.710
you know,
that can't believe you and doctor Phil or they literally,

42
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.520
we tell people we love each other.
And that's,
I mean,
and,
and,

43
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.430
and to give you a good example of that,

44
00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:49.460
he took me down when we flew in his Gulf stream to the Cayman Islands.

45
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.910
And I didn't even have a certificate or anything,
but I'd had one.

46
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:53.790
It was just expired.

47
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.580
And so we went on this dive and he watched me,

48
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.150
like I was four years old the whole time we were underwater and a,

49
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.330
if I got close to sub that I shouldn't touch.
You know,
he's like,

50
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.320
so,
so I know he loves me,
right?
I know he loves me and,
and uh,

51
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.180
and so,
but they're way really didn't have an idea,

52
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:21.400
but I just knew that I knew that he was,

53
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.750
that he was born anywhere to have lunch and talk about something that I'm like,

54
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:28.370
let's talk about it.
I cause I would do anything.
I mean,

55
00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:32.190
I would love to figure out something to do with him.
That makes sense because we,

56
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.090
because we come off really fun together in,
uh,
in,
in,
in,
uh,

57
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.170
in a juxtaposition situation.
Right.
And,
uh,

58
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.560
our views,
even though we cover several background,

59
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:47.880
how different the views are in some ways and several,
and they are in some ways,

60
00:03:47.881 --> 00:03:52.450
so it's fun stuff.
We should do your podcast together.
I mean,
love it.
Yeah,

61
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.440
it does dot guy.
Yeah,
he just did it.
He just did it like a tutor.

62
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.520
Yeah,
I knew that.
I knew that.
He told me

63
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.270
now he's exceptional.
Love that guy.

64
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.110
He's fucking easy going guy to really having to be around.
Right.
You know,

65
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.080
like comfortable in his own skin.
You know,

66
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:14.170
it was a reason why he's so successful.
It's not like anybody could do that.

67
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:17.730
Like looking at that Doctor Oz guy talked to Ross guy.
I just,

68
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.630
I'm watching him and I was like,
ah,
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know doc.

69
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.461
Well,
you know,
he,

70
00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:28.461
he does three w unscripted hours a day all day and he does a podcast now and

71
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.670
that did his podcast because also during that lunch he said also,

72
00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:39.450
I have a podcast and I'm going to start it up and uh,
and I'm gonna,

73
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.050
I'm gonna do a few people before I do.

74
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:43.720
You just get used to it and then I have you come on.
I'm like,

75
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.970
well for sure I'll do that.
How funny is that?

76
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:48.850
He thinks he's needs to get used to it.
Alright.
Yeah.

77
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:53.590
He does unscripted television with a camera in his face all day long.
Well,

78
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:55.240
it turns out he didn't need to get used to what?

79
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:58.270
He was great at it from the very beginning.
She was,
yeah.

80
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.680
That's the same exact skill.
He talks to people.
He knows,
I talk to people,

81
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:05.500
he knows how to listen.
That's the,
it does.
Yeah.

82
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:09.270
That's like what is missing in a lot of people when it comes to where I was

83
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.480
playing golf when the one time when I was going through a divorce and uh,

84
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.010
people asked me does he give unsolicited advice?
And I'm like,

85
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:21.520
he doesn't give solicited advice even if you asked.

86
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:25.210
So I'm playing golf with him and I'm like,
doc,

87
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.360
this,
uh,
there's divorce was killing me.
It's just killing me.

88
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.040
And he goes,
keep your head still when you put much what he said,

89
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.500
what he goes,

90
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:43.270
keep your head still when you're put your in a better mood when you put well,

91
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.120
but you're moving your hand all over the place.
So why don't we start,

92
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.130
we'll keep your head still when you Putt,

93
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.180
which now is a metaphor for a lot of things to me is keep your head still when

94
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:55.080
you Putt,
you know,
do what you do well.
You know,

95
00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:56.920
it's what makes you feel bad or whatever you,

96
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.090
but in that particular case that is there,

97
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.020
those were really simple words and I know they were right off the cuff and I've

98
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:06.890
thought about them all the time since you keep your head still when you Putt,

99
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.020
that's solid advice.
Yeah.
All right,
so it's so it's a little bee bee.

100
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.230
Be More centered,
be in the zone.

101
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.980
I'm not if you were playing pool to keep your head down when you shoot.
Right.

102
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.830
Keep your head down when you shoot on the shot.
Right.

103
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.870
And that was a fall through,

104
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.760
but you wouldn't exactly call it advice,
but it was,

105
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:31.880
it was something I listen to and continue to think about to this fucking day.

106
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.300
It is advice because if you're really good at golf in that respect,

107
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.160
if you know how to not move your head,
like that's a discipline where you can,

108
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:43.140
you can apply that to the rest of your life right here.
You know,
you're,

109
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.920
if you're loose and you're not drinking and you're fucked up and you're not

110
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:48.950
using good technique,
your head's going to be all over the place.
Right.

111
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.170
Same thing of pool.
Stay down in your shot,
right.
