00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.000
Meet C&amp;T
A partner Company of Udacity

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.400
Business are transforming.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.600
They must be faster.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.500
The digital world is out there.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.100
And CI&amp;T's mission is exactly this,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.500
to help companies transform.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.000
And to transform, they must innovate.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.700
They need to change business models,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.000
change the way they do things,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.200
and software is the essential part of it.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.300
CI&amp;T has been in the market for 22 years.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.000
It's a global and
international Brazilian company.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.600
For 22 years.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.100
We have over 30% growth year over year.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.900
And 2017 will be no different.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.600
We have positions opened,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.200
we have clients
expanding their contracts with us.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.600
And we are very lucky to
get to work in the high-tech market,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.800
providing innovative
solutions for CI&amp;T's customers.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.000
We have multidisciplinary teams,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
because we're not only
focused in building software,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.100
we want to deliver the
greatest value to our customers,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.600
who will deliver the
greatest value to their customers.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.900
So the team starts
with a Developer, a Tester,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.300
going to an Architect, a Team Leader,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.000
a Project Manager, a Senior Manager,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
an Interface Designer, a Digital Strategist,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.900
and sometimes even Marketing personnel,

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.100
who are going to help us

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.800
understand how to launch
a project like this on the market.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.600
Another cool thing is
that we offer Y career plans.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.300
So, like...you can...

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.200
up to a certain point in their career,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.800
everyone goes on the same journey.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.000
Then, you can choose

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
if you want to lean towards management

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.900
or more towards the technical area.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.300
And that's cool because

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.200
people are not pulled into management

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.800
if they don't want to.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.900
We look for people with a CI&amp;T posture,

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.600
and we want to build an environment

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.600
that makes these postures prevail.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.500
We talk a lot about diversity,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.400
about autonomy, awareness, flexibility,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.000
and I believe this is reflected

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.600
in how people act, you know?

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.800
CI&amp;T is a Company
in which we dream of working.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.000
But here, the...

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.500
whole environment
is projected in a way,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.200
so that you feel
comfortable working.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.500
So, there are even
spaces for us to relax,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.000
for us to think, to study...

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.200
We've changed a lot
our recruiting process

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.200
and our hiring process.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.400
And since late 2003

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.000
they are totally
focused on experiences,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.500
on cases, on the day to day,

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.300
on how it feels to work at CI&amp;T.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.500
So we've already
held several hackathons,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.000
really hands-on,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.700
to show our team work,

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.500
how to get by when you face a problem.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.900
It's not a test,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.500
it's not a very simple assessment.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.900
It's our day to day at work.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.600
CI&amp;T expects a lot

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.700
from our partnership with Udacity,

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.500
because we're always looking for

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.700
the most appropriate people for our staff.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.500
And we look for people where they are,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.900
and some of them
are definitely at Udacity.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.300
Udacity manages to empower people

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.000
with some of the technologies we need,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.800
some of the technical abilities we need.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.500
CI&amp;T has lots of opportunities

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.400
in the software development area

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.300
for multiple technologies.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.200
Especially Java, iOS, Android,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.400
people very specialized in Analytics and Big Data.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.200
So, it seems to be far away from our reality,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.300
but it's already here,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.400
and we're looking for these people,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.800
so that they can join CI&amp;T.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.500
