00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:04.816
As we go into January of 1918,

00:00:04.816 --> 00:00:07.566
let's remind ourselves of the context,

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.002
the background that's going on,

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.337
especially relative to World War I.

00:00:11.337 --> 00:00:15.066
First of all in April of 1917,

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.652
a lot of the context is
what happened in 1917,

00:00:17.652 --> 00:00:22.485
you have the U.S. declares war on Germany.

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:24.604
The main argument they give

00:00:24.604 --> 00:00:26.339
is this unrestricted submarine warfare

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.668
that the Germans are undertaking.

00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:32.002
You also have the fall
of the Russian Empire.

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:36.740
... Fall of Russian Empire...

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.233
You have the revolution
that overthrows the Czar

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:43.403
in February, March of 1917,

00:00:43.403 --> 00:00:45.153
and then in October, you have

00:00:45.153 --> 00:00:46.822
the Bolsheviks take over in a coup.

00:00:46.822 --> 00:00:49.392
This essentially, the Bolsheviks,

00:00:49.392 --> 00:00:50.220
once they take over,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.964
they have no interest in terms of

00:00:51.964 --> 00:00:54.630
continuing the war with Germany.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.465
So you have an armistice declared

00:00:57.465 --> 00:01:00.191
and the Russians are in the process

00:01:00.191 --> 00:01:01.547
of negotiating the terms

00:01:01.547 --> 00:01:03.660
of a treaty with the Central Powers.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.787
They're kind of negotiating

00:01:04.787 --> 00:01:07.730
the Brest-Litovsk Treaty as we speak.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.129
On top of that, you have, because

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:11.820
the central powers don't have to focus

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.094
on Russia on the eastern front anymore,

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:16.736
they're trying to bring their,

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:17.937
especially Germany,

00:01:17.937 --> 00:01:19.271
is trying to bring its troops back

00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:21.073
to the western front,

00:01:21.073 --> 00:01:23.403
and they want to do it before the U.S.

00:01:23.403 --> 00:01:25.670
can mobilize in any significant way.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.269
So, race on western front ...

00:01:29.269 --> 00:01:32.608
western front ...

00:01:32.608 --> 00:01:35.334
Between, essentially, can Germany get

00:01:35.334 --> 00:01:36.737
its troops and do an offensive

00:01:36.737 --> 00:01:39.481
that can put probably
France out of the war

00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:42.076
before the U.S. has a chance to

00:01:42.076 --> 00:01:44.669
significantly reinforce the western front?

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:46.336
This is essentially between German,

00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:50.001
redeploy troops from the eastern front,

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:55.001
German troops ... troops from eastern,

00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.002
from eastern front versus

00:01:58.002 --> 00:01:59.485
new American troops ...

00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:02.268
versus new Americans.

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:03.599
This is the backdrop.

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.200
No one really knew what exactly

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.000
was going to happen on the western front.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.219
Certain military analysts will say

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:09.994
Germany was able to prosecute this

00:02:09.994 --> 00:02:12.213
two front war against a major empire

00:02:12.213 --> 00:02:13.806
and Russia, now they're going to be able

00:02:13.806 --> 00:02:16.121
to focus completely on the western front,

00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:17.460
Germany might be able to

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.597
deal the decisive blow.

00:02:19.597 --> 00:02:22.520
Others would say the U.S. it's this

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.301
emerging power, it's bringing

00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:26.211
fresh troops in, it has a major

00:02:26.211 --> 00:02:27.709
industrial capacity.

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.632
The U.S. could, especially if the war

00:02:29.632 --> 00:02:31.073
were to last a good bit, the U.S. might be

00:02:31.073 --> 00:02:36.001
the decisive element for the allies.

00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:37.734
So that's the background in which

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:40.737
President Wilson, President Woodrow Wilson

00:02:40.737 --> 00:02:43.379
on January of 1918, January 8th,

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.298
gives a speech to the
joint sessions of congress.

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:48.139
This is part of the text of the speech,

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.337
I'm just going to read through it,

00:02:49.337 --> 00:02:50.663
I'm not going to read the entire speech.

00:02:50.663 --> 00:02:52.544
He talks about many things, essentially;

00:02:52.544 --> 00:02:54.214
why are we in World War I,

00:02:54.214 --> 00:02:56.001
what is the moral causes of World War I,

00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:58.068
and his speech is most famous for

00:02:58.068 --> 00:03:00.983
his articulation of the "Fourteen Points".

00:03:00.983 --> 00:03:02.118
Let's just read into it because

00:03:02.118 --> 00:03:05.449
it really informs a lot of what happened

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:06.746
in the Treaty of Versailles,

00:03:06.746 --> 00:03:08.850
which is essentially the peace treaty

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.848
with Germany, which the U.S. ironically

00:03:10.848 --> 00:03:16.517
did not ratify, but it also lays out the

00:03:16.517 --> 00:03:19.514
tension in the Paris Peace Conferences

00:03:19.514 --> 00:03:21.588
after World War I between those who were

00:03:21.588 --> 00:03:23.452
more idealistic like Woodrow Wilson,

00:03:23.452 --> 00:03:25.386
and those who might have been

00:03:25.386 --> 00:03:27.248
a little bit more vengeful, especially

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:29.589
against the Central Powers.

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:31.252
Here we go, this is part of the speech:

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:33.582
"We enter this war because
violations of right

00:03:33.582 --> 00:03:35.517
had occurred which touched us to the quick

00:03:35.517 --> 00:03:39.046
and made the life of our
own people impossible

00:03:39.046 --> 00:03:40.918
unless they were corrected and the world

00:03:40.918 --> 00:03:43.116
secured once for all against their

00:03:43.116 --> 00:03:44.454
recurrence. What we demand in this war,

00:03:44.454 --> 00:03:48.186
therefore, is nothing
peculiar to ourselves.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:51.332
it is that the world be made fit and safe

00:03:51.332 --> 00:03:51.926
to live in ..."

00:03:51.926 --> 00:03:52.812
This is very idealistic.

00:03:52.812 --> 00:03:54.268
Remember, all these others, especially

00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:55.395
these European powers are all about

00:03:55.395 --> 00:03:57.262
who gets what land, who gets what empire,

00:03:57.262 --> 00:04:02.332
who gets to take advantage
of whatever colony.

00:04:02.332 --> 00:04:04.662
"... and particularly
that it be made safe for

00:04:04.662 --> 00:04:07.556
every peace-loving nation
which, like our own,

00:04:07.556 --> 00:04:09.859
wishes to live its own life,

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.646
determine is own institutions,

00:04:12.646 --> 00:04:14.729
be assured of justice and fair dealing

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.812
by the other peoples of the world

00:04:16.812 --> 00:04:19.193
as against force and selfish aggression.

00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:22.475
All the peoples of the world are in effect

00:04:22.475 --> 00:04:23.928
partners in this interest,

00:04:23.928 --> 00:04:26.595
and for our own part, we see very clearly

00:04:26.595 --> 00:04:28.732
that unless justice be done to others

00:04:28.732 --> 00:04:31.129
it will not be done to us.

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:33.868
The program of the
world's peace, therefore,

00:04:33.868 --> 00:04:36.536
is our program; and that program,

00:04:36.536 --> 00:04:39.728
the only possible program, all we see it,

00:04:39.728 --> 00:04:41.195
is this:"

00:04:41.195 --> 00:04:43.476
These are his Fourteen Points and

00:04:43.476 --> 00:04:46.794
I'll try to kind of give some
context for each of them.

00:04:46.794 --> 00:04:48.729
The first is:

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.329
"Open covenants of
peace, openly arrived at,

00:04:51.329 --> 00:04:54.663
after which there shall be no private

00:04:54.663 --> 00:04:56.807
international understandings of any kind

00:04:56.807 --> 00:04:59.195
but diplomacy shall proceed always

00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:01.331
frankly and in the public view."

00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:02.727
The context here is actually after

00:05:02.727 --> 00:05:03.893
the Bolsheviks took over,

00:05:03.893 --> 00:05:05.263
they started releasing all these secret

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:08.600
covenants and understandings that the

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.462
Russian Empire had been getting into.

00:05:10.462 --> 00:05:12.654
We've already talked about
all the entanglements

00:05:12.654 --> 00:05:15.144
and the alliances that led to World War I,

00:05:15.144 --> 00:05:16.728
so this is Wilson's attempt to say,

00:05:16.728 --> 00:05:18.062
"Hey, let's just do
everything out in the open.

00:05:18.062 --> 00:05:21.601
That'll let everyone kind of know,

00:05:21.601 --> 00:05:23.731
give more transparency,
what may or may not

00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:25.268
occur, based on their actions."

00:05:25.268 --> 00:05:27.995
Number 2, "Absolute freedom of navigation

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:31.586
upon the seas, outside territorial waters,

00:05:31.586 --> 00:05:33.805
alike in peace and in war, except

00:05:33.805 --> 00:05:36.138
as the seas may be closed in whole

00:05:36.138 --> 00:05:38.068
or in part by international action for the

00:05:38.068 --> 00:05:40.471
enforcement of international covenants."

00:05:40.471 --> 00:05:42.273
So no more of these British blockades,

00:05:42.273 --> 00:05:44.552
no more of this unrestricted
submarine warfare,

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:47.549
the only time we can dictate what happens

00:05:47.549 --> 00:05:50.065
in open waters is if the international

00:05:50.065 --> 00:05:53.220
community trying to decide that it wants

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.333
to enforce international covenants.

00:05:55.333 --> 00:05:57.874
Number 3, "The removal
of all economic barriers

00:05:57.874 --> 00:05:59.465
and the establishment of equality

00:05:59.465 --> 00:06:00.661
of trade conditions among

00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:02.268
all the nations consenting to the peace

00:06:02.268 --> 00:06:05.269
and associating themselves
for its maintenance."

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:06.467
So essentially, it's free trade.

00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:10.274
... free trade ...

00:06:10.274 --> 00:06:12.865
Number 4, "Adequate
guarantees given and taken

00:06:12.865 --> 00:06:16.358
that national armaments
will be reduced to the

00:06:16.358 --> 00:06:18.462
lowest point consistent
with domestic safety."

00:06:18.462 --> 00:06:19.725
So he's trying to undo some of this

00:06:19.725 --> 00:06:24.394
militarism, this buildup
of arms that essentially

00:06:24.394 --> 00:06:28.660
allowed World War I to happen with the

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.069
ferocity that it did and with the

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:31.662
quickness with which it did.

00:06:31.662 --> 00:06:35.134
Number 5, "A free,open-minded,
and absolutely

00:06:35.134 --> 00:06:38.566
impartial adjustment
of all colonial claims,

00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:40.663
based upon a strict observance ot the

00:06:40.663 --> 00:06:43.063
principle that in determining all such

00:06:43.063 --> 00:06:45.056
questions of sovereignty the interests of

00:06:45.056 --> 00:06:47.333
the populations concerned must have equal

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:48.666
weight with the equitable claims of the

00:06:48.666 --> 00:06:51.559
government whose title
is to be determined."

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:54.193
This is a big deal that probably did not

00:06:54.193 --> 00:06:56.892
make the British or the French happy.

00:06:56.892 --> 00:06:59.398
This is essentially
saying self-determination,

00:06:59.398 --> 00:07:02.461
the people who are in those nations,

00:07:02.461 --> 00:07:03.264
in those states,

00:07:03.264 --> 00:07:06.813
their interests matter just as much.

00:07:06.813 --> 00:07:09.595
"A free open-minded absolutely impartial

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:11.663
adjustment of all colonial claims."

00:07:11.663 --> 00:07:14.397
This is a pretty big deal.

00:07:14.397 --> 00:07:16.480
Remember, we're kind
of exiting this period

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.194
of empires, most of the
European powers still

00:07:19.194 --> 00:07:21.975
think that these international empires

00:07:21.975 --> 00:07:24.892
are essentially part of their prestige.

00:07:24.892 --> 00:07:28.400
Number 6, "The evacuation of all Russian

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.863
territory and such a
settlement of all questions

00:07:30.863 --> 00:07:33.536
affecting Russia as will
secure the best and freest

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.868
cooperation of the other
nations of the world

00:07:35.868 --> 00:07:37.796
in obtaining for her an unhampered and

00:07:37.796 --> 00:07:40.140
unembarrassed opportunity for the

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.997
independent determination
of her own political

00:07:41.997 --> 00:07:45.475
development and national
policy and assure her

00:07:45.475 --> 00:07:46.927
of a sincere welcome into the

00:07:46.927 --> 00:07:49.334
society of free nations under institutions

00:07:49.334 --> 00:07:50.214
of her own choosing ..."

00:07:50.214 --> 00:07:52.965
This is still one sentence
and then you put period there,

00:07:52.965 --> 00:07:55.207
semi-colon ... And I guess
he had to read that himself,

00:07:55.207 --> 00:07:56.719
" ... And, more than a welcome,

00:07:56.719 --> 00:07:59.388
assistance also of every kind that she may

00:07:59.388 --> 00:08:01.708
need and may herself desire.

00:08:01.708 --> 00:08:03.630
The treatment accorded Russia by her

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.386
sister nations in the months to come ..."

00:08:05.386 --> 00:08:07.055
Remember, they're negotiating
with the Central Powers

00:08:07.055 --> 00:08:09.757
on Brest-Litovsk,

00:08:09.757 --> 00:08:12.191
" ... to come will be the
acid test of their good will,

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:14.058
of their comprehension of her needs

00:08:14.058 --> 00:08:16.839
as distinguished from their own interests,

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:19.188
and of their intelligent
and unselfish sympathy."

00:08:19.188 --> 00:08:21.451
So it's saying look, Wilson doesn't know

00:08:21.451 --> 00:08:23.123
whether the allies or the Central Powers

00:08:23.123 --> 00:08:24.426
are going to win on the western front,

00:08:24.426 --> 00:08:26.678
but they know that the Central Powers

00:08:26.678 --> 00:08:29.504
are dictating terms to
Russia with Brest-Litovsk.

00:08:29.504 --> 00:08:31.791
It's like, this is going to be a test

00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:33.717
of your good will, of your comprehension

00:08:33.717 --> 00:08:36.451
of the need of this newly-emerging of

00:08:36.451 --> 00:08:40.392
state now that the
Bolsheviks have taken over.

00:08:40.392 --> 00:08:41.421
Obviously at this point, you don't have

00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:44.674
the antagonism between the U.S. and the

00:08:44.674 --> 00:08:48.146
future Soviet Union
that is going to emerge.

00:08:48.146 --> 00:08:53.053
They're saying give Russia
a chance to be herself.

00:08:53.053 --> 00:08:55.652
Number 7, "Belgium, the
whole world will agree,

00:08:55.652 --> 00:08:56.901
must be evacuated and restored,

00:08:56.901 --> 00:08:59.117
without any attempt to
limit the sovereignty

00:08:59.117 --> 00:09:01.151
which she enjoys in common with all other

00:09:01.151 --> 00:09:02.401
free nations."

00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:07.154
This is kind of obvious.
When the Germans rolled

00:09:07.154 --> 00:09:09.236
through Belgium, that's
how they got to France.

00:09:09.236 --> 00:09:11.645
It was a justification
that Great Britain used for

00:09:11.645 --> 00:09:13.588
entering the war, so get out of Belgium.

00:09:13.588 --> 00:09:17.124
Number 8, "All French
territories should be freed

00:09:17.124 --> 00:09:19.272
and invaded portions restored,

00:09:19.272 --> 00:09:21.057
and the wrong done to France by Prussia

00:09:21.057 --> 00:09:23.607
in 1871 in the matter of Alsace-Lorraine,

00:09:23.607 --> 00:09:25.348
which has unsettled the peace of the world

00:09:25.348 --> 00:09:27.269
for nearly fifty years, should be righted,

00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:30.117
in order that peace may once more be made

00:09:30.117 --> 00:09:31.530
secure in the interest of all."

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:33.020
Alsace-Lorraine, we've touched on it

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.119
several times.

00:09:34.119 --> 00:09:37.328
That's this region right over here.

00:09:37.328 --> 00:09:39.533
It was taken by Germany, essentially the

00:09:39.533 --> 00:09:42.060
unification of Germany during
the Franco-Prussian War,

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.934
which was a [unintelligible] region.

00:09:43.934 --> 00:09:45.190
This was one of the justifications,

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.967
this was why France might have gone

00:09:47.967 --> 00:09:48.725
into a war with Germany,

00:09:48.725 --> 00:09:50.329
and what Germany almost wanted to be

00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:51.661
preemptive against France because they

00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:53.796
said France might want
to take some of that

00:09:53.796 --> 00:09:56.728
territory back.

00:09:56.728 --> 00:09:59.720
9, "A readjustment of
the frontiers of Italy

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.664
should be effected along clearly

00:10:01.664 --> 00:10:03.624
recognizable lines of nationality."

00:10:03.624 --> 00:10:05.209
Hey, where do people speak Italian?

00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:07.962
10, "The peoples of Austria-Hungary,

00:10:07.962 --> 00:10:10.371
whose place among the
nations we wish to see

00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:12.728
safeguarded and assured,
should be accorded

00:10:12.728 --> 00:10:13.728
the freest opportunity

00:10:13.728 --> 00:10:15.730
of autonomous development."

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.873
This is another big deal.

00:10:16.873 --> 00:10:18.538
It's another breaking up of an empire.

00:10:18.538 --> 00:10:20.663
It's another self-determination point

00:10:20.663 --> 00:10:22.729
of the "Fourteen Points".

00:10:22.729 --> 00:10:24.397
Austria-Hungary, we've already said

00:10:24.397 --> 00:10:25.464
it was an empire.

00:10:25.464 --> 00:10:27.659
It included many, many,
many nationalities.

00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:29.928
You have the Czechs right around there.

00:10:29.928 --> 00:10:31.733
You have the Slovacs right around there.

00:10:31.733 --> 00:10:34.062
You have the Austrians, German-speaking

00:10:34.062 --> 00:10:36.622
people, right over there.

00:10:36.622 --> 00:10:38.995
You have the Hungarians,
roughly over there.

00:10:38.995 --> 00:10:40.996
You have the Slovenians
roughly over there.

00:10:40.996 --> 00:10:43.622
You have the Croatians roughly over there.

00:10:43.622 --> 00:10:45.205
You have the Bosnians roughly over there.

00:10:45.205 --> 00:10:47.540
You have many, many other nationalities

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.397
especially as you get close to the border

00:10:49.397 --> 00:10:51.879
with Romania and the
border with the Ukraine.

00:10:51.879 --> 00:10:53.126
It's like, let these people determine,

00:10:53.126 --> 00:10:54.995
let them determine their own fate

00:10:54.995 --> 00:10:55.955
to some degree.

00:10:55.955 --> 00:10:57.728
There are all these nationalities.

00:10:57.728 --> 00:11:00.394
That was number 10.

00:11:00.394 --> 00:11:01.542
"The freest opportunity to

00:11:01.542 --> 00:11:03.200
autonomous development."

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.906
He's not saying that they necessarily

00:11:05.922 --> 00:11:07.380
need their own states,

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.046
but that they should have the opportunity

00:11:09.046 --> 00:11:12.149
to self-govern in some way.

00:11:12.149 --> 00:11:14.447
Number 11, "Romania,
Serbia, and Montenegro

00:11:14.447 --> 00:11:17.565
should be evacuated; occupied
territories restored;

00:11:17.565 --> 00:11:19.649
Serbia accorded free and secure access

00:11:19.649 --> 00:11:21.245
to the sea; and the
relations of the several

00:11:21.245 --> 00:11:23.519
Balkan states to one another determined

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:25.712
by friendly counsel along historically

00:11:25.712 --> 00:11:28.476
established lines of
allegiance and nationality;

00:11:28.476 --> 00:11:29.977
and international guarantees of the

00:11:29.977 --> 00:11:31.650
political and economic independence

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.811
and territorial integrity of the several

00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:35.977
Balkan states should be entered into."

00:11:35.977 --> 00:11:37.376
This is kind of laying the groundwork

00:11:37.376 --> 00:11:42.584
for the future state of Yugoslavia,

00:11:42.584 --> 00:11:45.514
which is going to be roughly over there.

00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:47.466
It's kind of the state
of the southern Slavs,

00:11:47.466 --> 00:11:48.938
which is what the whole motivation

00:11:48.938 --> 00:11:54.861
[unintelligible] for
assassinating Archduke Ferdinand

00:11:54.861 --> 00:11:56.481
which some would argue was kind of the

00:11:56.481 --> 00:11:59.739
spark that lit World War I.

00:11:59.739 --> 00:12:01.359
"The Turkish portions of the present

00:12:01.359 --> 00:12:03.731
Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure

00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:07.066
sovereignty, but the other nationalities

00:12:07.066 --> 00:12:08.530
which are now under Turkish rule should

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:11.196
be assured an undoubted security of life

00:12:11.196 --> 00:12:13.263
and an absolutely unmolested opportunity

00:12:13.263 --> 00:12:14.197
of an autonomous development ..."

00:12:14.197 --> 00:12:15.604
Once again, self-determination.

00:12:15.604 --> 00:12:17.197
"... and the Dardanelles should be

00:12:17.197 --> 00:12:18.794
permanently opened as a free passage

00:12:18.794 --> 00:12:21.782
to the ships and commerce of all nations

00:12:21.782 --> 00:12:23.996
under international guarantees."

00:12:23.996 --> 00:12:26.066
So the Dardanelles, we've
talked about it before,

00:12:26.066 --> 00:12:29.944
that is, that's this right over here,

00:12:29.944 --> 00:12:31.729
so that you have access between the

00:12:31.729 --> 00:12:34.327
Aegean Sea and the Black Sea.

00:12:34.327 --> 00:12:38.131
And we are almost there.

00:12:38.131 --> 00:12:40.193
So then you have, "An
independent Polish state

00:12:40.193 --> 00:12:44.025
should be erected which should include

00:12:44.025 --> 00:12:46.726
the territories inhabited by indisputably

00:12:46.726 --> 00:12:48.999
Polish populations,
which should be assured

00:12:48.999 --> 00:12:51.196
a free and secure access to the sea,

00:12:51.196 --> 00:12:52.996
and whose political and
economic independence

00:12:52.996 --> 00:12:54.687
and territorial integrity should be

00:12:54.687 --> 00:12:57.278
guaranteed by international covenant."

00:12:57.278 --> 00:13:00.197
Poland did not exist as its own state

00:13:00.197 --> 00:13:01.860
prior to World War I.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.194
Now you have Woodrow Wilson is

00:13:04.194 --> 00:13:04.937
advocating it.

00:13:04.937 --> 00:13:06.799
It will be carved out roughly of this

00:13:06.799 --> 00:13:08.995
area right over there.

00:13:08.995 --> 00:13:12.402
Then finally, point 14,

00:13:12.402 --> 00:13:15.399
"A general association
of nations must be formed

00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:17.941
under specific covenants
for the purpose of

00:13:17.941 --> 00:13:20.279
affording mutual guarantees of political

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:22.398
independence and territorial integrity

00:13:22.398 --> 00:13:25.528
to great and small states alike."

00:13:25.528 --> 00:13:27.067
This is essentially, this is the point,

00:13:27.067 --> 00:13:29.274
that leads to the formation of

00:13:29.274 --> 00:13:30.921
the League of Nations.

00:13:30.921 --> 00:13:33.251
When we talk about big ideas,

00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:35.525
this is a big idea, especially back then.

00:13:35.525 --> 00:13:37.403
You have Europe who keeps getting into

00:13:37.403 --> 00:13:38.514
wars with each other.

00:13:38.514 --> 00:13:40.649
Hey, why don't we all cooperate at

00:13:40.649 --> 00:13:43.585
this middle level and we have this

00:13:43.585 --> 00:13:47.919
club of all of the nations
to resolve disputes

00:13:47.919 --> 00:13:50.917
and make sure that we don't have

00:13:50.917 --> 00:13:52.315
another World War I.

00:13:52.315 --> 00:13:56.523
So, very, very, very big idealistic idea,

00:13:56.523 --> 00:14:00.584
it gets formed as an outcome of

00:14:00.584 --> 00:14:01.922
the Treaty of Versailles,

00:14:01.922 --> 00:14:05.398
which is drafted during the

00:14:05.398 --> 00:14:07.981
Paris Peace Conferences after World War I.

00:14:07.981 --> 00:14:09.817
The unfortunate thing
of the League of Nations

00:14:09.817 --> 00:14:11.250
is that even though this was kind of,

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:12.917
the idea was coming from Woodrow Wilson,

00:14:12.917 --> 00:14:15.119
the Treaty of Versailles and

00:14:15.119 --> 00:14:18.315
the League of Nations was
not ratified by the U.S.

00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:20.316
The U.S. never entered
the League of Nations,

00:14:20.316 --> 00:14:22.313
which kind of made it a little bit hollow,

00:14:22.313 --> 00:14:24.850
and the League of Nations did not have

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.532
the power to stop World War II from

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:30.255
happening only a few decades later,

00:14:30.255 --> 00:14:32.317
and would later be replaced
by the United Nations.

00:14:32.317 --> 00:14:35.779
This is a really, really,
really, really big idea.

00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:37.728
Because of these big ideas,

00:14:37.728 --> 00:14:40.476
Woodrow Wilson, these
very idealistic ideas,

00:14:40.476 --> 00:14:42.385
everyone in Europe is talking about

00:14:42.385 --> 00:14:44.901
territory and imperialism and how do they

00:14:44.901 --> 00:14:46.990
take control of other people,

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:48.854
take control of their resources,

00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:50.385
and now you have the American President

00:14:50.385 --> 00:14:51.847
saying it's all about self-determination.

00:14:51.847 --> 00:14:53.452
It's about making the world safe

00:14:53.452 --> 00:14:55.384
for democracy, safe for commerce,

00:14:55.384 --> 00:14:57.474
about open agreements.

00:14:57.474 --> 00:14:59.311
It's a very powerful idea.

00:14:59.311 --> 00:15:00.482
This would kind of form the basis,

00:15:00.482 --> 00:15:02.407
the more idealistic side of

00:15:02.407 --> 00:15:04.661
American Foreign Policy
over the 20th Century.

00:15:04.661 --> 00:15:06.121
Some would say that there's another

00:15:06.121 --> 00:15:09.063
very cynical side that takes
into account self-interest,

00:15:09.063 --> 00:15:11.720
but this is the idealistic side of

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.192
American Foreign Policy, especially

00:15:13.192 --> 00:15:15.193
through the 20th Century.

00:15:15.193 --> 00:15:17.657
For this, for his work
in this in this area,

00:15:17.657 --> 00:15:20.850
Woodrow Wilson wins the Nobel Prize

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:21.786
a few years later.

00:15:21.786 --> 00:15:22.982
This right here is a picture of

00:15:22.982 --> 00:15:25.986
the Nobel Prize looks
like, both sides of it.

00:15:25.986 --> 00:15:28.401
Now, just to kind of foreshadow some

00:15:28.401 --> 00:15:29.518
of the tension as we get into the

00:15:29.518 --> 00:15:30.721
Paris Peace Conference,

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:33.256
not everyone was as idealistic.

00:15:33.256 --> 00:15:34.990
You obviously these European powers

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.934
who bled much harder
than the Americans did,

00:15:37.934 --> 00:15:40.856
although the Americans did contribute

00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:43.716
significant cost, or troops, to the effort

00:15:43.716 --> 00:15:45.181
and they lost many, many folks.

00:15:45.181 --> 00:15:46.654
Obviously if you're French,

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:49.235
you had these Germans on your territory.

00:15:49.235 --> 00:15:51.749
You lost a significant fraction of

00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:53.250
your population, a huge fraction of

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:54.487
your male population.

00:15:54.487 --> 00:15:56.326
You might be a little bit angrier.

00:15:56.326 --> 00:15:59.519
So of course, you have Georges Clemenceau

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:01.524
who was the Prime Minister of France.

00:16:01.524 --> 00:16:03.784
He was a little bit more skeptical of

00:16:03.784 --> 00:16:04.854
the "Fourteen Points".

00:16:04.854 --> 00:16:05.921
This is a quote from him,

00:16:05.921 --> 00:16:08.076
he actually has many
slightly entertaining quotes,

00:16:08.076 --> 00:16:10.719
"Mr. Wilson bores me with
his "Fourteen Points"

00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:14.585
while God Almighty has only ten."

00:16:14.585 --> 00:16:17.049
This will kind of foreshadow some of the

00:16:17.049 --> 00:16:20.854
tension between Clemenceau
and the British,

00:16:20.854 --> 00:16:23.827
and European allies on one side,

00:16:23.827 --> 00:16:25.248
and the Americans as we go to the

00:16:25.248 --> 00:16:26.854
Paris Peace Conference.

00:16:26.854 --> 00:16:28.327
They were a little bit looking out more

00:16:28.327 --> 00:16:29.457
for revenge, especially against the

00:16:29.457 --> 00:16:31.327
Germans while the Americans, especially

00:16:31.327 --> 00:16:34.789
Woodrow Wilson, was a lot more idealistic.
