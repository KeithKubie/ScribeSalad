AUDIENCE: You've had
a chance to look over

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.290
the syllabus for this course.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.600
What value do you think
it might have for learners

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.990
in the outside
world, and would you

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.520
recommend that they take
a look at these readings

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.739
and try to apply them
to their own lives?

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.280
NOAM CHOMSKY: Yeah,
quite definitely.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.150
I mean, if we want to have
any constructive impact

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.510
on the world, any interchange
with the world that

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.070
will improve it will deal with
the innumerable problems that

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.080
exist.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.420
It has to be based
on understanding

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.500
of social, political,
economic reality.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.480
Otherwise, you can't
act in any serious way,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.910
just as you couldn't
go into a chemistry lab

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.870
and conduct an experiment
unless you knew something

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.510
about chemistry.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.320
Otherwise, you could mix
chemicals and make funny smells

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.720
and so on.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.530
But if you want to
do something serious,

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.370
you have to understand first.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.650
And the syllabus of the course
and conduct of the course

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.520
is aimed at and I think
succeeds in providing

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.110
the kind of fundamental
understanding and challenge

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.620
open questions that
people have to think about

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.050
if they want to be
able to participate

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.110
in a meaningful way in
the general society.
