00:00:00.303 --> 00:00:01.974
- [Voiceover] By now we're used to seeing

00:00:01.974 --> 00:00:06.525
functions defined like h(y)=y^2

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:11.192
or f(x)= to the square root of x.

00:00:11.192 --> 00:00:12.864
But what we're now going to explore

00:00:12.864 --> 00:00:15.886
is functions that are
defined piece by piece

00:00:15.886 --> 00:00:17.859
over different intervals
and functions like

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.331
this you'll sometimes
view them as a piecewise,

00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:22.910
or these types of function definitions

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.323
they might be called a
piecewise function definition.

00:00:26.323 --> 00:00:29.806
Let's take a look at this
graph right over here.

00:00:29.806 --> 00:00:31.779
This graph, you can see that the function

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.960
is constant over this interval, 4x.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.166
And then it jumps up
in this interval for x,

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.022
and then it jumps back down
for this interval for x.

00:00:40.022 --> 00:00:41.694
Let's think about how we would write this

00:00:41.694 --> 00:00:44.062
using our function notation.

00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:47.359
If we say that this right
over here is the x-axis

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.142
and this is the y=f(x) axis.

00:00:52.142 --> 00:00:56.507
Then, let's see, our function
f(x) is going to be equal to,

00:00:56.507 --> 00:00:58.683
there's three different intervals.

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.192
So let me give myself some space

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:01.794
for the three different intervals.

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:06.020
Now this first interval
is from, not including -9,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.575
and I have this open circle here.

00:01:07.575 --> 00:01:08.574
Not a closed in circle.

00:01:08.574 --> 00:01:12.219
So not including -9 but
x being greater than -9

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:15.238
and all the way up to and including -5.

00:01:15.238 --> 00:01:19.580
I could write that as -9 is less than x,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.179
less than or equal to -5.

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:25.175
That's this interval, and what is

00:01:25.175 --> 00:01:26.801
the value of the function
over this interval?

00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:29.587
Well we see, the value
of the function is -9.

00:01:29.587 --> 00:01:32.629
It's a constant -9 over that interval.

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:33.906
It's a little confusing because the value

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:36.599
of the function is actually also the value

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:40.361
of the lower bound on this
interval right over here.

00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:43.913
It's very important to look at
this says, -9 is less than x,

00:01:43.913 --> 00:01:45.260
not less than or equal.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.839
If it was less than or
equal, then the function

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:49.648
would have been defined at
x equals -9, but it's not.

00:01:49.648 --> 00:01:52.156
We have an open circle right over there.

00:01:52.156 --> 00:01:53.944
But now let's look at the next interval.

00:01:53.944 --> 00:01:58.944
The next interval is
from -5 is less than x,

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:04.387
which is less than or equal to -1.

00:02:04.387 --> 00:02:08.149
Over that interval, the
function is equal to,

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.844
the function is a constant 6.

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:10.842
It jumps up here.

00:02:10.842 --> 00:02:12.792
Sometimes people call this a
step function, it steps up.

00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:15.486
It looks like stairs to some degree.

00:02:15.486 --> 00:02:18.992
Now it's very important
here, that at x equals -5,

00:02:18.992 --> 00:02:20.966
for it to be defined only one place.

00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:22.521
Here it's defined by this part.

00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:24.123
It's only defined over here.

00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:25.493
So that's why it's
important that this isn't

00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:28.140
a -5 is less than or equal to.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.625
Because then if you put
-5 into the function,

00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:32.505
this thing would be filled in,

00:02:32.505 --> 00:02:34.618
and then the function would
be defined both places

00:02:34.618 --> 00:02:35.826
and that's not cool for a function,

00:02:35.826 --> 00:02:37.498
it wouldn't be a function anymore.

00:02:37.498 --> 00:02:40.818
So it's very important that when you input

00:02:40.818 --> 00:02:45.640
- 5 in here, you know which
of these intervals you are in.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.357
You can't be in two of these intervals.

00:02:48.357 --> 00:02:49.703
If you are in two of these intervals,

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:51.445
the intervals should
give you the same values

00:02:51.445 --> 00:02:52.768
so that the function maps,

00:02:52.768 --> 00:02:55.856
from one input to the same output.

00:02:55.856 --> 00:02:56.948
Now let's keep going.

00:02:56.948 --> 00:02:58.643
We have this last
interval where we're going

00:02:58.643 --> 00:03:03.217
from -1 to 9.

00:03:03.217 --> 00:03:06.073
&gt;From -1 to +9.

00:03:06.073 --> 00:03:09.602
And x starts off with -1 less than x,

00:03:09.602 --> 00:03:11.645
because you have an open
circle right over here

00:03:11.645 --> 00:03:12.574
and that's good because

00:03:12.574 --> 00:03:15.194
X equals -1 is defined up here,

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:18.955
all the way to x is
less than or equal to 9.

00:03:18.955 --> 00:03:23.082
Over that interval, what is
the value of our function?

00:03:23.082 --> 00:03:26.286
Well you see, the value of
our function is a constant -7.

00:03:26.286 --> 00:03:29.026
A constant -7 and we're done.

00:03:29.026 --> 00:03:31.023
We have just constructed a

00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:34.111
piece by piece definition
of this function.

00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:37.402
Actually, when you see this
type of function notation,

00:03:37.402 --> 00:03:38.419
it becomes a lot clearer why

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:42.273
function notation is useful even.

00:03:42.273 --> 00:03:44.409
Hopefully you enjoyed that.

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:48.089
I always find these piecewise
functions a lot of fun.
