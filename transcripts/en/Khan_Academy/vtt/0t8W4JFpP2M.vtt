00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.270
Sal:Let's say that we have three vectors,

00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:04.171
vectors A, B and C, and we know that

00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:13.108
vector A plus vector B
is equal to vector C.

00:00:13.703 --> 00:00:17.203
Now given this I have some
interesting questions.

00:00:17.906 --> 00:00:21.250
Can you construct a scenario where the

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.530
magnitude of vector C is equal to

00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:33.437
the magnitude of vector A plus
the magnitude of vector B?

00:00:36.404 --> 00:00:40.888
And can you also, using potentially
different vectors A and B,

00:00:40.888 --> 00:00:42.638
construct a scenario where the

00:00:42.638 --> 00:00:46.202
magnitude of vector C is greater than

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:54.779
the magnitude of vector A plus
the magnitude of vector B?

00:00:55.217 --> 00:00:56.435
I encourage you to pause this

00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:58.248
video right now and try to do that.

00:00:58.248 --> 00:01:01.575
Try to come up with some
vectors A and B so that

00:01:01.575 --> 00:01:04.093
when you take their sum,
the magnitude of the

00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:07.157
sum is equal to the sum of the magnitudes.

00:01:07.157 --> 00:01:10.076
And also see if you can come
up with some vectors A and B so

00:01:10.076 --> 00:01:14.810
that if you take the sum of
the vectors that the magnitude

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.460
of the sum is actually greater
than the sum of the magnitude.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.001
see if you can come up with that.

00:01:22.294 --> 00:01:24.234
I'm assuming you've given a go at it,

00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:26.184
and potentially you've gotten
a little bit frustrated,

00:01:26.184 --> 00:01:27.955
especially with the second one.

00:01:28.345 --> 00:01:31.186
The only way- Let's actually
just draw some vectors.

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:34.716
If you have vector A like this,

00:01:34.716 --> 00:01:40.158
and let's say vector B
looks something like that,

00:01:40.498 --> 00:01:41.719
then A plus B ...

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.222
We can just shift this
over, copy and paste.

00:01:46.622 --> 00:01:54.079
A plus B is going to look like this.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.670
A plus B, or vector C I guess we

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.951
could say, is going to look like that.

00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:04.922
And notice, these three
vectors always form a triangle.

00:02:05.332 --> 00:02:10.921
If you have a triangle, one side cannot be

00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:15.717
longer than the sum of
the other two sides.

00:02:15.717 --> 00:02:16.500
Think about it.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.296
If you wanted this to
be longer what you could

00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:25.341
try to do is maybe change
vector B in a way so

00:02:25.341 --> 00:02:27.372
you're pushing it further and further out.

00:02:29.874 --> 00:02:32.482
Maybe if you change your
vector B a little bit you

00:02:32.732 --> 00:02:35.498
could get this vector C
to be longer and longer.

00:02:35.498 --> 00:02:37.717
Maybe if you made your vector B like this.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.050
Maybe your vector B would
look something like this.

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.951
Now your vector C is getting
pretty long, but it's

00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:49.827
still shorter than the
sum of these two sides.

00:02:49.827 --> 00:02:51.405
To make it equal to the sum of these two

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:53.640
sides you essentially have to make these

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.250
two vectors go in the
exact same direction.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.768
To make it equal you have to
have vector A looking like this.

00:03:01.123 --> 00:03:03.264
You need to change the direction of B,

00:03:03.264 --> 00:03:04.761
or essentially construct a vector B

00:03:04.761 --> 00:03:07.422
that's going in the exact same direction.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.836
Only in this circumstance
will you get this scenario,

00:03:14.836 --> 00:03:18.746
where the magnitude of
vector C is equal to.

00:03:19.306 --> 00:03:23.657
Really the largest that
the magnitude of the sum

00:03:23.657 --> 00:03:26.277
can be is the sum of the
magnitudes, and that only

00:03:26.277 --> 00:03:29.809
happens when these two are
going in the same direction.

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:36.232
These are going in the same,
in the exact same direction.

00:03:36.714 --> 00:03:38.935
This right over here is impossible.

00:03:39.465 --> 00:03:44.008
You could never get one side
of a triangle being longer than

00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:47.290
the sum of the other two sides,
based on what we just saw.

00:03:47.871 --> 00:03:49.671
You're probably saying, "What
about the circumstance where

00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:59.778
"the magnitude of our sum is
less than the magnitude of ..."

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.039
Than the sum of the magnitudes,
I guess I could say.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.993
This is fairly typical.

00:04:06.993 --> 00:04:09.024
This is pretty much always the scenario,

00:04:09.024 --> 00:04:11.045
this is what's always going to be the case

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.240
when the vectors are not
in the same direction.

00:04:18.236 --> 00:04:20.408
If someone drew a vector like this-

00:04:21.268 --> 00:04:22.842
Let me draw that a little bit straighter.

00:04:23.422 --> 00:04:26.566
If someone drew a vector
like this and a vector like

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:30.147
this these clearly are not
going in the same direction,

00:04:30.606 --> 00:04:32.258
so the sum of these two vectors,

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:35.056
the magnitude of that is going to be less

00:04:35.056 --> 00:04:36.898
than the sum of these two magnitudes.

00:04:36.898 --> 00:04:40.509
For example if the
magnitude here is five and

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.479
the magnitude here is three then we know

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.322
that if we were to add
these two things ...

00:04:46.822 --> 00:04:48.087
Let me just show you.

00:04:49.948 --> 00:04:52.061
Copy and paste.

00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:54.900
Actually let me just cut and paste,

00:04:55.821 --> 00:04:57.726
so that we can clean
things up a little bit.

00:04:58.837 --> 00:05:00.790
Cut and paste.

00:05:01.322 --> 00:05:03.151
Let's add these two vectors.

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:07.134
So we know that the sum of these two,

00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:09.608
which is going to be this
vector right over here,

00:05:09.608 --> 00:05:16.493
its magnitude is going to be
less than five plus three.

00:05:16.714 --> 00:05:18.306
It is going to be less than eight.

00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:21.481
The only way that this magnitude
could even get to eight

00:05:21.481 --> 00:05:28.292
is if these two vectors went
in the exact same direction.
