00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.445
And the correct answer is this one.

00:00:02.445 --> 00:00:05.310
It goes through the point 0,4 and

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.045
remember 0 is the X coordinate and
4 is the Y.

00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:12.860
And the slope is 2 over 3, so
that means it goes up one,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.985
two, over one, two, three.

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:17.290
And so the pink line here
is the only one that fits.
