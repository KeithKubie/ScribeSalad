00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.580
Somebody made a dice rolling machine.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.500
There's a YouTube video, and I bet you can find it, to test the claim that I made about the dice

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.559
changing because of the drilling the holes in their faces. And he was a

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.830
undergraduate at University of Chicago's Statistics Department,

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.570
and he did it as a final project for a course. And he had a camera he had an automated, Brady,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.959
and he rolled six dice at once.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.689
I think. And there was a table underneath it, and there were little springs, and, and a pusher,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.149
and so that pusher would push it, and then the springs would go like that, and the dice would go all over the place. And then when

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:42.299
they finally came to rest, the camera would take a picture. And then he had something that parsed that picture, and would record it.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.919
And so, in that way he could get hundreds of thousands of rolls of a die.

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:53.939
And, and that was one way of making a dice rolling machine, which was to test random rolling.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.649
There are schools in Nevada which claim to,

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:08.009
which purport, to teach you how to roll dice in a casino and control them.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.260
And, now,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.219
it's pretty questionable, but very roughly speaking, what they try to teach you is to

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.549
roll the die so that it slides around

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.438
without tumbling, and then of course, if you slide a die on the table,

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.209
but just rotate it this way, the top face would just stay on top. You can imagine somebody

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.259
learning how to

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.799
slide dice in that way, so that they spun around. And maybe even if just one of the dice slides,

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.629
that's a pretty big advantage. The casinos, in order to combat that, make sure

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.749
that when you roll dice they hit the backboard. And the backboard has ridge rubber, which are

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.329
diamond fingers that look like that,

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.959
and if, I promise you, if a die hits ridge rubber it gets bounced back, and tumbles back, and, and,

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.479
and it's, it's a fascinating

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.060
psychological and sociological setting.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.700
Suppose that you think you can control the dice. Of course you're not perfect at it,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.080
but you don't have to be perfect at it in order to get some kind of an advantage. You could trick

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.820
yourself, even if you were watching a random sequence, into thinking that you were changing the odds a little bit.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.820
I'm sure that when you throw a die in a casino,

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.680
and it hits the backboard with ridge rubber and comes off, that there's no,

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.624
no control is possible.

00:02:28.624 --> 00:02:36.960
Brady: "To be a fair dice, is really the only criteria that all your sides are the same shape and area?"

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.280
So, in our theorem and, and the ones that you suggested, the ones with a

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.180
two-thousand-gon here, all the fair dice in our families always had an even number of faces, okay?

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.599
So now here's a question. Is that, well there isn't because I proved there isn't, is there a fair

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.139
five-sided die? Well, our theorem says no, but I'm gonna build one for you in the air. You know what a Toblerone is?

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.439
They're pretty good. They are good. So if I had a Toblerone, if I threw it up in the air

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.619
and it landed on the floor, any of those three sides is equally likely. That's certainly true. Now suppose

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.320
we start eating it, and it gets thinner and thinner

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.700
until it's a thin

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.479
triangular coin, right? I've just eaten until it's just. Now, it never is going to land on these edges,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.319
but it could land here or here. That's a two-sided thing.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.970
Okay, so it started out as a three sided thing. Now, by continuity,

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:42.309
there's some place, it has to be, where the chance of these three is the same as the chance of these two,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.329
and that would be a fair five-sided die. Now what's wrong with that argument? Why does that argument,

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.170
you know, not contradict our theorem? How much chocolate you would have to eat depends on what kind of surface

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.719
you're throwing the die on. If I was throwing the Toblerone up in the air and catching it in my hand,

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.830
that's one scenario.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.160
If I'm dropping it in sand or if I'm dropping it on a table

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.469
so that it bounces, those are all very different

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.470
physics, and very different dynamics. And how much chocolate you would have to eat in order to make a fair

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.070
five-sided die would depend on the dynamics.

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.540
Brady: "Mathematically, even in an abstract world of mathematics, that dice is not is not fair?"

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.140
Is not, well, it's not, it, you see, so so so suppose,

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.060
let me try to, let me try to, I'll answer with one more, one more example.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.420
How thick does a coin have to be so that it has probability a third of landing on its edge?

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.640
Okay? Obviously, if the coin is very very thick so it's a cylinder,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.550
well, it always lands on its edge. And if the coin is very very thin, it never lands on its edge, or almost never, and then it's

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:55.150
fifty-fifty. So how thick does a coin have to be so that it has probability a third of landing here,

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.250
or here, or here. Well, by the argument I gave, you know, there's some point in between

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.550
where it's true. Now, you might think, well, suppose

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.889
I make the surface area of

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.369
the band, of the edge, equal to the surface area of this face equal to the surface area of this face.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.170
Maybe that's the right answer. When you cut broom handles to that thickness, it doesn't work.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.509
It has to do with the dynamics and the physics in a rather complicated way,

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:29.650
you could just see that. And, the argument that does work, take the thick coin, okay, embed it in a sphere,

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.979
so there's a unique sphere with the center of gravity of the coin in the middle of the sphere, and imagine that that sphere

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.300
hits the table at a random point on its surface, okay?

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.840
And then put any point on the surface, and then let the coin settle down to wherever it settles down. You want the area

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.059
of the three spherical caps, this cap, this cap and the cap around the edge, you want those

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:59.320
spherical areas to be equal. And that, it's quite a different calculation. That seems to be the answer, in practice.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.460
Actually doing the physics nobody's ever succeeded. It's pretty hard physics problem. So physics has to come in, and,

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.469
I'm sure that if we actually tried it,

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.900
it would matter if the thick coin lands in the hand, or bounces on a table,

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.020
or it bounces on glass, or bounces on a rug, the thicknesses would probably change.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.560
Brady: "You're a mathematician. You're in a statistics department. You're a math guy."

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.220
Yeah.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.200
Brady: "Yet whenever I'm talking to you,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.500
"I can never quite tell where the boundary is between thinking purely

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.868
"mathematical in the abstraction in a perfect world, and in a real world where, you know,

00:06:35.868 --> 00:06:39.920
"carpet is coarse and, and dice wear away, and you have to drill holes."

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:47.000
Well, that's, that's applied mathematics and applied statistics, and that's what makes us happy. That is, it's not only beautiful math,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.800
it actually says something about the world. And, the, it comes back.

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:53.328
Once you look at the world, you think, oh my God,

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:57.559
I cleaned that problem up to make me able to do the math, it's completely unrealistic.

00:06:57.989 --> 00:07:02.239
Maybe I can go back and make it a little bit more realistic, in this trade-off between

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:04.849
actually throwing dice, or,

00:07:05.429 --> 00:07:11.719
you know, working in a casino and, and doing the math, and doing group theory is what makes me happy.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.900
Brady: "It's sort of imperfect math, though, isn't it?

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.800
It's like you, you come up with some perfect math, and then you say, but that's not gonna work."

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.160
Right, but sometimes the math is very robust, and then that's the best.

00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:30.439
That's, sometimes the math works wonderfully well, and, but, and you just, we have to live with that.

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:35.328
Many of my colleagues don't want to hear about the real world.

00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:38.238
And, and some of my

00:07:39.269 --> 00:07:45.679
friends that work in casinos couldn't care less about the math. Don't tell me about all of that stuff. You know, what's the bottom line?

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:48.618
Well, both parts of it make me happy.
