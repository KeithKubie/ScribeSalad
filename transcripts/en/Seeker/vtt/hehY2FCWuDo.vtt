00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.330
Why is it when I fall asleep I get all twitchy?

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:03.330
Am I dying?!

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.540
Am I trying to escape?

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:12.360
Are ghosts tickling me?!

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.070
You know when someone next to you is falling
asleep, and they twitch?

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.190
Or when YOU'RE going to sleep and you feel
that falling sensation…

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.400
It's a thing, and it's normal.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.650
Humans twitch involuntarily as they're moving
from consciousness into unconsciousness -- called

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.150
the hypnogogic state.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.550
60-70 percent of people have these twitches,
but they usually don't remember actually having

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.750
them, because they're asleep!

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.030
That makes them really difficult to study,
but that doesn't stop sleep scientists!

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.059
Science refers to sleep twitching as myoclonus
(my-AH-klen-us), and the actual twitch itself

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.120
is called a hypnagogic jerk.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.120
There's no sleep switch in the brain.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.300
When you're awake, your conscious brain is
in control, and as you fall asleep, the unconscious

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.129
processes are taking over.

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.789
Like a shift change at a factory, the handoff
has lots of little things that have to go

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.359
right for the brain allow sleep to set in.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.880
Two parts of the middle of the brain handle
this transition, the reticular activating

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.770
system (RAS), and the ventrolateral preoptic
nucleus (VLPO).

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.610
They're in the middle of the brain, next to
each other, right behind the eyes.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.520
The RAS handles awakeness and the transition
to sleep.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.950
The VLPO controls you when you ARE asleep.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.780
The RAS and the VLPO are the factories handing
off to each other, in my earlier analogy.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.869
During this transition, the brain stops sending
out serotonin.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.369
You've probably heard of that chemical, serotonin
is what helps keep us happy, low levels of

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.250
serotonin are an indicator depression.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.710
But, serotonin ALSO helps us control our large
muscles -- the ones in our arms, and legs

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.649
so we don't move too much -- but serotonin
doesn't control tiny muscles in our wrists,

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:45.820
eyes and lips.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.260
90 minutes into sleep, two neurotransmitters
GABA and glycine, work together to paralyze

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.890
you so you don't get up and run around in
real life… but during that waking-sleeping

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.540
handoff you're not there yet.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.049
So, one hypothesis says the twitches come
because you're starting to dream, but aren't

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.409
fully paralyzed.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.230
Your RAS is struggling with the VLPO, the
serotonin levels are dropping, body processes

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.760
are being handed over, and the hypnagogic
jerk is a symptom of misfiring nerves as these

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.040
two fight it out.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.200
An evolutionary hypothesis says this was a
way to wake our primate ancestors before they

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.010
fell out of a tree -- because the jerk, also
known as a sleep start, causes muscles to

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.010
react quickly.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.310
In the end, we're not EXACTLY sure what's
happening.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.060
But we DO know, that severe twitches CAN be
a sign of Parkinson's or Alzheimer's, the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.340
result of a brain injury, nerve damage or
fibromyalgia, but that's usually if it's a

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.790
lot of SERIOUS twitching.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.390
A new study in Current Biology says the twitches
help baby's brains learn how to move their

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.860
limbs more accurately.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.870
They found the brain activity of anaesthetised
rats was more vigorous during sleep movement

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.970
than during actual, awake movement!

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.849
The researchers determined it was the brain
practicing and learning how to make their

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:04.849
limbs move properly.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.200
So maybe these twitches are a holdover?

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.200
Who knows.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.319
More research is needed for sure.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.880
Did you ever twitch so hard you woke up?!

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:29.180
Sometimes I remember my twitches, it's weird.
