00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.410
I'm Hyunse.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.250
I'm working for the business
development team in Korea.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.710
And today I'm here
to talk about how

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.570
to go global in a
successful manner.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.300
And I'm going to walk through
the best practices that

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.740
is important to take
to global market.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.980
So this is the agenda today.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.610
I'm going to begin with
tips for global entry

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.680
and share some success
stories of actual developers

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.830
that really work
closely with us.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.570
And at the end I will
conclude talking little bit

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.630
about the emerging trends around
the globe in the mobile world.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.630
So today we're living
in a truly mobile world.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.120
As mentioned in
previous presentations,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.050
Google Play is a
truly global market.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.340
Countries shaded
in blue represents

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.830
countries that has the largest
install base around the world.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.860
Countries with the dollar
sign are the countries

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.740
that represent the
largest revenue

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.090
markets around the world.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.260
Revenue-wise, Korea, Japan,
and US is the largest,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.240
and it is constantly
growing at this moment.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.520
Also email is growing
extremely fast

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.630
with Germany, United
Kingdom, Spain, and France

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.440
leading the growth.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.360
So looking at the global
market, the question

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.370
will be what is needed in
order to successfully enter

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.200
the global market?

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.300
There are three
important aspects

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.580
that you need to
consider when you're

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.630
thinking about
international expansion.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.680
You need to acquire
the right users first.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.960
Engage with them to make them
feel that they are loved.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.000
And retain them to make
them stay and not leave.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.070
In order to achieve
this though, you

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.400
need to first know
your target audience

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.440
that you are targeting.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.410
So what do I mean by
know the audience?

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.870
These three questions
are the questions

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.440
that you want to ask
during the preparation

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.000
of your global strategy.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.470
Users use different
devices in different times,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.070
enjoying different
content varying by region.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.580
It is important to know
what mobile device they use,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.540
when they use the
devices, and how

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.050
they use the devices
with what content.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.510
In the Western
region, people tend

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.020
to use their mobile
devices sitting down.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.360
And what I mean by sitting down,
you'll know if the next slide,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.970
but when they are
not on the move.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.560
In the US, for
example, mobile devices

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.990
are used mostly at home, on
your couch, after dinner.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.850
Tablets are actually used more
in the US, in the EMEA markets,

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.900
compared to APAC
because of this reason.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.430
Now this is APAC.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.350
This is a typical,
everyday commuting scene

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.620
in Korea and Japan.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.610
You may have noticed that
everyone's head is looking

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.290
down, looking into
their smart phones.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.610
There is this funny story
about the subway in Korea.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.070
There were a lot of
advertising agencies

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.880
that actually had ads
on ceilings of subways.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.010
But after the launch of smart
phones in Korea, a lot of them

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.190
closed down, because
no one looked up.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.830
So smart phones are
very heavily used

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.030
on the move in the APAC regions.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.410
Contents are very
different also.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.500
I want you to take a
close look at these games

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.756
before I move on
to the next slide.

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:43.880
There's some famous titles.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.570
In the US, Clash
of Clans, Heyday.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.590
Germany, we see a
game from Kabam.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.640
These are games in
the APAC region.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.420
Now in Korea gamers
tend to enjoy

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.990
3D, cartoonish, realistic,
online, heavy action,

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.810
multiplayer games.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.160
And gamers are mostly
composed of core users.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.720
In Japan you see
a lot of dragons,

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.400
you see a lot of anime,
and they're mostly

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.399
composed of hybrid genres.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:21.010
Now after knowing
your audience, you

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.640
are now prepared to
enter the global stage.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.800
I'm going to take you through
this journey, step by step.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.210
The first thing you want
to do is acquire your users

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.130
by letting the users know that
you really care about them.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.720
When thinking about
international expansion,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.050
it is very important to keep the
APK size as small as you can.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.350
The smaller the
size, more likely

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.420
the chance for the user to
download your app or your game.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.650
Well, in Korea, you can download
one gigabyte in 30 seconds.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.140
But if you think about
Southeast Asian countries,

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.840
it actually takes about
five to 10 minutes

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.840
to download an APK
smaller than 50 megabytes.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.260
So keep your size
small if you're

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.240
thinking of global expansion.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.590
The next thing that
you want to think about

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.390
is designing your icons.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.120
Designing icons that stand out,
that is appealing to the users

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.130
is extremely important.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.900
Because on the Play
Store, remember

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.080
that the first impression of the
users towards your app or game

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.820
is through the icons.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.450
Some developers actually
use our Developer Console

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.160
and have different
icons by region,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.580
trying to match with the local
tastes as much as possible.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.880
So this is Eternity Warriors
Three by Glu Mobile.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:58.520
On the left-- yes, on the left--
is the icon used in Korea,

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.780
and on the right is the icon
used in the United States.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.040
I talk to the Country
Director of Glu Mobile

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.300
and asked him why did you use
a female character for Korea,

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.800
for your icon.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.030
And his answer was, after
studying the Korean gaming

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:20.080
market, he realized that
it is important to target

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.640
the high ARPU male
gamers of Korea that

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.130
enjoy playing female
characters over male.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.260
Upon launch, it
was able to acquire

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.470
a lot of hardcore gamers, which
brought a successful launch

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.280
in Korea for Eternity
Warriors Three.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.520
In addition to icons,
you need to make

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.520
the titles relevant
to the local audience.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.240
This is an example of a
game called Ace Fishing Wild

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.100
Catch developed by Come
To Us, a Korean developer.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.420
The Korean title actually
doesn't mean Ace Fishing Wild

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.980
Catch.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:03.220
Instead, if I translate it, it
translate into God of Fishing,

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.290
which is not really appealing
to the Western markets.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.360
God of Fishing, I mean-- But
if I translate Ace Fishing Wild

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.490
Catch back into Korean,
it doesn't make any sense.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.500
So it is really important
to make the titles right

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.700
for the local audience
that you are targeting.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.120
Screenshots are
very important also.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.790
It is important
to localize them,

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:34.290
and users, especially in APAC,
do not like unlocalized assets.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.240
It actually makes them move
away from the apps details page,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.960
the moment they realize
that the screenshots are not

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.420
localizing to their language.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.910
These are screenshots of a
trends curation app called

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.610
Vingle, and they did a great
job in actually localizing

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.610
their screenshots across
different regions.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.130
For games.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:03.020
These are screenshots of
popular games in Korea, Japan,

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.680
and in the US.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.850
For Korea and Japan,
developers tend

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.430
to use screenshots
with characters and art

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.110
that are very distinct
and very stylized.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.780
In the Western market,
characters and visuals

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:23.000
are more realistic compared
to that of Korea and Japan.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.810
Now if you take all
these steps and are

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.310
ready for the global
launch, the Google Play Team

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.409
is here for you to expose your
global content through our Play

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.340
Stores across regions.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.570
What you see now are the
Play Stores in Japan, Korea,

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.330
and in the United States.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.919
We are here to
help you to acquire

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:46.370
real users all around the world.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.780
Now once you successfully
acquired your users,

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.320
it is time to engage with them.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.730
You need to know your
users that you've

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.870
acquired in order to do so.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.150
In Korea and Japan,
pre-registration

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.910
is a very popular way to
engage users before launch.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.410
So what you do is, if a user
registers before launch,

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.720
they will receive a
small, in-app gift,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.300
once the game or
app is launched.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.010
Now according to the
developers in Asia, this tool

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.232
is the most powerful tool to
get the user into action, even

00:09:22.232 --> 00:09:22.815
before launch.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.580
When designing a game
or an app, you also

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.200
need to think about
the different UIs

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.790
that different regions like.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:37.150
In Japan, for example,
what you see on the left,

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:41.720
there is a lot of information
crammed into one screen.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.380
However, contents that
are popular in the West,

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.770
has a much more simpler UI, and
is much more straightforward.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:52.680
Having the correct UI design for
the target market will be also

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.280
a very important aspect in
keeping the users from leaving,

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.960
once they install
your game or an app.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.800
When you localize, you
need to be very careful,

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.150
and be very accurate.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:11.726
If you take a look at
the Korean at the top,

00:10:11.726 --> 00:10:13.130
it looks pretty much the same.

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.255
Circles, squares.

00:10:14.255 --> 00:10:14.755
Right?

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.970
But there is a big
error in the line break.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.980
So if I write this
out in English,

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.470
hi my name is Mic hael.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:34.060
So the line break is right
in the middle of Michael,

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.580
which can be very disturbing
to the Korean users.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.970
And especially in APAC users are
very sensitive about language.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.260
So it is very important
to localize accurately,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:50.250
to make the users feel
that they're being loved.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.700
And [? Broheme ?]
mentioned this,

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.040
pricing is also very important.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:58.420
The $0.99 is for the
dollar, the Euro.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.425
But in Korea and Japan,
it all ends with a zero.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.960
Regarding monetization
of games, it

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.030
is also very different
across regions.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.480
In the Western markets,
users tend to use more money.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.510
On in-app purchases, in
speeding up progress,

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.580
such as building buildings
and upgrading them.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.410
This is a little
different in APAC, though.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:28.170
Gamers in APAC spend the most
money in the Gotcha System.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:32.140
Does anyone not know
what a Gotcha System is?

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.000
OK.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.780
It is a very popular in-app
tactic that the APAC users use.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.930
Basically, it's
like a lucky draw.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.400
Through this lucky draw,
you upgrade your characters,

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.790
you get equipment, you get
five star rated shields,

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:49.790
through this lucky draw.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.180
And this is the most
popular in-app tactic,

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:58.020
and the most popular in-app
that the APAC users actually

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.410
use money on.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.880
So now that you have
the users engaged,

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.670
your next step is to
think about retention.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:12.250
You have your users in action,
and you don't want your users

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.340
to stop their action and leave.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.410
Globally successful developers
provide customer service

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.200
in languages that they support
within their game or app.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.840
This is very important
since it connects

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.920
to your rating on the Play
Store which [? Broheme ?] just

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.460
showed you.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.640
And listening to user feedback
of the global audience

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.880
actually teaches developers
a lot of new information.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.730
Making them able
to provide the best

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:45.680
service for the
regional audience.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:50.550
Notifications are powerful
tools in user retention.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:54.170
It is important to design
events and notify users

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.940
so that they are constantly
being entertained.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.330
Korean developers for example,
have events and updates

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.321
once to twice every week,
in order to keep the users

00:13:05.321 --> 00:13:05.820
entertained.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.150
But when you design your events,
you need to be very careful.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.614
You need to make the events
relevant to the audience

00:13:14.614 --> 00:13:15.530
that you're targeting.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.980
Valentine's Day, for example,
as you look in the screen,

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.320
it's a screenshot from
Badland, developed by Frogmind,

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.170
was used as a theme of their
map during Valentine's Day.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:36.810
But this is not a big day
in APAC, compared to the US.

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.590
So seasonal events tend to work
well in the Western regions,

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.920
but in the APAC regions,
it's a different story.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:47.670
In Japan, for example,
collaboration with strong IPs

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:53.440
is the most popular method of
events within games and apps.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.710
Clash of Clans,
when it got popular,

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.870
it had a collaboration
with Puzzle and Dragons.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.710
And Puzzle and
Dragons is actually

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.760
collaborating with
Dragon Ball, which

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.920
is the biggest anime
franchise in Japan.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:13.450
In Korea, local celebrities
are actually used on events.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:16.180
There's this game
called Legion of Heroes

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.320
by-- it's a very core
MORPG game, developed

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.350
by Nexon Company.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.060
They used actual
popular celebrities

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.670
and made in-game
characters of them.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:30.310
Again, targeting the
high ARPU male gamers

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:32.700
that enjoy using female
characters for game play.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:43.510
So now I'm going to talk about
a little about success cases

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:47.580
from Korea, that
actually was successful

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.540
in the global market.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.248
The developers that
I'm about to show you

00:14:50.248 --> 00:14:52.910
are developers that
we have been working

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.040
very closely in the Korea team.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.220
So this app is called Vingle.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.530
I showed you this app
for the localization

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.000
part in screenshots.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.530
What is great about
this app is that allowed

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:13.990
its global success was following
the Android design guidelines.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:17.840
They use Action Bar
Navigation Drawer, and tabs,

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.810
making it easy for the
global audience that

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.360
use Android to use this app.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.320
Currently Vingle is rated
4.8 from the global users.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:32.930
And the users are constantly
growing at this moment.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.550
The second app I
want to talk about

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:38.080
is an app called Polaris Office.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.180
This is an app that allows
users to edit office documents

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.045
on your tablet or on
your mobile phone.

00:15:45.585 --> 00:15:47.890
Not only they follow
the design guidelines,

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.637
but they also use a
subscription model

00:15:49.637 --> 00:15:50.970
that [? Broheme ?] talked about.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:54.730
And they're actually constantly
generating revenue every month

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.560
for the premium
version for service.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.310
They currently have two
million users, worldwide,

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.340
and 90% of the
users are overseas.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.900
For games, this is a game
called Summoners War, which

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.380
was developed by a Korean
developer, Come to Us.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.290
This game has around 3.7
current users at this moment,

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:20.380
and it's mostly composed
of users outside of Korea.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:24.410
They're holding regional events,
that I mentioned in my session.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.150
In-game for local users
in different areas.

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:30.350
They're providing customer
support in six languages.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:34.170
And they're engaging with users
through local communities.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.480
More than 60% of the
revenue currently

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.560
is generated by this game
is happening overseas.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.640
So I walk through the journey
of how to go to global.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.790
And I showed you
some case studies

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:51.220
of successful global entry.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:53.950
Before I wrap up, I would like
to talk about some emerging

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.340
trends in the mobile world.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.070
Mobile devices are
not phones anymore.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.930
They are the ultimate tool
for high quality entertainment

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:06.420
content.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.220
The higher the
quality, the better

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.450
chance of you having
real users that

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.680
matter all around the world.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.130
Korea developers these days,
are using the mobile devices

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.270
to provide stunning
games of high quality.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:25.150
On the left side you see
a high quality MORPG game,

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.280
and on the right a baseball
game, that is close to real

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.300
and is using actual
baseball players in Korea.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:38.380
Users today are always
connected everywhere.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.780
Engagement with the users as
a developer is also important,

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.320
but engagement among
users is becoming

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.940
a key trend in the mobile world.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:53.240
For games, players engage by
playing together with friends.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.450
And for apps, users see
each other's activities,

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.680
what they're doing on their app.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.180
Contents that involve
users within the content,

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.170
are growing fast all
around the world.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.240
Connecting from
the previous slide,

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.480
it is important to keep
the users engaged even more

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.432
outside of the game or
app through empowering

00:18:16.432 --> 00:18:17.140
your communities.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.310
And if you have a
chance, don't hesitate

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.750
to go beyond the digital world.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.230
Create a franchise
just like what

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.210
Gung Ho did for Puzzle
and Dragons, which

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.030
is the picture at the top.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.060
And like what Rovio
did with Angry Birds.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.890
Angry Birds is actually very
popular the licensing business

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.780
in Korea, and it's trying
to expand into Japan

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.070
also, at this moment.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:49.220
So whenever you're ready, or
have questions regarding APAC.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.920
Don't hesitate to
reach out to our teams.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.600

Japan, led by Yoshi,
Korea, led by my boss, KH.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:04.700
And traditional Chinese
markets led by Kevin in Taiwan.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.280
Here today we have
teams from Mountain View

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.010

expand into those territories.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:13.910

in the international world.

That's all I have for today.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.410
Thank you for listening.
