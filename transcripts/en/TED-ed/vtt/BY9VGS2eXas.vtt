00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:18.533
In society, we have to follow laws that maintain order.

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:22.251
Did you know all chemical matter follows certain laws as well?

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:26.250
In fact, we can describe those laws by looking at relationships.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.282
Some easy laws to begin with are the ones that govern the gases.

00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:36.182
Back in 1662, Robert Boyle realized that gases had an interesting response

00:00:36.182 --> 00:00:39.350
when he put them into containers and changed their volume.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.751
Take an empty bottle and put the cap on it, closing that container.

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:45.549
Now squeeze your bottle, and what happens?

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:50.751
The pressure inside the bottle increases when the size of the container decreases.

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:55.283
You can only crush that container so much until the gases inside push back on your hand.

00:00:55.283 --> 00:01:00.549
This is called an inverse proportion, and it changes at the same rate for every gas.

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:05.917
Boyle's law allows chemists to predict the volume of any gas at any given pressure

00:01:05.917 --> 00:01:09.167
because the relationship is always the same.

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:14.982
In 1780, Jacques Charles noticed a different relationship between gases and their temperature.

00:01:14.982 --> 00:01:18.086
If you've ever seen a hot-air balloon, you've seen this law in action.

00:01:18.086 --> 00:01:20.583
When the ballons are laid out, they're totally flat.

00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:26.815
Instead of blowing the balloon up like a party balloon, they use a giant flame to heat the air inside that envelope.

00:01:26.815 --> 00:01:31.433
As the air is heated up, the balloon begins to inflate as the gas volume increases.

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:35.283
The hotter the gas becomes, the larger the volume, and that's Charles' law.

00:01:35.283 --> 00:01:38.181
Notice this law is different from Boyle's.

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:40.299
Charles' law is a direct relationship.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.216
As the temperature increases, the volume increases as well.

00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:46.699
The third law is also easily demonstrated.

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:49.849
When you're blowing up party balloons, the volume increases.

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:55.000
As you are blowing, you're forcing more and more gas particles into the balloon from your lungs.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.754
This causes the balloon volume to increase. This is Avogadro's law in action.

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:04.054
As the number of particles of gas added to a container are increased,

00:02:04.054 --> 00:02:05.989
the volume will increase as well.

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:10.022
If you add too many particles, well, you know what happens next.

00:02:10.022 --> 00:02:14.489
Laws are everywhere, even in the tiniest particles of gas.

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.388
If you squeeze them, the pressure will increase as the particles are pushed together.

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:22.371
Low volume means a high pressure because those particles push back.

00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:28.287
As the temperature increases, gases move away from one another, and the volume increases as well.

00:02:28.287 --> 00:02:33.323
Finally, if you add gas to a closed container, that container's volume will expand.

00:02:33.323 --> 00:02:38.355
But be careful not to add too much, because otherwise you could end up with a burst balloon.
