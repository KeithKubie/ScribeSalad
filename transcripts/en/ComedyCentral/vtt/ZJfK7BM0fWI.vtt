- This is delicious,
Mrs. Cramblin.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.222
- I know it's terrible, honey,
but thank you.

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:04.557
- No, he said it was delicious.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.759
- Oh, Trevor, do you wanna
join us for Sunday dinner?

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:08.361
- [sucks teeth] No can do.

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:10.830
- Trevor, your mother
invited you to sit down.

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:12.999
Sit down.
- Hey, uh, Jerry,

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:16.002
why don't--why don't you
eat my ass?

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:18.104
- Rude.

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:19.906
- What is he still doing
in the house?

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.040
I thought he moved
into the house

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:22.742
with, like, 15 of his friends.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:24.310
- It didn't work out.

00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:27.647
They turned out all
to be backstabbers and liars.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.881
All 15 of them.

00:02:28.914 --> 00:02:30.716
They were nasty to him.

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:32.251
- Boy needs a job.
- Jerry.

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:34.687
- He got fired from Le Shish?
- My dad got him that job.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.922
- It wasn't his fault.

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:37.323
They were nasty to him.

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.258
They wouldn't let him choose
what time he came in.

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:40.860
- So he just didn't show up,
is what you're saying?

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:45.531
- Honestly, he has to sleep in
or he'll lose his voice.

00:02:45.564 --> 00:02:48.868
Besides, he doesn't have time
for a job.

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:51.571
He's very busy with Rochu.

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:53.172
- What is Rochu?

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:55.875
- Rochu is an Ultra Beast
Trevor created.

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:58.244
Look at the beautiful
pictures he makes.

00:02:58.277 --> 00:03:00.513
- Mom, don't put that
on the fridge!

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:02.949
- The details are fantastic,
Chrissy.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:07.320
Now, Rochu is the king
of the Banglo people.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:10.923
And he defeated Malgor
in the Battle of Light.

00:03:10.956 --> 00:03:13.025
- Oh.
- He's a Lich Priest.

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:14.160
Uh--is that how
you say it, Jerry?

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:16.162
Am I--Lich--Lich Priest?

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:17.363
- I don't freakin' know.

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:19.098
It's a bunch of cartoons
with their dicks out.

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:20.800
- Jerry!
- They are, Sue.

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.568
Some artist.
Asked him to draw

00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:24.604
a picture of his mother and me
in Wings jerseys,

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:27.373
he gives me a freakin'
drippin' hog.

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:30.042
- Chrissy, you should see
the details on that hog.

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:32.678
It's as if he's seen it.

00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.682
