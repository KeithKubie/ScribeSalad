00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
success of their children we see that
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.200

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.660
education of their children results are
significantly better and it's not only

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670
significantly better and it's not only
 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.520
significantly better and it's not only
in terms of the academic performance of

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530
in terms of the academic performance of
 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.380
in terms of the academic performance of
students but it's also in terms of the

role involvement is very important we

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
role involvement is very important we
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.820
role involvement is very important we
also see that that parental involvement

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830
also see that that parental involvement
 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.510
also see that that parental involvement
isn't about having an academic degree as

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520

go wrong and we can see those kids

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270
go wrong and we can see those kids
 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.180
go wrong and we can see those kids
actually having a significantly higher

don't need to improve but in fact the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180
don't need to improve but in fact the
 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.570

what you can't measure so the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270
what you can't measure so the
 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.970
what you can't measure so the
measurement framework is really really

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980
measurement framework is really really
 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.790

critically important but we also do see

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800
critically important but we also do see
 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.650

instruments that actually help us

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110
instruments that actually help us
 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.750
instruments that actually help us
improve education and that's true even

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760
improve education and that's true even
 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.760
improve education and that's true even
at the level of teachers you know you

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770
at the level of teachers you know you
 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.220
at the level of teachers you know you
can't evaluate teachers on the basis of

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230
can't evaluate teachers on the basis of
 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.690
can't evaluate teachers on the basis of
student learning outcomes it's one

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700
student learning outcomes it's one
 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.520
student learning outcomes it's one
perspective but you also need to bring

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530
perspective but you also need to bring
 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.229
perspective but you also need to bring
in other perspectives that value the

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239
in other perspectives that value the
 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.330
in other perspectives that value the
broader responsibilities that their

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340
broader responsibilities that their
 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.310
broader responsibilities that their
teachers have so looking at outcomes
