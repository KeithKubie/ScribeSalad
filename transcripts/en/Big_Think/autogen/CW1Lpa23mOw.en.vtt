use it in a much more positive sense I

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170

persuasive and powerful evidence you

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230
persuasive and powerful evidence you
 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.149
persuasive and powerful evidence you
compare the the genes of animals and

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159

resemblance is a tree a branching tree

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589
resemblance is a tree a branching tree
 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.039
resemblance is a tree a branching tree
and that branching tree could only be a

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049

evidence is there the geographical

evidence is there the geographical
 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.570
evidence is there the geographical
distribution of animals and plants on

where we should expect them to be if

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680
where we should expect them to be if
 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.030
where we should expect them to be if
evolution were a fact
