MARY PILON: My
name is Mary Pilon.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.898
I'm the author of "The
Monopolist," which

00:00:02.898 --> 00:00:05.130
just came out in February.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.900
I previously worked
as a sports reporter

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.440
at "The New York Times"
and before that wrote

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.040
about money and Wall Street
at "The Wall Street Journal."

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.600
So mostly now, I write
about business, sports,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.051
kind the intersection of all.

00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:16.800
But also along the
way, I've learned a lot

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.490
about board games, which is what
I'm here to talk to you guys

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.620
about today.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.270
So this is Monopoly.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.272
Now, most people are very
familiar with the game.

00:00:25.272 --> 00:00:26.730
It's made by Parker
Brothers, which

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.870
in 1991 was acquired by Hasbro.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.570
This is the Monopoly board.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.330
You guys have probably
all played on it.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.965
There's Mr. monopoly, the
iconic little mustachioed

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:38.050
man with the
monocle and top hat,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.710
the little red
houses, green hotels.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.780
There are a lot of jokes in
the game industry about Parker

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.060
Brothers actually being
one of the biggest home

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.140
manufactures, hahaha.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.810
And the story for
years was that the game

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.560
was invented by this
man, Charles Darrow,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.990
who, during the darkest hours
of the Great Depression,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.080
he was down on his luck.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.309
He was unemployed.

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:58.850
And he goes into
his basement, and he

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.190
creates Monopoly to remind
his family of better times.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.129
He puts these Atlantic
City properties on it

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.530
because that is where
they had vacationed.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.820
He sells the game
to Parker Brothers.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.010
Here's a copy of his patent.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.300
If you look at, it's from 1935.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.300
It looks a lot like
the Monopoly game

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.520
that we play today in 2015.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.850
You can see the art is on there,
the properties, everything.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.780
A version of this story about
Darrow inventing the game

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.030
and selling it to
Parker Brothers

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.636
is still on versions
of Hasbro's website.

00:01:28.636 --> 00:01:30.260
Some people believe
that Darrow himself

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.635
was the inspiration for the
Mr. Monopoly character, which

00:01:32.635 --> 00:01:34.400
you see up there.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.130
Only problem with that story
is it's, like, not true.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.190
The Darrow Cinderella story,
which is still told today,

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.300
often, actually, it turns out
Monopoly had a history long

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.470
before that started
with a woman in 1904.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.130
This a Elizabeth J. Magie,
or Lizzie Magie, as she's

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.240
often known.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.220
She created a game that was
called The Landord's Game, soon

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.770
thereafter called The Monopoly
Game but its early players

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.090
in 1904, long before Parker
Brothers, long before Darrow.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.470
So who was she?

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.890
It turns out, Lizzie Magie was
a really interesting woman.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.600
This is a copy of her patent
she had received in 1893

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.230
for this typewriter gadget.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.330
She was a stenographer.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.210
She was a writer.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.640
She was a poet.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.900
She had appeared in some
theater productions.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.430
And then this news
clipping I love.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.140
She was a really
outspoken feminist.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.250
She had done this thing.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.290
It was around the
turn of the century.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.160
She called it the
slave girl stunt.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.660
And basically what she did is
she put herself up for auction

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.090
to the highest bidder
as a protest against how

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.020
women were paid at the time.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.360
And she likened how women
were treated to wage slavery.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.210
And it got a lot of
attention around the country.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.220
This was one of
many news clippings.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.599
So one of the questions I
had in researching her was,

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.140
how did a women like
this come about?

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.390
I mean, this is a century ago.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.790
And she would be pretty
outspoken by today's standards

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.280
but certainly by
then, that times.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.110
So, her father was James Magie.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.020
Now, James Magie was not just
an influential newspaper owner

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.780
of the time.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.060
He was around for the early
days the Republican Party.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.524
This is a picture of him.

00:03:03.524 --> 00:03:05.690
He had traveled with none
other than Abraham Lincoln

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.140
during the
Lincoln-Douglas debates.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.920
So he infuses a lot of these
values into his daughter.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.837
She this is a template from
one of her poetry books.

00:03:14.837 --> 00:03:16.920
And one of the things he
passes on to his daughter

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.850
is this book, "Progress and
Poverty" by Henry George.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.120
So most people today don't
know who Henry George was.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.620
Actually, some
Georges have shown up

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.161
to some of the book
events I've done,

00:03:26.161 --> 00:03:27.540
which has been really fun.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.130
Henry George-- I'm not going
to totally geek out on this,

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.160
but he believed in
single tax theory.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.990
That's this idea that if
we tax land and only land,

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.440
the middle class
has a better shot.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.960
And there are all of
these incredible news

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.440
accounts of him
packing out these halls

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.860
as a public speaker.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.330
And he ran for mayor of
New York City, actually,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.890
and came in second behind
a Tammany Hall candidate

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.870
but ahead of this
Teddy Roosevelt guy.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.370
So he wasn't some wingnut
of his time period.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.250
I mean, people were
really into him.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.320
And I kind of think
of him politically

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.937
as very much a reaction to the
Carnegies, the Rockefellers,

00:04:00.937 --> 00:04:02.770
this amount of wealth
that was being created

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.750
at the turn of the century
that this country hadn't

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.360
seen before.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.350
And there's a lot of
questioning about how

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.602
this should be distributed.

00:04:08.602 --> 00:04:10.560
And it's really fun to
read some of this stuff.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.839
I read "Progress and Poverty."

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:14.380
And also, the single
taxers sometimes

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.380
called themselves
anti-monopolists.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.494
And a lot of what
they're talking about

00:04:18.494 --> 00:04:19.910
could be ripped
from the headlines

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.020
today about income inequality,
wage distribution, things

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.190
like that.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.440
So anyway, this is her patent
for The Landlord's Game.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.670
She applies in 1903.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.841
She receives it in 1904.

00:04:29.841 --> 00:04:32.127
And you can see, if
you look at it closely,

00:04:32.127 --> 00:04:34.460
there's some things that you'd
recognize from a Monopoly

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.960
board.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.210
So she has Go To Jail on there.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.230
She has Public Park.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.340
The Georges were very
concerned with public land

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.470
and how it was used
and natural resources.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.700
But obviously cars weren't
as big of a deal in 1904,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.610
so hers does not
have cars on it.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.145
So after she patents it,
this game goes viral,

00:04:50.145 --> 00:04:51.830
but like
turn-of-the-century style.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.527
And it becomes a favorite
among left-wing intellectuals,

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:55.860
but especially in the Northeast.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.720
So [INAUDIBLE] of Rex Tugwell.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.200
Rex Tugwell was an
economist at Colombia.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.210
He later joined
FDR's brain trust.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.379
He played the game.

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:05.920
In the center you
have Ernest Angell,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.880
who was a national
chairman for the ACLU.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.480
He had played it
here in New York,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.460
I believe in the late
'20s, early '30s.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.080
If there are any New Yorker
fans or sports journalism fans,

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.490
Roger Angell is his son.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.900
Scott Bearing plays it.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.860
And Scott Nearing was
involved in a very famous

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.770
academic freedom
case at Wharton.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.184
He plays it there.

00:05:24.184 --> 00:05:25.850
And he's also, later
in life, considered

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.160
to be one of the founders
of the Green movement.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.201
And it's played heavily
in Arden, Delaware, which

00:05:30.201 --> 00:05:31.430
is this single-tax colony.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.600
It was a big summer
hangout for these people.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.080
The game was very popular.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.580
And one of the people who hung
out in Arden, Delaware, a lot

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.790
was Upton Sinclair.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.165
And this is like
a total tangent,

00:05:40.165 --> 00:05:42.580
but there's an amazing sex
scandal involving Upton

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.210
Sinclair at Arden, Delaware.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.580
And his cabin there was called
The Jungalow, clearly an homage

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.560
to "The Jungle."

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.797
Yeah, so this is kind
of like a freewheeling--

00:05:51.797 --> 00:05:53.380
I don't know if I'd
call them hippies,

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.150
because it predates that,
but kind of a freewheeling

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.230
group of folks.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.350
So anyway, in 1924 Lizzie
renews her patent for the game.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.220
And it's unclear how aware
she was of how this game was

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.880
being embraced and played.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.560
And people, when they
made their own games,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.812
they would localize it.

00:06:08.812 --> 00:06:10.020
So there were New York games.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.140
They were Boston games.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.960
There were Philly games.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.706
And one group that
really embraces it

00:06:14.706 --> 00:06:16.080
are the Quakers
of Atlantic City.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.840
This is a picture of a
Quaker Monopoly night, which

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.500
was very common at the time.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.030
And they make the board
like Atlantic City,

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.840
because that's where they live.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.350
That's the community they know.

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.529
And they make some key
changes to Monopoly

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:31.570
to make it more like the
game that we know today.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.280
So for example, in addition to
the Atlantic City properties,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.350
they put fixed
prices on the board.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.760
A realtor, actually, in
Atlantic City does that.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.792
They also originality
in Monopoly,

00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:44.000
in The Landlord's Game,
there's a lot more auctioning

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.610
with the game.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.940
So the noise of that
bothers the Quakers.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.650
Silence is a tenet
of their faith.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.550
So they decide, because
they're playing with children,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.620
they want to make it
simpler, to get rid of that.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.510
So now there's the fixed prices.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.809
What most people don't
realize-- how most people play

00:06:58.809 --> 00:07:00.850
Monopoly wrong is another
conversation we can get

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.600
into later, but usually
when you land on a property,

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.889
if you don't want to purchase
it, you put it up for auction.

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:07.930
That's actually the rule.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.304
But there was a
lot more of that.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.620
And then they also
corporate hotels.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.757
Around the Great
Depression, Atlantic City,

00:07:13.757 --> 00:07:15.590
if anybody's watched
Boardwalk Empire knows,

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.382
is was kind of the
place to be in the '20s.

00:07:17.382 --> 00:07:19.798
But during the Great Depression,
a lot of these big hotels

00:07:19.798 --> 00:07:20.410
were vacant.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.870
And some of the Quaker teachers
who were playing Monopoly

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.960
were staying in these
now-vacant hotels.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.420
So they incorporate
those into the game.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.710
So one of players who plays the
Atlantic City Quaker version

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.920
of the game is Charles Todd.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.984
And this is a copy of
the Charles Todd board.

00:07:34.984 --> 00:07:37.400
And as you look at this compared
with The Landlord's Game,

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.566
you're noticing that it
looks more and more and more

00:07:39.566 --> 00:07:40.655
like Monopoly today.

00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:42.180
It has the Atlantic
City properties.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.925
Some of the colors
are even the same.

00:07:43.925 --> 00:07:45.550
So Charles Todd plays
this game, and he

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.170
runs into two old friends
on the street, the Darrows.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.150
And he had gone to
school with Ester Darrow.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.307
And he and his wife, Olive,
invite the Darrows over

00:07:53.307 --> 00:07:54.640
for dinner and a Monopoly night.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.570
They say, come over.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:56.200
It'll be great.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.600
We're going to play this game.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.090
So the Darrows and the
Todds live in Philadelphia.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.130
And they play this game.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:03.460
And they have a great time.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.290
And Darrow asks
Todd, hey, would you

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.210
mind typing up the rules
for the game for me?

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.030
And Todd thinks this
is a little strange,

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.530
because imagine if
somebody asks you

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.680
for the rules for checkers
or chess or something

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.520
that had just been
kind of around.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.470
But his secretary
does it nonetheless.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.190
And Todd teaches
Darrow the game.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.580
And let's cut to Parker
Brothers for a minute.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.644
Parker Brothers in
the 1930s was a firm

00:08:26.644 --> 00:08:27.810
on the brink of destruction.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.700
It was a family-owned
firm that George Parker

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.309
had started as a teenager
in the 1800s, late 1880s,

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:35.360
if you want to be exact.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.590
And he is now an old man.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.450
You can see him there
sitting at his desk.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.003
And the balance
sheet is a disaster.

00:08:41.003 --> 00:08:41.669
They need a hit.

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:42.659
They need it quick.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:44.770
And his son-in-law,
Robert Barton,

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.510
who's second from
the left there,

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.960
had just taken over the firm.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.190
And he was a lawyer by training.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.410
He had no game marketing
experience, anything like that.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:58.730
So Barton, through his wife,
hears about this Monopoly game,

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.614
which Darrow is selling
at Wannamaker's.

00:09:00.614 --> 00:09:02.030
This is a picture
of Wannamaker's.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.120
Actually, if you
go to Philadelphia,

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.880
you can still go there.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.796
I think it's a Macy's.

00:09:04.796 --> 00:09:06.690
I'm not 110% sure.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.250
I'm getting some good nods.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.420
And side note on
Wannamaker's, that's actually

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.340
where the film "Mannequin"
was shot, which I thought

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.040
was amazing.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.050
So Darrow and Barton
strike up this deal.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:21.910
They meet in the
Flatiron Building,

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.627
which is where the
Parker showroom was.

00:09:23.627 --> 00:09:24.960
And this is a picture of Barton.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.710
It's a terrible photo
in terms of quality,

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.360
but he's much older
in that image.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.870
And he buys Darrow's
game for, we believe,

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.070
$7,000 plus residuals.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.530
And Monopoly becomes
this blockbuster hit.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.120
And I can't really stress enough
how no commercially sold game

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.070
had sold like Monopoly
had, let alone

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.329
during the Great Depression.

00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:46.370
And the thinking of the
game industry at the time

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.411
was, nobody's going to
want to play a real estate

00:09:48.411 --> 00:09:49.890
game or a finance game.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:50.880
It's too complicated.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.506
It's too wonky.

00:09:51.506 --> 00:09:54.005
And they're certainly not going
to want to play it at a time

00:09:54.005 --> 00:09:56.040
when nobody has either
of those things.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.970
And the Darrow story becomes a
big part of the marketing tale,

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.760
that this game actually came
from an unemployed guy himself.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.030
He's just like you.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.281
And they used this
to try and sell

00:10:07.281 --> 00:10:08.780
another game called
Bulls and Bears.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.570
And there's an
image of that there.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.790
And game designers
weren't really-- even now,

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.600
it wasn't like being
the author of a book

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.679
or the star of a film.

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:18.970
These were people that weren't
incorporating marketing.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.428
And Darrow, I think of, was
kind of one of the first people

00:10:21.428 --> 00:10:22.200
to do that.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.110
And Parker can't make
these sets fast enough.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.410
So they need tokens.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:28.990
Now, when the Quakers were
playing and early folk players,

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:32.100
they used earrings, buttons,
whatever was around.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.990
But Parker Brothers calls
on Daoust Manufacturing,

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.150
which was this
Chicago-based company that

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:38.919
made Crackerjack prizes.

00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:40.710
And the tokens-- a lot
of people have asked

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.670
me about like, what
does the top hat mean?

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.170
What does the dog mean?

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.954
And the truth is, as
far as we can tell,

00:10:45.954 --> 00:10:47.370
they were kind of
an afterthought.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.180
These are some of
the early tokens.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.710
And you can notice that
some have a little loop.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.710
That's because Daoust
made them as charms, often

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.230
for charm bracelets, and like
little different tchotchkes.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.170
So some of them, the molds
we believe were recycled.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:02.540
So for example, the iron, they
had made tokens for a flatiron

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.292
company in Chicago.

00:11:04.292 --> 00:11:06.750
And if you bought an iron, you
would get one of these, too.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.750
So they were kind
of an accident.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.500
But it's not long
before Parker and Barton

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.490
realize that they
have a problem, which

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.450
is that Darrow didn't
actually invent the game.

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.680
This thing was around
for 30 years before.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.500
And they start hearing
from people saying,

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.200
we have played this before.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.232
And so Barton writes
to Darrow and says,

00:11:24.232 --> 00:11:26.190
would you mind writing
up a history of the game

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.389
and your invention of it?

00:11:27.389 --> 00:11:28.930
And Darrow-- and
this letter exchange

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.780
is in the book--
kind of waffles.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.400
And he doesn't sign an
affidavit saying he invented it.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.090
And he doesn't give a
narrative or anything

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.950
about Charles Todd or having
learned the game before.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.111
And other people had tried
to sell the game on their own

00:11:43.111 --> 00:11:43.610
before.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:46.150
So this is Dan
Layman's Finance Game.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.650
Dan Layman had also played
the game as a Quaker game.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.160
You can see that it's very
similar with Community

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.190
Chest, a lot of the properties.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.190
And he had sold it.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.990
So Parker Brothers, once they
realized that this game wasn't

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.970
invented by Darrow,
goes about acquiring

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:00.080
all these other games.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.285
So there's finance.

00:12:01.285 --> 00:12:02.660
They had to meet
with Dan Layman.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.286
There's a game called Easy Money
that Milton Bradley is making.

00:12:05.286 --> 00:12:07.493
They get this kind of the
bizarre licensing agreement

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:08.035
there.

00:12:08.035 --> 00:12:10.740
A gentlemen in Texas had
made a game called Inflation,

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.340
and this game was
out quite a bit.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.270
But the Darrow creation
story perpetuated.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.660
And by now, the train
had left the station.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.120
It was everywhere.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.480
But Lizzie, she's pissed.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.254
So this is an
interview from 1936.

00:12:24.254 --> 00:12:26.670
This would have been kind of
at the height of the Monopoly

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.285
craze, right after Darrow
and the game were booming.

00:12:29.285 --> 00:12:31.910
So she gives this interview with
the "Washington Evening Star."

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:32.940
You can see her there.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.790
She's now an elderly woman
with gray hair and a bun.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.960
She's holding up her boards
and the Monopoly board.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.500
And if you read this, it says,
"but not for Ms. Phillips."

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.800
She had gotten married by then.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.930
"It is understood she
received $500 for her patent,

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.810
and she gets no royalties.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.486
Probably, if one counts lawyers,
printers, and patent office

00:12:50.486 --> 00:12:52.520
fees used up in
developing it, the game

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.630
has cost her more than
she made from it."

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.830
So in the end, the inventor
probably got nothing

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.940
or, according to
this, maybe lost.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.350
So why did the patent office
grant the Parker-Darrow group

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.630
its patent when Magie to had
two similar ones before it?

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.120
We don't know.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.440
Usually when you go and research
patent history, which is really

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.270
geeky stuff, there's
a thing called

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.000
the patent wrapper, which is
the information around a patent,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.250
a lot of documents.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.560
And the Monopoly,
the 1935 patent

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.650
that I showed you,
that patent wrapper has

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.220
been missing for, I believe,
at least 30 or 40 years.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.997
So as a researcher, you just hit
this wall, and you're like, ah,

00:13:28.997 --> 00:13:30.910
we'll never know!

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.110
So Magie and Darrow die.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.990
This is Darrow's obituary in
the "New York Times" hailing him

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.880
as an All-American hero
who had created this game.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.325
Lizzie Magie's obituary, you
have to look a lot harder for.

00:13:41.325 --> 00:13:41.825
It's tiny.

00:13:41.825 --> 00:13:43.970
It makes absolutely no
mention of Landlord's Game

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.750
or Monopoly or
anything like that.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.220
And for a long time, this
was all lost to history.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.380
So how do we know any of this?

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.810
We know this
totally by accident.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.390
And it is because of
this guy, Ralph Anspach.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:00.030
He was an economist living in
Berkeley in the early 1970s.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.520
He was a teacher as well.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.130
And he made a game
called Anti-Monopoly,

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:07.150
which, as its name implies,
is the opposite of Monopoly.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.610
And I think of it very much as
an homage to the early '70s,

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.830
because-- I don't even
know how to describe it.

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.900
Instead of getting
total control of things,

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.280
you're breaking them apart.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.340
And lawyers are the hero
of the game. [LAUGHTER]

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.810
So it's very much like an
homage to like Nader's Raiders

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:23.870
and like public
interest law at a time

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.760
when that was pretty hot.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.200
And Ralph was very concerned
with the OPEC oil cartels

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.130
and the monopolies of his time.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.780
And this was obviously a
moment in American history

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:34.990
of high cynicism.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.606
So it's not surprising
that his game took off.

00:14:37.606 --> 00:14:38.980
And then these
are some drawings.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.570
He and his two sons
kind of create this game

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.040
as a monopoly backwards.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:43.810
And it takes off.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:47.221
There's actually a really great
line in Patty Hearst's memoir

00:14:47.221 --> 00:14:48.970
where she buys her dad
a copy of the game,

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.390
which, if you know anything
about the Hearst family,

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:50.970
is juicy.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.020
So it's a countercultural hit.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.890
But he hears from
Parker Brothers' lawyers

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.470
really quickly saying, you
can't make Anti-Monopoly.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.240
But instead of
Ralph backing off--

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.336
and it turns out that
Parker Brothers at this time

00:15:03.336 --> 00:15:05.710
was reaching out to a lot of
people making spinoff games.

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:09.925
So there was a Spaceopoly
that received basically

00:15:09.925 --> 00:15:11.440
a Cease and Desist.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.330
And also, I thought
this was awesome.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.070
There was a priest making
a game called Theopoly,

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:18.640
who also heard from
Parker Brothers

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.096
and immediately backed down.

00:15:20.096 --> 00:15:21.470
But Ralph takes
a different tack.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.580
And he decides to fight it.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.900
And this kicks off a 10-year
long legal battle over Monopoly

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.580
versus Anti-Monopoly.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.140
And in the process of
researching his case,

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.520
and as the case
gets more attention,

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.280
he starts to unravel the
early history of the game.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.980
And he becomes a
detective obsessed

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.870
with telling the true story.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.760
And he starts to travel
and track down as many

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.176
of these early
players, people who

00:15:44.176 --> 00:15:47.740
had played the game before
1935, as he possibly can.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.710
And Lizzie Magie at
this point is long dead.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:50.950
So he finds her patent.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.340
But he knows that a lot
of his fate in court

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.530
hinges on connecting the
dots between that 1904

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:58.180
patent and the game that
Parker Brothers put out

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.680
in the mid-1930s.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.850
So he finds some of
these original players.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:04.590
This is Dan Layman, who had made
Finance, who is now a retired

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.420
guy living in Pasadena.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.170
And he finds Charles Todd.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.730
He finds all these
people and gets

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.791
them to do sworn depositions.

00:16:11.791 --> 00:16:14.040
And this looks like notes
from like organic chemistry,

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.581
but it's actually Ralph's notes
from trying to piece together

00:16:16.581 --> 00:16:19.370
some of these Quaker lineages
and who is related to who,

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.470
who is married to who,
who had played the game.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.555
And a lot of these players--
you have to remember,

00:16:23.555 --> 00:16:24.930
this is like 30
years of history,

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:27.650
so the Quakers-- and this
is them later testifying.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.071
They're obviously older now.

00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:31.320
They didn't know where the
game had come from, either,

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.653
because they had just played it.

00:16:32.653 --> 00:16:34.530
So by the time Todd
and these other people

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:35.992
were playing the
game, they didn't

00:16:35.992 --> 00:16:37.030
know who Lizzie Magie was.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.830
They weren't friends with her.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:38.538
They didn't know.

00:16:38.538 --> 00:16:40.040
It had kind of
spread organically.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.590
So he has to reverse
engineer the whole story.

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.910
So one of things that he
talks to Charles Todd about

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:45.870
is Marvin Gardens.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:49.300
Now remember, Charles Todd
is not from Atlantic City.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.320
He's from Philadelphia.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.320
He just learned it from
a friend who had played

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.362
that version of the game.

00:16:53.362 --> 00:16:55.903
So if you go to Atlantic City,
Marvin Gardens is spelled with

00:16:55.903 --> 00:16:57.895
an "-en," because it's
a combination of Margate

00:16:57.895 --> 00:16:59.260
and Ventnor.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.402
So that's on the
Atlantic City board,

00:17:01.402 --> 00:17:02.860
because the people
in Atlantic City

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.579
know how to spell the
neighborhood right.

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:07.145
But Todd is not from there.

00:17:07.145 --> 00:17:08.020
So he makes an error.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.619
He spells it with an "-in."

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:12.270
So that's Charles Todd's
board, Marvin Gardens-- oops.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.349
He made a spelling error.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:14.700
He's a Philadelphia guy.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.540
Now, one of the key
things in copycat cases

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.798
that lawyers and courts look at
is whether you copy an error.

00:17:20.798 --> 00:17:22.339
Because what are
the odds that you're

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:24.339
going to make the
exact same error twice.

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:27.180
So the Darrow board has
Marvin with an "-in."

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.602
Da-da-daa!

00:17:29.602 --> 00:17:31.696
And Charles Todd
later jokes that he

00:17:31.696 --> 00:17:34.070
believes this is one of the
most repeated spelling errors

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.890
in history.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:38.440
Because every Monopoly
board from 1935 on

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.676
has his spelling error.

00:17:39.676 --> 00:17:42.050
One of the other things that
comes up in the Anspach case

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:43.537
are the color groupings.

00:17:43.537 --> 00:17:45.120
And this is an earlier
Monopoly board.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.110
Actually, this was in
really beautiful shape.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:50.760
And a collector had
emailed me this photo.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.360
He had found it in his attic,
which one of the great things,

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.430
by the way, about
the book coming out

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.070
is that even after
the Anspach case,

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.519
like here we are
100 years later.

00:17:56.519 --> 00:17:58.060
People are still
finding these things

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.027
and now understand where
they're coming from.

00:18:01.027 --> 00:18:03.110
But you can see it definitely
has color groupings.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:05.330
And it says Monopoly just
clean across the top.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.920
So the idea that people weren't
calling it Monopoly, I mean,

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.060
this comes up in
the depositions.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.309
But they were calling it that.

00:18:10.309 --> 00:18:12.540
A lot of the distinctive
features were there.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.285
So Ralph starts talking
publicly about this history.

00:18:15.285 --> 00:18:17.160
And he starts referring
to it as the Monopoly

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.929
lie and this corporate scandal
and that Parker Brothers had

00:18:19.929 --> 00:18:21.220
erased this woman from history.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.000
And he's very vocal
about this, even

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.592
though litigation is going on.

00:18:24.592 --> 00:18:26.550
And he learns about this
Atlantic City Monopoly

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.010
tournament that's going on.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.620
And they're giving
out the Darrow cup.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:30.540
And he seethes.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.550
He thinks this is
outrageous, because Darrow

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:33.840
didn't originate the game.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.120
So he decides he's going
to sabotage the tournament.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.599
And this is an ad he takes out.

00:18:37.599 --> 00:18:39.640
He's going to have a Truth
about Monopoly lecture

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.740
next to where a lot of the press
that was covering the Monopoly

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.130
tournament was staying.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.020
So unfortunately,
Parker Brothers

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.360
catches wind of this
event, because he had

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.800
been advertising it, after all.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.133
And they rearrange the schedule.

00:18:51.133 --> 00:18:52.284
So basically nobody comes.

00:18:52.284 --> 00:18:54.450
But you wouldn't know by
looking at this photograph.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:55.857
Ralph looks pretty excited.

00:18:55.857 --> 00:18:56.690
But he's undeterred.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.189
There's actually a
bigger tournament

00:18:58.189 --> 00:19:01.090
taking place in Washington,
DC, soon thereafter.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.340
Now, because this case had
gotten lot of attention,

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.170
he heard from these
two college kids

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.740
at Cornell who were part
of the Ivy League Monopoly

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.290
Association, which was an
unsanctioned tournament.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.100
And they had also
published a "How

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.315
to Win a Monopoly" book that
had rattled a lot of people

00:19:15.315 --> 00:19:16.330
at Parker Brothers.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.720
So these college kids
reach out to Ralph and say,

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.750
we're in it to win it.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.150
We're with you on this crusade.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:25.080
We're going to sabotage this DC
Monopoly tournament with you.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.770
So what they do
is they go to DC,

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.950
and they slip like Truth
about Monopoly pamphlets

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.210
under people's dinner plates,
especially the journalists.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:33.921
So they're successful.

00:19:33.921 --> 00:19:35.170
And everybody starts laughing.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.020
It's great.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.700
So one of those college kids
is Jay Walker, the billionaire

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.242
founder of Priceline.com.

00:19:42.242 --> 00:19:44.620
And when Ralph originally
told me this story,

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.555
I thought Jay Walker is
such an ambiguous name.

00:19:47.555 --> 00:19:49.680
So of course I had to
contact him and be like, hey,

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.013
I'm fact-checking a story for
"The Wall Street Journal."

00:19:52.013 --> 00:19:54.780
Did you, like, sabotage
a Monopoly tournament

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.055
when you were in college?

00:19:56.055 --> 00:19:56.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.404
And Jay was like, oh, yeah.

00:19:58.404 --> 00:19:59.260
How's Ralph?

00:19:59.260 --> 00:19:59.969
Send him my best.

00:19:59.969 --> 00:20:01.010
And it totally check out.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.330
And I was like, that's insane.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.130
And then the other
author of this book--

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.340
you can see Jay-- I did
some serious like Amazon

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.860
and eBay squatting and finally
got a copy-- is Jeff Lehman.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.250
So Jeff Lehman was his
roommate at Cornell,

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.950
who ended up becoming
the president of Cornell

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.339
and actually came
to an event I did.

00:20:17.339 --> 00:20:19.380
So on the book tour, people
that are in the story

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.010
keep showing up.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:20.710
So it's kind of great.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.335
So when I did this
presentation at NYU,

00:20:22.335 --> 00:20:24.900
I was like, that guy
sabotaged the tournament.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.430
So anyway, meanwhile in
court, Parker Brothers

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:28.724
wins an injunction.

00:20:28.724 --> 00:20:30.390
And normally when you
win an injunction,

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:32.800
you take whatever merchandise
you're arguing about,

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.460
and you like throw it in
a warehouse or something.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.260
But Parker Brothers is so
confident they're going to win,

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.150
they decide to stage a
burial of Ralph's 40,000

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:42.224
Anti-Monopoly games.

00:20:42.224 --> 00:20:43.390
And they invite journalists.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:44.510
Like people covered this.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.090
This is a photo of those games
being buried in Minnesota.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:51.780
And at this point, this battle
has been going on for years.

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.990
His personal relationships
are really frayed.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:56.570
He's gone through
several lawyers.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.370
Litigation wasn't cheap then
as it obviously isn't now.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:01.890
So his finances-- I think he
had taken out maybe two if not

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:04.100
three mortgages at this point.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.380
He's at his wit's end.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.650
And he thinks he's
winning, actually.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.280
But Parker Brothers decides to
appeal to the Supreme Court.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.540
This is not good.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.350
Ralph's lawyer at
this point was a guy

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:17.137
named Carl Pearson, one-man
legal shop, basically.

00:21:17.137 --> 00:21:19.220
And the two of them were
working around the clock.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.250
And the amicus briefs in this
case are really fun to read,

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.410
because it's like a who's
who of corporate America.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.560
And the argument was
basically that if you

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.840
allow-- I'm really,
really paraphrasing here,

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.770
but that trademark law as
we know it will collapse

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:32.990
if you let Anti-Monopoly win.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:37.330
But the Supreme Court refuses to
hear the case, and Ralph wins.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.400
And he not only wins his
right to make Anti-Monopoly,

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.010
but he wins his right to talk
about the history and origins

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.830
openly.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.380
And the court
upholds his research

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.421
and that the game actually
originated with Lizzie

00:21:47.421 --> 00:21:49.920
Magie and these Quaker players.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.580
However, victory is
not enough for Ralph,

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:55.242
and he decides he wants
to go dig up his games.

00:21:55.242 --> 00:21:56.200
There's 40,000 of them.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.075
They're in Minnesota.

00:21:57.075 --> 00:21:57.580
They're his.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:58.954
And after all,
he's won the case.

00:21:58.954 --> 00:22:01.046
The Supreme Court has
put the final word on it.

00:22:01.046 --> 00:22:02.670
So he and his friend
Russ Foster-- this

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.510
is a really poor
quality photo of them--

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:06.530
they go to try and dig.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:07.980
And they look and they
look and they look

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.050
and they can't find them.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:10.133
They're really frustrated.

00:22:10.133 --> 00:22:10.990
They pack it in.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.150
Then a friend
contacts him and says,

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.140
so, you're digging
in the wrong spot.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.880
And Ralph says, oh,
well, we'll go back.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.729
We'll find them.

00:22:17.729 --> 00:22:19.270
And they said, well,
you can't really

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:22.200
do that, because they started
building condos on top

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.630
of where they were buried.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:24.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:27.810
So when sometimes people ask me,
why have you spent five years

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:30.730
researching Monopoly, which is
a perfectly legitimate question,

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:35.060
I feel like sometimes if we
don't-- these games are going

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.411
to get found, right?

00:22:36.411 --> 00:22:38.160
Whether that's a year
from now or 10 years

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.520
or 10,000 years from now.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:40.990
And we need a
document or something

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:45.220
explaining why they got
there, how they got there.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.240
And as far as I know,
they're still there.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.590
So there you have it.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:50.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.910
So I follow Monopoly
iconography a lot.

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:54.660
And one of the things
that's amazing to me

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.830
is that the game is
still everywhere.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.470
It's a meme, which
makes me happy.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:59.690
It's on "Gossip Girl."

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.390
Jon Stewart's a fan.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.050
And I put this tattoo
up there, only because I

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.671
want to find this person.

00:23:05.671 --> 00:23:08.170
And I feel like if you have an
arm sleeve of Monopoly stuff,

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:11.050
you're going to show up to some
Monopoly-related book event.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:14.020
If anybody has any intelligence,
please let me know.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.770
I really just curious.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.890
I want to know
everything about it.

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.620
So this is my book.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.900
And you can buy millions
of copies of it.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.260
And I feel like, just
to go back to this

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:29.159
why-obsessively-research-games
piece, I think that for me,

00:23:29.159 --> 00:23:31.200
this was like a fact-checking
question gone awry.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.350
I, like everybody, thought
Monopoly was invented

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.620
during the Great Depression.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.180
And in researching
it, it's taught me

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.290
a lot about how things
are actually made.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.620
I think that we love
the light bulb story.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.740
We love the Darrow story
because it's so romantic.

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.500
Like who doesn't want
to believe that that

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.702
could happen to any of us?

00:23:45.702 --> 00:23:48.035
But the truth is that making
things, whether it's a game

00:23:48.035 --> 00:23:50.160
or-- I mean, I'm sure you
guys go through this here

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.165
all the time.

00:23:51.165 --> 00:23:53.290
It's really complicated
and messy and collaborative

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:54.750
and it takes trial and error.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.370
And that's the
story of Monopoly.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:59.811
So I'm happy to take any
questions you may have.

00:23:59.811 --> 00:24:04.681
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:06.129 --> 00:24:06.629
Yes?

00:24:06.629 --> 00:24:08.212
AUDIENCE: Do you
have any pet theories

00:24:08.212 --> 00:24:11.855
on what happened in
the patent office,

00:24:11.855 --> 00:24:14.624
like for them to forget
or lose the patent?

00:24:14.624 --> 00:24:15.290
MARY PILON: Ooh.

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.660
So one of the things that's
been so fun about this

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.531
has been the book has brought
a lot of conspiracy theorists

00:24:20.531 --> 00:24:21.030
out.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:22.863
And so some people have
offered up theories.

00:24:22.863 --> 00:24:24.500
Based on my reporting,
I have none.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.400
Like I have no clue.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.320
And obviously because the
property became so lucrative,

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:33.590
there's a ton of incentive
to get rid of stuff.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:36.180
But also, with historical
research, one of the things

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.212
that blows me away is that any
of the stuff survives at all,

00:24:39.212 --> 00:24:40.670
I mean especially
like Lizzie Magie

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:41.836
and some of those documents.

00:24:41.836 --> 00:24:44.770
So, people just lost
stuff all the time.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:45.530
So I have no idea.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.100
I mean, I love the idea of
like a sinister back story.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.380
But the truth is, it could
have been some janitor.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.460
So I have no idea.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.760
But it's a great question.

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.526
Do you?

00:24:56.526 --> 00:24:57.234
What do you know?

00:24:57.234 --> 00:25:00.150
AUDIENCE: I mean, it's the
'30s, it's Parker Brothers.

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.733
Any number of sketchy stuff
could happen, especially

00:25:02.733 --> 00:25:04.524
considering that you
had a bunch of lefties

00:25:04.524 --> 00:25:06.960
at the time championing it.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.239
MARY PILON: Right, right.

00:25:08.239 --> 00:25:08.738
Absolutely.

00:25:11.445 --> 00:25:11.944
Yes?

00:25:11.944 --> 00:25:14.461
AUDIENCE: So what is the
state of competitive Monopoly

00:25:14.461 --> 00:25:14.960
like now?

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.615
Are there big
tournaments going on?

00:25:16.615 --> 00:25:18.240
MARY PILON: So that's
a great question.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.940
One of my favorite
books is "Work Freak"

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:21.796
by Stefan Fatsis, which if
you haven't read, it's great.

00:25:21.796 --> 00:25:23.690
It's about competitive
Scrabble playing.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.610
And I think because of the
nature of Monopoly as a game,

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.930
it doesn't have the same
competitive circuit.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.305
Like Hasbro every now and then
will sponsor a tournament.

00:25:31.305 --> 00:25:33.090
I think there's one
in Macau this fall.

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:34.980
But it's very all
over the place.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:36.831
It's not like it
happens every year.

00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:39.080
And if you really want to
geek out on the game design,

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.602
I think that Monopoly
is not designed to be

00:25:42.602 --> 00:25:43.810
as great of a strategic game.

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.840
Like you can't study up for it
the same way you can Scrabble.

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.542
So there really hasn't been
much of a competitive circuit

00:25:50.542 --> 00:25:51.510
And I think that's OK.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.718
I mean, sometimes people
think I'm like this monopoly

00:25:53.718 --> 00:25:54.500
purist and a nut.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.500
And I'm like, no, like Settlers
of Catan is a great game.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.800
But like Monopoly was
like from a century ago.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.550
I kind of think of it-- when
I did this event at the Game

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:06.091
Design Center, all these games
designers were like, it sucks.

00:26:06.091 --> 00:26:09.210
And I was like, it's like a
Model T. It's OK that it's not

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.425
a perfect game today.

00:26:10.425 --> 00:26:11.800
It was a great
stepping-off point

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.794
for all these other great ones.

00:26:13.794 --> 00:26:16.210
So yeah, I mean, one of the
problems with it, too, is it's

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:17.269
a very lopsided game.

00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:19.310
So unless you're playing
with people who actually

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:21.351
follow the rules and kind
of have a similar skill

00:26:21.351 --> 00:26:23.820
set, like the deal-making and
the stuff that makes it fun,

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.180
it kind of falls flat.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.952
But yeah, there's tournaments.

00:26:27.952 --> 00:26:30.035
Sorry if that was a
disappointing answer. [LAUGHS]

00:26:30.035 --> 00:26:32.974
AUDIENCE: My dad was actually
the Monopoly champion

00:26:32.974 --> 00:26:34.140
of Pennsylvania [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:34.806
MARY PILON: Woo!

00:26:34.806 --> 00:26:35.604
Yeah!

00:26:35.604 --> 00:26:37.544
Guys, we have
royalty in the room.

00:26:37.544 --> 00:26:38.044
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:38.044 --> 00:26:39.020
Who knew?

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.674
AUDIENCE: But his family
grew up playing Monopoly.

00:26:41.674 --> 00:26:42.924
And they're super competitive.

00:26:42.924 --> 00:26:43.412
And you're right.

00:26:43.412 --> 00:26:44.912
Like they all play
together and like

00:26:44.912 --> 00:26:47.190
I just get destroyed
every single time.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:48.731
MARY PILON: Right,
right, absolutely.

00:26:48.731 --> 00:26:50.272
AUDIENCE: But he
actually went-- they

00:26:50.272 --> 00:26:52.338
had a tournament in
New York after he won

00:26:52.338 --> 00:26:54.984
the whatever,
Pennsylvania championship.

00:26:54.984 --> 00:27:00.250
And then he lost at the I
guess US-wide tournament,

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.472
but it's still going on.

00:27:03.472 --> 00:27:04.400
[LAUGHS]

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.525
MARY PILON: That's awesome.

00:27:05.525 --> 00:27:08.400
And there's some unsanctioned
tournaments, too,

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.655
the dark underbelly of
competitive Monopoly playing.

00:27:11.655 --> 00:27:12.154
Yes.

00:27:12.154 --> 00:27:13.370
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about the history

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:14.490
of modern board games.

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:16.940
Was Monopoly very
unprecedented at the time?

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.790
Or was there already
a large collection

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.710
of other similar
things that people

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:22.459
were playing with
like dice on boards

00:27:22.459 --> 00:27:23.750
that weren't checkers or chess?

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.720
MARY PILON: Absolutely,
so there's a lot more

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.430
about that in the book
and the history of Parker

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:28.240
Brothers and Milton Bradley.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.073
Because I felt like I
need a lot of context,

00:27:30.073 --> 00:27:32.960
even walking up to
Lizzie Magie's game.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.570
So when you look at her patent,
there were a lot of things

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.240
there that I hadn't seen before,
so like the circular game

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.620
design.

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.610
What wasn't unique about hers
was that games at the time

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:44.320
were often used for teaching.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.550
They were often used as
a means of communication,

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.716
just like you would write
an article about something

00:27:48.716 --> 00:27:50.930
political you were fired
up about or what have you.

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:52.410
What was strange
about Monopoly is

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:56.584
that it really, as a commercial
game, was a huge blockbuster.

00:27:56.584 --> 00:27:58.750
And it opened the door for
all these other financial

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:00.300
and real estate
games and things.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.784
But there hadn't
really been a game

00:28:02.784 --> 00:28:04.950
that had sold quite at that
level and kind of popped

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:05.450
through.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.460
And games that were commercial
hits were rare enough.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.437
But Monopoly was kind of one
of the first marketed games

00:28:11.437 --> 00:28:12.270
that is a perennial.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.880
I mean, here we are sitting
around talking about it.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.410
And nobody ever really gotten
rich off of a game like Darrow

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:17.910
had.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.490
So it kind of created
this following.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:24.076
After Darrow sold the
game, Parker Brothers

00:28:24.076 --> 00:28:25.450
started getting
all these pitches

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:27.120
from people wanting to
become the next Darrow.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.270
And I think that was, from
a marketing perspective,

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.090
something that hadn't
really happened before.

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:33.131
But the history of games
leading up to this point

00:28:33.131 --> 00:28:34.550
is like worthy of a second book.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.716
And there's some in
bibliography that, if you really

00:28:36.716 --> 00:28:38.860
want to go in the weeds
on that, might be useful.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:42.068
I'd be happy to point
then out to you.

00:28:42.068 --> 00:28:43.060
Yes?

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.640
AUDIENCE: So people
publish entirely

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.434
alternate rule sets for
Monopoly and just throw out

00:28:48.434 --> 00:28:49.910
most of the concepts
of the game.

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:50.909
You still use the board.

00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:52.100
You still use the pieces.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.470
Do you have a favorite alternate
rules set of that sort?

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:58.720
MARY PILON: So this group
of-- I get really great emails

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.739
from people about this.

00:28:59.739 --> 00:29:01.280
And this was maybe
a year or two ago.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.890
Somebody had
emailed me, and they

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:06.120
created a version of the
game with securitization.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.750
So like you're
selling properties,

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:08.670
but you're bundling.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.169
You're bundling
mortgages and stuff.

00:29:10.169 --> 00:29:13.270
And I thought it was kind of
a fascinating, great idea.

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:16.469
And so you clearly have to
play with a group of players

00:29:16.469 --> 00:29:17.260
that are into that.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.371
But I thought that
was very, very funny.

00:29:19.371 --> 00:29:20.870
And it was the first
time I had even

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:24.300
thought of securitizing
mortgages and stuff

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.974
on the Monopoly board.

00:29:25.974 --> 00:29:26.474
Yes?

00:29:26.474 --> 00:29:28.015
AUDIENCE: In that
regard, what do you

00:29:28.015 --> 00:29:31.254
think of like the new version
of Monopoly with credit cards

00:29:31.254 --> 00:29:33.660
and like amounts like
the millions of dollars?

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.250
MARY PILON: Sure, so I did a
piece for the "Sunday Review"

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.990
at "The Times" about this.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:41.450
As a purist, I think
it's a little silly.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.700
But I also think that it's
a little hypocritical of me

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.410
to be like, you can't put
credit cards in Monopoly.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.850
Because if you look at
the origins of the game,

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:49.160
it was all about people
making it their own.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.750
So it's just another
iteration of it.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:53.000
And one of the things I find
really strange about that

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.907
is a parent came up to me at
an event I did and was like,

00:29:55.907 --> 00:29:57.990
oh, we use Monopoly to
teach our kids about money.

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.150
And I was like, oh, I
guess my parents did, too.

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:01.941
And she was like, no,
you don't understand.

00:30:01.941 --> 00:30:04.570
Because of credit cards,
they don't see me use money.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.660
Like they don't understand
$5 versus $10 versus $20.

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:08.950
And I was like, oh, whoa.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.330
So like if you do the credit
card version of the game,

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:14.720
you lose that financial lesson.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.410
So I mean, I don't own it.

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:18.737
I'm also not a game collector.

00:30:18.737 --> 00:30:20.070
I mean, I live in New York City.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:23.980
I don't have time
for that or space.

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:26.640
So I guess I'm kind of meh
about it, to summarize.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.431
I didn't write that in
the "Sunday Review,"

00:30:28.431 --> 00:30:30.850
like, Mary's meh about it,
leave the rest of the space.

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:31.600
So, yeah.

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:38.735
Any other questions, comments,
concerns, thought of your day?

00:30:38.735 --> 00:30:41.110
AUDIENCE: So can we all start
selling our own derivatives

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.250
of the game Monopoly?

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.800
MARY PILON: So that's
a very juicy question.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.694
So there's a
collector in Portland.

00:30:47.694 --> 00:30:49.110
His website is
landlordsgame.info.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:52.930
And he's going to start
making Landlord's Games.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:56.540
And I'm not a lawyer,
but my understanding

00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:01.430
is that Hasbro controls the
brand, like the Monopoly brand.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.550
And then all those
spin off games,

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.710
USAopoly makes with a
license through Hasbro.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:11.880
So again, with my non-legal hat,
my guess is you probably could.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.690
But it wouldn't be
surprising-- I mean,

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:16.190
do you want to fight a 10-year
long legal battle like Ralph?

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:17.192
I mean, I don't know.

00:31:17.192 --> 00:31:18.056
But he did win.

00:31:18.056 --> 00:31:20.060
AUDIENCE: There's
precedent now, right?

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:22.601
MARY PILON: Right, well, also--
and this is in the book, too,

00:31:22.601 --> 00:31:25.220
and I didn't include it
here, but after his case,

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.080
the trademark lobby
approached Congress,

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.790
and they rewrote trademark law.

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.581
And they tucked it into I think
it was the Semiconductor Chip

00:31:32.581 --> 00:31:33.080
Act.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.930
And it's actually called--
So Ralph's lawyer at the time

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.594
had to reach out to-- I
think Orin Hatch sponsored

00:31:38.594 --> 00:31:40.010
the amendment but
had to reach out

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:42.040
to whoever's representative
it was at the time.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.640
And there's actually an
Anti-Monopoly amendment,

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.830
which is insane.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.250
So like this case, there's
like a hole, and then

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:49.985
this new batch of
trademark law, which

00:31:49.985 --> 00:31:51.610
is why I'm a little
hesitant to say it.

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:53.780
Because if you were to
fight Ralph's case today,

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.480
it would be a
different legal thing.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.390
Because trademark and patent law
has changed so much, partially

00:31:58.390 --> 00:31:59.520
as a result of this case.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:03.621
Yes?

00:32:03.621 --> 00:32:05.345
AUDIENCE: So Monopoly
seems to be very centered

00:32:05.345 --> 00:32:06.980
in American culture,
and I'm wondering

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.100
if you've seen interesting
international versions

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:09.952
of the game?

00:32:09.952 --> 00:32:10.910
MARY PILON: Absolutely.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:13.850
So the first country that I'm
aware of outside of the US

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:16.804
where it was played
was in the UK,

00:32:16.804 --> 00:32:18.470
and Waddington's
controlled the license.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:19.910
So what's weird
is that if you go

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:21.919
to different parts of
the world, they made it--

00:32:21.919 --> 00:32:23.710
so if you buy a French
version of the game,

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.240
it's going to have
Paris properties.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.619
If you go to London, it's
going to have Piccadilly Circus

00:32:28.619 --> 00:32:29.910
and all this other stuff on it.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:32.300
So yeah, they're huge.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.530
And somebody told
me Brazil, they even

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.700
have Sao Paulo and Rio versions.

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.790
So those are really popular.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.805
They're everywhere.

00:32:39.805 --> 00:32:42.180
And actually, this is really
getting back in the history,

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:46.849
but board games are
interesting politically,

00:32:46.849 --> 00:32:49.140
because there's all sorts of
chatter about whether they

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.890
were allowed across the Wall.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:51.830
Was Monopoly allowed?

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:53.010
It's a symbol of capitalism.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:54.475
And the history
is a little murky.

00:32:54.475 --> 00:32:56.100
But one thing I did
find in my research

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.980
is that Adolf Hitler used board
games a lot with Hitler youth.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.190
And there are these
really insane games.

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:06.060
Like there's one called Juden
Raus, which means Jews Out.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:09.820
And seeing really insane
propaganda on board games

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.460
was like, wow,
like people really

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:15.070
understood the power of these
as tools and teaching tools.

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:18.250
And so there were
Monopoly spinoffs,

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:21.310
and because this game
was so successful,

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:24.045
a lot of people, good and evil,
started making them worldwide

00:33:24.045 --> 00:33:25.850
in all these bizarre,
different flavors.

00:33:30.143 --> 00:33:30.737
Yes?

00:33:30.737 --> 00:33:32.320
AUDIENCE: I remember
reading somewhere

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.360
that the game
mechanics of Monopoly

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.310
are purposefully terrible
to essentially teach

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:39.280
that Monopoly, like
the real-life concept,

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.580
is not fun, because one person
ends up with everything,

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.996
and everybody else
is just kind of

00:33:42.996 --> 00:33:44.830
crushed beneath the
machine of capitalism.

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:45.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:46.477
Is there any truth to that?

00:33:46.477 --> 00:33:48.060
MARY PILON: So what's
funny about that

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:50.210
is that when Lizzie
Magie made her 1904 game,

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:51.500
she made two rule sets.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.130
She made a monopolist rule set
and an anti-monopolist rule

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:54.770
set.

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:57.420
And the monopolist rule set
is the one that takes off.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.320
So you can read into
human nature whatever

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.157
you want on that, that we
chose the evil one where

00:34:02.157 --> 00:34:04.176
we have to crush everybody.

00:34:04.176 --> 00:34:06.050
So I think you could
make an argument, right?

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:09.550
Like her politics were
clear, like she did not

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:11.857
think that-- her
view of capitalism

00:34:11.857 --> 00:34:13.940
was not that one person
should control everything,

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.659
you have to destroy
everybody else.

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:17.992
So you could make this argument
that the monopolist rule

00:34:17.992 --> 00:34:20.130
set and its origins
was to teach people

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:23.750
about how awful it feels to lose
at Monopoly, which, we've all

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:25.030
been there.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.530
So I don't think
that's off base.

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:29.030
Yes?

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:30.980
AUDIENCE: My son is
super into Monopoly.

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.209
He has like the Batman
Monopoly, the Yankees Monopoly.

00:34:34.209 --> 00:34:37.010
Do you have a
favorite alternative?

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.380
MARY PILON: Your
son has good taste.

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.150
Let me think about that.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:42.249
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:42.249 --> 00:34:43.040
MARY PILON: Pardon?

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.460
AUDIENCE: I'm sure you've
seen all the variations?

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.199
MARY PILON: I've
see a lot of them.

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:48.090
It's kind of impossible
to see them all.

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:51.030
I like them all.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.730
But I actually-- this
is going to sound

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:55.380
really geeky, but recently
through a game designer,

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:58.320
I was able to play the
Quaker version right

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.032
before the auctions were added.

00:35:00.032 --> 00:35:02.240
So if you play Monopoly
where you land on every-- you

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.000
could probably do it with your
son at home, where every time

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.170
you land on a property,
you auction it.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:10.130
It changes the entire game.

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:12.470
But it changes it in a way
that I think is kind of fun

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:13.640
if you're used to
playing the game.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.598
So I think like the
pre-Parker Brothers auction

00:35:15.598 --> 00:35:17.630
Monopoly is my new favorite.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:19.560
In terms of the
commercially sold one,

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.590
I grew up in Eugene, Oregon, so
Duckopoly was a family default

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:25.780
if we didn't play the
traditional, which

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.200
is hyper-local, because
Eugene is not big place.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.286
It's like, oh, that's our
street, which was always fun.

00:35:32.286 --> 00:35:32.785
Yes?

00:35:32.785 --> 00:35:35.120
AUDIENCE: Did you have any
interactions with Parker

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.390
Brothers during your research?

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:37.770
MARY PILON: So, yes.

00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:40.030
I contacted them
several times, sent them

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:42.030
hundreds of
fact-checking questions.

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:44.340
When the excerpt ran in the
"Times" a few weeks ago,

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.490
I contacted them again.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.591
They have not like
offered anybody up

00:35:48.591 --> 00:35:50.090
for interviews, no
comment, anything

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:52.714
like that, which isn't the first
time a journalist has received

00:35:52.714 --> 00:35:53.940
a no.

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.340
Although they acquired the
company in the early '90s,

00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:00.415
so the bulk of this story
took place before then.

00:36:00.415 --> 00:36:02.790
And because of this court
case, I had a lot of documents.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:05.837
So whenever possible, like
Barton, his deposition

00:36:05.837 --> 00:36:07.170
is a whole sequence in the book.

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:08.480
I tried to give voice.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.470
Because I was really interested
in the history of this company.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:12.820
And I was really interested
in the decisions they made.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.220
And I think it's really
easy to write a story that's

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:18.099
black and white, but actually,
this one had a lot of gray.

00:36:18.099 --> 00:36:20.140
And I was able to talk a
lot of former executives

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.060
and former people and
people in the family who

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:23.810
are related to it.

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.815
So I feel like I was
still able to get--

00:36:25.815 --> 00:36:29.487
I tried my darndest to get as
full if a picture as I could.

00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:31.320
But yeah, it's always
a bummer when somebody

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.486
doesn't want to talk to you.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.853
Any other questions?

00:36:41.202 --> 00:36:43.285
I think I've heard every
Monopoly-related question

00:36:43.285 --> 00:36:44.420
at this point.

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:47.290
I've heard every Monopoly pun.

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.078
Yes, I've passed go, all that.

00:36:49.078 --> 00:36:51.328
AUDIENCE: What's your strategy
when you play Monopoly?

00:36:51.328 --> 00:36:52.280
Do you have a strategy?

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.405
MARY PILON: So the Jay
Walker book that I mentioned

00:36:54.405 --> 00:36:57.770
is actually, if you want a pure
strategy book, pretty great.

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:02.010
I am a big believer of the strip
between Jail and Free Parking,

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:03.500
because it gets landed on more.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.160
And the ROI if you're
building is pretty great.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.970
And I'm a big advocate
of housing shortages.

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:10.450
So what most people
don't realize

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:14.570
is that the number of houses
and hotels in any game is fixed.

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:17.370
So what I do is I become
like a total slum lord.

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:20.020
And I don't think I've
bought a hotel in Monopoly

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:20.840
in like years.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.250
It's just like not interesting.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:24.541
And it totally screws people,
and they don't realize it

00:37:24.541 --> 00:37:26.602
until it's too late.

00:37:26.602 --> 00:37:29.060
I don't think I've purchased
Free Parking or North Carolina

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.518
Avenue or any of the greens or
any of those in a long time,

00:37:31.518 --> 00:37:34.720
either, unless you're trying
to thwart a competitor.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.494
But there you have it.

00:37:36.494 --> 00:37:38.160
Too expensive to
build-- not interested.

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.459
MARY PILON: Right.

00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:43.250
No, but most people--
who here has actually

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:45.320
ever read the Monopoly rules?

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.020
OK, this is a smart room.

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.574
Because like in
my family, people

00:37:49.574 --> 00:37:50.740
will argue with me about it.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:54.297
I'm like, right, Dad, what
do I know about Monopoly?

00:37:54.297 --> 00:37:55.880
You're right, we
should put everything

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.900
in Free Parking-- no.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:01.970
It's still a source
of-- still a raw nerve.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:02.470
Yes?

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:03.910
AUDIENCE: Have you
met Ralph in person?

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:05.476
MARY PILON: Yeah, I spent a
lot of time interviewing him.

00:38:05.476 --> 00:38:06.434
AUDIENCE: So how is he?

00:38:06.434 --> 00:38:07.150
What was he like?

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:08.566
MARY PILON: Ralph
is really funny.

00:38:08.566 --> 00:38:09.066
He's 89.

00:38:09.066 --> 00:38:11.066
And actually, I just
emailed him a few weeks ago

00:38:11.066 --> 00:38:11.970
about something.

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:15.005
And he said something amazing,
which is life begins at 89.

00:38:15.005 --> 00:38:15.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:19.374
And I was like, wow,
that's an amazing insight.

00:38:19.374 --> 00:38:21.790
Because like, poor Ralph--
like I started interviewing him

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:22.950
five years ago.

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:26.255
And as far as I know, this is
the first journalistic account

00:38:26.255 --> 00:38:27.130
of the whole history.

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:30.270
So to wait 40 years for a
journalist to come along,

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:35.760
or 34 years or whatever,
that's a long time to wait.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:37.170
And I interviewed his sons.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:41.090
And his ex-wife actually passed
away while I was reporting.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:42.420
She was really helpful.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.690
So I kind of got
this portrait of him

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:47.280
not just from spending time
with him but also his family.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.280
He's very professorial.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.800
And the fact that this story
fell in the hands of somebody

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.697
who had a PhD in
economics was, I think,

00:38:53.697 --> 00:38:55.280
one of the great
things that happened.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.600
Because he basically
became a paralegal

00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.110
and understood
the inner workings

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:02.590
of this case and the history
and the politics of it in a way

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:05.240
that, had it been somebody
who just made a board

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:10.310
game or something, I
don't think the story

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:12.039
would have been as fleshed out.

00:39:12.039 --> 00:39:13.830
But he's very academic,
very even-tempered.

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.480
One of things I
struggled with a lot

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.226
in writing it is I
kept asking myself-- he

00:39:21.226 --> 00:39:22.850
turned down a massive
settlement offer.

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:25.820
And there's a lot more drama
in the book about what it

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.070
took for him to win this case.

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:29.520
And I thought, God, me
and most people I know

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.710
would have called it quits.

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:32.970
And also, we knew the outcome.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.970
When you're doing
historical research,

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:37.974
you're looking at it knowing
that he'd already won.

00:39:37.974 --> 00:39:40.640
And he obviously didn't, because
this was happening in real time

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.139
and he had so many
odds against him.

00:39:42.139 --> 00:39:43.740
And I was like, why
did he fight this?

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:45.980
And his background
is that he was

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:49.520
born in Danzig, Jewish
family, fled to the States.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.057
Had he stayed any longer,
he probably would have died.

00:39:52.057 --> 00:39:54.140
And then he was an immigrant
in the United States.

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.550
So understanding his
history as a fighter,

00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:00.770
as somebody who had
to battle to survive,

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:03.590
made me understand why
he was in the Bay Area

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:05.800
also protesting against
the Vietnam War.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.416
And I think one of
his sons told me

00:40:07.416 --> 00:40:08.790
that he would go
to these marches

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:11.271
with like a helmet,
like that takes

00:40:11.271 --> 00:40:12.520
a certain kind of personality.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.478
And it took me a long
time to kind of reconcile

00:40:14.478 --> 00:40:17.320
this gentle old man
with his sweaters

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.232
and mismatched shirts with that.

00:40:19.232 --> 00:40:20.690
And I think that
that's a challenge

00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:23.282
that you have in more
historical reporting

00:40:23.282 --> 00:40:24.490
that you don't in journalism.

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:26.070
When you report
like a daily story,

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:27.610
the person is right
there and you're

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:30.320
watching them do the thing that
is putting them in the news.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.090
And with this, I had wind
back the clock a lot more.

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:35.170
Because he had evolved a
lot as a result of this,

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:37.170
too, even from the start
of the case to the end.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.160
Other questions?

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:41.660
Yes.

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.085
AUDIENCE: We all know how
most of the house rules

00:40:43.085 --> 00:40:44.430
make the game way worse.

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:46.010
But have you run
across any house

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.719
rules that make it way better?

00:40:47.719 --> 00:40:49.510
MARY PILON: The one
that comes to mind just

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:52.720
off the top my head
is playing it timed,

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.190
just because it kind of
incentivizes people, kind

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:56.630
of like you would with chess.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:57.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:58.649
MARY PILON: Yeah.

00:40:58.649 --> 00:40:59.940
my family won't do it that way.

00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:04.390
But that seems like a fun way.

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:07.610
And also, there's ways you
can start with handing out

00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:08.810
people's properties.

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:11.750
So you just start
where everybody-- it

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:13.000
makes the game go faster, too.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.541
But you just have to work with
what you're handed, basically.

00:41:15.541 --> 00:41:18.459
So it's kind of like Clue
where you hand out the-- you

00:41:18.459 --> 00:41:20.500
have whatever evidence
you have in the beginning.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.355
So that's another one
that I think is fun.

00:41:22.355 --> 00:41:23.570
It's good with kids, too.

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:27.050
Yes?

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.695
Anything else?

00:41:30.932 --> 00:41:31.640
I was so nervous.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.310
I was like, God, everybody
at Google is so smart.

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:34.976
And somebody at
Bloomsbury was like, you

00:41:34.976 --> 00:41:37.160
know a lot about Monopoly.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.910
It's gonna be OK.
[LAUGHS] I was like,

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:40.640
they could probably have a
Monopoly division at Google,

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.723
and we wouldn't even know.

00:41:41.723 --> 00:41:43.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:45.730
They could be making
the sets downstairs.

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:48.810
We can't make any assumptions.

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:50.880
Any other questions?

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.014
Great-- thank you so much.

00:41:52.014 --> 00:41:53.680
And if you have any
questions, email me.

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.680
That's not a dummy Gmail.

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.830
I actually use it.
