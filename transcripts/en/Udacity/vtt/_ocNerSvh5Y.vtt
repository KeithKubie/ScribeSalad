00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:00.890
Hi Michael.

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.060
&gt;&gt; Hey Charles. How's it going?

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.820
&gt;&gt; It is going quite well. Thank you very

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.250
much for asking. How are things going with you?

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.210
&gt;&gt; I can't complain because I've been barred by a, a judge.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.820
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm pretty sure you can still complain. Complaining is a

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.030
fine art that requires lots of practice. Guess what we're going to do today?

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.120
&gt;&gt; I'm reading decision making and

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.880
reinforcement learning which is very exciting.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.060
&gt;&gt; It is.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.700
&gt;&gt; Except the hyphen.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.620
&gt;&gt; Except for the hyphen?

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah the hyphens wrong.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.250
&gt;&gt; Why?

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.460
&gt;&gt; because

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.430
it's not decision dash making.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.280
&gt;&gt; You're right. I normally don't do that

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.850
but people always want to put a dash

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.990
so what I'm going to do is for your

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.150
Michael. Just for you. I'm going to remove the dash.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.050
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.969
&gt;&gt; And I'm going to put it over here where it belongs.

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.720
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No. There. Well, Michael, this is

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.490
the first of our discussions on the last

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.830
mini course of machine learning, Reinforcement Learning, which

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.370
I believe you know a little bit about.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.720
&gt;&gt; I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.150
am very interested in Reinforcement Learning.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.200
&gt;&gt; Excellent. So I'm just going to do

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.260
a little bit of background. It's going to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.560
be relatively short and straight forward. We're

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.770
going to do a couple of quizzes, because

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.930
I know how much you like quizzes. And then we're just going to go back

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.180
and forth and see what we get to learn about Reinforcement Learning. Sound good?

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.938
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

00:01:04.938 --> 00:01:07.470
&gt;&gt; Excellent, okay so, let's get started.
