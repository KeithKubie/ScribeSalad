00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.380
Hey guys welcome back I'm Nate

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.690
thank you for joining me today on the king of random a

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.660
Sling is a tool that is thousands of years old used to hurl projectiles at high speeds over long distances

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.599
It's been used as a hunting tool and a weapon of war it's light weight has incredible range and best of all for us

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.549
it's very easy to make so the purpose of today's video is to show you how to make your own sling at home in just

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.060
A few minutes using some low cost materials here are all the supplies

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.199
We'll need for this build yarn from any craft or fabric store some drinking straws

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.069
I prefer the thicker ones you can often find at fast food restaurants and some twine

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.889
This is jute cord also available at most craft and fabric stores, and that's all the supplies You'll need to start

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.329
Let's grab one of our straws and our yarn the first step is to tie a simple overhand knot

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.579
With your yarn around one of the straws

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.390
You'll want to be sure that you leave six to eight inches of extra yarn after your knot

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:55.379
Gather all six straws and hold them in your hand with the yarn attached to the far right straw to begin simply weave the yarn

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.010
through the straws

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.050
With each straw you need to alternate if the yarn goes in front or behind the straw

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.709
When we get to the last straw wrap it around and weave back

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.699
Keep weaving the yarn up the straw being sure to pull it tight and slide it all the way down every couple of passes at

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.049
First it might be a little hard to hold on to the straws as you weave but it will get easier as the straws get

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.049
Wrapped up and held in place by the yarn

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.070
There shouldn't be any gaps in your yarn always press it down so that the different layers are touching each other

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.040
We've now woven our yarn nice and tightly together about six inches wide

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.879
So it's cut off our excess yarn and set this aside for a moment and prepare our twine

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.599
Let's measure out six pieces of twine each piece should be ten feet long

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.060
With our lengths of twine cut let's feed one through each of the six straws

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.479
Before we remove the straws we want to be sure that the yarn pocket is in the center of the lengths of twine

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.929
gather together all six ends of the twine on both sides

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.569
Being careful to keep the two sides separate from each other hold them in one hand and stretch the pocket and straws

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.389
Away from them if the straws aren't centered on the twine pull on the short side until the straws are right in the middle

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.839
With the straws and yarn centered on the twine it's time to carefully remove the straws holding the yarn so that the weave doesn't unravel

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.049
Gently pull the straws in one uniform direction

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.390
You may find that the center straws slide out more easily than the two straws on the edges to

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.480
Be sure you didn't accidentally pull any of the twine while you are removing the straws

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.420
It's best to line up the edges and make sure the pocket is centered again

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.849
If the yarn pocket is too far to one side carefully slide it along the twine to Center it again

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.239
Now with our pocket centered we want to tighten it up and cinch it off

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.739
Secure all six strands on one side of the twine and begin pushing the yarn down into the middle

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.029
Once that side seems fully compacted switch to the other side and do the same thing

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.509
The yarn pocket should end up about half as long as it was

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.449
once the yarn is compacted into the center you want to grab the extra piece that you left and gently pull it to cinch the

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.200
edges

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.049
before tightening the side where the weave began be sure to undo the overhand knot you made around the straw the

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.739
Pocket is formed so now let's make the cords divide the twine into three sets of two strands

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.890
To make the braiding process easier we'll secure the side we're not working on to the table with tape

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.779
Now we're ready to begin braiding to make a braid take one of the outside lengths of cords and place it in the middle of

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.589
The other to take the cord from the other side and now move it into the middle

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.280
Repeat this process over and over and the braid forms

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.049
Every so often you'll need to make sure that the back of your twine is not getting tangled be sure to keep the braid nice

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.949
And tight by pulling on it there shouldn't be any gaps or holes in the braid

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.010
You can choose how long to make your cords, I prefer a length of just over two feet once

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.639
You've reached the length that you want simply tie an overhand knot to end the braid

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.820
remove any excess twine

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.329
With one side complete we want to repeat the process on the other side

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:51.649
When our second braid is about three inches from the length of our first

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.079
We're going to add an addition that makes it easier to use

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.529
We're going to make two smaller braids select one strand from each of the three bundles

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:03.439
We want to braid each of these three strands together

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:13.039
Keep going until your small braid is approximately 2 inches long then make a second identical braid with the other 3 strands

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.379
With the two smaller braids completed. Let's form our double strands again and return to the larger size braid

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.469
We only need about half an inch of our larger braid before we tie this off and this side of the cord will be complete

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.589
This braided loop gives us something that we can easily hold on to and let go of to facilitate the use of our sling

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.449
Your sling is now complete

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:37.068
There are a lot of things that can be used for a mo most traditionally small smooth rocks however

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:41.809
We don't want to be doing any damage with these so what we're going to use is small crumpled-up balls of foil

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:45.919
This is a good size to fit in our sling is lightweight enough that it won't damage anything

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.679
But it's heavy enough that it should fly through the air fairly

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.939
Well to use our sling take your ammo put it in the pocket of the slingshot and fold it in

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:58.759
You'll then twirl the sling around your head and release from the loop that we made with the small braids

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:00.949
Let's take this outside and try it out

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.699
I'll spin this above my head and let go of the side that I'm holding in the loop

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:11.688
My aim is terrible. I'm learning

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:16.849
Well that launched pretty well into the neighbor's yard

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:22.549
So hopefully they won't mind a small piece of foil on their grass a little bit of wind this time

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.550
We'll see if that affects anything

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:34.520
That's pretty good had some good zing to it flew kind of straight did not go over the wall just backed into the brick

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.689
Let's go see what happened mostly. I'm just curious if it flattened part of the foil I

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.210
Think it did it's not very obvious

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.969
But I'm pretty sure this is where I hit the wall our whole shot is now a little bit narrower from the impact

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:49.219
Let's try a few more times

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:57.348
That went into the neighbor's yard again, I need to find a better target, so instead. I'm just going to throw it down the street

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.150
There's really nothing that can be broken and these little balls of foil probably couldn't break anything anyway

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.079
And now I'll be able to go get it. It's not going to go over a fence into someone's yard

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.019
Unless I'm a very bad shot in which case

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.959
It will we'll see Oh

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:23.119
In someone's yard, but not over a fence. I'm gonna try spinning it in a different direction so it's more

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:26.598
down the street and less in circles above my head oh

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:37.189
There we go that was straight right down the middle of the road if I were David fighting Goliath

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.229
I'm pretty sure I'd lose he had a lot more practice than me

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.189
Grounder

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:51.468
For me the helicopter and releasing sideways. I keep launching it off to left or right

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.449
What's working better for me?

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:55.449
and you should practice this on your own I

00:07:55.469 --> 00:08:00.619
Go around and then I come down and up and that's really getting a lot straighter of a shot for me

00:08:00.649 --> 00:08:04.219
Let's try things out with the projectile that won't damage anything figure out. What works best for you

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:07.009
I'm gonna try using marshmallows because they're fun

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.989
Both taste like really good projectiles and this will work

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.940
Still one sideways

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:25.700
And that marshmallow didn't come down it lives in a tree now some squirrel is gonna be so happy now

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:30.710
I'm gonna try and throw marshmallow into the air while grant tries to catch it in his mouth for science. Oh

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.680
Oh

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.490
In and out in and out

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.470
Yeah

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:06.409
New chubby bunny challenge chubby bunnies from a distance long distance chubby bunny long distance show many buddies

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.410
I could see this becoming a little sport

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.610
perfect alright

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.970
Yeah

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.770
That was sweet, it was like a wiffle ball. Just move curve ball marshmallow

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:33.229
There you have it how to make your own David and Goliath style sling using just yarn twine and some straws

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.189
Like I said all sorts of things can be used as ammo when these were used as weapons of war

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:43.580
They would often use cast pieces of lead and in fact some ancient Greek pieces have been found with inscriptions on them that say things

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:49.759
Like catch or take that now reminder that if you're using any sort of metal or rocks these things can be extremely dangerous

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:54.500
So be sure you're nowhere near any people or fragile objects. I hope you've enjoyed this project

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.980
Thank you so much for joining us and we look forward to the next one. Talk to you then and

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.919
Then I just that when I just let go early flew off backward random happens

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.370
They both go that way

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.630
Hey guys, I hope you're feeling happy today

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:18.510
I know I am because you're keeping this channel alive and well we really appreciate your support because we could not be doing this without

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.510
You that's why you're the best
