SALMAN KHAN: The Khan
Academy is most known

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.590
for its collection of videos.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.170
So before I go any
farther, let me

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.474
show you a little
bit of a montage.

00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:25.140
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.630
-So the hypotenuse is
now going to be five.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.500
This animal's fossils
are only found

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.310
in this area of South
America, nice, clean band

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.130
here, and in this
part of Africa.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.160
We could integrate
over the surface,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.080
and the notation usually
is a capital sigma.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.220
National Assembly, they
create the committee

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.900
of public safety, which sounds
like a very nice committee.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.990
Notice this is an aldehyde,
and it's an alcohol.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.350
Start differentiating into
effector and memory cells.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.730
A galaxy, hey, there's
another galaxy.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.090
Oh look, there's another galaxy.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.720
And for dollars is their 30
million plus the $20 million

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.460
from the American manufacturer.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.275
If this does not blow your
mind, then you have no emotion.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:13.980
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.960
SALMAN KHAN: We now have on
the order of 2,200 videos

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.400
covering everything from
basic arithmetic all

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.720
the way to vector calculus
and some of the stuff

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.490
that you saw up there.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.820
We have a million students
a month using the site,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.340
watching on the order of
100,000 to 200,000 videos a day.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.090
But what we're going
to talk about in this

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.150
is how we're going
to the next level.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.810
But before I do that, I want
to talk a little bit about how

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.330
I got started.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.950
And some of you all might
know, about five years ago,

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.730
I was an analyst
at a hedge fund.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.230
And I was in Boston.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.260
And I was tutoring my cousins
in New Orleans remotely.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.260
And I started putting the first
YouTube videos up, really just

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.650
as a nice to have, just kind of
a supplement, for my cousins,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.820
something that might give them
a refresher, or something.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.279
And as soon as I put those
first YouTube videos up,

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:05.570
something interesting happened.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.060
Actually, a bunch of
interesting things happened.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.180
The first was the
feedback from my cousins.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.584
They told me that they preferred
me on YouTube than in person.

00:02:16.584 --> 00:02:22.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.949
And once you get over the
backhanded nature of that,

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:28.990
there was actually something
very profound there.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.370
They were saying that they
preferred the automated version

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.732
of their cousin to their cousin.

00:02:34.732 --> 00:02:36.940
At first it's very unintuitive,
but when you actually

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.606
think about it from
their point of view,

00:02:38.606 --> 00:02:40.220
it makes a ton of sense.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.260
You have this situation where
now they can pause and repeat

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.770
their cousin without feeling
like they're wasting my time.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.590
If they have to review something
that they should have learned

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.570
a couple of weeks ago, or
maybe a couple of years ago,

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.289
they don't have to be
embarrassed and ask

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.830
their cousin.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.050
They can just
watch those videos.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.160
If they're bored,
they can go ahead.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.730
They can watch it at their
own time, at their own pace.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.280
And probably the least
appreciated aspect of this

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.100
is the notion that the very
first time, the very first time

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.790
that you're trying to get your
brain around a new concept,

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.670
the very last thing you need
is another human being saying

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.327
do you understand this.

00:03:18.327 --> 00:03:20.410
And that's what was happening
with the interaction

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.730
with my cousins before.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.820
And now they could just do it in
the intimacy of their own room.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.420
The other thing that happened
is I put them on YouTube

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.050
just for the-- I saw no
reason to make it private.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.530
So I let other people watch it.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.230
And then people started
stumbling on it.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.570
And I started getting some
comments, and some letters,

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.870
and all sorts of feedback from
random people around the world.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.130
And these are just a few.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.600
This is actually from one of
the original calculus videos.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.570
And someone wrote on YouTube,
it was a YouTube comment,

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:02.650
"First time I smiled
doing a derivative."

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.170
Let's pause here.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.290
This person did a derivative,
and then they smiled.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.040
And then in response
to that same comment,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.956
this is on the thread.

00:04:11.956 --> 00:04:14.090
You could go on YouTube
and look at these comments.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.830
Someone else wrote,
"Same thing here.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.820
I actually got a natural
high and a good mood

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.170
for the entire day,
since I remember

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.780
seeing all of this
'matrix text' in class.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.966
And here I'm all
like, I know Kung Fu."

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:30.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.900
And we got a lot of
feedback along those lines.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.820
This clearly was helping people.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.400
But then, as the viewership
kept growing, and kept growing,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.032
I started getting
letters from people.

00:04:41.032 --> 00:04:42.490
And it was starting
to become clear

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.780
that it was actually more
than just a nice to have.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.520
This is just an excerpt
from one of those letters.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.250
"My 12-year-old son
has autism, and has

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.150
had a terrible time with math.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.440
We have tried everything, viewed
everything, bought everything.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.122
We stumbled on your video on
decimals, and it got through.

00:05:00.122 --> 00:05:01.830
Then we went on to
the dreaded fractions.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.220
Again, he got it.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.500
We could not believe it.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.610
He is so excited."

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.980
And so you can
imagine, here I was,

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.140
an analyst at a hedge fund.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.964
It was very strange for me to
do something of social value.

00:05:15.964 --> 00:05:24.080
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.460
But I was excited.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.510
So I kept going.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.130
And then a few other things
started to dawn on me.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.780
That not only would it
help my cousins right now,

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.760
or these people who
were sending letters.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.640
But maybe that this
content will never go old.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.910
That it could help their
kids or their grandkids.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.700
If Isaac Newton had done
YouTube videos on calculus,

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.540
I wouldn't have to,
assuming he was good.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.911
We don't know.

00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:54.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.784
The other thing that happened,
and even at this point, I said,

00:05:56.784 --> 00:05:58.158
OK, maybe it's a
good supplement.

00:05:58.158 --> 00:05:59.590
It's good for
motivated students.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.792
It's good for maybe
homeschoolers.

00:06:01.792 --> 00:06:04.250
But I didn't think it would be
something that would somehow

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.469
penetrate the classroom.

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:07.510
But then I started getting
letters from teachers.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.440
And the teachers
would write saying,

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.860
we've used your videos
to flip the classroom.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.230
You've given the lectures.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.021
So now what we do--
and this could actually

00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:18.500
happen in every classroom in
America tomorrow-- what I do

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.350
is I assign the
lectures for homework.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.670
And what used to
be homework, I now

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.580
have the students
doing in the classroom.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:33.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.830
I want to pause
here for a second

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.788
because there's a couple
of interesting things.

00:06:36.788 --> 00:06:38.840
One, when those
teachers are doing that,

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.400
there's the obvious benefit.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.970
There's the benefit
that now their students

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.250
can enjoy the videos in the
way that my cousins did.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.562
They can pause, repeat at their
own pace, at their own time.

00:06:48.562 --> 00:06:50.270
But the more interesting
thing-- and this

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.561
is the unintuitive thing when
you talk about technology

00:06:52.561 --> 00:06:55.650
in the classroom-- by removing
the "one size fits all"

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.250
lecture from the classroom
and letting students have

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.684
a self-paced lecture
at home, and then when

00:07:00.684 --> 00:07:02.600
you go to the classroom,
letting them do work,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.750
having the teacher walk around,
having the peers actually

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.870
be able to interact
with each other,

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.290
these teachers have
used technology

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.460
to humanize the classroom.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.870
They took a fundamentally
dehumanizing experience,

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.450
a bunch of 30 kids with
their fingers on their lips,

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.160
not allowed to interact
with each other.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.970
A teacher, no
matter how good, has

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:23.920
to give this kind of
"one size fits all"

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.640
lecture to 30 students-- blank
faces, slightly antagonistic.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.110
And now it's a human experience.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.620
Now they're actually
interacting with each other.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.880
So once the Khan
Academy-- I quit my job.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.820
And we turned into
a real organization,

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.940
or a not-for-profit.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.785
The question is, how do we
take this to the next level?

00:07:42.785 --> 00:07:44.410
How do we take what
those teachers were

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.490
doing to their
natural conclusion?

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.370
And so what I'm
showing over here,

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.330
these are actual
exercises that I

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.717
started writing for my cousins.

00:07:53.717 --> 00:07:55.550
The ones I started were
much more primitive.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.030
This is a more
competent version of it.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.490
But the paradigm here is we'll
generate as many questions

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.950
as you need until
you get that concept,

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.370
until you get 10 in a row.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.610
And the Khan Academy
videos are there.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.870
You get hints, the actual
steps for that problem,

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.624
if you don't know how to do it.

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:13.790
But the paradigm, it seems
like a very simple thing.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.040
10 in a row, you move on.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.873
But it's fundamentally
different than what's

00:08:16.873 --> 00:08:18.690
happening in
classrooms right now.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.370
In a traditional
classroom, you have

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.295
a couple of-- homework,
lecture, homework, lecture,

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:26.360
and then you have
a snapshot exam.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.470
And that exam, whether you get
a 70%, an 80%, a 90% or a 95%,

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.960
the class moves on
to the next topic.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.711
And even that 95% student, what
was the 5% they didn't know?

00:08:37.711 --> 00:08:39.169
Maybe they didn't
know what happens

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.297
when you raise something
to the 0-th power.

00:08:41.297 --> 00:08:43.380
And then you go build on
that in the next concept.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.159
That's analogous to-- imagine
learning to ride a bicycle.

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.200
And I give you a bicycle.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.070
Maybe I give you a
lecture ahead of time.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.980
And I give you that
bicycle for two weeks.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.945
And then I come back
after two weeks.

00:08:53.945 --> 00:08:55.070
And I say, well, let's see.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.736
You're having trouble
taking left turns.

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:58.370
You can't quite stop.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:59.945
You're an 80% bicyclist.

00:08:59.945 --> 00:09:04.060
So I put a big C stamp
on your forehead.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.610
And then I say
here's a unicycle.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.940
But as ridiculous
as that sounds,

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.620
that's exactly what's happening
in our classrooms right now.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.880
And the idea is
you fast forward.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.130
And good students start failing
algebra all of a sudden,

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.490
and start failing
calculus all of a sudden,

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.840
despite being smart, despite
having good teachers.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.006
And it's usually because
they had these Swiss cheese

00:09:25.006 --> 00:09:27.400
gaps that kept building
throughout their foundations.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.255
So our model is learn math the
way you would learn anything.

00:09:31.255 --> 00:09:32.880
Like the way you
would learn a bicycle.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.420
Stay on that bicycle.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.770
Fall off that bicycle.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.890
Do it as long as necessary
until you have mastery.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.370
The traditional model,
it penalizes you

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.010
for experimentation and failure.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.080
But it does not expect mastery.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.710
We encourage you to experiment.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.070
We encourage you to failure.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.364
But we do expect mastery.

00:09:51.364 --> 00:09:53.030
This is just another
one of the modules.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.730
This is trigonometry.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.910
This is shifting and
reflecting functions.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.700
And they all fit together.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.330
We have about 90
of these right now.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:02.600
And you could go to
the site right now.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.290
It's all free.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.719
Not trying to sell anything.

00:10:04.719 --> 00:10:06.260
But the general idea
is that they all

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.930
fit into this knowledge map.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.380
That top node
right there, that's

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.180
literally single-digit addition.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.641
It's like 1 plus
1 is equal to 2.

00:10:13.641 --> 00:10:15.890
And the paradigm is, once
you get 10 in a row on that,

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:20.690
then it keeps forwarding you to
more and more advanced modules.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.750
So keep-- this is further
down the knowledge map.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.720
We're getting into more
advanced arithmetic.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.220
Further down, you
start getting into

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.720
pre-algebra and early algebra.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.500
Further down, you start getting
into algebra one, algebra two,

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.520
a little bit of precalculus.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.930
And the idea is, from this, we
can actually teach everything.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.330
Well, everything
that can be taught

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.830
in this type of a framework.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.810
So you can imagine.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.470
And this is what
we are working on--

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.610
is from this knowledge
map, you have logic.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.120
You have computer programming.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.430
You have grammar.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.540
You have genetics.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.740
All based off of that core of,
OK, If you know this and that,

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:56.200
now you're ready for
this next concept.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.487
Now that can work well
for an individual learner.

00:10:58.487 --> 00:11:00.570
And I encourage one, for
you to do with your kids.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.236
But I also encourage everyone in
the audience to do it yourself.

00:11:03.236 --> 00:11:05.660
It'll change what happens
at the dinner table.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.650
But what we want to do is
use the natural conclusion

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:11.200
of the flipping of the classroom
that those early teachers

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.326
had emailed me about.

00:11:12.326 --> 00:11:13.700
And so what I'm
showing you here,

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.610
this is actually data from a
pilot in the Los Altos school

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.130
district, where they took two
fifth-grade classes, and two

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.200
seventh-grade classes,
and completely gutted

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.390
their old math curriculum.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.690
These kids aren't
using textbooks.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.490
They're not getting "one
size fits all" lectures.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.710
They're doing Khan Academy.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.990
They're doing that
software for roughly half

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:30.140
of their math class.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.350
And I want to make it clear.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.160
We don't view this as a
complete math education.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.660
What it does is--
and this is what's

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.774
happening Los Altos--
it frees up time.

00:11:36.774 --> 00:11:38.190
This is the blocking
and tackling.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.481
Making sure you know how to
do the system of equations.

00:11:40.481 --> 00:11:43.140
And it frees up time for the
simulations, for the games,

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.390
for the mechanics, for
the robot building,

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.370
for the estimating how high that
hill is based on its shadow.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.950
And so the paradigm is the
teacher walks in every day.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.630
Every kid works
at their own pace.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.410
And a teacher-- this is actually
a live dashboard from Los Altos

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.890
school district-- and they
look at this dashboard.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.610
Every row is a student.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:02.300
Every column is one
of those concepts.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.360
Green means the student's
already proficient.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.960
Blue means that they're working
on it, no need to worry.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.960
Red means they're stuck.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.320
And what the teacher does
is literally just says,

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.760
let me intervene
on the red kids.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.040
Or even better, let me get
one of the green kids who

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.680
are already proficient
in that concept

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.340
to be the first line of attack
and actually tutor their peer.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:29.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.976
Now I come from a very
data-centric reality.

00:12:32.976 --> 00:12:35.600
So we don't want that teacher to
even go and intervene and have

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.060
to ask the kid
awkward questions.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.476
Oh, what do you not understand,
or what do you understand,

00:12:39.476 --> 00:12:40.440
and all of the rest.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.330
So our paradigm is to
really arm the teachers

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.580
with as much data as possible.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.000
Really data that, in almost
any other field, is expected.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.240
If you're in finance, or
marketing, or manufacturing.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.800
And so the teachers
can actually diagnose

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.930
what's wrong with the
students, so that they

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.630
can make their interaction
as productive as possible.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.410
So now the teachers
know exactly what

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.200
the student's been up
to, how long they've

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.200
been spending every day.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.310
What videos have
they been watching?

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.720
When did they pause the videos?

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.970
What did they stop watching?

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.590
What exercises are they using?

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:04.920
What have they been focused on?

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.336
The outer circle shows the
exercises they were focused on.

00:13:07.336 --> 00:13:11.314
The inner circle shows the
videos they're focused on.

00:13:11.314 --> 00:13:12.730
And the data gets
pretty granular.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.320
So you can actually
see the exact problems

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.819
that the student
got right or wrong.

00:13:15.819 --> 00:13:16.580
Red is wrong.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.660
Blue is right.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:19.460
The leftmost question
is the first question

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.584
that the student attempted.

00:13:20.584 --> 00:13:22.251
They watched the video
right over there.

00:13:22.251 --> 00:13:23.833
And then you could
see eventually they

00:13:23.833 --> 00:13:25.100
were able to get 10 in a row.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.070
It's almost like
you can almost see

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.150
them learning over
those last 10 problems.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.110
They also got faster.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.770
The height is how
long it took them.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:37.119
So when you talk about
self-paced learning,

00:13:37.119 --> 00:13:39.160
it makes sense for everyone--
in education speak,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.700
differentiated learning.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.940
But it's kind of crazy what
happens when you actually

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.370
see it in a classroom.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.360
Because every time
we've done this,

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.960
in every classroom we've done,
over and over again, if you

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.602
go five days into
it, there's a group

00:13:51.602 --> 00:13:52.810
of kids who have raced ahead.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.260
And there's a group of kids
who are a little bit slower.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.430
And in a traditional model, if
you did a snapshot assessment,

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.200
you say, oh, these
are the gifted kids.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.350
These are the slow kids.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.120
Maybe they should be
tracked differently.

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.590
Maybe we should put them
in different classes.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.840
But when you let every student
work at their own pace,

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.850
and we see it over and
over and over again.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.460
You see students who took
a little bit extra time

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.440
on one concept or the other.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.469
But once they get through that
concept, they just race ahead.

00:14:16.469 --> 00:14:18.010
And so the same kids
that you thought

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:21.840
were slow six weeks ago, you
now would think are gifted.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.890
And we're seeing it over
and over and over again.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.290
And it makes you
really wonder how much

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.080
all of the labels a lot
of us have benefited from

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.480
were really just due to
a coincidence of time.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.690
Now, as valuable as
something like this

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.400
is in a district like
Los Altos, our goal

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.520
is to use technology
to humanize,

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.630
not just in Los Altos, but kind
of on a global scale, what's

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.030
happening in education.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.630
And actually that brings
an interesting point.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.310
A lot of the effort in
humanizing the classroom

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.300
is focused on student
to teacher ratios.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.360
In our mind the
relevant metric is

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.272
"student to valuable human
time with the teacher" ratio.

00:15:01.272 --> 00:15:03.480
So in a traditional model,
most of the teacher's time

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.470
is spent doing lectures, and
grading tests, and whatnot.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.010
Maybe 5% of their
time is actually

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.600
sitting next to students and
actually working with them.

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.530
Now 100% of their time is.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.440
So once again, using
technology, not just

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.550
flipping the classroom, you're
humanizing the classroom,

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.797
I'd argue, by a
factor of five or 10.

00:15:20.797 --> 00:15:22.380
And as valuable as
it is in Los Altos,

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.421
imagine what that does to
the adult learner who's

00:15:24.421 --> 00:15:27.180
embarrassed to go back and learn
stuff that they should have

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.990
known before, before
going back to college.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:35.440
Imagine what it does to a
street kid in Calcutta who

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.790
has to help his
family during the day.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:40.250
And that's the reason why he
or she can't go to school.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:41.960
Now they can spend
two hours a day

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.590
and remediate or get
up to speed and not

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.910
feel embarrassed about
what they do or don't know.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.870
Now imagine what happens where--
we talked about the peers

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.350
teaching each other
inside of a classroom.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.190
But this is all one system.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.250
There's no reason why
you can't have that peer

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.510
to peer tutoring beyond
that one classroom.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:04.540
Imagine what happens if
that student in Calcutta

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.670
all of a sudden
can tutor your son.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.600
Or your son can tutor
that kid in Calcutta.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.290
And I think what
you'll see emerging

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:19.030
is this notion of a global
one world classroom.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.060
And that's essentially
what we're trying to build.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:22.975
Thank you.

00:16:22.975 --> 00:16:31.885
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:31.885 --> 00:16:34.360
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:16:34.360 --> 00:17:04.579
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:06.119
BILL GATES: I've
seen some things

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.600
you're doing in the system
that have to do with motivation

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.440
and feedback-- energy
points, merit badges.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.449
Tell me what you're
thinking there.

00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:16.490
SALMAN KHAN: Oh yeah, no,
we have an awesome team

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:17.280
working on that.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.069
And I have to be clear.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:19.150
It's not just me anymore.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:20.540
I'm still doing all the videos.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.012
We have a rock star
team doing the software.

00:17:23.012 --> 00:17:24.720
Yeah, we've put a
bunch of game mechanics

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.930
in there, where you
get these badges.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.054
We're going to start having
leader boards by areas,

00:17:28.054 --> 00:17:29.360
and you get points.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.040
It's actually been
pretty interesting.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.580
Just the wording of the
badging, or how many points you

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.320
get for doing something, we
see on the system-wide basis

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.944
tens of thousands
of fifth graders

00:17:37.944 --> 00:17:40.360
or sixth graders going one
direction or another, depending

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.500
on what badge you give them.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.384
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:44.384 --> 00:17:46.050
BILL GATES: And the
collaboration you're

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:49.730
doing with Los Altos,
how did that come about?

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.560
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, Los
Altos was kind of crazy.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.540
Once again, I didn't expect
it to be used in classrooms.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.920
Someone from their board
came and said, what would you

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.240
do if you had carte
blanche in a classroom?

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.274
And I said, well, I would
just-- every student

00:18:02.274 --> 00:18:04.190
work at their own pace
on something like this.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:05.107
We'd give a dashboard.

00:18:05.107 --> 00:18:06.898
And they said, oh, this
is kind of radical,

00:18:06.898 --> 00:18:08.060
we have to think about it.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.600
And me and the rest of team
were like, they're never

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.850
going to want to do this.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:13.600
But literally the next
day they were like,

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.311
can you start in two weeks?

00:18:15.311 --> 00:18:17.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.150
BILL GATES: So it's
fifth-grade math

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:20.460
is where that's
going on right now?

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.168
SALMAN KHAN: It's two
fifth-grade classes

00:18:22.168 --> 00:18:23.530
and two seventh-grade classes.

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:24.590
They're doing it at
the district level.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.173
And I think what
they're excited about

00:18:26.173 --> 00:18:27.830
is they can now
follow these kids.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.601
It's not an only
in-school thing.

00:18:29.601 --> 00:18:31.850
Even on Christmas, we saw
some of the kids were doing.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:32.850
And we track everything.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.610
So they can actually
track them as they

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.530
go through the entire district,
through the summers, as they

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:37.940
go from one teacher to a next.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.060
You have this continuity of
data that, even at the district

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.100
level, they can see.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.516
BILL GATES: So
some of those views

00:18:43.516 --> 00:18:46.940
we saw were for the teacher
to go in and track actually

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.289
what's going on with those kids.

00:18:49.289 --> 00:18:51.330
So you're getting feedback
on those teacher views

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.050
to see what they
think they need?

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:53.925
SALMAN KHAN: Oh yeah.

00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:57.494
Actually, most of those
were specs by the teachers.

00:18:57.494 --> 00:18:58.910
We made some of
those for students

00:18:58.910 --> 00:18:59.980
so they could their data.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.602
But we have a very
tight design loop

00:19:01.602 --> 00:19:02.810
with the teachers themselves.

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.080
And they're literally
saying, hey, this is nice.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.424
But that focus graph,
a lot of the teachers

00:19:07.424 --> 00:19:10.090
said I have a feeling that a lot
of the kids are jumping around,

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.380
and not focusing on one topic.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.660
So we made that focus
diagram for them.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.290
So it's all been teacher driven.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:16.422
It's been pretty crazy.

00:19:16.422 --> 00:19:18.130
BILL GATES: Is this
ready for prime time?

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.330
Do you think a lot of
classes next school

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.780
year should try this thing out?

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:23.530
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.400
It's ready.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.530
We've got a million people
on the site already.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:28.730
So we can handle a few more.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:33.250
And no, no reason
why it really can't

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.180
happen in every classroom
in America tomorrow.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.640
BILL GATES: And the vision
of the tutoring thing.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.550
The idea there is, if I'm
confused about a topic,

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.810
somehow right in
the user interface,

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:45.760
I'd find people who
are volunteering,

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.610
maybe see their reputation.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:50.500
And I could schedule and
connect up with those people.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:51.500
SALMAN KHAN: Absolutely.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.250
And this is something
I recommend everyone

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.542
in this audience to do.

00:19:54.542 --> 00:19:57.000
Those dashboards the teachers
have, you can go log in right

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.500
now.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.390
And you could essentially
become a coach

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.850
for your kids, your nephews,
your cousins, or maybe

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.380
some kids at the
Boys &amp; Girls Club.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.790
And you can start becoming
a mentor or tutor really

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:09.340
immediately.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.969
But yeah, it's all there.

00:20:10.969 --> 00:20:12.260
BILL GATES: Well, it's amazing.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.870
I think you've
just got a glimpse

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.680
of the future of education.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.192
Thank you.

00:20:16.192 --> 00:20:17.150
SALMAN KHAN: Thank you.

00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:27.034
[APPLAUSE]
